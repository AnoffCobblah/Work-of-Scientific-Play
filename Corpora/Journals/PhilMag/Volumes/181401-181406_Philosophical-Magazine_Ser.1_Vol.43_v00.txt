From        the commencement    of this work, it has been our aim to
lay before our readers every thing new or curious in the objects
embraced by our plan ; and aided by the contributions of nu
merous respectable correspondents, to whom we are under many
obligations,    we have been enabled to present an instructive and
 useful -miscellany.
      We have now to congratulate     our readers on the cessation of
 war— the enemy of philosophical intercourse.      For a long period
 it   has been with difficulty that even foreign Transactions and
 Journals could be obtained : indeed the publication of several
 of them had been entirely suspended. As to regular intercourse
 with the conductors of the continental periodical works, with
 many of whom we were years ago personally acquainted, and
  in habits of regular communication, it had, for a considerable
  time, entirely ceased. The return of peace has already renewed
  the correspondence; and without subjecting ourselves to the im-i
  putation of boasting, we may be permitted to say, that the readers
  of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal will reap increased
  advantages from this source of information, as well as from the
   revived continental journals.
      With the last number of this volume        two title-pages  are
  given. , It was intended to continue       this practice, but on
   more mature consideration the plan has been altered.       The re
   ferences to future volumes could not, without confusion and the
   risque of many errors, be adapted to a two-fold numeration ;
   and therefore, to bring The Philosophical Journal at once into
   series with The Philosophical Magazine, the extra title-page is
   adapted to serve for Vol. XXXVII. to XLIII. of The Journal ; and
   those who are possessed of that work are requested to give di
    rections to the binder to letter the back of the volume accord
    ingly.   When the present volume may be referred to in future
    numbers, it will be quoted as Vol. XLIII.
       Gentlemen whose sets of the Philosophical Magazine are de
    fective, should make an early application for the numbers that
     may be wanting, as many of them are getting out of print.

  I. Description of a new Transit Instrument. By Sir H. C.
        Englefield, Bart. F.R.S. F.S.A. &c. &c. &c.
The     transit instrument, of which I propose to give a descrip
tion, was thought of in consequence of a request from Mr.Thomas
Jones, astronomical, &c. &c. instrument maker, in Oxendon-
street, who, having been often applied to by watch-makers, and
others not much conversant with astronomy, to make for them
a cheap, simple, and easily.placed instrument,      for the purpose
of obtaining time with accuracy, requested me to assist him
with my ideas on the subject.
    An old transit instrument formerly belonging to Mr. Aubert,
and at his sale purchased by Mr. Walker, gave me the first hint
for the instrument now to be described.        It had, like this, its
telescope in the axis ; but the reflecting mirror was between the
object- and eye-glasses, which rendered it cumbersome, and liable
to many inconveniencies, which are, I think, avoided in the mode
 of construction now adopted.
    It may be here observed, that Hevelius, in his Selenographia,
 describes a telescope in which a mirror is interposed between the
 object-glass and eye-piece, thereby enabling an observer, without
 danger, to look out of a besieged place, the telescope being
 placed vertically under shelter of the rampart.   It seems singular
 that he should not have perceived how much more commodious
 and simple his instrument would have been, had the mirror been
 placed beyond the object-glass, and made so as to turn all round,
 as it has been of late years made to do in some of the large
 camera obscuras.
    To return to the present subject. It is well known that the
 transit instrument, in its usual form, is liable to great injuries
 from blows, or other violence affecting the perpendicularity of
 the telescope to the axis ; that it necessarily takes up much
 room in package ; that, unless of a very small size, it is not easily

    2             Description    of a new Transit Instrument.
    fixed    in a window or other opening in a common dwelling-
    house ;    and  that it is quite impossible, excepting in fixed obser
    vations, to make it sweep the entire arch between the southern
    and northern points of the horizon.             In windy weather its u3e is
    also very difficult and inconvenient.              In the instrument now
    offered, all these inconveniencies are avoided.             It may be fixed
    almost any where ; in many places it may be made to describe
    the entire semicircle of the meridian ; the observer is put to no
    difficulties by change of place, as he always looks directly along
    the axis ; it is packed in one eighth of the space requisite to
    pack a common transit instrument of the same real size ; its
    weight is not more than a sixth of the other ; from its simplicity
    it will be afforded at half the price ; and its verifications and
     adjustments are easy and simple. It has also another advantage —
     that the mark by which it is placed in the meridian may be
    either in the meridian or at right angles to it ; or, if convenient,
     two marks may be erected, one to the south or north, the other
    east or west ; and if so used, it will be always seen by inspection
    only, whether the mirror needs adjustment or not.                   In many
    confined situations, such as occur in cities, the power of having
     a mark at right angles to the meridian mav be eminently useful.
     The genera] description           the instrument
                                         <\f          is   as follows :
        The telescope    is   included in      abrass cylinder having     asmall
    cylinder at each end, turned true in the usual manner, and resting
    in Ys of the usual construction.              These smaller cylinders are
    both pierced.       In one      the eye. piece of the telescope with its
                    The other    is is
    wires, &c.                       open for the purpose of seeing through
    it, if necessary,    the  eastern   or western mark, and for adjusting
,   by direct vision the line of collimation of the instrument.               It
    also serves for the illumination of the wires.            The object-glass
    of the telescope    is   placed so near this cylinder as only to allow
    room for an unsilvered plane glass mirror to be placed before             it,
    at an angle of 45°.         It    obvious that, as the telescope revolves
                                     is
    on its axis in the Ys, every celestial object at right angles to          it
    will successively be seen             by
                                        reflection from the mirror    ;  and, of
    course,  if  the axis be placed due east and west, the transits of all
    celestial bodies over the meridian wilt he observed with the' ut
    most accuracy and convenience.              The aperture in the axis be
    yond   the  object-glass    is not  only of  use for the adjustment of the
    instrument to an eastern or western mark, or for the illumination
    of the wires, but affords means of seeing the mark at the same
                                     a
    time with the body whose meridian passage              is  to be observed,
    and of thereby being certain of the true adjustments of the in
    strument at the very moment of observation which  ;          is   impossible
    in any other construction of the transit instrument, and seems
    to be a very material advantage.

                 Description of  a new   Transit Instrument.       •       3
      1  am convinced    that  transit instruments of the largest size
  might with very great advantage       be constructed on this principle.
.
   It is true that where very much light is wanted, as in obser
  vations of stars in the day-time, the loss by reflection will be some
  disadvantage ; but the loss of light from an unsilvered mirror is
  very small ; and the convenient and simple form of the instru
  ment, by its lightness, less subject to flexure ; by its position
  much less liable to errors from unequal change of temperature ;
  and so extremely commodious in its use; present advantages of
  a very important nature, and such as might introduce it into the
  most extensive observatories with profit.        The advantages may
  perhaps be even greater than in small transit instruments.          When
  in the present construction the telescope is long, as its whole
  weight rests on the most disadvantageous point of the axis, this
  is of necessity made very large towards its centre to avoid flexure,
  the whole instrument so heavy that an additional apparatus of
   counterpoise must be added to the pivots, lest they should wear
   away the Ys, and the reversing the instrument becomes a work
  of some difficulty and danger : whereas in the construction pro
  posed, the small comparative weight of the object- and eye
  glasses lies very near the pivots, and the middle of the tube is the
   lightest part of it.   The operation of reversing is performed with
  great ease, both from the form and tightness of the instrument ;
  and it may be added, that the comparative facility of observa
  tions is of greater advantage the larger the instrument.
      Having so far explained the genera! principles of this transit
  telescope, which was executed very much to my satisfaction by
   Mr. Thomas Jones, it will be proper to describe more particularly
  its construction.
      The transit stand is represented by either fig. 1 or 2 (PI. I) . The
  first is constructed for being placed or fixed on a vertical surface ;
  the second for a horizontal one, A, B ; in both are the Ys, or
  supports for receiving the axis of the telescope.       The end A in
   tended to be always next the eye is furnished     with  both the hori
  zontal and vertical adjustments, such as are usual to transit in
  struments.     The telescope axis is represented by fig. 3. The eye
  end being at C, the object end at D turns round in the Ys AB
  upon its. cylinders n, n ; the screw head r, at the object end D, is
  for the purpose of adjusting the parallel glass.         rlhe telescope-
  is adjusted to distinct vision by means of the head or knob at P.
   The wires of the telescope are adjusted by means of the four
  capstan head-screws at the eye end t,t.        The circle R is divided
  on the surface next to the eye.      The eye-tube has a sliding mo
  tion for viewing the wires distinctly; the short piece of tube
  at the object end turns round on the telescope tube, and serves
  as a cover for the object-glass.
                                    A  2                               Fig.

    Fig. 4 is the riding level,   and is placed upon the axis in the
Ys,   and adjusted by means       of the screw S. Fig. 5 represents
the stand, telescope, and level, displaying the position in which
they are used.      Fig. 6, for placing the transit in the meridian.
    Of the verifications of this instrument two are common to
every construction ; one only is peculiar to this.              The line of
collimation is adjusted by looking direct at some distant small
point (the cover being turned over the lateral aperture), and
turning the telescope gradually round on its axis, and moving
the screw of the wires, if necessary, till the spot is in every po
sition covered by the intersection of the wires.               The axis is
brought to an horizontal position, and the level is in the same
mode adjusted by reversing the telescope or level, and correcting
half the error by the level screw, and half by the vertical screw
of the Y in the usual mode.
    The verification peculiar to this instrument is that of the
min or, and perhaps the best mode of doing this is by the pole
star when nearly in an eastern or western position from the pole ;
its motion in azimuth is then so slow as to give ample time for
the adjustment.       Bring the pole star to the vertical wire (the line
of collimation having been previously adjusted) ; then reverse the
telescope in its Ys ; and if the star is still on the wire, the mirror
is in adjustment : if not, correct half the difference by the mirror-
screw, and half by the horizontal of the Y till the error vanishes.
This adjustment may also be performed by setting up a board
with two parallel perpendicular lines drawn on it distant from
each other, exactly the space between the positions of the mirror
when the telescope is reversed in Its Ys.            If the vertical wire be
brought to cover one of the marks, and on being reversed the
wire covers the other mark, it is right.            If not, the error must
be made to vanish by correcting it half and half as before di
rected for the adjustment by the pole star.
    The following method of placing the instrument correctly in
the meridian, is equal if not superior to any that lias yet been
devised*.
    Let Z, fig. 6, be the zenith ; P, the pole ; HO, the horizon ;
ZPI, the meridian circle ; ZK, a circle of altitude distant from
the meridian by a small quantity IK (suppose a degree) ; 1, 2,3, 4,
the diurnal circle of the pole star, whose radius is 1° 45' nearly ;
and let the altitude of the pole be 5 1° 30'.          Then when the pole
star is on the northern meridian its altitude 3 I will be 49° 45',
and its zenith distance Z3=403 15'; and ACD be a part of
the diurnal arch of a star whose polar distance is 46° 30', and
N. meridian altitude 5°.
   * It had been invented
                           by me many years    ago,   but has not, as far as I
know, been as yet published.    I therefore give it here, as not inapplicable
to the subject of this paper.
                                                                        Now,

     Now, suppose the transit instrument, whose axis is accurately
levelled, and of course in the meridian at Z, to point at the ho

 the cosine of its altitude AI, that value being reduced to the

'passing through the transit telescope, after the time of its
 passing the meridian           and the same operation being performed
                                    ;
 for the pole-star as before directed, the difference of these times
 will be the error in time of the transits, answering to the given
 deviation IK of the transit telescope.               And tables having been
 previously     constructed     for  such    stars  as shall be thought con
 venient, the transit telescope may, in a very short space of
  time, be set to the meridian, with a degree of precision unattain
  able    by any other method.
     If   the star      precedes the pole-star in its passage under the

their transits is elapsed ; the instrument will then be extremely
near its true position ; and, by • repeating the observation once
more, will be brought to a perfect exactness.           Or, if another
star, following the pole-star in its passage, be observed on the
same evening, if the times elapsed between their transits are equal
to the tabular difference or their right ascensions, which will pro
bably be the case, the accuracy of the first placing the instru
ment will be immediately ascertained.        Other stars near the pole
may    be  made  use  of in the same manner as is here described for
the pole-star, but with proportionally less advantage as the polar
distance is increased.                  *
    It is also obvious from the figure, that the transit of.the pole-
star above the pole may be also used, and that with nearly,
though not quite, the same advantage as the transit below the
pole.
    The same method may also be applied with equal ease, if the
second star A pass the southern meridian instead of the northern.
    The slowness of the pole-star's motion, though it renders its
transit uncertain to a few seconds, cannot materially affect the
accuracy of this method, as an error of ten seconds in time, in
the estimation of its passage, which is certainly more than can
be committed, would not cause an error of a third of a second
of time in the passage of stars near the equator.

    The error of a degree, therefore, in the position of the transit
telescope at the horizon, causes the star A to pass through it
5h 29ys in time later than it ought; whereas, the same error
 causes the transit of the pole-star to be lh 26m 40j* later than
it ought ; and the difference between these two times, viz. lh 21m
 1 1^.% will be the difference of the observed time of their transits,
owing to the error of the position of the transit telescope, their
real right ascension being supposed the same.

                                     ,               Oxford, Jan. 6, 1814.
JLt is            of no ordinary importance, in the profession of
           a matter
surgery,  to  know   the best mode of treating burns and scalds,
particularly  in  what  manner to proceed immediately after the
injury has been received, and which it seems is still a deside
ratum.
   It is singular, that even of late years, two modes of practice,
directly opposite to each other' in principle, have been recom
mended by practitioners of the first eminence in the profession.
   One method, and I believe the most prevalent one, is to coun*x
teract or prevent the ill consequences       arising from a bum or
scald, as in other instances of inflammation, by an antiphlogistic
process; viz. by cold sedative applications : the other, which i*
the latest, is by the adoption of a stimulating pi ocess ; viz. by
the use of biflammant stimulating applications, and these pre
viously made ivarm or 1 ather hot.
   The abettors of each method give a rationale of the means
by which each mode produces its peculiar good effect.
   The former of these methods is so consonant with common
opinion, and the ordinary mode of reasoning, as to require from
me neither explanation nor comment.
   The latter mode, however,             is,
                                     at first view, so repugnant to
ordinary reasoning,   as to excite attention.
   The rationale upon which this        stated to act,
                                               is                  by

                                                              is

other ill consequences which are incident to injuries of this na
ture that
       ;          is,   by
                   not suffering the excitement, irritation, or in
creased action, in the part, produced by the injury, to subside too
hastily    but,

Jneans, in due time, suffered to regain its natural or ordinary
state.
      It is proper to observe, that the author of this process entertains
 a decided opinion of the superiority of his own plan, in preference
 to the antiphlogistic one ; and that this opinion is sanctioned at
 present, I believe, by the practice of many gentlemen of emi
 nence in the profession.
      The process of the stimulating plan, recommended and pur
 sued by Mr. Kentish, is doubtless well known, being described
 in the various professional works, and therefore an account of it
 here is unnecessary.
      With respect to the theory, of which I have only given the
 leading principle, by which the good effect of the stimulating
 plan, in burns and scalds, is supported by Mr. K. I must con
 fess it appears to me, as it does to some other professional per-.
 sons, remote and unsatisfactory ; but, after all, it must be ad
 mitted that facts alone are to be relied on.
      Had this latter method been introduced injo practice, at th*
 time I had an opportunity of making observations at the Rad-
 cliffe Infirmary, I might probably have been prepared to have
 delivered an opinion respecting its comparative efficacy in point
  of fact.
    - In private practice, having good reason to be perfectly satisfied
 with the plan here recommended, I have judged it imprudent to
  adopt so bold, and, in my opinion, so indefensible a mode of
 practice, upon the authority of any person : therefore I have
  hitherto never tried it.
      For my own part, I consider cold, as the direct and proper
  antidote for heat ; and upon this principle, chiefly, I think the
  immediate and- remote ill consequences          of a burn or scald are
  to be obviated ; and amidst the various methods I have witnessed
  the trial of, in cases of this nature, no other mode of treatment
  has answered so well as the method I am now about to mention.
       In consequence of my observations, on cases of this kind,
  which occurred at the Radcliffe (Infirmary, during a period of
  nearly five-and-twenty years, I collected that the following mode
  of treatment was the most successful ; and, accordinglv, 1 em
  ployed it there, in those cases in which I had an opportunity,
  and which, with some slight variations, I stilt pursue.
       In the first place, I apply a dressing of the simplest emollient
  cerate ; viz. one composed of wax and oil, spread rather thick,
  upon soft old linen of a close texture, in order to the exclusion
  pf the atmospherical air ; an exposure to which, under these cir
  cumstances, I consider to be extremely injurious; and im me
  diately after, apply compresses soaked and wet with the liquor
                                                                   plumbi

 plumbi acetatis dilutus, and             as cold as may be, renewing
    continuing this process, by means of two compresses, one of
   which remains in the cold liquor, whilst the other is applied so
   often, ami so long, as the part injured is above the natural tem
   perature ; that        is,until the heat and irritation arising imme
   diately    from  the  injury have subsided, and which, by this means,
   duly pursued,     is  usually accomplished in        few hours.

        In the instances of scalds, where the injury            only superficial,

   the same method              is
                                persevered   in, renewing the dressing or
   pledget of cerate once or twice every four-and-twenty                  hours,
   according as the discharge, pain, or other circumstances may
   indicate ;    still continuing the cold application, especially toward
   the afternoon or evening, when the part                more inclined to be
                                                             is
   come hot and painful.                 ,
        Whatever vesications might ensue,          I immediately emptied of
   the effused serum, by as small              apuncture as might be, and
  pressed the whole of the fluid gently out, preserving the cuticle,
   tillit   separated spontaneously, or the denuded part was become
   callous, taking particular care, at the time of removing                  and  it,
  likewise at every time of dressing, to cover the part, as expedi
  tiously as possible, in order to exclude the external air.— Parti
  cular care, likewise, should be taken that the part be well moist
  ened or wetted, with the liquor before mentioned, previously
  to removing the plaster, and compress, in order to prevent their
 sticking or adhering to the part.
       In. burns or scalds of more serious nature, where sloughs are
                                     a
  likely to form, the second part of the process consists in applying
a     cataplasm,    of  bread, and the saturnine liquor prepared as be
 fore, and cold*,    if    the heat of the part require             it
                                                                   repeating
                                                                         ;              ft
 twice, or oftener, every f'our-and-twenty hours, according to cisj.
 cumstances.        It    isscarcely necessary to state, that rest in bed,

                                is

      In cases of such a nature as to threaten morlif cation, of the
 loss of Life, care must be taken that the cooling antiphlogistic
 system be not pushed too far, that                    is,

consequence of having observed, in many cases, the effects of
emollient applications, and of the cold saturnine lotion, w.aA both
separately and conjointly, to various cases of this nature — and
likewise from the effects of the stimulating applications, then in
fashion with some practitioners, viz. vinegar, camphorated spirit
of wine, &c.
     I have two cases of severe scalds at this time (July 12, 1812)
under my care ; one which has been dressed in the ordinary w'ay
with emollient cerate only ; the person neglecting to apply the
eotd lotion as I had directed.
     In the other case, both legs were severely scalded, from the
feet to the knees nearly.
     In this instance the patient very prudently, in my opinion, im
mersed his legs instantly, without waiting to take his shoes and
stockings off, in a tub of cold water, which happened to be
near, for some time, and then applied to me.               I pursued the
plan     before mentioned   ; the next day  there  were   several vesica
 tions of considerable size, (although      the  greater part escaped
this effect,) which I immediately punctured, pressing out the
effused serum.       At a week's end from the time of the accident,
the denuded parts, and those which were still covered in part with
 the detached cuticle, were entirely free from inflammation and
pain, and scarcely any tenderness remained ; and in less than a
fortnight from the time of the accident, he was perfectly well ;
 no suppuration or discharge whatever having succeeded to the
 accident.      The cold lotion was applied .by this person, almost
unremittingly, night and day.                           -
      In the former instance, the blistered parts suppurated, and
 were many weeks in healing.
      The ordinary progress, as I have found by repeated instances
 of cases treated assiduously in the manner recommended above,
 has been according to the event in that instance; and in easel;
 of burns or severer scalds, in which sloughs have formed, the
 event, by following the directions before given for the treatment
 of such cases, has been equally successful, allowing for the greater
 degree of injury received.
      I think it unnecessary, and even injurious, to use any applica
 tion colder, either in winter or summer, than that temperature
 at which spring water usually is all the year round ; viz. about
 50° of Fahrenheit, (which temperature of water, as is well known,
 may be obtained throughout the year, from a pump, a pailful or
 two having been previously pumped on-;) ar.d the more frequently
 this is renewed, especially at first, the better : — pumping upon
  the part, however, by its mechanical force, might be injurious.
      After the first or second dressing, I prefer the use of some de-
  siccative cerate, to the emollient one ; viz. a saturnine cerate,
                                                                        of

of which the following       is a good formula.      Take of olive oil and
white wax,      each   sixteen    parts ;  white   ceruse  two parts, and
Goulard's extract      of  saturn (liquor plumbi ecetatis) one part,
mixed : — in winter, the proportion of the wax should be only four
teen parts*; — the proportions of each article are meant by weight.
    My intention here is to confine myself entirely to the result of
my own experience alone.           Therefore, with respect to the com
parative effects   of  this    mode   with the one lately recommended
by Mr. Kentish,      in   injuries of this nature, I can say nothing,
having never witnessed myself the effect of it. But perhaps it
may not be going too far to state, that the mode of treatment
recommended by that gentleman has been used here by pro
fessional persons, who have again returned to the cooling anti
phlogistic mode of treatment.
    It has been the practice of some practitioners, to push the cold
plan so far, as to use even ice and snow to burns and scalds :
of this, likewise, I can say nothing from my own experience.
    In burns or scalds, of such extent as not to admit of the or
dinary mode of dressing by plasters or cataplasms ; an emollient,
desiccative, or stimulating liniment may be used, according to
the intention required. — In the latter intention, which will be
indicated by an atonic, sluggish state of the parts, the liniment
of Mr. Kentish, viz. the linimentum terebinthince of the pre
sent London Pharmacopoeia, is doubtless a very appropriate
one — using, as occasion may require, to the sores,after the eschars
or sloughs have separated, or in the act of separating, desiccatives,
or, in case of fungus rising, gentle escharotics ; never omitting
withal, wherever it can be conveniently applied, especially in the
instances of exuberant granulations, dry lint and a moderately
tight bandage.
    It is scarcely necessary to observe, that any cerate, or unguent,
may be reduced to the state of a liniment by the addition of a
<lue proportion of olive oil.
    Since it is essential, according to my opinion, that the parts
injured by burns or scalds, especially immediately, and for a short
time after the accident, should be kept as much as possible from
the action of atmospherical air, and likewise as cool and moist
as possible; I have lately adopted the method of continuing the
same wrapping linen on, observing to keep this constantly as
cool and moist as possible, by frequently dabbing it over with
the saturnine liquor, by means of a sponge or otherwise — having
found the more assiduously this mode is pursued, together with

the exclusion of air, the more successful is the process ; and
moreover, excepting on such parts as may be already denuded of
the cuticle, I omit the dressing of cerate ; finding by this mode
the inflammation is best prevented, or arrested in its progress,
and thereby future vesications obviated.
   I consider all unctuous applications as extremely injurious to
recent scalds or burns, and particularly so in warm weather,
unless constantly covered with a cold lotion, according to the
manner above mentioned*.
   Amongst various other cases of a similar nature, which have
occurred to me, treated in the same manner with equal success,
I shall briefly mention one which has recently presented itself.
   A gentlewoman of a corpulent habit, and strongly inflammatory
diathesis, burned both her hands very much in endeavouring to
extinguish a fire which happened to the curtains of the bed she
was lying on, and from which she escaped with difficulty before
the whole was in a blaze.      On my arrival I found her immersing
her hands in cold water.     This I immediately changed for strong
saturnine liquor, to which I added a very small portion of cam
phorated spirit.    Her hands were kept immersed in a liquor of
this kind, changing         it,
                        as often as   was becoming warm, for fresh.

This process was continued from about eleven in the morning
until about nine at night,           by
                                    which time the intolerable heat
 and pain    inthe parts were very much diminished, though not
entirely subdued.    Each hand was then placed separately in a
linen bag, containing each a cold cataplasm composed of bread
crumbled fine, and the same kind of liquor in which they had
before been immersed, made very moist, and plentiful in quan
tity, so as to cover them thickly, immersing them occasionally
in bason of the same liquor, to keep them moist and cool.
  a
   This plan of poulticing, and moistening occasionally, renewing
the cataplasm every night and morning, was continued for four
days;   by which time they were in      manner well,

of the preventive means commenced.        They were then, for the

them occasionally, when they were becoming painfully warm, in
the cool liquor.    By this treatment the effects of the fire were
so entirely  arrested  and obviated, that all was well within the

 week from the day of the accident, the small parts before al
 luded to excepted, and which were almost too inconsiderable to
 have been mentioned.         It is worthy of notice, that during the
 greater pni* of the day on which the accident happened, so long
 as the hands were kept immersed in the cold liquor, they were
 easv ; but if taken out for ever so short a time, the sensation of a
 most painfully burning heat came on — and likewise, if the li
 quor in which they were immersed was permitted to become
 warm before changing.           The only injury the parts sustained,
 was an almost entire separation of the cuticle — the cutis itself
remaining perfect, the instances before mentioned excepted. The
 vesications) which were many and very large, I punctured the
 day after the accident happened, and pressed the serum out ;
 and on the fifth day I removed the greater part of the detached
 cuticle — the cutis itself being dry and free from abrasion : — not
 the slightest inflammation came on.
     This patient, residing at a distance from Oxford, returned
 home well on the sixth day from the accident, with scarcely any
 other remains of the injury than tenderness, arising from the
 recently denuded cutis. Whereas, I consider my experience war
 rants me in asserting, that had she been treated in the first in
 stance upon the ordinary stimulating plan, viz. by camphorated
 spirits, or other articles of a similar nature, ulceration would
have been the consequence, and the cure would probably have
taken up more than as many weeks to have accomplished.
     I prefer bread nibbed or grated small in these cases, for mak
ing the cataplasm, to linseed flour, because the latter is more
apt to heat, and moreover does not so readily admit of an equal
diffusion of the cooling liquor by immersion.
     I forbear entering here into the secondary or subsequent mode
of treatment necessarv, when eschars or ulcerations ensue from
 burns or scalds; my object, in this paper, being to confme my
self to the primary or immediate treatment of such cases.
    An attendant upon this gentlewoman had likewise her hands
burned at the same time, but in a much less degree. By pursuing
the same plan of immersion throughout the day, and the appli
cation of similar cataplasms at night, by the next morning they
were nearly well.
     I have witnessed almost every gradation , of burns, from the
slightest to the most important.         The most dreadful instance of
these, and lire still remaining, was a woman who was so terribly
burnt,, that the whole surface of her head, body, and her limbs,
for the greater part, exhibited an appearance resembling wood,
or any other combustible substance, completely charred.            She
lived     several  hours ; during  which  time her  sufferings were  in
some degree alleviated bv the application of cold damp            com-

liquors.
   To these observations, already too long perhaps, I shall sub
join a circumstance or fact, which perhaps is not irrelevant to
the present subject ; and which by a kind of inverse analogy may
tend to confirm, if further confirmation were wanting, the pro
priety of the mode of treatment 1 have recommended in burns
and scalds.       By the topical application of extreme cold to
the skin, as in handling polished metal at a very low tempera
ture, the same effects are produced as in the instance of a burn
produced by heated iron, &c. viz. vesication, &c.               In like man
ner,  as  the application    of    cold   in  burns   or scalds   is a specific
remedy ; so likewise is the application of heat in this instance —
each used discretionally ; viz. by immersion of the part in a
liquid of opposite temperature, duly adjusted.                Moreover, in
stances of the same kind, in a smaller degree, are very familiar
to me, in extreme cold weather, viz. in myself, as well as others.
By frequent immersion or washing the hands, at such a season,
in cold water, and exposure to the cold air, the tips of one or
more of the fingers (these parts froni the thinness of the skin
there being most susceptible of such an effect, and even without
any abrasion of the skin,) become tender, proceeding onto vesica
tion and ulceration, if this mode be persisted in; whereas, by
avoiding the cause, and using warm water, and defending them
from the effect of the cold air by wearing a glove, the progress
of the injury is checked at the commencement; or, by appropriate
dressings or cataplasms, together with immersion in warm water, •
and protection from cold, which is indispensable, are, in an ad
vanced state, cured.      I have several times, for want of attention '
in time, experienced myself the effects of this kind of injury, as
far as to the vesication and separation of the cuticle; and in
other persons, on to a state of ulceration.            Even in an incipient
state of this affection, the application of cold water, or exposure
to cold air, is extremely painful, and in an advanced state, in
tolerably so ; whereas, on the other hand, immersion in warm
water immediately restores, or produces perfect ease.                  The af
fection  I am   speaking  of   is  not   to  be  confounded     with    that of
chilblain,   from   which   it    differs   materially ;  the  effect    arising
from the sudden communication of intense cold to the skin, or
surface of any part, by a quick or powerful conductor of heat, as
polished metal, or the frequent repetitions of             it,  in a slighter
degree ;   thus producing effects similar,        by   an inverse cause, to
handling hot iron, or subjecting the hands repeatedly to very hot
water*.
 * It will  be readily understood, that  intin's instance the conductor ope
rates by taking away the heat tVoui the part,
                                                                     I   have

               On the Treatment       of Burns and Scalds'.
     I have not unfrequently traced the mild         or superficial species
 of paronychia (whitlow) to the frequent application of cold,
the end of the finger or thumb having been previously accidentally
pricked, or slightly injured       by some means      or other,    and neg
lected.
    With respect to my opinion of the natnre of the injury re
ceived in burns and scalds, and rationale of the mode of treat
ment to be adopted in such cases, it is briefly this — that the*
effect continues to go on, in a certain degree, although the direct
application of the cause has ceased to act; as is apparent, I
think, by the painfully burning heat which remains.
    Hence the immediate mode of treatment is evidently pointed
out to consist in the application of cold, and which I have no
doubt, if effectively used, would completely arrest or prevent the
progress of such effect, leaving the parts, as far as the cold could
immediately penetrate, precisely in the same state as at the in
stant of commencing the process.
    The same mode of reasoning will apply equally to the injury
produced by an inverse effect to the former, viz. the direct appli
cation of extreme cold to the surface of the body or limbs, and
which, from its similarity in effect to burns and scalds, has not
been unaptly termed cold-burning* ; the effects in one instance
being produced by the sudden introduction of heat or caloric,
and the other by the sudden abstraction of it, by means of the
most powerful conductors of heat, allowing for the difference
between the positive and negative mode of action in the two
instances.
    For obvious reasons, I think, the best mode of applying cold
or heat, in such cases, is by the medium of a liquid, and com
municated by immersion, in all instances which admit of it;
and although I have mentioned the degree of 50* of Fahrenheit
as the fittest temperature, it will be necessary to attend to the
feelings of the patient, and regulate the degree of cold applied,
throughout the process, to that temperature which affords most
ease.
    In the  course  of my professional experience both in physic and
in surgery, I   have rarely found plain reason and fact          at variance
with each other ; and I think we shall           not  err  in  admitting, in
the present instance, that cold is the genuine and proper antidote
for the effects of heat; and vice versa.
    It will however be obvious, that the application of the re
medy, in all instances, should be proportionate to the manner
in which the injury is received, or communicated : thus, if it be
   * Mercury frozen, or any polished     metal at the same   temperature, ,wrll
quickly destroy the living principle of the skin, and produce vesication.
                                                                        direct

       On the Agency     of Electricity in producing   Combustion.   17
direct   and sudden, the mode above recommended should be
pursued : if indirect, and in consequenee of long exposure to the
cause, as is ordinarily the case in the effects produced by cold ;
heat, as in this instance, should be cautiously and gradually ap
plied, with friction, &c.
    P. S. — My experience warrants me in asserting, that in all
instances of burns and scalds, which admit of the total exclusion
of the external air, as in the mode of immersion and poulticing
before mentioned, the best method is to omit entirely, during that
process, any dressing to the part, although the cutis be left de
nuded.
    To this mode I attribute the complete success in the last in
stance, in which case much of the cuticle was entirely destroyed
or detached by the fire ; 'the sedative and astringent        qualities
of the saturnine preparation acting conjointly with the cold, in
constringing and closing the orifices of the cutaneous exhaling
vessels, and thereby preventing effusion, and subsequent suppura
tion.    It will be apparent that the poulticing is merely a modi
fication of the same principle as immersion, for the sake of con
 venience, and may therefore, under particular exigencies or cir
 cumstances, be commenced at any time.

    Properties of Bodies,     and producing Combustion.       By Mr.
    John Webster.
 The      secondary causes which operate throughout nature are
 formed with such, infinite wisdom and design, by the first great
 inscrutable cause, that it cannot excite our surprise that finite
 creatures are unable to fathom or explain these laws, or that
 there should be various hypotheses concerning them.
    Although the advancement that has been made in the chemical
 department of nature is still limited, yet enough has been done
 to show the simplicity of her laws and the generality of their
 operations.     When we see principles widely diffused, we conclude
 that they are intended for great and important purposes in the
 ceeonomy of nature, and that general effects are derived from
 these prevailing    causes.
     Light, heat, and electricity are imponderable elements of uni
 versal distribution, and appear to be primary instruments in the
 hands of nature.       In discovering her laws, we are more induced
  to speculate on tangible and sensible masses, than on these uni
  versal principles.

IS                    On      the   Agency of Electricity
     We consider the earth        as composed of a certain number of
elements,     and  that  the  different  properties of bodies depend upon
the different combinations of these elementary substances.              Ag
gregated masses undergo no change in their properties, without
some chemical change amongst the elements that compose them ;
and as chemical effects are now ascribed to the influence of
electricity, the change of property which bodies obtain seems to
be more peculiarly derived from a variation in the electrical state
of them than from any other source.
    The most acrid and offending bodies lose their destructive pro
perties by chemical or electrical combination.            If it be the pro
perty of acids and alkalis to be corrosive, why do they lose their
respective properties by combination, if it be not derived from the
electrical union of the ultimate particles that compose them ?
Even the same elements in the same quantities will receive dif
ferent properties under different states of electricity.            The gas
called nitrous oxide, for instance,            according to Sir H. Davy,
                                                  is,
composed of thirty-six parts in           hundred oxygen, the remainder
                                              a
nitrogen    ; and the atmospheric air twenty-one parts oxygen, and
the rest nitrogen, saving some inconsiderable portion of carbonic
acid gas. Now suppose fifteen parts oxygen be added to the at
 mospheric air to bring the quantities of these ponderable ele
 ments equal     ;in this case, we are well aware that the properties
 of the two gases in the lungs are of a very different description,
 although their elements are the same, and yet the atmospherical
 air may be converted into the nitrous oxide                by
                                                         electricity.
    According to Cavendish's experiment,                we pass electrical
                                                        if
 shocks through       aconfined portion of atmospherical air, we pro-'
 duce nitrous gas     ; but in this experiment       portion of the nitro
                                                        a
gen    is rejected, and the electrical combination of the oxygen
 with the remaining nitrogen            in greater proportion than in the
                                         is
 atmospherical     air    :   if
                             we    present even an oxidable metal to the
 nitrous gas,    itloses    portion of its oxygen, and
                              a                              converted into
                                                                        is
 nitrous oxide.
    The different properties of the two elements, oxygen and ni
 trogen, in these three different states of combination, seem pe
 culiarly to point out how much the properties of bodies are pro*
 duced      by
             their different states of electricity.         .
    The same principle            strikingly shown from the effects pro
                                    is
 duced      by
            the vinous and acetous fermentations.          Oxygen, hydro
 gen and carbon compose saccharine matter                  this in solution
                                                                :
 undergoes an electrical process called the vinous fermentation,
 and alcohol     is produced from the same elements as the sugar
 and water.      Another     electrical change called the acetous fer
 mentation absorbs further quantity of oxygen, and wine
                          a                                            con   is
                                                                      verted

           in constituting the peculiar Properties of Bodies, &c.      19
  verted into vinegar.     Thus the properties of the fluid change, as
  the chemical or electrical combination varies amongst the ele
  mentary principles that compose it.
      If it be admitted that the character and properties of bodies
  be derived from electrical influence upon the particles that com
  pose them ; the substances themselves are passive, or are merely
  the vehicles of limited quantities of electricity for which they
  have a determinate capacity.
     Supposing, according to the generally received opinion, that all
  bodies possess electricity, but in different quantities according
  to their capacity, combustion and other chemical effects might
  be explained upon a new theory.
     The term combustion is here employed to express the evolution
  of light and heat, rather than the decomposition of a body.
     According to Lavoisier, combustion arises out of the combina
 tion of an inflammable body with oxygen : hence oxygen has
  been considered as an essential to combustion.
     Inflammable bodies, generally, have great capacity for electricity,
  and oxygen of all other bodies the least.        Whether we suppose
  the inflammable body and oxygen to be taken away, or the ulti
  mate particles of these bodies combined ; still the electricities re
  main the same, and these very opposite states will rapidly com
 bine to restore an electrical equilibrium.         In either case, an
 emission of light and heat will be produced ; that is, either with
 or without the grosser bodies.        So that we have all the effects
 of combustion in an electrical spark obtained from the conductor
 of an electrical machine, or from the positive and negative ends
 of the wires of the electro-chemical apparatus, as well as from
 the combustion which is produced by the electrical combination
 of the ultimate particles of bodies in opposite states of electri
 city.
    Oxygen, which is considered as indispensable to combustion,
 may be withdrawn when electricity is supplied.
    In the ordinary experiment of burning charcoal between the
 positive and negative ends of the electro-chemical apparatus, the
 degree of light and heat which is evolved is in proportion to the
 intensity of electrical power employed, and the effect which is
produced is greatly superior to any other means of combustion :
this seems to arise from the influence of uncombined electricity.
    When combustion takes place from the combination of the
             of two bodies, the effect is limited ; or the emission of
  ight  and
{>articles    heat is dependent upon the electrical capacities of the
bodies      employed: thus, the different combustible dispositions
which different bodies possess arise from their varying capacity
for electricity, the intensity being the greatest in those bodies
that are in the most opposite states.       Eut the influence of un-
                                     6 2                     combined

20                         On Electricity.
combined electricity in supporting combustion, or producing an
evolution of light and heat, is always the most powerful, from the
extreme states of the fluid ; and equally perfect in effect, whether
the quantity employed be great or small : it is on this account
that the ordinary electric lights are much more brilliant than
those that are obtained by any other means.       —
    The influence of oxygen does not appear to produce any effect
where uncombined electricity is employed.
    If a combustible body, charcoal for instance, be placed in a
vessel of nitrogen or hydrogen gas, on connecting it with the two
ends of the electro-chemical apparatus, the light is equally bril
liant with that which is obtained in atmospherical air : or, if
the charcoal be placed under an exhausted receiver, an equal
effect will be produced.      The combustion of the charcoal is
equally vivid in water or carbonic acid gas ; but in the two latter
instances it might be objected that the bodies were decomposed,
and oxygen supplied from them.
    Then briefly to sum up this view : the evolution of light and
heat, or the general effects of what is termed combustion, appears
to arise out of the rapid union of opposite states of electricity,
either independent and uncombined, or effected by means of
certain bodies in which it resides ; and that the combination of
the ultimate particles of sensible masses can only take place
through the influence of those portions of electricity for which
the bodies have a specific capacity ; and that the properties of
these bodies arise out of their electrical states : thus generally
tending to support those established principles of Sir H. Davy,
that all chemical combination is dependent upon electrical union.
    If these observations should be found worthy of a place in
your very useful publication, I shall take another opportunity
of extending this subject a little further, and of tracing some of
the analogies of light and heat with electricity, and the influence
 of these universal agents in the oeconomy of nature.

       V. On Electricity.    By George John Singer, Esq.
 Some time since, I ventured to rectify some erroneous state
 ments of Mr. Ez. Walker's on the subject of electricity; re
 garding them as the mistakes of a novice 4n that science, which
 it might be useful to correct for the advantage of other young
 electricians.
                                                                Had

     Had I then imagined that the "opinions and suppositions" with
 which they were accompanied were intended to form. the basis
of a new system of " chemical philosophy," or to be followed by
 the luminous views of electrical combustion, and oxygen and
'hydrogen electricity, which have been developed (at page 267
 of the forty-second volume of the Philosophical Magazine), I
 should certainly have avoided any notice of those " statements,"
and most probably might not then have incurred the anger Mr.
Walker has manifested against me in his note published in the
last volume of this Magazine *.,
    It would be unnecessary to reply to that note, but that it con
tains an assertion of " the thing which is not."               I am repre
sented as having asserted that Mr. Walker is in error, without
adducing one fact to prove it.           To refute this misrepresentation,
it is only necessary to repeat here my former paragraph, from
whLeh Mr. W, has made some mutilated extracts.                It was printed
as follows:
    " With respect to the permanence of the effects produced by
electrical influence, Mr. W. has fallen into error by confounding
them with communicated electricity.             If, after bringing an elec
trified body near an insulated conductor, on withdrawing                   the

                                                                            it

fied by communication, and not           by   position,  whether  its  loss or
gain   be   the consequence        of  the  contact   of  some conducting
body, or the imperfection of its own insulation during the disturb
ance of its natural electricity     ;     and one of these causes must
operate to produce permanent electricity in such an experiment                       :
for neither an insulated rod, nor           a  gold-leaf electrometer,               if
properly    constructed,    will be  permanently electrified by approxi
 mation to    an  electrified   body unless they commutiicate
                                    ;                                     im by
perfect insulation, or pointed terminations,             with surrounding
unelectrified substances dming such approximation.                These are
 facts, which the constant repetition of such experiments pro
fessionally enables me to state with confidence; and they are
indeed such as amongst electricians are generally admitted                 but   :
perhaps    Mr.  Walker      has  yet  to  learn, that   a  conducting body
supported    by  dry glass, and surrounded         by dry air, may be still
 very far from perfectly insulated f,"
     The statement in the preceding paragraph may be verified in
 a few minutes    by any one sufficiently acquainted with the practice
 of electricity to make experiments with due accuracy; and                           I
 believeit  not only adduces    a   fact in proof of Mr. Walker's error,
 but offers the requisite information to show him its cause.

 VI. New      Outlines  of Chemical Philosophy . By Ez. Walker,
                         Esq. of Lynn, Norfolk.
                      [Continued from p. 371, vol. xlii.]
  M UcH      confusion in chemical philosophy seems to arise from
  want of precision in chemical language.          Oxygen and hydrogen
  are terms that are used in a very vague manner, no distinction
 being made between oxygen and oxygen gas, nor between hydrogen
 and hydrogen gas.         Positive and negative are words that have
 no definite meanings in chemical science; and yet we have posi
 tive and negative electricity, positive and negative galvanism;
 and even the laws of chemical affinity are now explained by the
 terms positive and negative. We have also fixed fire, phlogiston,
 and other words that express things rather more imaginary than
 real.    All this confusion might be avoided by adopting two new
 terms   to  .express the two elements, which produce effects that
 are real objects of our senses, and by which those elements may
 be known in all their various conbinations with matter.
    "   Mr. Davy," now Sir Humphry Davy,          " exhibited the powert
 of the Voltaic instrument by brilliant experiments ; metals were;
fused upon the surface of water and of oil of turpentine, and
burnt in contact with them.          He stated that the maximum of
heat was at the positive electrical surface ; and he exhibited an
experiment in which, though the most brilliant light was at the
negative surface, yet the ignition was infinitely greater at the
positive*."
    From these properties of the two elements above mentioned,
that element which produces the maximum of heat, at the posi
tive electrical surface, may be called the generator of heat, or
thermogen;        and that element which appears at the negative
surface, and exhibits the most brilliant light, may be called the
generator of light, or photogen.           The choice of these terms
seems to be sanctioned by the words thermometer and photome
ter now in common use. By the term photogen is to be under
stood the imponderable element of all combustibles,             whether  it

                                                                    exists

             New Outlines of Chemical Philosophy.                 23
exists combined or uncombined with matter ; by thermogen is
to be understood the imponderable element of all supporters of
combustion, whether it exists combined .with matter, or in a
free and uncombined state.               /
                   Thermogen     and Phologen.
   When a Leyden jar is receiving a charge from an electric ma
chine, one side receives thermogen from the atmosphere, and the
other side receives photogen from the earth.       When a commu
nication is made between the inside and the outside of the jar,
by some conductor of these elements, the element from the in
side attracting the element from the outside, a spark is produced,
consisting of a double current exhibiting both light and heat,
and the equilibrium which was destroyed by the action of the
machine is restored.     But it cannot be supposed that these ele
ments are annihilated by their union : such a supposition would
be absurd : they only enter into new combinations, and return
again into those receptacles from whence they were withdravm.
For while the element of one side of the jar goes to the earth,
the element of the other side is communicated to the air.
   When two portions of the same element are nearly equal they
repel each other, but when they are very unequal they attract
each other.     This is known from an infinite number of experi
ments : consequently, the immense attraction of the photogen in
the earth attracts any small portion of the same element, which
may be disengaged from its base, with an infinite force ; and the
thermogen in the atmosphere attracts every small portion of the
same element the instant that it is disengaged from matter.
   But why does not the thermogen in the atmosphere unite with
the photogen of the earth, as they have a very strong attraction
for each other ?    This question will be easily solved as soon as it
is understood that they are kept asunder by their bases.     Oxygen
and hydrogen gases mixed together in a proper vessel, would re
main for ages without producing any effect upon one another ;
but let their elements be brought into contact, either by pressure
or increase of temperature, and combustion will instantly take
place.
    If the attraction between these elements of combustion aud
their bases were not proportioned to a mathematical exactness,
the whole ceconomy of our globe would be deranged.            For, if
this attraction were greater than it is at present, %ve should have
perpetual frost ; and if this attraction were much less than it   is,
all combustibles would be reduced to ashes in     a   moment :   but,
in the present state of things,it   isimpossible that either of these
 events should happen.
  It   is not to be understood that photogen      it  light, or that

thermogen is heat ; they are the generators of light and heat,
light and heat being the effects which they produce on matter.
The thennogen on the inside of a charged jar cannot be felt,
nor does it produce any effect upon the most delicate thermo
meter, nor is any light perceptible on the outride of the jar. But
let the jar be discharged through a piece of iron wire, and both
light and heat are produced.          When the metal becomes red hot
by    this means,  it loses  its  photogen, attracts oxygen gas from
the air, and becomes oxidized.             If this oxide be mixed with
some matter containing photogen, and heat applied, oxygen gas
will be reproduced, and the metal will receive photogen, and
again become malleable.
      The application of these elements, to elucidate some of the
most interesting phenomena in nature, will be more fully treated
 of hereafter.
                          Composition   of Water.
      Some philosophers maintain that water is a simple body, and
the only ponderable basis of oxygen and hydrogen gases, and other
 aerial fluids ; but others suppose that water is a compound of
 oxygen and hydrogen, and this opinion is now generally adopted
 by writers on chemistry.        But all the experiments made to se
 parate    the component parts of water, tend to prove that it is a
 body simple and undecompounded.                What has led men to con
 clude that water is a compound body, seems to have arisen from
 their supposing that the electric spark is a simple fluid ; but as it
 is now well known that it consists of two elements possessing
 different properties, both chemical and mechanical*, the passing
 of these elements through water is no proof of its being a com
 pound substance, notwithstanding oxygen and hydrogen gases
 are produced by this means.
      When thermogen and photogen pass through water in con
 trary directions, thermogen and water form oxygen gas ; pho
 togen and water form hydrogen gas.              These gases being mixed
 together in a close glass vessel, and their temperature increased
 to a certain degree, combustion takes place, light and heat
 escape through the .glass, and the product is pure water.
      That thermogen and photogen are capable of producing com
 bustion, before they entered the water, is unquestionable, nor
  can it be supposed that they are annihilated by passing through
  it ; for they appear again in the two gases, producing the same
  phenomena of light and heat as before.             Hence it appears that
  the two elements which compose the electric spark are the impon
  derable elements of the two gases, and that water is their com
  mon base.      Oxygen and hydrogen gases thrown upon fire prp-

duce the most intense heat ; but water being thrown upon fire
extinguishes it : water, therefore, is neither a combustible nor
a supporter of combustion, and consequently it contains neither
oxygen nor hydrogen.
    Another experiment, which has been made to prove that wa
ter is a compound of oxygen and hydrogen, consists of passing
steam through a red hot iron tube containing turnings of iron,
by which means hydrogen gas is produced, and the iron turnings
become oxidized ; whence it is concluded, that water is a com
pound of oxygen and hydrogen.              But let the experiment be tried
with a red hot glass tube containing pieces of broken glass, and
no hydrogen gas will appear : hence it is evident, that one of the
component parts of the hydrogen gas, in the former experiment,
came from the metal.
    Now when the turnings of iron become rad hot, the photogen
they contain .and water produce hydrogen gas : but in this pro
cess thermogen must be present, for no cdmbustion nor increase
of temperature can be generated unless thermogen and pho
togen be united.       The most condensed rays of the sun do not
exeite combustion in vacuo, nor in any gas deprived of oxygen,
even when the most inflammable substance is employed*.                 Con
sequently, the thermogen         and    water produce oxygen gas, which
the iron, after being deprived of its photogen, attracts, and be
 comes an oxide of that metal.
    Thijs experiment may .be illustrated by the burning of iron
wire in oxygen gas.        In this beautiful exhibition the most bril
liant light and the most intense heat are generated, by the union
of the photogen of the metal and the thermogen of the oxygen
 gas.    The metal, having lost its photogen, attracts oxygen gas,
 and becomes an, oxide of iron intensely heated.
    The photogen or generator of light in the metal cannot be
hydrogen, for
                  " ho combinations of iron with hydrogen or azote
 are known f."       If this assertion be correct, we have combustion
without hydrogen.
    Sir H. Davy observes, that         " the nature of water may be shown
 synthetically as well as analytically."
     " When ten grains of the metal called potassium are added to
 about two grains of water in a glass tube, there is a violent ac
 tion, much hydrogen is disengaged, and by heating the results
 the operation is completed.            The same effect is produced upon
 the potassium, as would be produced by heating it strongly in
 contact with a small quantity of oxygen ; it becomes united to
 pxygen, and its increase of weight i9 in proportion to the weight
 pf the hydrogen as 15 to 2 J."

   But the composition of water cannot be shown by a compound
test.  "Potassium inflames when gently heated, aud throws
off fumes which are alkaline *." Consequently potassium is a
compound of an inflammable element and a metal, and therefore
it may     be used as a test to prove that water     is a simple body,
and not   a compound.      For   the inflammable   element   and water
will form hydrogen gas, and the metal when strongly heated will
attract oxygen gas in the same manner as other metals.
     "It may be remarked, that oxygen is mild when in the pro
portion of 22 per cent. in atmospheric air, and highly corro

 stones and of Coals, in my Notes on Mr. B's pages 44, 125, &c. Sic.) ., and
 whereon, an Officer in one of the Societies to whom I recommended the
 consideration   of this question, has lately mentioned, the probability, that
 the blue Clay of London and the culcaire grossier or coarse Limestone of Paris
 are parts of the same deposit or stratum, " and that from local circumstances
 the clay has prevailed in the ore, and the calcareous matter in the other,"

         himself serious, in   adding to the extreme confusion on

         ever of too much importance, as to the real succession

     mention of Derbyshire is omitted in describing the
     magnesian range, from Nottinghamshire to Northum
     berland,, that the lower yellow Lime Rock, is here in
     tended, and that the sandstone mentioned above, must
     mean the stratum next under the lower yellow Lime,
     (often appearing as a Sand, but sometimes also as a
     thick Sandstone Rock, see Rep. ii. p. 410, Note); be
     cause, otherwise, either Coal strata would occur on both
     sides of [above and below] his Gypsum if placed lower,
     or if Mr. B. referred to the upper yellow lime, and made
     his Gypsum belong to the intervening Red Marl, which
     I  have lately traced between these rocks (P. M. xxxix.
     p. 104), then      "   earthy limestone" would occur [be
     low]      on one side  of it instead of Coal strata ; and thus
     therefore it should seem, that Mr. B. would persuade
     "   the disciples of Werner," to place the Chellaston
     Gypsum, and its incumbent Red Marl, next above the
     Derbyshire Coal.measures, and under the yellow Lime
     Rock, which covers them ! — But has any Collier,
     sinking through the Limestone to ivork the Coals below,
      (as several do) ever seen an ounce of Gypsum ?, or has
     such anywhere been found at its basset ?, or even Red
     Marl, which might contain it?.

 iX.   On the Formation   of Fat in the Intestines of living Ani-
     mals.    By Sir Everard Home, Bart. Presented bv the
     Society for promoting the Knowledge of Animal Chemistry*.
The       investigation of the digestive organs of different animals,
  in which I have been engaged for many years, has led me im
  perceptibly into an inquiry respecting the particular uses of the
 lower portion of the intestines in birds and quadrupeds.
     The first thing that attracted my notice more particularly to
 this subject, was finding that, in all animals whose stomachs are
 made up of a great variety of parts for the purpose of econo
 mizing the food, the colon has a greater extent of surface, and
 the course of the canal is so disposed that its contents must be
 a long time in their passage through it.         This circumstance led
 me to believe that the food, after the chyle is formed and se
 parated from     it,undergoes in the lower intestines some changes,
 by which   a  secondary kind, o£. Nourishment       extracted from it.
                                                           is
     This opinion was much strengthened,'                   by
                                                       finding that the
colon of the casuary from Java           only one foot long, and each
                                         is
of the caeca which are appendages to                 it,
                                                  only six inches long,
 and a quarter of an inch in diameter          while the African ostrich
                                                ;
 has the colon forty-five feet, and each of the caeca two feet nine
 inches in length, and at the widest part three inches in diameter:
 besides which, both the colon and caeca have very broad valvulae
conniventes not met with in the casuary from Java.             This won
 derful difference, for  it   more than fifty to one, can only be ex
                              is
plained     by the luxuriancy of Java being so great, that this bird
might destroy its health by over-feeding, had no guard been
furnished by nature.
     This guard    is, the food passing through the intestines with
so much facility, and in so short a time, that, however much
the bird mav eat, only the necessary quantity of nourishment                       is
carried into the constitution      but in the African ostrich, the food
                                    ;
is  retained in the extensive colon till every thing nutritious       ex    is
tracted.     In all ruminating animals, the colon        of great length,
                                                                is
is  fixed in its course, which      very intricate, and varies in every
                                    is
different genus; so that we cannot doubt of some particular
process being carried on       it.
                               in
    The process which the contents of the colon undergo,            quite  is
distinct from any thing carried on in ,the other intestines, since
they entirely change their appearance and smell; and there                        is
commonly      a   valve to prevent any part of them, even the gases
evolved, from being carried up into the small intestines.

    that from putrefaction, although        by no means the same, led                me
to compare them with the animal matter buried in the earth,
    whichis converted into adipocere : in both cases the substance
is in the incipient state of putrefaction, but that process never
•completely takes place ; it is excluded from the external air, is
either under water, or within the reach of imbibing moisture ;
 and there is no substance whatever, the chyle excepted, which
 can better supply the waste produced by the actions of growth
 and muscular exertion, than animal fat.
     The more I canvassed this new opinion, the greater number
of circumstances in favour of it occurred to me ; one of the
strongest of which          is,
                           that there    no other mode am acquainted
                                           is                      I
 with,        by
              which animal fat can be formed.           To this may be
 added the curious circumstance of the sleeping animals, which
 lay in so large a supply of it,' ins short time, to serve for their
 winter's consumption, having         i    mation of the intestines                  al

 guish  the   colon, and  no  fixed course   for  that intestine   so that  ;
 the contents pass along with more facility, and remain a shorter
 time in the canal, the food being sufficiently plentiful during the
'
 summer to compensate for this want of cecondmy,                       by
                                                                 which the
 lower intestines receive more abundant supplies for the produc
 tion of fat. These intestines remain empty during the sleeping
 season, so that no fat can be formed in that period.— With this
 very important information, thus procured, in support of my
 opinion,     Ihave been led to prosecute this inquiry with increased
 ardour, and shall now bring forward the facts             have been able
                                                                   I

 of      it

spermaceti.     In Stowe's History of London, this part of Shore-
ditch   isstated to be a morass, and since that time the ground
has been raised eight feet. The clerk and the grave-digger ob
serve, that at the full and new moon the water in the sewer rises
two feet, and that at those times there           water found in the
                                                                 is
graves, which at other times are dry.
    The current of water, which passes through the colon, while
the loculated lateral parts are full of solid matter, places the solid
contents in somewhat similar circumstances to dead bodies in
the banks of      common sewer.

of fat, being found, in immense quantities, in the lower intestines

with in a diseased state of that canal, and are called sci/bala                                ;

this she experienced almost immediate relief ; and, on the sub
sequent examination of what passed from the bowels, globular
concretions were uniformly observ ed, which by the persons about
her were considered as the gall-stones which had previously been
productive of so much distress. This lady having occasion some
months since to visit her friends in town, and a doubt having been
suggested by one of her medical attendants in the country, as to
the nature of the concretions in question, I was desirous, from
the account that I had received, to have an opportunity of de
termining the point for myself ; and therefore requested, that if
 the pain should recur, and she should be under the necessity of
repeating her medicine, that the concretions, which had been
said always to pass from the bowels in consequence of her so
doing, might be reserved for my inspection.       In a few days I was
 summoned to make my proposed visit ; and, upon examining the
 substances collected, t found their appearance to be such as I
 have already described to you, namely, that of distinct globules,
 varying in size from that of a large pea to the bulk of a moderate
 grape; of a cream colour, and slightly translucent, of sufficient
 consistence to preserve their form, and to bear being cut by a
 knife, like soft wax, but at the points of their contact disposed
 to cohere. When exposed to heat, they readily melted, and then
 at once exhibited their original oily character.        The change,
 >which they have since experienced, has taken place in the water
 in which they have been kept.

      Our associate, Mr. Brande, afterwards examined the substance,
   and made the following report upon it :
      " The globules voided appeared to be composed of the olive
   oil combined with mucus : the latter separated during putrefac
   tion, and the oil was evolved, apparently unaltered.         The re
   lative proportion may be estimated at one-third animal matter,
   and two- thirds vegetable oil."
       The following case, which was also communicated to me by
   Dr. Babington, shows that fat is sometimes formed in the in
   testines, and detected passing off with the faces :
       Elizabeth Ryder, four years and a half old, had been healthy
   for six months aftefher birth, when she became thin, had a sal
   low complexion, and was liable to jaundice. At a year and a
    half old, her belly was tumid, and she had great weakness in her
    back and limbs, for which complaints Dr. Babington was first
    consulted.   At three years  old, her mother observed something
                                                                   come

   amined, was found to be fat in a liquid state, which concreted
   when cold.     Ever since that time to the present, she has voided,
   at intervals of ten or fourteen days, the quantity of from one to
   three ounces, sometimes pure, at others mixed with faeces ;
   when voided, it has an unusuallv yellow tinge, and is quite fluid
  like oil.    Her appetite is good, as well as her spirits, and her
  flesh firm ; her belly rather tumid, but not hard : she is subject
  to occasional griping: her urine natural, and she sleeps well.
  The specimen on the table was procured under circumstances
  which precluded all possibility of deception.
      These facts, so strongly in favour of the opinion I had taken
  up, led me to devise in what way it might be put to the test of
  experiment.      I tried to extract fat from the contents of the colon
  in different parts of its course, but without success.      Failing in
 this mode of obtaining any det.isive conclusions, I was led to be
 lieve the caeca of birds more favourable for experiments on this
 subject, and had those of a duck exanlined by Mr. W. Brahde
 after the bird had been seven days without an evacuation. This
 confined state of the bowels put the parts nearly under the same
 circumstances as if they were in a diseased state.           When the
 caeca were examined, they were found completely distended with
 faeces of the consistence of soft clay, so that, when the bags were
 laid open, the contents retained the same form.          The intestine
 immediately above the caeca was empty, but the rectum was
 much distended ; its contents were of a softer consistence than
 those of the caeca.
     The following is Mr. Brande's report on this subject :
   "    The contents of the caeca were divided into two portions, of
one drachm each, and comparative experiments were made with
 similar quantities of the contents of the rectum.
     " Exp. 1. One drachm of the contents of the caecum was
completely immersed in half an ounce of water, and kept for
seven days in a temperature varying from 40° to 60°.             At the
end of that time, warm water was poured upon            it, but no ap
pearance of fat could be perceived.
     " Exp. 2.     The same quantity of the contents of the caecum
was immersed in water containing one-fifteenth part of nitric
acid, and kept under the same circumstances as" in the former
experiment.       In seven days, warm water poured upon       it   sepa
rated  a   portion  of  oily matter,  which  concreted when  cold,   and
appeared     to be  one-eighths  of  the whole mass.
  "    Exp. 3. Portions of the contents of the rectum were treated
in the same way as in Experiments           1   and 2.   That in water
became putrid very rapidly, and showed no appearance of fat.
The other,  in    the diluted nitric acid, was more dissolved than in
                                  C    4                      Experi-

                     On the Formation of Fat
Experiment 2.      Considerable extrications of gas took place, but
there was no appearance of fat.
    From these experiments, we learn that the contents of the cae
cum, being confined there for some days, are in a state readily
to be converted into fat by nitric acid, while the contents of the
rectum are not, probably from being too putrid.
    While engaged in this inquiry, I received from Sir Joseph
Banks the carcase of a wild swan, which the Hon. Mr. Pelham
had shot in the neighbourhood of the Humber.            On examining
the caeca, their contents were found to be of a bright green co
lour.    This led me to propose to Mr. Brande to ascertain by ex
periment, whether an admixture of bile had any effect upon the
process of converting animal substance into fat.        The following
experiments were made by Mr. Brande upon this subject :
    Exp. 1 . He took two portions of human muscle of the same
size, and digested one of them in human bile, the other in wa
ter, both placed in the temperature of 100°. — In the first day
the muscle in the bile underwent no change.             On the second
day it   became   soft in its texture, and  had  a slightly fetid smell.
On the third day it became more fetid and yellow.                On the
fourth it had the smell of excrement, was flabby, very offensive,
and fatty upon the surface.       The portion of muscle, digested in
water, had undergone no other change in the four days, but be
coming slightly putrid, and there was no appearance of fat what
ever.
    Exp. 2. A similar experiment to that with the human bile,
was made with a small portion of beef, and ox's bile, and the
results were exactly similar.
    Exp. 3. The last experiment was repeated in the tempera
ture of 60\      In four days the beef became slightly fetid, and of
a yellow colour ; in six days it became more fetid, but there was
no appearance of fatty matter.
    Exp. 4. A portion of beef cut into pieces was digested in
ox's bile, at the temperature of 100°.       At the end of the fourth
day the putrefaction was more advanced than in Experiment 2 ;
 the beef was washed and heated upon paper, but no greasy stain
was produced.
    From these experiments we learn, that the bile has a power of
 converting animal substance into fat ; and that the temperature
 of 100°, or nearly so, is necessary for that process. We learn
also, that this change is produced just as putrefaction is be
ginning to take place ; and if the substance goes rapidly into
 putrefaction, no fat is formed; and, what is deserving of observa
 tion, the peculiar smell belonging to faeces, so differeVit from that
 of putrid matter, is produced at the time that fat is procured.
    Having succeeded in changing animal matter into fat, by
                                                                 adding

                 in the Intestines   of living Animals.             4f
adding bile to it out of the body, I was desirous of ascertaining
whether this process could be detected going in in the human
intestinesj and being in attendance upon a gentleman of an ad
vanced age, who had been six days without an evacuation from
the bowels, confined to bed by the gout, I did not let slip the
opportunity of his having a very costive stool deeply tinged with,
bile, to make the experiment.          The excrement was put into
water,   and kept  heated  for three  hours  to a temperature of above
 100°.    When the water was allowed to cool, a film was formed
upon the surface, which appeared to be of an oily nature, and
 Mr. Brande ascertained it to be so. The quantity was not great,
but quite sufficient to ascertain the fact ; and next day the faeces
 having subsided, the fatty film was much more conspicuous.          In
the Phil. Trans, for 1678, p. 6093, a case is stated of a person
 who laboured under an indisposition, attended with sickness and
 vomiting.    In one attack of vomiting, he brought up matter re
 sembling tallow, four pieces of which weighed half an ounce.
    This process of forming fat in the lower intestines by means
 of bile, throws considerable light upon the nourishment derived
 from clysters, a fact well ascertained, but which could not be
 explained.    It also accounts for the wasting of the body, which
,«o invariably attends upon all complaints of the lower bowels.
 It accounts, too, for all the varieties in the turns of the colon,
 Which we meet with in so great a degree in different animals.
 This property of the bile explains likewise the formation of fatty
 concretions in the gall-bladder, so commonly met with, and
 which, from these experiments, appear to be produced by the ac
 tion of the bile on the mucus secreted in the gall-bladder : and
 it enables us to understand the following effects, which arose
 from the circumstance of no part of the bile passing into the.
 intestines.
    A child was born, at the full time, of the usual size, and lived
 for several months, but never appeared to increase in size, al
 though it fed heartily, had regular stools, and the food seemed
 perfectly digested.    There was no bile in the stools, and the
 skin was of a dark yellowish brown. I saw the child while it
 was alive, and was struck with its want of growtii, and its having
 no fat under the skin, which made it appear longer than new
 born children generally are.       Upon examining the body after
 death, the only mal-formation met with, was there being no
 gall-bladder, nor any duct leading from the liver into the duo
 denum.
    From what happened in tl\is case, a supply of fat appears ne
 cessary for growth ; for the child was by no means wasted in its
  muscles, which it must have been had the constitution not been
 supplied with nourishment.
                                                                Animal

42                          On defmite Proportions.
   Animal fat has, I believe, hitherto been considered as a secre
tion, although there is no direct evidence in favour of such an
opinion. It has nothing in common with the secretions ; it is
met with in all the interstices of the body ; is very often quickly
deposited, and in as short a time taken back into the constitus
tion.   In. these respects it corresponds with the watery fluids,
with which the body is supplied.
    In a former communication respecting the stomachs of animals,
I explained that water was taken up from the stomach by chan
nels yet unknown, and carried into the circulation ; from whence
it is poured into all the cavities of the body, or thrown out al
together by the kidneys and glands of the skin.
    On the present occasion, I hope that I have collected a suf
ficient body of evidence te prove, that fat is formed in the in
testines, and from thence received into the circulation, and de
posited in almost every part of the body.     When there is a great
demand for        it,
                   as in youth, for carrying on the growth of the
body,   it   laid immediately under the skin, or in the neighbour
             is
hood of the abdomen       when not likely to be wanted, as in old
                             :
age,   it   deposited
            is        in the interstices of muscles, to make up in
bulk for the wasting of the muscular fibres.     There appear to be
no direct    channels       by
                          which any superabundance of         can be   it
thrown out of the body       so that, when the supply exceeds the
                                 ;
consumption, its accumulation becomes        disease, and frequently
                                                     a
a  very distressing one.

I    have expressed an opinion in the former parts of this Essay,
that water takes place of a base with respect to the acids, and
of an acid with respect to the bases   have also advanced as
                                             ;   I                               a
probable supposition, that the salts contain always so much water
of crystallization, that its oxygen     either an integral multiple
                                             is
or submultiple of that which     contained in the base of the salt.

tic acid contains such a quantity of water as is sufficient for oxi
dating with its oxygen as much metal as is capable of producing
a neutral salt with the dry muriatic acid 3 and Gay-Lussac has
proved the same thing in his excellent essay on the combinations
of the gases.     I had also found by experiment that the sulphuric
acid could only be concentrated by boiling, until the remaining
water contained one-third as much oxygen as the acid, that is,
as much as would be required by the same acid in a base capable
of saturating it. I had assumed the component parts of water
llf   of hydrogen, and 88f of oxygen, from my own experiments,
confirmed by those of Biot and Arago.          Mr. Gay-Lussac makes
them 13 1 and 86 j, without altering the determination of the
 specific gravity of the gases.    I shall endeavour to throw a clearer
 light on these combinations of water by the experiments now to
be described.      I ought perhaps to have been deterred from mak
 ing some of them public by the difficulty of the subject, and the
 impossibility of fully establishing my opinions respecting the com
 position of hydrogen ; but science would often have profited by
 communications which have been withheld by too great a desire
of minute accuracy.
   I shall   here make some preliminary     remarks on subjects con
nected with the immediate objects      of my pursuit; and first, re
                                 '
specting the impossibility of exhibiting some of the acids in a
separate state.   We have learned from the excellent experiments
of MM. Gay-Lussac and Thenard, that the muriatic acid can
not be separated from the substances with which it is combined,
unless in the presence of water, with which it may combine at
the moment of its formation.        Mr. Davy's inferences from this
fact are well known ; but we shall here pause a little to examine
the affections of other acids in similar circumstances.
   Sulphur, as we have reason to believe, is capable of four de
grees of oxygenization.     The first and second are unknown ex
cept  in combination   with the muriatic acid ; the third is the sul
phurous acid,   and  the  fourth   the sulphuric.  No chemist has
ever obtained    dry sulphuric acid, and whoever attempts to pro
cure  it,will find sulphurous acid in its place.      If,  for example,
we burn sulphur in perfectly dry oxygen,        avery slight trace only
of sulphuric acid     formed, and this originates from the hydrogen
                     is
present  in  the sulphur, which affords     alittle water.  If   we dry
sulphate  of  the  oxide of  iron, or alum,   with   proper care, and
attempt to drive off the sulphuric acid         byheat, we obtain oxy
gen and sulphurous acid, without the condensation of        a   trace of
sulphuric acid   ;  but    we cause aqueous vapour to pass over
                           if
these salts when heated, we immediately obtain sulphuric acid
condensed in the receiver.        It known on the other hand, that
                                       is
if we throw sulphuretted muriatic acid into water, sulphurous acid

44                         On definite Proportions.
 is disengaged, and a precipitate of revived sulphur appears.          We
 may therefore safely assume, that of the four stages of oxygeniza-
 tion of sulphur, only one is capable of being separately exhibited.
    Nor can the nitric acid be obtained without water.               If we
 attempt   it, we  get nothing   but  oxygen gas and nitrous acid. But
 when these gases come into contact with each other over water,
the affinity between the substances, which had been suspended,
is  restored, and a compound of nitric acid and water              formed.
                                                                  is
 Consequently the nitric acid cannot exist alone, but requires the
presence of      athird body containing oxygen.         If the nitric acid
were incapable of being exhibited in a lower degree of oxygeni-
zation, and    ifthe affinity of oxygen to its radical were very strong,
it  would obviously be perfectly impossible to expel this acid from
any of its combinations         by
                                 means of a dry, although        stronger,
                                                                  a
acid,   with   the  assistance   of  heat
                                        ;   for in this case two strong
affinities would oppose the one which tends to the formation of
the dry acid; that        is,
                           the attraction of the nitric acid to the base
of the combination, and that of the oxygen to the radical of the
acid, which must both be overcome in order that the separation
may take place.
    But  it often happens that the attraction of radical to oxygen
                                                      a
is   incomparably greater than that of an acid to             base.
                                                              a       Iris
therefore very natural, that an acid which cannot be exhibited in
a separate state, and of which the radical has            avery strong at
traction for oxygen, should be incapable of being separated from
its combinations without the intervention of water, or of some
other oxidated body.
    This  is precisely the case with the muriatic acid, and            it
                                                                      pos
sesses the properties which have led the acute Mr. Davy to his
peculiar opinions respecting this acid, in common with the sul
phuric, the nitric, and, as we shall see hereafter, with several
other acids.     The experiments, which have been performed, in
order to the decomposition of the muriatic acid, prove that the
radical of this acid has       remarkably powerful attraction for oxy
                                a
gen, if   not  the  greatest  of  all existing substances.      But     we
                                                                        if
attempt    to decompose ignited      muriate  of  soda with fused  boracic
acid in a red heat, we oppose the weak attraction between the
boracic acid and the alkali to the much stronger attraction of the
muriatic acid for the alkali, and the still more powerful affinity
of the radical of the acid to oxygen hence  :         it   isvery obvious
that   no separation   of  the  muriatic  acid   from  the base  can take
place.
   When the celebrated Mr. Davy entertained hopes of decom
posing the oxymuriatic acid gas by means of charcoal, which he
kept ignited in    for an hour, he seemed to suppose that the
                     it
carbon had     greater affinity for oxygen than tin radical of the
                 a
                                              .            muriatic

  imiriatic acid. For, if it is impossible to exhibit the muriatic acid in
•
  a separate state, it would have been requisite that the carbon should
  separate from the radical not only the small portion of oxygen
  which distinguishes oxymuriatic from muriatic acid, but the whole
  quantity that exists in the combination.        Now the attraction of
   carbon for oxygen is much weaker than that of the muriatic ra
  dical, and the experiment cannot be admitted as a vajid proof
  that the oxymuriatic acid contains no oxygen.
        A second preliminary remark relates to the water of crystal
   lization of salts. If we examine a solid that contains water,
   we must not forget that the water may be either in a state of
   chemical combination, or merely retained mechanically in the
   pores of an aggregate.        The internal parts of crystals are not
   completely continuous, but interrupted by very small irregular
   interstices, occupied by a small portion of the mother liquor, in
   which the crystals have been formed.         For this reason, regular
   saline crystals, although they derive their origin from a power
   which detaches them from all chemical connexion with the sub
   stances remaining in solution, still contain a small quantity of
    the foreign substances which had been present, however carefully
    their surfaces may have been washed.         Crude saltpetre, for in
   stance, crystallized from the first solution, exhibits yellowish-
    brown crystals.     But this saltpetre is not chemically combined
    either with the colouring extractive matter, or with the alkaline
'
    muriate, which is found in it.        By the help of a magnifying
  •glass we see clearly that the white salt contains a yellow sub
    stance in its pores ; and the same must be true of the impurities
    which are not distinguishable by their colour.       The less pure the
    mother liquor, the more must the crystals be loaded with foreign
    substances ; and the purification by repeated crystallizations de
    pends on the mechanical admixture of a mother liquor which
    becomes less and less charged with impurities at each step of the
    process.     A large crystal contains in its pores a quantity of the
    mother liquor proportionally larger than a small crystal.        Thus,
     in the refmeries of sugar, the syrup which is separated during
     the continual agitation that is employed for obtaining lump sugar,
'
     by crystallization in small grains, is commonly more coloured
     than the syrup from which sugar candy has been separated du
     ring a slow evaporation, in large yellow or even brown crystals.
      In the same manner it has been usual to purify nitre for fire
     works by causing it to precipitate in fine grains ; and we know
      from the experiments of MM. Thenard and Roard, foat alum
      may easily be purified by a similar process.

46                                 On definite Proportions.
If,  on the other hand, we attempt to pulverise the same salt
equally well dried, but consisting of larger crystals, we obtain                      a
damp powder, somewhat cohering, from containing              portion of  a
 the mother liquor, that oozes out of the pores, and causes the
appearance of moisture.                    If

with chemical combination.           For this reason, the estimates of
the quantity of the supposed water of crystallization in decrepi
tating salts have been extremely various, according to the mag
nitude of the crystals examined, the larger crystals affording the
greater proportion.
    That decrepitating salts might contain water of crystallization
is  not altogether impossible, for the water of crystallization might
be expelled at         higher temperature than that which produces
                         a
decrepitation     but:   as far as we have hitherto examined, the com
binations which retain water the most obstinately are always
fused at a moderate temperature, and the water which                    only     is
united mechanically to the crystals            expelled/by boiling.

General view of the results of my experiments.
          I. Laws for the Combinations of Water.
              A. Combinations    of Water with Acids.
                          1. Tartaric Acid.
   Ten grammes of fmely powdered dry tartaric acid were dis
solved in water, and heated with a solution of acetate of the prot
oxide of lead, as long as any precipitate was formed.            The
mixture was evaporated to dryness, and the uncombined acetic
acid was in great measure expelled.       The mass that remained,
when well washed on a filter, afforded 23.5 1 gr. of tartrate of
protoxide of lead.
    Five grammes of this substance, when treated with dilute sul
phuric acid, afforded, in three different experiments, 4-2318,
4.229, and 4-228 gr. of sulphate.         Consequently the tartrate
must consist of
             Tartaric acid             37 75       100.00
             Protoxide of lead . . . 62-25         104.87
    Hence the 23.5 1 gr. of tartrate must contain S.875 of dry
acid, and 100 parts of the crystallized acid contain 11.25 of
water, and 100 of dry acid unite with 12. 7 of water, which con
tain 11 .2 of oxygen.     But the protoxide of lead saturated by
 100 parts of this acid contains 1 1 .788 parts of oxygen ; so that,
notwithstanding the slight difference in the quantities, it is pretty
obvious that the crystallized tartaric acid must contain a quan
tity of water, in which there is as much oxygen as in the base
saturated by the acid.     In the experiments which I have under
taken, in order to investigate the laws of the formation of organic   ,
productions, and which I shall hereafter make public, I have
only found in the tartaric acid 56.384 per cent. of oxygen, with
39.206 of carbon, and 4.41 of hydrogen, which is nearly five
times as much as is contained in the water that saturates 100
parts of tartaric acid.   In two experiments on the tartrate of the
protoxide of lead, I obtained from 3 grammes, with a very slight
variation, 3.7555 gr. of carbonate of lime, and .425 of water.
 If now the compositions of this tartrate, of the carbonate of
lime, and of water, are correctly ascertained, the deficiency in the
computation must be made up with oxygen : but it must be al
lowed that this determination is subject, from various causes, to
an error of as much as 1 per cent.        I .must here repeat the re
mark, that I may possibly have estimated the quantity of oxygen
contained in the different bases somewhat too high, and that
hence may arise the difference of the' quantity as deduced from

               /
48                     On definite Proportions.
the oxygen of the acids and that which has heen more directly
determined.    But I have endeavoured to distribute this error as
equally as possible through all the results, so that the first per
fectly correct and well-established analysis of an acid or an oxide
may correct the whole at once.
                                2. Citric   Acid.
    Some crystallized citric acid was finely powdered, and dried
for some hours in the sun.
    a.) Five grammes of this acid were dissolved in water, and
mixed with 15 gr. of levigated protoxide of lead, which had
been ignited the instant before ; the mixture was slowly evapo
rated to dryness, and the salt of lead, mixed with the protoxide,
was then dried, in as strong a heat as it would bear, on a sand
bath, until it lost no more of its weight.           The mixture .now
weighed 1 8.95 gr.      Consequently the acid had contained 2 1 per
cent, of water.
    b.) Ten grammes of the same citric acid, treated in the same
way as the tartaric, afforded 23-756 gr. of the citrate of the prot
oxide of lead.
    c. ) Five grammes of the same citric acid, kept melted in a
gentle heat, as long as they lost any part of their weight, were
found to be deficient, when they were congealed into a solid
mass, .354 gr. or 7 '08 per cent.
    d. ) Ten grammes of citrate of the protoxide of lead, treated
with diluted sulphuric acid, gave 9*056 gr. of sulphate of the
protoxide, in which are contained 6.666 gr. of the protoxide.
 Consequently this salt contains one third of its weight of acitl,
 and consists of
             Citric acid        .   33.333         100
             Protoxide   of lead     66.667        200
 Hence 100 parts of citric acid must saturate a quantity of the
 base which contains 14.3 of oxygen.         If we compute from ex
 periment b.), according to this analysis, we find again that the
 citric acid contains 20.85 per cent. of water. Now this acid had
 lost, in a temperature not high enough to decompose              it,
                                                                  7*08
 per cent. of water ;    and this makes about       third of the whole
                                                    a
 thatit   contains.    The remaining 13-77 parts of water were at
 tached to the acid    by a stronger attraction.    But if 79.15 parts
 of dry citric acid contain 13-77 of water strongly attached to
 them, 100 parts of dry acid must combine with 17' 14 of water,
 which contain 15 of oxygen, or a little more than           contained
                                                             is
 in the protoxide of lead which saturates 100 parts of the dry
 acid.     This small difference depends on the impossibility of ob
 taining perfectly correct results from substances, which, like the
 citric acid, are easily decomposed in          atemperature somewhat
                   <        .                                 elevated.

                      On definite Proportions.                     49
elevated.     Hence we see that the citric acid contains a quantity
of water of crystallization, which may be separated from it
without altering the composition of the acid, and that this water
of crystallization is half as much as that which is more intimately
combined with the acid.
                          3.   Oxalic Acid.
    It is a fact generally known, that the oxalic acid effloresces or
falls into powder in dry air.      I thought at first that it lost the
whole of its water during this change ; but upon exposure to a
temperature somewhat above the boiling point of water, several
portions of it were changed into coherent masses, but never lost
exactly equal parts of their weight.        The variations however
were onlv from 28 to 29 and 29-3 per cent. ; and in the last case
it was obvious that a sublimation had commenced, for the sur
face of the salt was covered by small crystalline needles.
    I now mixed in a small glass dish four grammes of powdered
oxalic acid, which had been dried for an hour in the air, with 20
gr. of finely powdered protoxide of lead, which had just been
ignited ; I poured water on the mixture, and dried it rapidly,
stirring it frequently in the mean .time.    The acid and the prot
oxide had now lost 1-68 gr. of their weight.           I repeated the
experiment with a result precisely similar.       Hence 100 parts of
oxalic acid contain 42 parts of water.
    Ten grammes of well dried oxalate of the protoxide of lead
were burnt in an open glass dish exposed to a red heat.           The
dish lost, in different experiments, from 2.52 to 2.53 gr. of its
weight.      The remaining protoxide had a shining yellow colour.
Consequently the oxalate of the protoxide of lead consists of
                       .......
             Oxalic acid           .  25.2      10O0
             Protoxide of lead . . . 74.8       296.6
Hence 100 parts of oxalic acid saturate a quantity of a base of
which the oxygen amounts to 21-2 parts.          Now we have seen
that 100 parts of crystallized oxalic acid contain 42 of water, of
which they lose from 28 to 29 by exposure to the air.          But 28
is exactly  f   of 42 ; so that the oxalic acid retains 1 part of wa
ter for every two that it loses.     Hence we find that 100 parts of
dry   oxalic  acid unite with 72*414 of water, and lose 48.276 of
these in drying.       The remaining 24.138, which can only be
driven off by the assistance of other substances possessed of
stronger [positively] electrical powers with relation to     it,  con
tain 21.3 parts of oxygen.
                               4. Results.
  We   are therefore acquainted with none of the three vegetable
acids, here analysed, in separate state and
                         a                   ;  may' be presumed

 that, like the mineral acids before mentioned, they cannot he ex
 hibited in a separate state.
     We have also seen, that both the citric and the oxalic acids
 contain a portion of water which may be expelled, and which
 may be considered as water of crystallization,       while the acid
 remains combined with another portion of water, which com
 pletely assumes the place of a base, and can only be expelled
 by a stronger base . We may properly consider these combina
 tions with water as salts, in which water is the base, and stands
 precisely in the predicament of the weaker bases among the me
 tallic oxides, which are capable of combining both with acids
 and with other bases.       If we consider the water which escapes
 from the oxalic acid during its efflorescence as water of crystal
 lization, it contains twice as much oxygen, as the portion of the
 water, which is to be considered as the base of the combination.
    It is not probable that these determinations can be liable to
 any error from the presence of water in the oxalate of the prot
 oxide of lead : for from 5 gr. of well dried oxalate of lead, pro
 perly burnt in close vessels, I obtained in two experiments only
 from *077 to -09 gr. of water, together with a quantity of car
 bonic acid which afforded 3*708 of carbonate of lime.           If we
calculate the composition of the oxalic acid from the analysis of
the oxalate of the protoxide of lead, the carbonate of lime, the
 carbonic acid, and water, this acid must consist of 34'9 of car
 bon, nearly 1 of hydrogen, and 64* 1 of oxygen.          But we have
 seen that 100 parts of oxalic acid unite with so much of a base
 as contains 21.2 parts of oxygen, and 21,2x3=03,6.                 We
mav    therefore  consider  it as proved^  that the oxalic  acid   must
 contain three times as much oxygen as the base by which it is sa
turated. . Finally, we     f  have found, that" the water contained
in the crystallized oxalic acid contains exactly as much oxygen
as the acid itself.                                              '
    It is true that these analyses of the vegetable acids differ con
siderably from those of Gay-Lussac and Thenard ; probably on
account of the water united with them.           For, if we subtract
from the acid of the tartrate of Kme as much water as contains
twice as much oxygen as the lime, we find the capacity of the
acid for saturation such as is determined by my experiment on the
tartrate of lead.     The same is true of the citrate. and oxalate of
lime, if we deduct from them as much water as contains a quan
tity of oxygen equal to that of the lime.        With this correction,
the analysis of the oxalic acid agrees pretty well with mine ; but
there is still a considerable variation in our' analyses of the tar
taric acid ; and time must decide which is the least inaccurate.

              B. Combinations of Water with Bases.
                 1.    Alkalies and Alkaline Earths.
   The extrication of a quantity of hydrogen gas, during the re
 duction of the alkalies to a metallic form, by the action of iron
 raised to a white heat, has induced several chemists to endeavour
 to discover water in the fixed alkalies after ignition. The results
of these investigations differ in some measure from each other,
although they evidently oscillate about the same point.
   Since it is perhaps impossible to obtain a perfectly pure dry
caustic alkali, which contains neither carbonic acid, nor earth,
nor any other foreign substance, so that experiments upon such
an alkali can afford no very accurate result, I chose for these in
vestigations lime and magnesia, convinced that what is true of
one of these stronger bases, must also be applicable to another.
                                 Lime.
    Some pure well-burnt lime was slaked with water, and strongly
 ignited again in a platina crucible, so that all the carbonic acid
 left in the lime might be expelled with the aqueous vapour.      a.)
 Of this caustic lime 10 grammes were slaked with water, dried
 as soon as possible, and lastly heated over a spirit lamp far above
 the boiling point of water.     They had acquired an additional
 weight of 3-21 gr. b.)     The experiment was repeated with 30
 grammes of pure lime, and afforded 39-75 gr. of slaked lime.
    Consequently in both these experiments 100 parts of lime had
 taken up from 32- 1 to 32.5 of water. Since in the latter experi
ment the greater bulk of the lime required a longer time for dry
ing, it is obvious that the weight must have been increased by
the absorption of some carbonic acid.       But 100 parts of lime
contain 28.16 of oxygen, and 32-1 of water 28.5.         The slight
difference evidently depends on the absorption of carbonic acid
while the lime is drying : and the experiments sufficiently prove,
that the lime takes up a quantity of water, of which the oxygen
is equal to that of the earth.
                              Magnesia.
    a. ) In order to ascertain the quantity of oxygen contained in
magnesia, I expelled the water of crystallization of some pure
sulphate of magnesia by heat, dissolved the salt in water, after
slightly ignitingit,   and precipitated the sulphuric acid with mu
riate of baryta.      Ten grammes of ignited sulphate of magnesia
afforded 19-43 of ignited sulphate of baryta, answering to 6-664
of sulphuric acid.
  b.
   )   I   took five grammes of caustic magnesia, which had been
prepared from the carbonate, precipitated with pure carbonate
                                 D2                               of

52                       On definite Proportions.
of   potass   from a boiling solution of sulphate of magnesia, ob
serving    the  precaution that all the magnesia should not be pre
cipitated,     since otherwise the last portions would contain some*
carbonate of potass, which could not be washed away : I dis— .
solved them in diluted sulphuric acid, evaporated the solution,
and ignited the residuum in aplatina crucible : they left 14-742
gr. of sulphate, which, when redissolved, left behind a slight
trace of magnesia, and had consequently lost a small portion of
their acid by the effect of the heat.        According to this experi
ment,     the   dry salt contains 66' parts of sulphuric acid in 100.
                                      1
    Although it is possible that this experiment may have been
more accurate than the former, I shall however prefer that as a>
ground of computation, because the errors to which it is liable
 must have proportionally affected the other comparative experi
 ments.      We have therefore for the sulphate of magnesia
              Sulphuric acid            66.64       100.00
              Magnesia                  33.36        50.06
 Consequently, according to this calculation, we have 39*872
 parts of oxygen in 100 of magnesia.          According to Experiment
 L)  they   contain   only 38*8.    Mr.  Hisinger   found, by means of
 the decomposition of the muriate of magnesia with the nitrate
 of the protoxide of silver, 38-3 parts of oxygen in 100 of mag
 nesia.
     Ten grammes of caustic magnesia, moistened with water, and
 dried in a platina crucible, afforded, in different experiments,
 when heated far above the boiling point of water by means of a
 spirit lamp, 14.25, 14.35, and 14.4 grammes of the combina
 tion of the earth with water.          Now 4.4 gr. of water contain
 3.883 of oxygen : consequently this agrees very accurately with
 the result deduced from experiment b).           I do not however ven
 ture to declare this experiment the more accurate, since possibly
 a part of the magnesia may have been deprived of its water in
 it, at the bottom of the crucible, where the flame touched it. For
 when the magnesia, which to all appearance was dry, was placed
 over the lamp, it lost very rapidly a considerable quantity of
 water, until about 14.6 gr. only were left, and then half an hour
 was required in order to reduce it to 14.4 gr. or less.         Conse
 quently these experiments cannot be perfectly accurate ; but we
 collect very clearly from them that magnesia, like lime, is capa
 ble of combining with a quantity of water, of which the oxygen
 is equal to its own.
                                 Conclusions.
     I consider these examples as affording a sufficient foundation
 for the supposition that the same law prevails with respect to
 the fixed alkalies and the other alkaline earths.          But if these
                                                                    hold

hold in combination a quantity of water, of which the oxygen is
equal to that of the earth ; and if they are capable of taking up
fresh quantities of water which correspond to the water of cry
stallization, as they are known to do, they must contain water
in two different states, like the acids which have already been
described.     One of the portions of water corresponds, in com
parison   with  these stronger bases, to a [negative] body, or an
acid, and cannot be expelled from its combination with the fixed
alkalies, with baryta, and with strontia, by means of ignition,
 but only by the action of a body which is either intrinsically more
 strongly [negative], or which assumes that character at the
 given temperature.
     If we compare the experiments of Berthollst, • Davy, and
 Darcet, on the quantity of water contained in fused potass, we
 find that they differ little from 16*15 per cent. ; and since this is
 exactly the quantity of water which contains equal quantities of
 oxygen with the potass, these experiments may be considered as'
 a proof of the opinion which I have here advanced.           We know
 from the able experiments of Mr. Bucholz, that crystallized
 baryta loses half its weight in the fire ; it still remains fluid, and
 can be deprived of no more water by continued ignition ; but
 Bucholz and Gehlen have shown more lately, that even in this
 state it still contains water.    According to the analogy of lime,
 we should expect this to amount to 10*59 per cent. If then 200
 parts of crystallized baryta lose about 100 of water in the fire,
 the water of crystallization here amounts to either nine or ten
 times as much as that which is combined in the place of an
 acid.
     The property of the fixed alkalies    and alkaline earths, which
 enables   them to retain water at a very high temperature, may
 afford us the means of attaining an object of great importance
 to the whole theory of chemical and physical science, a compa
 rison of the force of chemical attraction with common mecha
 nical force. We know how immense a force is required to retain
 water in a state of liquidity at elevated temperatures : probably
 no vessel of iron can be made strong enough to contain it at the
  heat of ignition, while this effect is actually produced by the at
  traction of the alkalies and of baryta to water.          If the force
  which Is required for such an effect were expressed by the height
  of a column of quicksilver, we should at least obtain a very high
  numerical estimate of this force, which is exceeded by the at
  traction of these bodies to water ; but we should not obtain a
  correct measure of the attraction, since, at a still higher tempera
  ture, both the alkali and the water are raised in vapour.           But
  lime and magnesia would allow of such a comparative estimate,
  and for these substances we might determine the height of a co-
                                   D S                              lunin

lumn of quicksilver, under the pressure of which aqueous vapour
would begin to condense at the temperature required for expelling
the water out of these earth y, hydrates : and this height would
express the mutual affinity of the. alkaline earths and water, and
might be compared at pleasure with any other nTechanical power.
And since chemical attractions may be compared with each
other, we might perhaps by- degrees advance so far by these
means, as to be able to express every. chemical affinity in numbers,
and U> compare it with gravity, the universal measure of me
chanical force.
   We shall hereafter see that some of the weaker bases, when
they take up water, retain it with a force so moderate, as to be
exceeded by the expansive power of the water even at lower
temperatures.    Some of them thus become in some measure
hygroscopic  substances,  since their greater or less -approach to
the maximum of moisture depends on the dryness of the air, and
only takes place when the air exhibits a similar maximum, and
the expansive power of the water at the given temperature is
completely annihilated.

                                            in a cotemporary Journal,
 and to point out a mis-statement there given to the public, in
jurious, in my opinion, to the scientific reputation of a learned
and respected individual.
    The passage I allude to is contained in No. 12 of Dr. Thom
 son's Annals of Philosophy, and i6 in these words :
    " When we reflect on this cause, it appears at first evident that
 it must be of a mechanical nature ; and what presents itself as
 the most probable idea, most conformable to our experience,                         is,
 that bodies are composed cf atoms, or of molecules which com
 bine  1 with     1,with

 proportions   seem  to  result   from  this with such clearness and
 evidence, that     seems very singular that an idea so simple and
                   it
 probable has not only not been adopted, but not even proposed
 before our own days.      As- far as   know, the English philosopher
                                             I
  Mr. John Dalton, guided        the experiments of Bergman, Richter,
                                   by
  Wenszel, Berthollet, Proust, and others, was the first person who
  endeavoured to establish that hypothesis.        Sir Humphry Davy
  has lately assured us, that Mr. Higgins in         book published
                                                             a                       in
  the year 1789  established  the   same hypothesis.    have not seen
                                                                  I

  the work of Mr. Higgins, and can only notice the circumstance
  on the authority of Davy."
      To which vhe learned Editor has subjoined a note of his own
 in the following words :         '
      " The work of Higgins on Phlogiston is certainly possessed
  of much merit, and anticipated some of the most striking sub
  sequent discoveries.      But, when he wrote, metallic oxides were
  so little known, and po few exact analyses existed, that it was
  not possible to be acquainted with the grand fact that oxygen,
  &c. always unite in determinate proportions which are multiples
  of the minimum proportion.         The atomic theory was taught by
  Bergman, Cullen, Black, &c., just as far as it was by Higgins.
  The latter indeed states some striking facts respecting the gases,
  and anticipated Gay-Lussac's theory of volumes ; but Mr. Dalton
  first generalized the 'doctrine, and thought of determining the
  weight of atoms of bodies. He showed me his table of symbols,
  and the weight of the atoms of six or eight bodies, in 1804 ; and,
   I believe, the samt' year explained the subject in London, in a
  .course of lectures delivered in the Royal Institution.     The sub
 ject could scarcely be broached sooner. But about the same
  time several other persons had been struck with the numbers in
  my table of metallic oxides published in my Chemistry ; and the
  doctrine would have certainly been started by others if Dalton
   had missed it."
      That learned Editor by this publication has endeavoured to
  deprive Mr. Higgins of the honour due to the first author of
  the atomic theory, a doctrine now so generally received and uni
  versally admired, and of which Sir H. Davy, Berzelius, and others
  have spoken in terms of unqualified approbation.
       Dr. Thomson has in a part of his note endeavoured to bestow
•
  the credit of that theory upon Mr. Dalton, and in another part
   to fritter away the merits and importance of the discovery. And
   that the discovery 'is important, and that merit is due to the
   author, I think, is fully established by the opinion of such men as
    I have mentioned.
       I shall now proceed to show, by reference to dates and facts,
   that the merit of that discovery exclusively belongs to Mr. Hig
   gins, and that Dr. Thomson was not justifiable in making the
    assertions in his note.
       It is well known, that for several years the attention of the
   chemical world was directed to the consideration of the phlo
   gistic and antiphlogistic, doctrines.    Whilst these questions were
    agitated by their respective advocates, Mr. Higgins, without
    adopting either the one theory or the other, commenced, upon
   the true ground of experiment and analysis, to examine the foun
    dation of both, and the atomic theory was one result of that in-

vestigation . And accordingly Mr. Higgins, in his work printed in
the year 1 790, gave that theory to the world, ten years, at least,
before either Mr. Dalton or his learned panegyrist even pub
lished a hint of such a doctrine.       That work which Mr. Higgins
styled A comparative View of the Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic
Theories, and "which Dr. Thomson calls (and I thhik disingenu
ously) a work upon Phlogiston, was very generally read, and is
now to be found in the library of every scientific society and in
dividual, with that date for its publication prefixed to it.
     Reference to dates establishes priority ; and reference to the
 works of Mr. Higgins and Mr. Dalton will fully establish this,
 that Mr. Higgins left the atomic theory fully as perfect as Mr.
 Dalton ; and I would with confidence call upon the most zealous
 advocate of the latter gentleman, to show in his work any vone
 position, or principle, which is not founded upon, or deducible
 from, the doctrine first discovered and established by Mr, Higgins.
     Dr. Thomson in the note alluded to asserts, that " when Mr.
 Higgins wrote, .metallic oxides were so little known, and so few
 exact analyses existed, that it was impossible to he. acquainted
 with the grand fact, that oxygen, &c. always unites in deter
 minate proportions which are multiples of the minimum pro
 portion."     To set the Doctor right on that head, I will beg
 leave to refer him and the reader again to the Comparative View,
  page 295 &c. where they will find that treated of which the
  Doctor asserts to be then unknown ; and what he calls the grand
fact, will be found to be the greatest leading principle which
  Mr. Higgins endeavours to establish in that work, particularly in
  that part where the molecules of different acids are represented
  by diagrams, with their respective number of particles of oxygen
  and bases ; and it was that which first gave a clear idea of definite
  proportions.                                                         •
      I apprehend the Doctor is not more fortunate in the assertion,
  f  that the atomic theory was taught by Bergman, Cullen, Black,
  &c. just as far as by Higgins."            Now I have looked over
  carefully  the works  of  those  chemists, and also an accurate ma
  nuscript  note  or report   of Black's Lectures ; and I affirm, there
  is not in any of them the slightest mention of the atomic theory.
   Indeed I must here remark, that the Doctor has npt attempted
  to support any of his assertions /by quotations : it was prudent not
  to make the attempt, he could not succeed.
      In contradiction to what the Doctor says, " Mr, Dalton first
  generalised the doctrine, and thought of the weight of atoms of
   lodies," I need only refer the reader to Mr. Higgins's work,
   pages 15, 37, and particularly to pages SO and 81.        As to that
   remark of the Doctor's with which he closes his note, that " the
   doctrine would be started by others    if Dalton had missed it,"    I
                                                                   must

            Preparation  of the  new Substance called lode.          57
must say that it is most disingenuous : first, because it indirectly
makes Mr. Dalton the starter (to use the Doctor's metaphor) of
that whereof he was only the pursuer, and when it appears, and
that to the Doctor's knowledge, that Higgins put up the game ;
and next, because that sentence conveys a sentiment unworthy
of any scientific man, equally disparaging to merit of any dis
covery whatsoever, the best answer to which is to remind the Doc
tor of the story of Columbus and the egg.
      I wish it to be clearly understood, that I by no means attempt
 to attribute the learned Doctor's mis-statement to any unworthv
 motive ; nor is it any part of my intention to enter into a vindi
 cation, or explanation, of the theories and the positions laid
 down in the production of Mr. Higgins.           Such were I even ca
 pable of performing would now be superfluous, as I understand
 there is at present in the press a work on that subject, from the
  pen of the learned Professor himself. I mean no more than to
  claim for Mr. Higgins the merit of being the original author and,
  promulgator of the Atomic Theory,

  XII.     Preparation of   the lately discovered new Substance called
       Iode, which   possesses the  singular Property of becoming con
       verted into a beautiful violet-coloured Gas    by the mere    ap
       plication of Heat. Communicated by Mr.        Fredrick Accum
       in a Letter to the Editors.
   Sirs, -Y"ou will    receive with these lines a small glass tube, con
   taining a specimen of the extraordinary substance lately dis
   covered in France, which possesses the singular property of be
   coming converted into a beautiful violet-coloured gas, by the
   mere application of a gentle heat, and condensing again unal
   tered into a solid state, resembling plumbago or black lead, when
   suffered to grow cold.
        As this substance, to which the name of iode has been given,
   has within these few weeks arrested the attention of chemists,
    and as the mode of obtaining it has not yet been published in
    this country, I take this opportunity of stating, that it may be
    procured by distilling, with a v«ry gentle heat, the uncrystallizable
    saline mass which is obtained, or left behind, after separating all
    the crystallizable salts from a lixivium or solution of Help, or
    Spanish barilla of commerce.
        For the purpose of experiment or exhibition in a Lecture-
     room, the following easy process answers exceedingly well :
                                                                     Take

58.           On the new discovered Substance called lode.
   Take a thin glass tube about 10 or 12 inches long, and 3.8ths
of an inch in the bore ; put into it about one drachm of the un-
crystallizable residue before mentioned, previously fused for a
few minutes, to free it as much as possible from water, and re
duced to a coarse powder : add to                   it,
                                               without soiling the inside
of the tube*, about       half  its weight of concentrated sulphuric
acid: shake the whole together, and apply a gentle heat,                               by
means of       ataper or lamp.        This being done,         dense white
                                                                        a
vapour will make its appearance, and            black glistening powder,

Then cut to a convenient length, with a file, that part of the
tube which contains the iode, and seal the extremities of                by      it
means of the blow-pipe or spirit-lamp.

and easy.     Let a long slender -necked tubulated retort be placed
in a sand-bath      ;surround the whole body of the retort up to the
tubulure with sand, and adapt, without luting, to the beak of                          it,
a  wide-mouthed phial or receiver.           This being done, introduce
through the tubulure, first, one part of sulphuric acid, and then
two parts of the saline mass, before mentioned, broken into small
pieces of the size of split pease,          and distil for a lew minutes
with a gentle heat.        The iode will become sublimed into the
neck of the retort in      crystalline form, exhibiting
                           a                                 black shining

 iode     means of
         by           a feather or.camel's    hair brush.
    Ifthe whole of the saline mass of kelp or barilla, freed from
carbonate of soda only, and which of course consists of muriate
of soda, muriate of potash, sulphate of potash, hydrosulphuret of
potash, &c. be treated with sulphuric acid, the preparation of
iode becomes more embarrassing and difficult.

no chemical agent does it offer any trace of muriatic acid. The
iode' combines with nearly all the metals ; but as it is solid, it
does not appear to develop in its combinations so much heat as
the oxygenated muriatic acid, with which it has much analogy
in its general properties.      To give an idea of its relations with
other bodies, we shall compare it with this acid, applying also
the two hypotheses which have been formed respecting its nature,
and adding, that on combining with hydrogen it forms a peculiar
very strong acid, which can be procured in the gaseous state,
which is very soluble in water, and, which has the same relation
to iode that muriatic acid has to oxygenated muriatic acid or
 chlorine.      The action of phosphorus on iode furnishes the means
 of obtaining the new acid in both its states, gaseous and liquid.
      If we agitate iode and phosphorus together, both perfectly dry,
we obtain a reddish-brown         substance which emits no gas ; if we
 moisten    this substance,  it immediately yields copious fumes very
 acid, and at    the same  time  phosphorous acid is formed.    We can
 easily obtain the new acid in a gaseous state, by using the iode
 a little moistened ; there is then enough of water to assist its
 formation, but not sufficient to condense it. If we combine the
 iode and phosphorus under water, only a very small quantity of
 subphosphuretted hydrogen gas is disengaged, and the water be
 comes very acid : if the new substance be in excess, the liquid is
 deeply tinctured of a reddish-brown ; on the contrary, it is co
 lourless if the phosphorus predominates.         It generally remains
 in a mass of a red colour, insoluble in water, and in which
 we find some phosphorus and iode.          Nevertheless, their propor
 tions may be such that we can obtain no residuum, and the li
  quid may be as limpid as wafer.        If we submit this acid liquor
  to distillation, water comes over, and the new acid does n«t pass
  into the receiver' till the liquid in the retort is highly concen
  trated : in the latter, pure phosphorous acid remains, which
  soon yields an abundance of phosphuretted hydrogen gas. Thus,
  when phosphorus and iode are dry, a combination analogous to
  that of oxygenated muriatic acid with phosphorus is formed ;
   and when they are moistened, the same phaenomenon is produced
   as with the liquor of phosphorus poured into the water, while
   the oxygen of the latter with the phosphorus forms phosphorous
   acid, its hydrogen combining with the iode to form the new acid.
       We now see the characters of this acid : in the gaseous state it
   is colourless, smelling nearly like muriatic gas, smoking when in
   contact with the air, rapidly absorbable by water, giving with the
   oxymuriatic gas a fine purple vapour, and speedily changing over
    mercury : it forms with this metal a greenish yellow substance,
    similar to that which -we obtain directly with mercury and the
                                                                 vapour

vapour of iode, and it produces hydrogen gas equal in volume to
the. half of the acid gas. A few minutes agitation are sufficient to
decompose it entirely. Iron and zinc produce a similar effect.
     This acid in the liquid state, obtained by dissolving the gas in
water, forms, as is said above, a very dense liquid not very vola
tile : it rapidly decomposes the carbonates, and dissolves iron
and zinc with an extrication of hydrogen gas : but it does not
attack mercury even when warm; which proves that it has a
strong affinity for water.          It forms with barytes a soluble salt,
and    it gives  with   corrosive  sublimate     a red precipitate soluble in
an excess      of  acid.    When    we   pour   into it some drops of oxy-
muriatic acid,       the new   substance    is instantly regenerated : when
heated with black oxide of mangauese, the red and brown oxides
of lead, iode is disengaged, and the oxides are reduced into the
state in which they are generally soluble in the acids.              The red
oxide of mercury makes the acid pass to iode, and we may con
clude that all the oxides which cause the muriatic acid to pass
to that of oxymuriatic will also pass a portion of the new, acid
to the state of iode.         Finally, this acid dissolved in water, and
subjected to the action of the Voltaic pile, appears at the positive
 pole in the state of iode. When once engaged in a combination,
it is not easy to separate it. The sulphuric acid, for example,
when placed in contact with the combination of the new acid,
 and with potash, gives sulphurous acid, and the new substance i$
 liberated: the nitric gives nitrous acid.            If we employ the phos
 phoric and boric acids, dry          or dissolved   in water, they produce
 no decomposition.
     It is now easy to conceive what happens when iode is placed
 in contact with other bodies.                                   ,
     With hydrogen at a high or low temperature we obtain the
 new acid ; but it is not usually pure, because it has the property
 of dissolving a great quantity of iode, which resists the action of
 hydrogen.
     Sulphuretted hydrogen speedily takes the colour from iode,
 and makes it pass to the state of acid, depositing abundatice of
 sulphur : it also produces the same effect when the new sub
 stance is in combination with the alkalis, forming brown or
 colourless solutions.        It is to be remarked, that when we preci
  pitate by    the   sulphuretted hydrogen gas a solution of iode in
 ether or alcohol, sidphur is not deposited in any sensible quantity.
     The sulphurous acid speedily converts iode into acid, passing
  itself to the state of sulphuric acid *. The phosphorous acid and
  the sulphuretted sulphites also give existence to a new acid.
     * This  assertion contradicts a fact stated in the next paragraph.   Pos
 sibly the sulphurous and sulphuric acid should be transposed. Edit.
                                                                       Henct

           On the new discovered Substance called lode.             61
Hence we may conclude, that in the sodas of sea-weed in which
there is abundance of sulphuretted sulphites, the new substance
is in the state of acid ; it is not even manifested in the mother
waters of these sodas, except when the sulphuretted sulphites
are destroyed.
    lode is not altered by charcoal and sulphurous acid, because
these substances cannot furnish it with hydrogen in order to pass
to the state of acid. It does not decompose water at a low or a
high temperature. It takes the colour from indigo, and is driven
from its combinations by the mineral acids, and even by the
acetous acid. It combines with most of the metals without any
gas being extricated. When any of these combinations are made
under water, for example, that with zinc, nothing is extricated ;
the liquor, at first strongly coloured, soon becomes as limpid as
water : the alkalies precipitate from it a substance which has all
the characters of oxide of zinc, but which nevertheless retains a
little of the new acid.      Water has also been decomposed, and
 oxide of zinc and the new acid are produced. This combination,
like all those which contain the new acid, gives sulphurous acid
 when we treat it with sulphuric acid.         Eighteen grammes of
 iode dissolve nearly three grammes and a half of zinc : hence
 we may conclude that the relative weight of oxygen is as 1 to 20,
 or 15 to 100. With the oxymuriatic acid a compound is formed
 of an orange yellow colour, crystalline, volatile, deliquescent,
 and appearing to exist in two different proportions.
     lode forms, it is said, a fulminating powder with ammonia ;
 but the theory of this phenomenon is very simple, when we con
 sider that the iode has a great tendency to combine with hy
 drogen.            •
     From the    above description  we cannot avoid comparing iode
 with chlorine, and the new acid with the muriatic acid.           It is
 also equally remarkable,, that the hydrogen       is constantly neces
 sary to make the iode pass to the .state of acid.      It appears that
  this substance performs in nature the same functions with
  respect to one class of bodies, that oxygen performs for another.
  All the above phenomena may be accounted for by supposing that
  the iode is an element, and that it forms an acid on being com
  bined with hydrogen ; or rather, that this last acid is a com
  pound of water with an unknown base, and that iode is this same
  base united with oxygen.       The former hypothesis appears more
  probable   than  the latter, and it serves at the same time to give
  more probability to that in which we consider the oxymuriatic
  acid as a simple body.       On adopting the new acid, the name
  which suits it best will be that of the hydi iodk acid.

   XIV.   On the Discoloration    of Silver by a hard-boiled Egg. By
      Mr. J.Murray,        Lecturer on Experimental Philosophy.
          rr\                                    London, 81st January, 1814.
           .L he discoloration of silver by a hard-boiled egg is a
  Sirs^
  question difficult of solution. It may appear to be an anomalous
  phenomenon.
      Observation and experiment enable me to state the following
  circumstances :
      If a slip of polished silver permeates the albumen of the egg
  exclusively, it suffers no change ; but if it also penetrates the
  yolk, it is instantly tarnished, and (what is worthy of particular
  remark) the stratum of the metal in Contact with the albumen
  alone is coloured, while the surface of the silver embraced by
  the yolk retains its pristine lustre and character.            The effects
  are more imposing, if the silver be suffered to pass through the
  first stratum of albumen, then through the yolk, and then again
  through the albumen.       The impression is also more sensible the
  harder the egg.
      There are two views in which the phenomenon may be consi
 dered ; 1st, an electrical phenomenon ; 2dly, a chemical effect :
 .— if the former,    which I conceive it to be, then it is a modifi
 cation of that Voltaic circle which Davy announces, and where
 one metal is concerned.        In the present case, however, there is
 only one menstruum, namely the yolk furnishing sulphuretted
 hydrogen.      The effect produced at each end of the silver, it fof.
lows from hence, must be a positive phenomenon.                  The albu
 men is decomposed, and the olive oxide of silver produced,
 compounded according to Davy of 100 parts silver and 7'3 parts
oxygen.
     Were it the sulphuret of silver, it ought to be tarnished only on
that part of the slip which the yolk envelops.              It receives the
oxygen, according to my estimate of the phenomenon, from the
albumen, which is known to contain it.
                       " Si quid novisti re< tius istis,
                         Candid us imperii."
 I may again revert to the subject.
     I observe that Mr. Walker of Lynn has, in No. 1 87, page 368,
of The Philosophical       Magazine, given a theory of combustion as
deduced from Galvanic phenomena. In my lecture .on Galvanism
at Lynn, I took occasion to point out that there were two opi
nions respecting the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen at the
respective poles of the Voltaic circle : 1st, Resting on the sup
position that water is composed of>5hydrogen and oxygen, that a
decomposition might take place, and these constituents be libe
                                                                       rated

                      A   Mathematical Question.                     63
rated from their combination in the gaseous form. 2dly, Con
sidering water as an element, an undecompounded body, and
that the radicles of oxygenous and hydrogenous gas were com
municated by the positive and negative wires, and these com
bining with the water, probably in definite portions, constituted
gaseous oxygen and hydrogen.            This was the opinion of Ritter
of Jena, and I remarked that it was in harmony with our best
views of electrical phaenomena. How can we account for the elec
trical spark not only decomposing but recomposing water, on the
latter supposition ? — two opposite effects resulting from the same
cause P — analysis and synthesis accomplished by similar means?
—destruction and reunion, by one agent, under identical
                                                                 molli
fications ? It is hard to be conceived.        But a more satisfactory
solution is obtained, if we admit that oxygen and hydrogen in the
form of gas are elements (evolved by means of attrition in the
electrical machine, or the action of acid and alkaline menstrua
on metallic bodies in the Voltaic trough,) united with water :
then, these gases in definite proportions, by passing the spark
through them, may be united, and the radicles form a neutral
effect ;— when the power of holding the water in solution ceas
ing, the moisture is precipitated.
    There is much obscurity in Mr. Walker's solution of the phae
nomena of combustion, arising from his using indiscriminately
the terms heat (caloric) and combustion. Now caloric (the mat
ter of heat) arid combustion (the act of ignition) are not iden
tical. What may be collected, however, from the general tenor
of that paper, is merely the theory of Lavoisier in a new dress.
Mr. Walker may please to be informed that combustion takes
place where there is not the least evidence of the existence of
                                                                         '

the metals, &c.

XVI. On the Quantities of Heat developed in the Condensation
 of the Vapour of Water, and in that of Alcohol. By Ben

§1.0/'    the Quantity     of Heat developed in the Condensation
                     of   the Vapour of Water.
Having       filled the calorimeter and placed it on its stand, a
 current of vapour was introduced into the serpentine through a
 cork placed in the lower aperture of the serpentine.      This cork
having  been   perforated with a hole two  lines in diameter, in the
direction of its axis, a small cork (two lines in diameter and two
in height) was fitted into  it, and four other holes about  a line in
diameter, pierced horizontally through the sides of the large
cork at two lines below its upper extremity, and communicating
with the hole two lines in diameter in the axis of this cork, af
forded a passage to the vapour, to admit of its entering        by
                                                                 four
small channels horizontally into the serpentine.

level of the flat bottom of the serpentine, the water which re-

fulled from the condensation of this vapour, did not prevent the
vapour from continuing to flow through these passages.
    This vapour came from along-necked matrass containing distil
led water, which was put on a portable stove placed in a chim
ney at some distance from the calorimeter ; and in order to stop
all direct communication of heat between the stove and the ca
lorimeter, the former was masked by plates, and the tube which
conducted the vapour to the calorimeter was well covered with
flannel.
    The cold water which filled the calorimeter was of a lower
temperature than' that of the chamber by 6° of Fahrenheit and
when the thermometer of the calorimeter announced an aug
mentation of temperature by 12° of Fahrenheit, an end was put
to the experiment.
    The water produced by the condensation of the vapour in the
terpentine was carefully weighed ; and from its quantity, as well
 as from the heat communicated to the calorimeter, the heat de
veloped by the vapour in its condensation was determined.
    As a small part of the heat communicated to the calorimeter
 proceeded from the cooling of the water condensed in the ser
pentine, after the vapour had been changed into water, an ac
count was kept of this heat.           It was supposed that the water at
the moment of condensation was at the temperature of 212° F.
being that of boiling water; and it was determined by calculation,
what part of the heat communicated to the calorimeter must
have been owing to this boiling water.
    In making this calculation, no account was taken of the dif
ference in the capacity of water for heat, which depends on its
 temperature : this is but imperfectly known ; and besides, the cor
 rection which would have been the result, could not but have
 been very small.

    6b'                On the Quantities   of Heat   developed,
       By expressing the mean result of these two experiments in the
    way employed by Mr. Watt and others, I shall say that 1040
    degrees of heat (Fahrenheit) are liberated in the condensation of
    steam, and that consequently this very quantity of heat is em
    ployed and rendered latent when the water, already at the tem
    perature of boiling water, is changed into steam.
       The duration of each of these two experiments was from ten
    to eleven minutes, and I had boiled the water some time in the
    matrass (to drive out the air which it contained) before I directed
    the steam from it into the serpentine of the calorimeter.
       As the results of these experiments have been very uniform,
    and as they agree very well with the latter experiments made by
    Mr. Watt with a view to determine the same question, I have not
.
    thought it necessary to repeat them.
       I have besides been very much occupied with, the following
    branch of my inquiries.
    §     II. Of the   Quantity of Heat developed in the Condensation
                            of t lie Vapour of Alcohol.
        As chemists are not agreed as to the state of the elements of
    the water which exist in alcohol,' I thought that, by determining
    with precision the quantity of heut which is developed, we should
    be better able to form conjectures as to the state of the water, if
    it be at all times found in this inflammable liquid.
        The results of the experiments which I made with alcohol are
    less regular than those of the experiments made with water, as
    might have been expected ; but theyhave nevertheless been suffi
    ciently uniform to establish a fact, which will be regarded without
    doubt as very curious and important.
        As the vapour which is extricated from spirit of wine when
    boiled, varies a little with the intensity of the fire used in boiling
     it,  took care to note the time which was taken in every experi
          I
    ment,     inorder to be able to judge, by comparing the quantity
     of vapour condensed, with the time employed to form          it,

    intensity  of the  heat employed  to  boil the liquid.
        In the following table we shall see the details and results of
    five experiments made on the same day (January 21, 1812) with
     alcohol of different degrees of strength.       The capacity of the
     calorimeter was always equal to that of 2781 grammes of water,,
     and the thermometer employed was that of Fahrenheit.

   In order to prove the state of the elements of the water which
exist in the steam of alcohol,     must be shown how much water

these elements ought to form.
.  We shall select the experiment which was made with alcohol
of the specific gravity of   763, and which contained the least

56-6 grammes.

   In 100 parts of this alcohol there were
   91-79 parts of pure alcohol of Lowitz, and
    8'2 parts of water.
              1
   Consequently there were in the 56-6 grammes of alcohol con             1

   51 '962 grammes of alcohol of Lowitz, and
    4.648                          of water.
   Now, as M. de Saussure has shown that there are 47 parts of
water in 100 parts of alcohol of Lowitz, there must have been
24.422 grammes of water in the 51.962 grammes of alcohol                                                                                                                     oj^

     If to this quantity of water ( = 24-422 grammes) we add the

in the 56-61 grammes of alcohol condensed               in the calori

    But the condensation of 29-07 grammes of steam into liquid
water ought to have of themselves furnished more heat than we
had in the experiment in question, in the condensation of these
2!H)/ grammes of elements of water, with 27-57 grammes of
carbon and hydrogen, which concur, with these elements, in
forming the steam of the alcohol which was condensed.
     If wc apply     similar calculation to the results of the experi
                       a
ments made with alcohol which contained more water, the re
sult of the inquiry will be still more striking.
    In the experiment No. 5. the alcohol employed was of the
specific gravity of 8.5324     :consequently 100 parts of this          al
cohol were composed of 77-88 parts of alcohol of Lowitz, and
                                22.12 water.
    And      inthe experiment 71 '31 grammes of vapour of alco
hol were condensed.
    There were therefore in these 71 '21 grammes of condensed
 alcohol,
           55*688 grammes of alcohol of Lowitz, and
           15-622 grammes of water.
    In the 55-688 grammes of alcohol of Lowitz there were
 26-102 grammes of water, according to the analysis of M. de
 Saussure    ; and this last quantity of water = 26-012 grammes)
                                                  (
 added to the quantity found above, viz. 15-622 grammes, makes
 41*727 grammes of water which ought to have existed, either
 as steam or otherwise, in the 71-31 grammes of alcoholic vapour
 condensed in the calorimeter, in the experiment in question.
     In order to simplify our calculation, and to render our com
 parisons more striking, we shall show how much pure water,
 in vapour, ought to have been sufficient to furnish, in its con
 densation, the same quantitv of heat which was furnished          by
                                                                    the
 condensation of 71-31 grammes of alcoholic vapour, in the ex
 periment in question.
     In this experiment the temperature of the calorimeter was
 raised to 14 degrees of Fahrenheit.
                  J.
      In the second experiment, made with the steam of pure
 water, the temperature of the same calorimeter was raised lOf
 degrees of Fahrenheit, with tiie heat developed        inthe conden
 sation of 24-4 grammes of. this vapour.
                                                                 Conse-

   Consequently the temperature of the calorimeter must have
been elevated to 14| degrees of Fahrenheit, with the heat which
must have been developed in the condensation of 33-695
grammes of steam from pure water.
    Now as the hydrogen and the oxygen forming the elements of
41.727 grammes of water, which are found to form constituent
parts of the 71*31 grammes of vapour of alcohol condensed in
the experiment in question, only furnished in their condensation
the same quantity of heat as 33*695 grammes of steam of pure
water should have furnished, it is clearly proved, in my opinion,
that these elements are not so united as to form water, so long
as they concur in the formation of alcohol.
   I have discovered that the vapour of sulphuric ether furnishes
about one half less of heat in its condensation than that of
alcohol, and consequently one fourth only of what is furnished
by the steam of water of equal weight : but having been inter
rupted by an accident in the course of my experiments with ether,
I am desirous of finishing them before I publish the results.*

the temperature of 158°, a beautiful dense violet-coloured elastic
fluid rises.     This the French chemists propose calling iode gas,
from ItuSijf, violaceous ; but Sir Humphry, considering the
English idiom, denominates it violaceous gas. Its properties
are singular: 5 combined with hydrogen, with phosphorus, and
with oxymuriate of silver, (argentane of Davy) it forms a
peculiar acid ; it is a simple or uncompounded gas, at a
suitable temperature a permanently elastic fluid, but heavier
than any known gas, 100 cubic inches weighing 93 -5 grains:
it is a non.rconductor of electricity, experiences no change ex
posed to the action of the Voltaic battery with charcoal, is not
inflammable, and does not support combustion.               As a simple
 substance it has many analogies with.oxvgen, chlorine, and the
 alkalies : like oxygen, it rapidly unites with the metals : mercury,
 tin, lead, zinc, and iron, are converted by            it,
                                                    in a moderate tem
 perature,    into  salts of  orange, yellow,   and brown tints, which
 are soluble in spirits, ether, and water, and form beautiful pigr
 ments, and most probably may be equally serviceable in the dyer
 house. Exposed to a moderate cold           condenses into solid plum
                                             it
 bago-coloured crystals. Combined with hydrogen,             forms what
 the French call hydroionic gas.       Like the alkalies,       it it
                                                             unites with
 oxygen,    from   which     can
                              it be expelled       by
                                                 heat.  The existence  of
 this substance confirms the opinion previously given          Sir Hum
                                                                     by
 phry, that acidity and alkalescence do not depend on any spe
 cific principle, but on certain modifications of matter.           This
  chemist concludes his important paper with some observations on
  the necessity of      new nomenclature, and proposing several ar
                          a
  bitrary terminations to distinguish the various substances which,
  according to the principles of a significant nomenclature, would
  be called iodais.       But his observations on this head are, as
  usual,   submitted   with the utmost diffidence, and merely as hints
  on which some general principles may be founded.                    inIt   is,
  deed, evident that the whole nomenclatural theory of Lavoisier
     completely set aside by the subsequent discovery of facts, and
it is   time that chemists would unite together to form a new che

  mical vocabulary better adapted to the actual state of our know

                      ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS.
                                                             Naples,   Dec. 20.
     Yesterday, at five in the evening, commenced one of the most
  formidable eruptions of which there is any record in the history
  of Vesuvius.    Happily, though it presented a terrific spectacle,
  k caused no great damage. The explosion began by a shower
  of volcanic gravel, which was followed       by.  violent eruption of
                                                     a
  lava.   This ignited matter having divided itself into two torrents,
  flowed over the ancient lavas towards the Torre de! Greco.         At
. ten in the evening the first torrent      stopped    but the second
                                                         ;
  continued to proceed towards Bosco-Reale and Rosco-Tre-Case.
     This morning the apparent calm of the volcano was followed
 by   an explosion resembling       violent discharge of cannon.
                                     a                                      A
  column of volcanic ashes rose in the air, and obscured the hori
  zon. At the moment we are writing the eruptions still continue.
  Redoubled shocks make the houses of the city shake, but have
  as yet done no damage. We do not know the direction of the lava.
     The Government has taken every necessary measure to afford
  assistance to those who mav have need of it. Yesterday the King
  sent one of his equerries to inform himself of the state of things,
  and to-day the monarch came out himself to observe the erup
  tion.   When arrived in the neighbourhood of the fiery torrent,
  he spoke to every person with that affability which characterizes
  him, and pointed out to those who appeared terrified, that the
  direction of the lava secured us from any danger.
     P.S.   It two o'clock
                 is          the eruption appears to have ceased.
                             ;
   On tine 29th of December a second explosion of the Felling
Colliery took place, causing destruction to nearly every living
creature within the range of its explosion.     Nine men, \'A boys,
and 12 horses, fell victims to the fury of  the  blast; and    more    8
pitmen were severely scorched, though likely     to recover. By this
heart-rending occurrence,   widows, and 18 fatherless children,
                                 8
are becoming the deserving objects of public benevolence*,

72                     Contagious Fever at Gibraltar.
   A contagious fever producing an alarming and daily increasing
mortality having prevailed at Gibraltar during the summer and
autumnal months of 1813, the following account of                   it,
                                                                      drawn
up      aby
          medical   officer  of  that  garrison,  will  be  found  interest*
ing. After stating that on the 3d of December last the disease
totally disappeared, the writer proceeds         :
   When the disease commenced, the population was 15,600
inhabitants   ; and the garrison with their families amounted to
5,500. Of the inhabitants, nearly one-half took shelter on
board of ships, or were forced to encamp on the neutral ground,
where they all continued well, with very few exceptions, none
having been taken ill after they had quitted the place six days.
Of the inhabitants who remained, to the number of 7,870,
upwards of 3,800 had had the disease                   in 1804, who all
escaped, no well-authenticated           case having appeared of any
person taking the fever     a    second time     :of the remainder, not
more than 40 escaped an attack of the fever; yet upwards of
2,600 of the garrison and their families escaped,               their being
                                                               by
encamped     outside  of  the town    and  on  the heights above          it,
                                                                         and
avoiding all communication with the town.
   The disease appeared to originate solely from contagion, as
every person outside of the walls, or who kept themselves in
complete seclusion, remained in perfect safety; and all the
numerous vessels lying in the Mole and Bay, though crowded
with inhabitants, continued perfectly healthy whilst they avoided
communication with the town        ;    but in six different instances,
where they neglected this precaution, the fever appeared on
board.
   The average mortality of deaths was one in five. In more
than half of the fatal cases, the black vomit took place.               Yel
lowness   of skin  was   rather  an   uncommon     symptom,    and   seldom
occurred but in fatal cases, and then was of             dingey mahogany

colour, and commenced       a   few hours before death.
   The faculty now seem generally to agree that the disease                      is
the same as that of 1804, and that          it   is
                                                 a   distinct disease from

    The French Gazette of Health for November contains a de
tailed relation of the sufferings of a young girl of eight years
old, into whose ear a spider had crawled.              She experienced mo
mentarily     a nervous    fit resembling    epilepsy, of which the strength
gradually increased, impressing           those  around her with a fear that
it would speedily become          fatal.    The surgeon, unable to extract
the spider, poured oil of olives into the ear ; hereupon she ex
 perienced some convulsive movements, longer and more violent
ihan those      she had before ; and when they terminated she was
quite    relieved.                                        i
    Professor Mangeli has published in the Milan Journal, a long
report upon the action of the venom of vipers.                    He states,
as the result of his experience, that ammeniac is the only sove
 reign remedy for the bite of those reptiles, and that opium and
musk, which have been hitherto prescribed by Italian physicians,
 have no certain effect.
    An Havanna         paper of the 7th inst. mentions that an aged
 priest,   in  Guatimala,      had lately applied himself to the produce
 tion of   opium    in  that   province, and had succeeded to a degree
 that promised to make his discoveries a great national benefit.
 The Guatimala opium was said to be of a much superior quality
 to that obtained from the Levant.
     Cotton and indigo are said to have been successfully cultivated
 in the principality of Cintra, in Calabria, Nola, and other places
in Italy.      From the leaves of the latter plant, indigo of a qua
 lity not inferior to the American is asserted to have been ex
tracted.
     Dr. Adams     has in the press his long projected      work on the er
 roneous opinions and consequent terrors usually entertained con

 some remarks on the attempts at reducing cutaneous complaints
 to orders and classes, and the unnecessary revival of so great a
 number of exploded Greek terms..

     The Register Thermometer at Jones's, in Oxendon-street, on
 the night between the 9th and 10th, was at 7 degrees Fahrenheit;
 on the same night, at Petersham, it was at 2 degrees, which is
 the greatest cold we have had since between the 24th and 25 th of
 December 1798, when the Register in Tilney -street was at
zero; Sir George Shuckburgh's, in Park-street, 2 degrees below
zero; Mr. Cavendish's, at Clapham, 7 below — and near Maid->
stone, 1 1 or 12 below zero, which was the greatest cold ever ob
served in England,

  Meteorological Observations made at Clapton in Hackney,
       from December            17,   1813, to   January 19, 1814.
  Dec. 17-20, 1813. — The weather clouded for the most part,
the Thermometer generally above 40° in the day, with damp hazy
atmosphere and southwesterly winds.      On the night of the 20th
a frost set in, with Thermometer   24°.
   Dec. 21-25. — Damp atmosphere, a great deal of cloud, and
some rain during this period.
   Dec. 26. — Clear day, with tufts of cirrus and cooler air. Wind
northerly.
   Dec. 27 . — A very great change took place to-day; a thick
white stratus or fog, of such density as to prevent carriages from
finding their way, prevailed all day, and for a long period after
wards.
   Dec. 28. — Fog somewhat less, but very great.
   Dec. 29. — Fog denser in London, but rather less in the country.
   Dec. 30. — Fog so far cleared off in the country as to let the.
sun be seen through       but very dense in London.
                          it,
   Dec. 31.  —  Clearer in the middle of the day over-head, and
cirrus observed in tufts    dense fog at night.

    * This remarkable
                       fog, of so long continuance, appears by accounts to have
commenced earlier,   in   the southern and western parts of England than
in the northern and eastern. It was very partial at times, and often sud-
.denly abated and returned.        To speak of its nature in meteorological lan
 guage,I   should say
                    it   was a highly electrilied slrulqs, and was accompanied
 the whole time
                 by
                 a     gradually falling Barometer and an increasing frost.
   +  The Barometer began rising to-day, and continued to ri;c till the 11th;
 during all^the interval a very hard frost prevailed.     On the 1th the Baro

   Jan. 18. — Barom. 29.18 falling. Gale from N. with plenty

   Jan. 19. — The Barometer to-day was a long time stationary
at 29.14 ; towards night it rose; snow fell from north-east all
dav with some sleet.        The flakes were seldom large. The Ther
mometer about 30° and 32;l all day.            Wind in gales and high,
and thawing by degrees.
   During the previous part of this long and severe frost, there
have been very few sea-fowl observed about the marshes, which
were formerly so common in such weather ; nor have wild geese
been observed to go southward.           This circumstance suggests the
inquiry,  what   has  been  the  state  of the weather in northern parts
of our island. Any observations on this subject communicated
by northern meteorologists would be interesting.             I cannot omit
here mentioning another curious circumstance.                The greatest
haziness and fog known for ages before, is well remembered to
have prevailed the year of the last great eruption of Mount
Hecla ; the late great fog began the day of the present eruption
of Mount Vesuvius.

  XIX.    On the Use     of Air- Vessels in Plants.       By Mri.
                             Ibbetson.
Siks,— •Sir George Staunton observes, "that the leaf of the
Nymplicea Nelitmbo,  besides its common use, has from its peculiar
structure, growing entirely round the stalk, the advantage of de
fending the flowers and fruit within its centre from any contact
with the ivater, from whatever depth, (unless in case of a sudden
inundation,) until it attains the surface."       But this property is
common to all water plants. There are curious facts appertaining
to plants of this kind, well worth showing, since they are pheno
mena which serve as general rules in nature ; and to attain and
collect these, has, from the first of my dissecting plants, been my
most ardent desire ; especially as (in this case) they are never,
or very rarely varied from.       The fact which I now wish to prove,
 is the use which Nature makes of air-vessels in plants, while I
 attempt also to explain how air in general is received and placed
in them.      It was the universal opinion of all the physiologists of
the last age, that all plants have air-vessels : but dissection has
 convinced me that this is a mistake ; that when found, they are
 too large and beautiful not to be seen and acknowledged : but
 they are to be discovered in water- and semi-water plants alone.
  There is indeed a quantity of air mixed in the vessels of all ve
  getables, and from this circumstance arises that process which
  accelerates or retards the flow of the sap and other juices : the
  mixture of air in the sap-vessels is the source of the most won
  derful part of the formation of plants in general, since to that is
  owing the constant fluctuation which the heat or cold produces
  in the several vessels, filling and emptying them as the thermo
  meter rises or falls : thus, when the cool of the evening, or even
  a cold blast approaches, the air which nearly fills half the sap-
  vessels is condensed into a much smaller compass ; this causes
  a momentary vacuum, which opens the innumerable leaf-valves
  of the plant, and in succession those of the hairs, and admits a
  stream of rain or dew into the sap-vessels, which then being per
  fectly replenished, the returning sun as quickly converts into
  oxygen for the restoration of that purity of air so necessary to
  health; and carbonic acid gas, for the formation of the bark
 juices, and other combinations.           This process takes place in
   some measure, in water- as well as in land-plants : but with
   respect to real air-vessels, vessels Jilted with air alone; they ap
   pear, from all the dissections or study I have made on them, to
   be placed in the plants merely to support them in the water ;
   and to be fixed in different directions according to the attitude
   in which the vegetables are required to stand.      When the leaf is
   to lie on the stream in close contact with   it,  then the leaf-stem
      Vol. 43. No. 190. Feb. 1814.            F                increases

82              On the Use       of Air- Feshls in Plants.
  increases in length with the depth of the water, and it is wholly
  filled with air-vessels which sustain it in a perpendicular direction
 fo where the leaf begins, and it has a layer of air-vessels also un
 derneath the leaf, to support it on the stream, and keep its upper
 surface perfectly dry.      But when the plant is to be kept above a
 foot under water, the leaves lose their accompaniment of air-
  vessels under, and retain only those which surround the leaves,
 and a bubble at the apex and bottom of the midrib, which is
 increased or diminished according to the necessities of the plant
 for rising or falling in the stream.     But if leaves are to be main
 tained in a perpendicular direction in the water, then more art
 is used for the purpose, which I shall now show in describing the
 whole formation of a water-lily, or the Nympkcea lutea ; ob
 serving that the dissection is the same in all the species I have
 been able to procure for the purpose.
      That the water-lily has two sorts of leaves, is a fact, I believe,
 not known even to the Worthy Baronet who so well observed them
 in their native waters in China : that they wholly differ in thick
 ness, and in form, as they do also in the various uses for which
 they are designed, I shall now show.        The first I shall describe,
is that which swims on the water.         A double layer of air-vessel*
just covered by a skin perfectly impervious to water, forms its
lower surface, that which is in contact with the stream ; while
the upper one has a treble net, instead of pabulum, covered by a
double skin through whichnowater can pass. I have given a sketch
of the thickness of the leaf in (Plate 1 1 . fig. 1 .) that the difference
might be well understood, and the use of air-vessels fully exem
plified. I have said that the stem lengthened with the depth of the
water, but the air-vessels in the midrib stop with the commence
ment of the leaf, so that it liejs quite flat, and the upper surface
perfectly dry.       But the other leaf is of a very different descrip
tion: when the corolla has fallen off, and the seeds have dropped
from the receptacle, the pericarpium decays, and a new germ,
which is to contain the next year's fruit and flower, just peeps
above the mud, but is wholly covered with water.              This is sur
rounded     with  leaves  of a very peculiar form, flapped into a kind
of scollop at the edges ; they press the bud in every other part ;
while the apex of the midrib just keeps above the water, enabled
to do so by a large bubble of air which it encloses, and by all
the midrib being full of air-vessels : of course there are none
under the leaf, and fewer in the leaf-stalk; but the large opening
for air between the skins of the leaf, at the top scollop, keeps it
constantly upright.
   The (fig. 2.) will give an idea of the comparative thickness of
the leaf, while (A, fig.    and (B, fig. 2.) will show the shape of
                           1.)

   .mation, and the different mechanism of the two leaves, will point
    out the use of air-vessels.    The little influence the water has on
    the essential properties of the plant will be shown, since it in a
   very trifling degree alters either seed, flower, or fruit.          I gave
   before a letter on Water Plants *.      I then showed how the water
   grass, FeslucB.fluita.7is, is supported on the stream by the same
   means (a layer of air-vessels under the leaf) and that almost all
   water plants have two sorts of leaves ; 1st, floating ones to yield
   oxygen, and form the different compound juices required by the
   plant ; 2dly, the under leaves to support and invest              and for     it,
   many other purposes yet to be discovered          but in the Potamo-
                                                           ;
   getons, the lower leaves are too narrow to cover the bud, and this
 is   wholly left to the vails.    In the Potamogeton natans, when
   the water happens to dry up, the air-vessels                    by
                                                           degrees lose all
   their beauty; they contract in such        manner as soon to become
                                              a
   merely common vessels, and then the plant carries the appear
   ance of  a  Planlago.     Having found one last summer,            should      I
   not have known   it   to be a Potamogeton, but for the observation
   of Linneus, who had seen and mentioned the alterations that
  sometimes took place in the species.          This       remarkably the
                                                                is
  case in many of the semi-water plants, which, instead of decaying
  for the want of water, become land plants, by losing or contracting
  their vessels, particularly the Veronica Scutellaria, and some
  times the Beccabunga.
      The strange idea that water plants perspired,                 think    I              I
  should not here have shown to be false, as           flatter myself that
                                                            I

  dent to common sense, as to carry conviction to every breast that
  seeksit :   but as the mistake originated in land plants,         figures      by
   (which  in  reality resembled any thing rather than            bubble of  a
  water), and as water plants are almost divested of hairs, retorts,
  or any appearance resembling them,             itproper that

 detained   ;   the bubbles of oxygen, continually flowing from the
 leaves, are caught in its diminutive meshes         and the plant, thus
                                                           ;
 situated, appears covered with diamonds, which when swept off

     and watched them for hours, without seeing one bubble of water
     transpire, that I am well assured of the truth of the above fact;
     and that, when not covered by aCryptogmnia, the floating leaves
     are alien ys perfectly dry, which they could not be with the per
     spiration attributed to them.          I have said that the water plants
     have no hairs, that       is,  that none of the unhiclosed parts have
     any which appears to me to be
         ;                                       astrong proof of two facts                 I
     have much wished to establish; viz. that the hairs, and those in
     struments in general taken for perspiration, are on the contrary
     intended to hring moisture to the plants, instead of drawing                           li
     quid from them; and that there exists such a thing in vegetation
     as  a skin impervious to water, which covers all leaves and most
     other parts, and    is    of peculiar use to water plants.         These two
     points   are  of  great  importance   to  phytology.      I have  continually
     brought them forward in every specimen that gave proof of their
     existence and former evidence
                 ;                         is much added to, think,  I        what     by
.    follows.     Though leaves and the parts under water uncovered                          by
     vails, have no hairs, yet the flowers which shoot their spikes
     above, and the buds while thoroughly defended from the stream,
     have a few; and what            most curious, they are filled with water.
                                    is
     The bud before the flower develops               covered

     so thoroughly impervious to water, that one of them                   usuallyis
     inflated with air, that       it may more effectually guard the pollen,
     and prevent the introduction of moisture.            Assured that the hairs
     were never replenished from the plant, but that they gained their
    -liquid from the atmosphere alone, wished to try how hairs when
                                                I
     so situated, could obtain the water that inflated them                 taking:
     therefore two gjasses and placing them one within another, well
     guarded beiow from any moisture             bya thick luting, covered the
                                                                         I
     whole apparatus with water, and left              for the night
                                                      it                 when the
                                                                              ;
     next morning    1    found the interior of the inward glass strewed
     with pellicles of water enough to fill all the little hairy cylinders
     the buds contain    ;     showing that evaporation can pierce through
     a double glass.        There cannot be stronger proof that the hairs
                                                 a
     possess some peculiar power which enables them to draw mois
     ture from the atmosphere, than this.              Though that       gave in a
                                                                          I
     late letter, shows   it   is  not water alone that          procured in this

     the  luscious    red  juice produced     or concreted    in  them, may be
     traced afterwards entering the plant, and running in appropriate
     vessels even to the valves of the leaf.
         Having now shown all that concerned the leaves and air-vessels
     of the water plants,     I   wished to ascertain whether they differed
     from other plants in this respect; or whether, like them, they
     formed their seeds and buds in the root              To prove this, pro

 of these, an horizontal slice, I shall give a figure of. In the
centre of the root, buds will be discovered, and the seeds are im
bedded in the alburnum vessel next the bark (fig. 3. C, buds,)
and (fig. 3. D, seeds.)      I then divided the stem, and taking a
perpendicular piece down the middle, it presented me with the
line of life (mounting as it always does in small plants) in the
centre, with the buds attached to it ; (see fig. 4.)      To complete
the picture, I continued to cut to the top of the plant, and dis
covered the buds in a more advanced state, where they are first
collected, for the use of communicating to them the different in
gredients; their seeds and pollen (fig. 5.) which they had not
yet received, though so much formed in appearance; for both
stamens and seed-vessel were empty.           I never dissected a plant   '
more fitted to show every truth I wished to prove : 1st, that
water interferes less with the essential properties of a plant than
could be conceived ; that air-vessels are merely supporters ; 2dly,
that the  seed, bud, and pollen, are formed in the root in water
plants, and not in the seed-vessel and stamen ; 3dly, that there
is no perspiration in water- any more than in land-plants, though
the latter have few hairs ; 4thly, that there is an invisible skin,
which covers almost all vegetation, impervious to water; and that
the hairs receive their liquid from the atmosphere, and not from
the vegetables to which they belong.         As I enter into the mi
nutiae of the formation of plants, these facts become more evident,
and not a single vegetable do I dissect without their appearing
too positive to be doubted : there is a curious appearance around
the flowers of the plants of which I have given a specimen,
which I never saw before and cannot account for.            (See fig. 3.
and fig. 4. at K.)     I can at this time procure only the Potamo-
getons and the Ranunculus aquaticus, and the flower in them
has but just begun to form.        That the spiral is discovered in all
corollas, is a fact ; but to see it all round in this manner is novel,
and may, I hope, be the means of procuring further information.
    Shall I be pardoned for concluding this letter with breathing
a doubt respecting that account which Theophrastus gives, that
the Nymphcea Lotus sinks under water every night ? The very
great care Nature takes in all water plants, to defend them from
the element till after impregnation, is such, that I cannot believe
she would suddenly change her laws, merely to make one flower
of a system act in exact contradiction to a known principle.
All water plants rise above the stream to perform the impreg
nation of the seed ; and when the flower is under water, before
                                   F3                                  it

 it blows, it           with a treble vail to defend it from the in
                  is covered
 fluence of the element ; and this defence it loses not till after it
 has risen above the water.            All the species seem admirably to
 coincide in every particular.         We have a native in this country,
where the nights are colder in proportion.                  What reason, then,
                                              '
can possibly justify such a variation ?           Prosper Alpinus endeavours
 to prove   that  the  Nymphcea       Lotus    is   in every respect the same
as a common lily, and adds that they all equally sink at night.
 Now we know this to be a mistake, as not one of the species
flowering in England does so : but there is another reason that
makes me suppose the observation of Theophrastus unfounded ;
there is no mechanism to draw the plant hastily under the water.
 I have now for some years dissected plants, and I never yet saw
a purpose of any kind effected without a very visible means to
produce it. A stalk never bends, a leaf turns, or a corolla twists,
without the muscles presenting themselves in a proper way to
effect the purpose required.         If the interior of the stem had been
found   with   spirals  sufficient  to  raise or contract      it,
                                                                I   should have
credited the account.         The Ruppia maritima, which draws un
der the water soon after fructification          is   over, has a  stalk formed
with proper mechanism to act thus. In the Valisneria spiralis
there   isalso an evident proof of its being made to be drawn un
der the stream but even in these two plants, they remain above
                    ;
the water till after the fructification          is    past.   That the flower
closes at night, and lays its head on the water,           is   certainly true        ;
but this      also to take care of the stamen and pistil
             is                                                              the
                                                                            it   is
                                                                     is ;
general watchfulness of Nature to perfect that which                   to insure
the safety of the future seed, and even the lying down of the flower
   to prevent the dew from entering where the petals close, lest
it is
   should hurt and explode the pollen too early for, at    ;            acertain
time of its formation,         itbursts immediately on water getting
through the stamen, and becomes            (if   not ripe enough) quite in
capable   of  performing     its  part  in the    fructification of the seeds.
This very case seems to contradict the fact advanced                    byTheo
phrastus.    But  may   I  be  so  daring   as  to   hint that neither Greeks
nor Romans were very methodical            in    their accounts of the phae
nomena of nature        ?And though this famous Grecian               isthought
to be one of the most exact in whatever he records, yet his flesh-
consuming stove, which he says destroyed in forty days all but
the bones of the body laid in it, and turned to stone the shoes
and every other different material placed in that repository,
shows that he believed that which he never took the trouble to
investigate.     As to Pliny, he credited that stones brought forth
young   ; and   he  repeatedly mentions several sorts of firs that had
tap-roots   six  cubits  in length; though there      is     but one species of

 fir that has any tap-root, and that, being the deciduous Cyprus,
 and an American tree, could not be known to him.         I merely
 mention this, not to detract from these great authors, but as
lessening the certainty of the evidence when placed in opposition to
 a real law of nature, from which we have as yet seen no variation.
    Before I close this paper, I cannot but mention a circumstance,
though irrelevant to the subject, which proves, I hope, the accu
 racy of my observations in this respect, and has given me some
confidence in them, as agreeing with those of so distinguished a
philosopher as Mr. Leslie.        I observed in one of my letters last
year,  that  when  I placed    the  spiral wire suddenly in any degree
of heat, its motion was all by impulses ; whenever I breathed
upon     it,
           or exposed        to the focus of the solar microscope, its

 In    order to be able to determine the quantity of oxygen con~
 tained in alumina, I dissolved some of this earth, which had
 been precipitated from alum by caustic ammonia, in sulphuric
 acid ; and when the acid would take up no more of
                                                                     it,
                                                                       I   filtered
 the solution, concentrated       it     byevaporation, and precipitated the
 neutral salt from    it    by  the addition of alcohol.        The precipitate
 was    well  washed    with   alcohol,   in  order    to separate   any uncom-
 bined sulphuric       acid  which    might    accidentally   be  present.      The
 salt thus prepared       had   completely    the   taste of alum,  but  the   taste
  was much stronger.           In order to drive off the water,     I    heated   it
  in a platina crucible over      a    spirit lamp, and weighed the crucible
  from time to time     ;    when  it   lost no more of its weight,         I   con
  sidered    the   salt as  free  from   water.    It   melted,  swelled  up,    and
  exhibited    the  appearance       of alum  ;   at lastI  was  obliged   to  force
 it   down into the crucible, in order that the heat might be able
  to penetrate   it   uniformly.       The dry salt appeared not to be so
  luble in water, and in this respect resembled the dry sulphate of
   the protoxide of iron, the dry sulphate of magnesia, burnt alum,
   and other salts.       But with the assistance of heat         it  was    by   de
   grees completely      dissolved.
         ignited 10 grammes of this dry sulphate of alumina in
      I                                                                           a
   platina crucible, as long as they lost any weight from the extri
    cation of sulphurous acid they left behind 2.9934 gr. of
                                 ;                                          a   loose
    white  and  light  alumina.       This  salt,  the  dry sulphate   of alumina,
    must therefore consist of
                  Sulphuric acid . . 70.066                 100.000

       And if  42 722 parts of alumina contain 19.96 of oxygen, 100
     parts must contain 46.726.

                                                                                to

to separate the earth from alum by adding ammonia in excess.
But in this I could not succeed ; for, when I burnt the alumina
thus obtained, it always afforded first water, and then sulphurous
acid and oxygen gas.          Consequently alumina forms with the
sulphuric    acid   an insoluble subsalt, which is but imperfectly de
composed by       ammonia.
     I therefore took the alumina which had been freed from sul
phuric acid by complete ignition, dissolved it by long digestion
 in nitric acid, and precipitated it by adding to the solution caustic
 ammonia in excess.        The gelatinous earth was well washed on a
 filter, and slowly dried in the sun : when dry, it was rubbed to
 a fine powder, again digested with water, in order to separate the
 nitrate of ammonia, once more dried, and ignited in a small glass
 retort.    At first pure water was evolved, but it was followed by
  a quantity of nitrous acid vapours, which could only be com
  pletely expelled by a white heat.       Consequently the nitric acid
  possesses  the   same  property  as the  sulphuric, of affording with
  alumina a subsalt, which is not completely decomposed by am
  monia.     The subnitrate of alumina has a considerable resem
  blance to the gelatinous silica, or to a stiff decoction of starch,
  and is easily obtained by rubbing unburnt alumina with a little
  nitric acid : the mixture exhibits after a few moments an inflated
  starch-like mass.
      I now dissolved alumina in muriatic acid, precipitated it with
  ammonia in great excess, and digested the precipitate for six
  hours with the solution, which remained strongly alkaline.       The
  earth, when taken out of the filter, and well washed, was dried
  in the sun, finely powdered, and again exposed to the sun for a
  day.    When ignited in a small retort, it afforded nothing but
  water, although a small portion of the earth itself was carried up
   with the water, and was collected like a fine dust in the receiver.
   The loss was somewhat increased by this circumstance.
      This compound of water and alumina left 64.932 per cent.
   of earth, which, being dissolved in nitric acid, showed no signs
   of sulphuric acid when examined by the test of a salt of baryta.
   Consequently 100 parts of dry alumina had been united with 54
   of water: and this water contains 47-65 parts of oxygen : the
   alumina, on the other hand, as we have seen, contains only
   46.726. I cannot insist on the perfect accuracy of either of
   these determinations ; but both of them are sufficiently near to
   the truth, to show that alumina, like the bases of salts already
   mentioned, is capable of combining with a quantity of water of
   which the oxygen is equal to that of the earth.
       Alumina, after ignition, attracts moisture very rapidly from
   the air, but retains it with a slight force ; and the quantity de
   pends on the hygrometrical state of the air.          The warmth of
                                                                     the

 90                       On definite Proportions.
 the sun is sufficient to expel the greatest part of this water ; and
 if we  heat the alumina on a sand-bath, the whole of it is driven
off ;  while  the water in the true hydrate requires a red heat in
order to be expelled.            After some days, 100 parts of burnt
alumina had absorbed 34*5 of water in an atmosphere saturated
 with moisture, hygr. 100°. Of this water it lost in a few days
•18-5 parts, when the hygrometer stood at 7°, and the thermo
 meter from 22' to 25°' [72° to 77 '] ; and its weight then re
 mained stationary.         It may be questioned in what state of com
 bination this water was retained : certainly not in the same as in
 the hydrate.
                                 . 3. Silica.
    The silica, which      is separated by acids from the liquoY silicum,
contains,    after    being dried, as is well known, a considerable
quantity of water.          I found that it made no difference whether
 I employed silica that was precipitated at once, or that was first
separated in a gelatinous form.
    Three portions of. silica, which 1 had obtained by different
analytical operations, were dried in the same saucer on a sand-
bath.     When I ignited them after some hours' exposure to this
heat, they all lost a quantity of water, which varied from 11 -2 to
 II -3 per cent.
    The experiments upon the ignited alumina, and others upon
the oxide of tin, which I shall hereafter relate, determined me
to repeat these experiments at a subsequent time.                I found that
the oxide    of   tin, when dried in      different   temperatures, retained
different proportions of water.           I therefore weighed a portion of
silica dried in the open air, and dried it again in a sand heat ;
the loss amounted to 26-8 per cent.               Being left in the scale, its
weight   increased    by degrees.    J then   dried it again very thoroughly,
and ignited     it  ; and   I found  the   loss  14'2  per cent.    It formed
little transparent grains, which lost nothing of their transparency
nor of their form by ignition.          It seems, therefore, as if the water
retained by the silica were precisely in the same state as that
which ignited alumina absorbs from the air.
    I had entertained hopes of being able to calculate the quan
tity of oxygen in silica, from that of the water retained in
combination with it in a dry form ; and the agreement of the
three first experiments with each other made me, suppose, that
silica probably contains four times as much oxygen as the water
combined with it ; and in this case the quantity would be 45 per
cent.     But I no longer place any dependence on this mode of
determination.         It may perhaps be possible, at a future time, to
ascertain the composition of silica from its combinations with the
fluoric acid, or with the alkalis and the earths.
                                                                    4. Oxide

                           4. Oxide of Iron.
     The experiments of Mr. Lierlbeck have for some time made it
known in Sweden, that the yellow or brownish ore of iron called
Meadow ore, " Rasenerz," contains the oxide in the form of a
hydrate.       My friend Mr. Hausmann of Cassel [now Professor
of Technology at Gottingen, G.] wrote to me some months since
that he had made the same remark, and had found from 19 to
2 1 per cent. of water in this tiydrate, but considered the former
number as the more correct.        In this case the water would con
tain a quantity of oxygen amounting to two-thirds of that of the
oxide of iron, or the water would contain as much oxygen as had
been required for converting the given quantity of iron into a
protoxide.      Although this does not agree with the laws which
have been laid down, it is evident that this latter view of the
subject may lead to very instructive consequences ; and I wa*
induced by it to add to these investigations the examination of
the hydrate of the oxide of iron.
     Mr. Liedbeck had found, in the ores which he examined,
20'8, 21*1, or 25 per cent. of volatile substances, of which water
constituted about 20.      Together with the oxide of iron, he found
mechanical mixtures of sand, clay, silica, and so forth, which
being deducted from the oxide, left from 60 to 62 per cent. only:
and this portion of pure oxide contains as much oxygen as the
water combined with it.
     I now examined some foreign specimens of this ore, and found
in it 14.4, 13-1, 11*6, . . . per cent. of water, accordingly as the
ore was dried in the sun, or in a sand heat.        The ore was not
magnetic before ignition, but became more or less so after igni- \
tion. Hence it must have contained a little combustible matter,
which must have increased the loss by ignition.      When the oxide
was dissolved, after ignition, in muriatic acid, it left behind a
little silica, swollen up into a semi-gelatinous form, which conse
quently appeared to have been chemically united with the oxide.
 But the admixture of foreign substances was such as to render it
impossible to determine the composition of this triple combina
tion of water, silica, and oxide of iron, with so much precision,
that the result might be of the least utility as a basis for calcu
 lation.
     I now examined the yellow mass which is formed on weather
 ing pyrites, and which I had often found to be free from sulphuric
 acid.     The specimen taken from one piece lost during ignition
  1 7'5 per cent.; from another 12 only.       Both contained silica,
 and the first I afterwards found to exhibit traces of copper.
      I then prepared some hydrates of iron, by decomposing the
 julphate, the nitrate, and the muriate of the oxide, with caustic
                                                           ammonia.

92                        On definite Proportions.
ammonia.        All these solutions afforded however a mixture of
hydrate and subsalt, from which heat expelled first some water,
and then some of the acid.             The ignited hydrate lost in these
experiments     from   27   to  18.5  per cent.
   I next digested      the  precipitate obtained from the nitrate with
a great excess of caustic ammonia.            The hydrate, when washed,
and dried in the sunshine, now lost 22*15 percent.: the fluid
which escaped, was not pure water, but a strongly ammoniacal
fluid. I had not therefore yet obtained a pure hydrate.
   Two years and a half before, when I was examining the iron
which contained silicium, I had left about 20 grammes of this
iron, moistened with water, to oxidate spontaneously.               But the
mass assumed by degrees a solid consistency, and . even after the
expiration of this time, was not completely oxidated throughout
its substance.        Not being able therefore to employ it for the
analysis   of  silica,   as I originally intended, I collected and dried
a quantity of the yellow ochre that was formed on it : but acci
dentally this substance was placed, with others that were to be
dried, in a sand heat, and here in all probability lost a part of
the water that was chemically combined with it ; for the hydrate*
of iron support but little heat, without assuming a darker colour,
and losing part of their water.              By ignition, its weight was
further   diminished'     10 per cent.      The  red oxide that was left
contained 8-2 per cent. of silica.          I was therefore working again
upon a triple combination of silica, oxide of iron, and water.
The quantity, which I had to employ for this experiment, was
too small ; and was already consumed, so that I could not ex
amine this preparation of iron with greater accuracy : but it was
evidently an artificial combination resembling the foreign ore
which I have already mentioned.             This ore will undoubtedly be
come the subject of further investigation, and the comparative
analysis of the artificial triple combination, obtained by the oxi
dation of iron containing silicium, will perhaps be indispensable ;
for the ore is mixed in various and inconstant proportions with
dust, and with different earthy substances, so that it can afford
no certain results.
    It is also obvious from what has been related, that it it diffi
cult to obtain a perfectly pure hydrate of iron, since the oxide
combines, at the moment of precipitation, as well with acids as
with ammonia, according to the degree of excess in which this
alkali is present.      1 therefore allowed some iron filings to be oxi
dated in pure water, which I changed daily, and collected the
hydrate.      After some weeks I had obtained enough for an ex
periment on a small scale.           I dried it in the sunshine for several
days,    and  then   ignited   it in a platina crucible.   It left 85-2 per
cent. of red oxide, which was partially magnetic ; a circumstance
                                                                      which

                          On definite Proportions.                      93
which     I attribute to some carbon contained in the iron, which
was mixed with the hydrate.            This quantity of oxide contains
26.12 parts of oxygen, and the water combined with it 13 parts.
Consequently in this experiment the oxide contained twice as
much oxygen as the water.
    But in order that this proportion might have more than a single
experiment for its support, I took some iron which contained
less carbon, choosing for this purpose some harpsichord wire,
n. 10 ; I suffered it to be oxidated in pure water, which was daily
changed, in contact with a plate of platina, which accelerated the
oxidation.       After some weeks, I had again collected enough for
examination.        This hydrate, dried for several days in the sun
shine, had a very light orange yellow colour, and left after igni
tion a fine red oxide, not at all magnetic, which amounted to
85 .5 per cent.        Consequently in this experiment the hydrate
had contained 14*5 per cent. of water, which confirms the pre
ceding experiment ; and we see that the hydrate of iron, which
forms on iron in water, contains a quantity of water of which
the oxygen is equal to half that of the oxide.             It is however
probable, as well from Mr. Liedbeck's experiments, as from
others which will hereafter be mentioned, that the oxide of iron,
when in combination with other substances, is capable of taking
 up a quantity^of water, of which the oxygen is equal to that of
 the oxide.
                             5.  Oxide   of Tin.
    Ten grammes of pure tinfoil were oxidated in a glass flask by
 means of pure nitric acid; the fluid was evaporated, and the
 oxide ignited in the flask.      It was of a light straw colour, and
 weighed 12.72 gr.      In another  experiment I obtained only 12.71 gr.
 According to the former experiment, the oxide of tin consists of
                  Tin                  [78'62]       100.0
                  Oxygen               [21'38]        27-2
     It is a known fact that oxide     of tin, prepared with nitric acid,
 reddens litmus paper, but not after ignition.          I thought at first
 that this might depend on some nitric acid adhering to it ; but
 when the water, with which it was washed, no longer reddened
 the paper, the oxide still possessed the property.            It was only
 deprived of it by pouring on it a little ammonia ; but the oxide
 now afforded, when ignited, water strongly impregnated with
 ammonia.         The oxide of tin therefore has as much right to the
 denomination of an acid as the tungstic acid, and the columbic
  acid, or rather the " tantalic" oxide.
                                             '
     I dried some oxide of tin, which had been well washed, but
 not treated with ammonia, in a sand heat.            It lost by ignition
 S'6 per cent. After some hours, when the sand-bath was con
                                                                  siderably

 94                        On definite Proportions.
 liderably colder, I repeated the experiment with a part of thrf
 lame oxide, which had remained on the sand.             It now lost 9'66
 per  cent.:   another  portion,   left for a longer time, lost 10-8 per
 cent. by ignition,    and  the next morning, when every thing had
 been completely cold for some hours, the ioss amounted to 1 2*5 per
 cent. ; the weather being in the mean time very damp and rainy,
 It is impossible to determine which of these experiments ought
 to be preferred : and although this oxide, which approaches so
 nearly to the ^acids in its nature, when it retains the greatest
 portion of water, contains itself nearly twice as much oxygen as
 this water, still we can form no very decided conclusion from this
 circumstance.
    It may be hoped that similar experiments on the water contain
 ed in the oxides of titanium and tantalium, on the tungstic acid,
 and other similar substances, will lead us to a more general and
 decided knowledge of the relation of water to these bodies, which
 occupy a middle rank between acids and bases.
    But what are we to think of the attraction of a body for water,
 which retains this fluid so slightly as to be overpowered by its ex
pansive force at a moderate temperature ?          It must manifestly be
the same power that causes filtering paper to attract moisture
from the atmosphere, and sometimes to become heavier even
during the operation of weighiug            it,
                                              and that exhibits the well
known effects of hygroscopical substances. Whether this force
diifers only in degree from that which           characterized
                                                  is            by  regu
larly denned relations between the bodies that are united, or
whether   it  merely consists in      modification of superficial attrac
                                      a
tion,' do not venture to decide. With respect to the modifica
      I
tions of the force of elective attractions, there still remains much
for us to investigate  ;  for example, in what the force which causes
a  salt to be dissolved in water, in quantities dependent on the
temperatures, differs from the force         by
                                              which the same salt     ca
                                                                     is
pable of rendering solid a greater or less quantity of water of
crystallization.    Between these quantities there        no determinate
                                                           is
and unalterable relation     ;  for salts, which contain no water of
crystallization at all, may be very soluble in water, for example,
nitre, and muriate of potass while others, which contain
                                 ;                              it   very
abundantly, are completely insoluble, as, for example, subsalti
of iron and copper, carbonate of magnesia, and some others.

gives   off in the operation oxygen gas, nitrous acid, and lastly
 nitrous gas, but does not afford a. drop of liquid acid.      The tar
trate of potass, precipitated with nitrate of the protoxide of lead,
afforded, for 100 parts of the well dried salt, 155-7 of tartrate
of the protoxide of lead. Consequently, according to the ana
lysis of this salt lately related, the tartrate of potass consists of
                  Tartaric acid . . 58.69         100 0

    Now 70-4 parts of potass contain 11.93 of oxygen, that           is,
 with   avery slight difference, the same quantity as the protoxide
of lead that saturates 100 parts of the acid. The slight difference
 may depend on the unavoidable loss of        a  small quantity of tar
trate of leid in the experiment.        Hence it   isevident, that the
tartrate of potass can contain no water of crystallization.
    The supertartrate of potass, on the contrary, or the crystal*
of tartar, contains water of crystallization, which cannot be ex
pelled      by
            heat.   The salt employed for the preceding experiment
had been made of pure tartaric acid with pure carbonate of po
 tass, and was therefore perfectly free from lime.      I  precipitated
the remaining portion of   it   with tartaric acid, I  dried very care
fully the powdered precipitate, and burnt 10 grammes of        it   in
                                                                     a
platina crucible.     The coaly alkaline mass was carefully washed
with muriatic acid,the muriatic solution dried, and the salt ignited.
I  obtained in one experiment 3.91, and in another 3.915 gr. of
muriate of potass.     I found  by  another experiment, as Wollaston
had already observed with respect to the oxalic acid, that the re
siduum of 10 gr. of supertartrate of potass, after ignition, was
sufficient to saturate 10 gr. of the supersalt     : so that the potass
must be combined with twice as much acid in the supersalt as         in
the neutral salt.    But the muriate, which was obtained, answers
precisely to 24.8 per cent. of pure potass, which must conse
quently form the superacetate with 70.45 of tartaric acid, and
the remaining 4.75 parts must be water.        Hence the superacetate
of potass consists of
                        Tartaric acid .   . 70.45

    This quantity of potass  contains   4.206, and the water 4.192
parts  of  oxygen;   consequently   the  water   of crystallization in
this salt contains exactly as much oxygen as the base. But since
this water can only be expelled       the addition of a second base,
                                     by
and  is exactly the same quantity as would have been combinecT
with the excess of acid in a separate form of crystallization, this
salt may be considered as   a  double salt, of which water      is  the
second base.
                                                                 Salts

                    While, according to the experiments which
     Salt •> of soda.
are here related, the salts of potass seem in general to be with
out water of crystallization, those of soda on the other hand con
tain it in abundance, but retain it with a very slight attraction,
so that the greater number of them fall to powder in a dry at
mosphere.     Hence it is very difficult to obtain accurate results
with respect to them, since it may easily happen, that such a
salt may begin to crumble away at the surface, before it is dry in
the middle.
    Sulphate of soda, in pure crystals, was washed with water,
pulverised, and in great measure separated again from the water
on blotting paper, then dried in a press for twenty-four hours,
between several folds of fresh blotting paper, and lastly dried
again by slow degrees, and then ignited, in a platina crucible.
In this process 30 grammes lost 16.8 in weight; consequently
the salt contains 56 per cent, of water of crystallization,       and
must consist of
                      Sulphuric acid . . . 24.76

water 49.42 ; so that in this salt the water of crystallization
contains exactly ten times as much oxygen as the base.
    Acetate of soda.       Ten grammes of acetate of soda, pow
dered, and dried in the open air, when exposed to the heat of a

 Five grammes of the acetate which had crumbled to dust, when

will only be possible to undertake the difficult task of discovering
perfectly correct numerical expressions for these proportions, with

    Sulphate of ammonia.             I had mixed 10 grammes of dry sul
phate   of  ammonia       with   30   gr. of caustic lime in a small glass
retort, and then completely filled up the bulb and tbe neck of
the retort with lime.         I fitted to the mouth of the retort a small
glass tube filled with caustic potass, and then heated the bulb
slowly till it was completely ignited. When no more ammoniacal
gas escaped through the opening of the tube, I withdrew the
heat : the apparatus, when cold, had lost 2*26 gr. of its weight.
In another experiment it lost only 2*25 gr. Now since the am
monia must saturate a quantity of sulphuric acid which contains
three times as much oxygen as itself, this salt must consist of
                     '
                       Sulphuric acid                   53*1

                       Water                            243
   This quantity of water contains 21*444 of oxygen, and the
ammonia, according to my determination,                  10-G- and 10 6    x 2 =
21.2.
    In these   experiments       it   is very difficult   to drive out the am
monia completely, for a small portion of it almost always re
mains in the water which is condensed in the lime and the po
tass.    But we see from the experiment, that in this salt the water
of crystallization contains twice          as much oxygen as the base.
    The oxalate     of   ammonia      exhibits the singular spectacle of an
ammoniacal salt falling to powder.                According to some former
experiments, the       loss  of weight during this efflorescence should
 amount to 16 percent.             But in several experiments I never ob
tained a greater diminution than 13*75 per cent.                    If now 100
parts of oxalic acid saturate a base which contains 21*2 parts of
oxygen, the salt must be thus constituted :
                         Oxalic acid              59-37
                        Ammonia                   26*88
                        Water                      13-75
    This quantity of ammonia contains 12-586 of oxygen, and the
 water 12-134.        We may therefore assume it as demonstrated,
 that the base and the water of crystallization in this salt contain
 equal quantities of oxygen.              The variation certainly depends
 only on some slight errors in the experiments.
    Muriate of baiyla.             Seventeen grammes of finely powdered
 muriate of baryta, dried in the shade, lost 2-505 gr. of their
 weight, when ignited in a platiua crucible.                  Consequently the
 crystallized  salt consists    of
                       -Muriatic acid               23*349
                        Baryta..                    61-852

                            On definite Proportions.                  99
    This quantity of baryta contains 6-495, and the water 13.05
parts of oxygen.         But 6-495 x 2 = 12.99.      The water of cry
stallization in this salt contains therefore twice as much oxygen
as the base.
    Sulphate of lime.       From the analysis of oystallized gypsum,
described by Bucholz, we know that it is composed of the fol
lowing parts    :                                                      ,  .
                         Sulphuric acid ....    46

                         Water                  21
  . This quantity of lime contains 9.29 of oxygen,        and the water.
 18.53.     Now 9.29 x 2= 1S.58.        Consequently the water in this
salt contains twice as much oxygen as the base.
    Muriate of lime. I had collected and put by some years
ago a quantity of fine crystals of muriate of lime.            I pounded
them quickly, and dried them between many folds of blotting
paper, several times changed, in a press, until the salt communi
 cated no more moisture to the paper.          I weighed 10 grammes
 of the salt thus dried, in a well-stopped glass flask, then heated
 them in the same flask open, and lastly ignited them.           The salt
 had lost 49-603 per cent. of its weight.      The crystallized muriate
 of lime is therefore thus constituted :
                      Muriatic acid   ....    24-686
                      Lime                    25-711
                      Water                   49*603
     Now 49-603 parts of water contain 43-774 of oxygen, and
^5*711 of lime, 7-24 ; and 7*24 x 6 = 43-44.            It is easy to see
 that a small excess of water could not here be avoided.            Con
 sequently the water of crystallization contains six times as much
 oxygen    as the lime.
     Sulphate of the protoxide of iron. Ten grammes of the sul
  phate of the protoxide of iron were very strongly heated in a glass
  retort, but not raised to a red heat : they lost 45*4 gr. of water.
  This salt consists therefore of
                      Sulphuric acid             2S-9
                      Protoxide of iron  ....    25 - 7
                      Water                      45-4
     The oxygen of the water amounts to 40*16, and that of the
  protoxide to 5*8; and 5-8 x 7 = 40.6.         Hence we see that the
  water of crystallization of this salt contains seven times as much
  oxygen as the base.
     Sulphate of the protoxide of zinc. Ten grammes of this
  salt, being heated over a spirit lamp in a platina crucible, lost
  36-45 per cent.      But since the dry salt consists of 49-52 parts
                                   G  2                                  of

 of sulphuric acid and 50*48 of the base, it contains, when «ry-

                       Water                      36.450
    The ba-<e contains 6*39, arid the water 32' 15 parts of oxygen;
 but 6-39 x 5 = 31.95 : consequently the water contains five time*
 as much oxygen as the base.
     Sulphate of the oxide of copper.           Ten grammes of this salt
 in crystals lost,  when    dried to  a powder over a spirit lamp, 36-3
 per cent. in weight.        The crystallized sulphate of the oxide of
 copper consists therefore of
                       Sulphuric acid     ....     31-57
                       Oxide of copper      . . .  32.13
                       Water                ; . .   36.30
since, according     to the  corrected analysis    of  the sulphate of baryta,
 5 grammes of the sulphate of copper consist of 2.477 gr. or 49.55
 per cent. of sulphuric acid, and 50.45 percent, of oxide of cop
 per, or 101.82 parts of oxide of copper for 100 of sulphuric acid.
 The oxygen of the oxide of copper, being computed at 24.5 per
 cent. amounts to 6.32, and that of the water to 32 : but
 6.32 X 5 = 31.6 ; so that the water of crystallization contains
                                   as the base.                                .
five times   as much oxygen
     Nitrate of the protoxide of bismuth.             Ten grammes of this
 salt, crystallized, and dried in the air after being powdered, were
 heated in a small retort to complete ignition.              They afforded in
 one experiment 5-13, and in another 5.12 grammes of liquid
 nitric acid, not smoking.        Consequently this salt must contain
 more water than i* sufficient to exhibit the acid in its highest
 state of concentration.        According to the very accurate experi
 ments of Mr. Lagerhjelm, the protoxide of bismuth contains
  10. 13 per cent, of oxygen; 48.8 parts must therefore contain
 4-9434, and must consequently saturate 33.7 parts of nitric acid,
 [since 100 parts of nitric acid suppose 14$ of oxygen in the basa
 which saturates them. G.]            The remaining 17-5 parts, which
 make up the 100, must have been water.                    But these contain
  15*4 of oxygen; and 4-9434 x 3 = 14-83.                  We see therefore
that, according to this experiment, which cannot be very accurate,
from the readiness with which the atmospherical moisture de
composes the salt, the water of crystallization must contain three
 times as much oxygen as the base.
                                 Conclusions.
    I consider   these examples, for     which    salts of so different na
tures have     been selected, as     sufficient to demonstrate the law,
that   " the oxygen of the water of crystallization is always an in
                                                                        tegral

 tegral multiple, or, as in the cases of the citric acid, and the
 eubcarbonate of the oxide of copper, an integral submultiple of
  the oxvgen of the base."                                           • i
     If we compare the oxygen of the water of crystallization with
 that of the acid, we do not always find the same law observed :
 thus, in the sulphate of soda, for example, the oxygen of the wa
 ter of crystallization is to that of the acid as 3.£ to 1 , and in the
 sulphate of ammonia it is           f
                                  of that of the acid.    Hence I have
 been led to the following rule : " In combinations of several oxy
 genized bodies, the oxygen of the component part, which con
 tains the least of      it, an aliquot part of that of each of the
                               is
 other component parts."
    But may not we discover, in combinations of this kind,         pre   a
valent component part, of the oxygen of which, although its
 quantity may not be the smallest, that of the other parts most
 be multiples or submultiples                If,
                                         for example, in a subsalt, the
                                         ?
 acid contained one-third, and the water half as much oxygen as
 the base, the oxygen of the two former would stand in a regular
 relation to that     of
                       the latter, which might be regarded as the
 prevalent component part          but the oxygen of the water would
                                     ;
 not be   a  multiple of that  of the acid, which in this case would be
 the least of the three.      Among the few substances which have       I
bad occasion to examine,            have met with no instance of this
                                         1
kind but
      ;        itdoes not follow,that the latter view may not be a cor
rect one.     Since however every combination depends on the whole
tum of the attractions of each of its component parts, the former
mode of representation appears to me to be the more probable.
  1    confess that we have at present too little experience to be
able to set up such inferences as demonstrated laws.         But we are
obliged to adopt them at least as temporary suggestions,          order in
to our advancement towards a more certain theory              and  :am   I
convinced that all the opinions which           have here expressed will
                                                     I
in general be confirmed as truths           although they may require
                                                ;
numerous corrections, in proportion as more and more of the in
finity of matter, which has hitherto eluded our researches, shall

bustibles contain the element of light, which I have been induced
to call photogen to avoid the use of ambiguous terms ; and all
those bodies, which are called supporters of combustion, contain
the generator of heat, called thermogen for the same reason *.
    These elements may be made to unite and produce combustion^
or increase the temperature of bodies, by various means, as, : 1st,
by friction ; 2dly, by percussion ; 3dlv, by pressure ; 4thly, by
mixture ; 5thly, by increase of temperature ; and 6thly, by the
functions of living animals and vegetables.
    Thermogen and photogen in a condensed state, as in a charged
Levden jar, have so strong an attraction for each other, that they
will pass through any of those bodies called conductors, to a very
great distance, to be united.     But, when they are united to pon
derable matter, they will remain mixed together for ages without
producing any effect ; but as soon as they are brought within a
 certain distance of each other, which may be called their striking
 distance or their sphere of action, either combustion takes place,
 or the temperature of the body, in which they meet, is increased.
    The following explanations of some well known experiments
 will tend to show the importance of a theory founded on facts.
     Experiment 1 . In a Memoir read to the National Institute of
 France, M. Biot announces the important fact, that a mixture
 of hydrogen and oxygen gases may be made to explode by me
 chanical compression only, independently of the electric spark.

 mixed together, for any length of time, without combining, the
 thermogen and photogen which they contain being kept at too
 great a distance by their bases ; but by mechanical compression
 only, they are forced within their striking distance, and light and
 heat are produced on the same principle as combustion is pro
 duced by discharging a Leyden jar.
     Experiment 2. *f Take six grains of oxygenized muriate of
 potass, and three grains of flour of sulphur, rub them together in
  a mortar, and a smart detonating noise will be produced,      Con
 tinue to rub the mixture hard, and the report will be frequently re
  peated, accompanied with vivid flashes of light.       If the same
  mixture be wrapped in paper, laid on an anvil, and smartly struck
  with a hammer, the report will be as loud as what is usually pro
  duced by a pistol."               i
      Explanation.    These  experiments may be explained on the
  same principle   as the last.   The two ingredients, though mixed
  together, produced no effect until the thermogen in one of them
  and the phptogen in the other were forced into union, by friction
  or percussion.    And on the same principle the effects of many
  other fulminating substances may be explained.

     Experiment 3. " If an ounce of strong nitrous acid be mixed
with about half its weight of sulphuric acid, and poured into a
little oil of turpentine, the whole will immediately burst into
flame."
     Explanation.    The thermogen and photogen contained in
these fluids coming immediately into contact, flame is produced
instantaneously, without any mechanical force or increase of
temperature.
     Now, from this experiment it appears impossible that water
should be a compound of oxygen and hydrogen ; for, if it were,
these two principles of combustion would burst into flame like
the acid and the oil.     But no pressure, no increase of tempera
ture, nor any union with combustible matter, can produce a sin
gle spark of fire from water.       In short, nothing combustible is
 found in its composition.
      Experiment 4. Combustion may also be generated by friction.
 Two pieces of hard wood, being smartly rubbed together .with
 great pressure, will soon burst into flame.
      Explanation.   The first increment of caloric, by friction, Is
excited by a portion of the thermogen of the air being forced into
 union with the photogen in the wood ; and by continuing the
 operation, the temperature of the inflammable principle of the
 wood is increased till flame is produced.
      Experiment 5 . When a rod of iron is laid upon an anvil and
 hammered with a quick succession of heavy strokes, it soon be
 comes red hot ; but it cannot be strongly heated a second time
 by the same means, unless it has been previously introduced into
  a fire.
      Explanation.    The first stroke of the hammer forces a small
  portion of the thermogen of the air into contact with the pho
 togen of the metal, which generates the first increment of caloric;
 and b\ repeated strokes of the hammer the caloric is increased,
  till the rod becomes red hot.      But the photogen of the metal
  becomes exhausted by this means, and cannot, therefore, pro
  duce caloric a second time, till it has recovered its combustible
  property in the fire.
      The burning of ison wire in oxygen gas shows, in a very bril
  liant manner, how iron loses its photogen and becomes oxidized.
      Experiment 6. " Mr. Thomas Wedgwood has shown that it
  has never yet been explained how friction produces caloric.
      " He took a piece of common window glass, and held the edge
  of it against the edge of a revolving grit-stone, and that part in.
  contact with the stone became red hot, and threw off hot parti
   cles which fired gun-powder.       The stone and the glass being
  both incombustible substances, it remains to be explained how
   ealoric was produced." — Philosophical Transactions for 1792.

104             New Outlines     of Chemical Philosophy.
    Explanation.      It has been shown in a former paper, that the
electric machine creates nothing, but by friction only it collects
the two elements which produce caloric from the earth and
the atmosphere.         Although the stone and the glass, in Mr,
Wedgwood's experiment, are both incombustible ; yet it is almost
a self-evident conclusion, that they collected the two elements of
caloric from the air and the earth by friction in the same manner
as the electric machine.
    If this explanation be not sufficiently conclusive, let two small
pieces of plate-glass be rubbed together for a short time, and they
will show electrical phaenomena,        The two pieces of glass being.
incombustible, the elements which produce those phaenomena
must come from the earth and the atmosphere.               This experi.r
ment is sufficient to show us haw combustion was produced by
the pressure of the glass upon the grit-stone when it was revolv-.
ing with great velocity.
    Experiment 7.
                         " It is well known, that when flint and steel
are smartly struck against each other, a spark always makes its
appearance, which is capable of setting fire to tinder or to gun
powder.      The spark in this case, as was long ago ascertained by
Dr. Hooke, is a small particle of the iron, which is driven off,
and catches fire during its passage through the air.       This, there-
fore, and all similar cases, belongs to the class of combustion.
But light often makes its appearance when two bodies are struck
against each other, when we are certain that no such thing as
combustion can happen, because both the bodies are incombustii
ble.     Thus, for instance, sparks are emitted when two quartz
stones are struck smartly against each other, and light is emitted
when they are rubbed against each other.               Many other hard
stones also emit sparks in the same circumstances.
    If they be often made to emit sparks above a sheet of white
paper, there are found upon it a number of small black bodies,
not very unlike the eggs of flies.        These bodies are hard but
friable, and when rubbed on the paper leave a black stain.
When viewed with a microscope, they seem to have been melted.
 Muriatic acid changes their colour to a green, as it does that of
lavas.     These substances evidently produced the sparks by being
 heated red hot*.
     Explanation.      It may be necessarv to observe, in the first
 place, that if the flint be moved over the steel very sjowly, no
 spark will be produced, nor will any spark appear if the flint
 barely touches the steel, although the velocity of the flint be the
 greatest possible : consequently caloric cannot be produced by
 collision or friction, but by velocity and pressure conjointly.

    Secondly, by the collision of the flint and steel, the thermogen
of the atmosphere is forced into union with the photogen of the
metal.      The combustion thus produced, melts the minute par
ticles of steel struck off by the flint into small globules.              That
this metal contains the generator of light is well known, by the
burning of iron or steel wire in oxygen gas.
    Sparks are emitted when two quartz stones are struck smartly
against each other under water; and Mr. Kirwan affirms, that
sparks are produced by the collision of flint and steel under com
mon spring water.
    That sparks are produced by the collision of flint and steel un
der water, I have no doubt, since water is a belter conductor of
thermogen and photogen than atmospheric air.                  And the sparks
so produced, being intensely hot, cannot be extinguished by the
water* as soon as they are generated.
    Experiment 8, From Count Rumford's experiments it ap
pears, that by a moderate degree of friction the same piece of
metal afforded so much caloric under water as to keep it boil
ing. — Phil. Trans. for 1/9S.
    This experiment may be explained on the same principle as
the last.     Water, being a better conductor of thermogen than
atmospheric uir, cannot prevent the production of caloric by th«
collision or friction of hard bodies,

 XXII,      O72 Sir H. C. Englefield's new Transit Instrument.
                      By the Rev. James Grooby.
                                                  Cirencester, Feb. 4, 1814.
           O N receiving      your last Magazine, I was not a little sur
prised   to  see in  the   new  Transit Instrument there described, the
 exact representation of one I had thought of more than three
 years ago ; a drawing and description of which I then sent to
 Mr. Banks, astronomical instrument-maker, &c. Strand, request
 ing him to make me a transit upon that plan, unless he saw very
good reasons to suppose it would not answer.                He wrote to me
in return, that he had well considered my plan, had shown it to
several scientific gentlemen (among whom he particularly men
tioned Mr. Pond, the present astronomer royal), that they had
 all pronounced such a construction of the instrument useless,
 and he therefore by all means recommended one on the old plan,
 and not to put myself to a needless expense about an instrument

that never could answer the purposes for which it was intended.
Not content with this rejection in tola, without any particular
fault being pointed out, and seeing Mr. B. so prejudiced against
it, I determined to attempt the constructing of it myself ; and,
rude as my instrument was, its performance convinced me that
it had not merited the unqualified censure that had been passed
•upon it.   Since that time, I have been procuring glasses, &c. for
a more perfect essay on a larger scale ; and it is something ex
traordinary that Mr. T. Jones himself, about a month ago, fur
nished me with the apparatus for adjusting the wires, but with
out my mentioning to him the instrument it was intended for.
That Sir H. C. Englefield was one among the scientific gentle
men to whom my plan was shown by Mr. Banks, or that he got
the hint from it in any other way, I cannot for a moment sup
 pose, since he has mentioned the source from whence he derived
his idea.    It must however be considered as a very extraordinary
 instance of the same thought occurring to two individuals at
 nearly the same time ; and certainly Sir Henry, in meeting with
 a person so competent to realise his idea, has been more fortunate
than I. From the little experience I have had with the home
 made instrument above mentioned, I am convinced that, when
properly constructed, it is capable of the greatest possible accu
 racy.    By having two marks, one to the north or south, and the
 other to the east or west, the position of the instrument may at
^all times be ascertained, as 'nearly as it is possible to place those
 marks at right angles to each other ; and if the northern or
 southern mark be bisected by the central wire at the instant of
  observation (as it always ought to be), such observation must be
 as perfect as the power of vision in the instrument to distinguish
 when the object and wires are in contact.         Nor will it be found
 impossible,  when   the  object-glass is pretty large, to observe stars
 in the day-time.        I had at first intended to subjoin a few
  observations, to show how far it was capable of being used
  by day ; but as I have sent the glasses, &c. to Mr. Jones to be
 fitted up by him in a rather more accurate manner than I had
 -been capable of doing, and as I expect to find it much improved
  thereby, I shall defer it to a future opportunity.

Sirs, — 1 beg leave to present you with the following solution
to the question proposed by Sir H. C. Englefield, Bart. F.R.S.
F.A.S. &c. in the last number of your most excellent Magazine ;
and at the same time take the liberty to remark, that in the stating
of the question I think a small typographical error has crept;
for the two last, read the, two first (1 1th line, page 64).
    All numbers under a million must consist of six figures or less,
and consequently the cube roots of all such numbers must con
tain two figures or less.          In numbers whose roots have only one
figure, no difficulty can be found, as their roots can be obtained
from simple inspection : the remaining case is then that of such
 cubes that their roots may contain two digits.                  In order to ob
 tain     the   first digit, from    the  given  number     of figures subtract
 three, and of the remaining figures we by the supposition know
 the two first, and thus we obtain a number consisting of either
 one, two, or three digits : the nearest root of this number may
 be immediately found by simple inspection ; and that root will
be the first digit of the number required.
     The second digit of the root may be obtained by considering
 that all numbers must end either in 0, or in some of the nine
 digits: now the cubes of these digits are respectively 0, 1, 8, 27,
 64, 125, 216, 343, 512 and 729 ; therefore the cubes of all num
 bers ending in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, must terminate in 0,
  1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, or 9.        From this consideration it is evident,
 that knowing the terminal digit of any cube, we can immediately
 by inspection determine that of the root, and thus the first digit
  being before found, we obtain the root itself.
      Thus, in the example the learned Baronet has given : from the
  given number of figures (6) subtract three, and three will re
  main ; we therefore, affix a cypher to the two given figures 43,
  and obtain 430, whose nearest root is 7.                The terminal figure
  being 6, we find that the last figure of the root must also be 6 ;
  and therefore the root required must be 76, whose cube is 438996.
  I take the liberty of proposing, for the amusement of your scien
  tific readers, the two following questions :               I think they have
  both been before proposed, but imagine that they admit of more
  interesting solutions than have hitherto appeared.
       1 . Required a method of determining            at sight, or by simple
  inspection,       whether  any given   number   be  a  prime number or not.
      2. By what        methods     could the Romans solve simple arith
   metical questions with their mode of notation ?
                              I remain, gentlemen,
                                      Your obedient humble servant,
   To Messrs. Nicholson and Tilloch,                      Egerton S. Eyres.

        10S Solutions   of Sir H. C. Englefield's Mathematical Question.
                                                    Chichester, Teh. 5, 1814.
           Sir H. Englefi eld's    mathematical question published in your
       last number may, I believe, be solved in the following manner :
           The cube root of every number under a million must of course.
       consist of not more than two places of figures.           Of these the
       last may be immediately determined, by observing that with re
      gard to six of the ten integers, viz. 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 0, the
      Unit's place is always the same in the cube and its root ; while
      2 and S, 3 and 7, are reciprocally changed one into the other in
      the processes of involution or evolution.
          The other figure of the rcot may be obtained as in the com
      mon rule for extracting the third power, viz. by deducting 3 from
      the given number of places, and taking the root of the cube next
      less than the amount indicated by the one, two, or three figures
  '
      remaining on the left hand.
          Thus, in the example proposed, where we have given the unit's
      place 6, the two first figures 43, the number of places 6 ;
          The unit's place in the root will of course be 6, as in the cube.
          Deducting 3 from the number of pfaces, there remain 3 ;
      therefore, affixing a cypher to the two first figures, we obtain 430.
     The cube next less than this is 343, of which the root is 7. The
     toot required is therefore 76,
          In this way, I fmd I can obtain the root of any cubic number
     almost instantaneously ; but I can hardly suppose so simple and
     obvious a principle to have escaped the notice of mathematicians,
                                                                         13.
                                                  Paddinpton, Feb. 9 1814.
         Sirs, — Having     been induced by the letter of Sir H. C. Engle-
     field, inserted in vour last, to turn my attention to the subject
•    of his inquiry ; I am enabled by the following simple process to
     name immediately the root of any cube under a million, whose
    two first figures, last figure, and number of figures are given.
         All that appears necessary for the performance of this problem
    is a knowledge of the cubes of the digits.          As the root consists
    of two figures, its tens will be indicated by, and must be sought
     for in, its two first figures, and its units in the last figure given.
         By observing the number of figures in the cube we previously
    discover the value of the two first figures given, whether they
    contain the units only, or the tens and units, or the hundreds and
    tens of the first figure of the root when cubed : having ascer
    tained this, we compare these figures with the cubes of the digits,
    and call that digit with whose cube they correspond, or to which
    they are next in superiority, the first figure of the root.
         The last figure given, which is of course the unit of the cube,
   will produce the second Jigure^ or unit of the root, by this simple
                                                                         rule,;

 Solutions   of Sir H. C. Engtefield's Mathematical         Question.  1($
 rule  : 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 0, remain unaltered, while 3 and 7, 2 and 8,
 are respectively convertible into each other ; or each when oc
 curring in the cube may be represented in the root by what it
 wants of 10.
     The instance adduced by Sir H. C. Englefield is a cube of
 6 figures, the two first of which are 43, and the last is 6.         Now
 as in a cube of 6 figures, the cubed tens of the root exist
 in the three first figures, these two first, here given, must con
 tain the hundreds and tens of that cube, and 43 represent 430
 (the amount of the unit's place being immaterial).           The regular
 cube next below 43G is 343, whose root (7) is consequently the
first figure required. For the second figure, 6 in the cube gives,
 as before explained, 6 in the root, and the whole root is there
 fore 76.
     I know not if this be the method used by Sir H. C. Engle
 field, and shall be happy to see any others suggested by your
 correspondents ; but must observe that this appears amply suffi
 cient for the purpose, as by it any one, after a practice of less
 than half an hour, may tell the root of any number, within the
 bounds of the question, as soon as proposed to them.
                          I remain, sirs,
                                   Your very obedient servant,

     Sirs, — The     solution of the following question proposed ia
 your   last Magazine is not difficult.                   \
     "  Of any cube   .number    under  a  million, give the  figure of the
 unit, the two first figures, and       the number of places, instantly
 and without any aid of writing to name its cube root."
     In every cube number, two figures, the first and last, may be
 known by simple inspection ; the first being the nearest cube
 root under the first or left hand period, whether consisting of
 one, two, or three figures, and the last being invariably indicated
 by the final digit.     Thus, if the final digit be 2, the' last figure
 of the root will be 8 ; if it be 3, the root indicated will be 7 : a
 table of the cubes of all the single digits at once exhibits the
 unvarying correspondence between the final digit of the cube and
 its root.    Now, according to the conditions of the question, the
  cube whose root is sought, can never exceed six places of figures :
 consequently the root must consist merely of a first and a last
figure, which we have seen may be instantly discovered by sim
 ple inspection.      It is true, the intermediate figures between the.
 final digit and the two first figures are not given ; but the number
 of places being given, it is (for an obvious reason) only necessary
                                                                   mentally

    Given 94. . .2.     Here the number of places being six, the
first period (according to the rule for extracting the cube root)
must consist of three figures, which after the mental substitution
of noughts will be 940, whose nearest less cube root is 9, and
the final digit 2, indicating 8 for the remaining figure of the
root: the entire root is "instantly and without any aid of
writing" perceived to be 98.

    Sirs, — It  gave me great'pleasure to observe      the sentiments
*vith which Sir H. C. Englefield introduced his question in your
last number, relative to the extraction of certain cube roots. He
there justly states, that it is not common to introduce questions
of this kind to the public through the medium of periodical
Journals, though it was not unusual in the early part of the last
century; and every one acquainted with the progress of the
sciences at that period will admit that much of it was to be
attributed to such communications.          I made a similar remark
some little time back, in proposing a question in the Philosophi
cal Journal, under the signature of" Mathematieus;" and though
I failed in my attempt to bring the subject under examination at
that time, I am not without hopes that the example of a gentle
man, so well known and esteemed in the scientific world as Sir
H. E. is, may be followed by others, and that we may thus see,
at times, a few pages of your valuable Magazine employed on
subjects of this nature.
    With respect to the question proposed, it is far from difficult,
nothing further being necessary for its solution, than that of re-

All his ideas Were obviously intuitive, yet in most cases correct :
indeed the only instance in which I found that he proceeded on
false principles was in resolving numbers into' their' factors; and
even here he would succeed in the greater number of cases.

   Sirs, — .Every    attempt to simplify and abridge calculations
deserves attention, and      cannot therefore but view the question
                              I
proposed       by
              Sir H.  Englefield, in your number for January, with
particular pleasure  and  satisfaction.
   In order to resolve       it,
                            would first remark, that when the unit'*
                              I
                                                                                                                             9,
                                                                             7, 3,
place in any root
                                                   0, 0,   1, 1,   a 8, 2,           4, 4,   5, 5,   6, 6,   3, 7,   2, 8,
                        is
the unit's place in the cube will be                                 9.
   This table, of course, can be acquired in few minutes           me                                          by
mory.     To exemplify its use, we may briefly state, that when
the unit's place in any cube             the unit's place in the root
                                         is   8,
will be   2
          ; or when the unit's figure in the cube            the unit's                is      3,
place in the root will be           7.
   Moreover     it   well knowii law existing amongst cube num^
                     is
                     a
bers, that     if
              any  cube  number be divided into periods of three
figures commencing     with the unit, the number of these periods
will show the number of figures in the root, which in the case
before us never can exceed two; that                   is,
                                               the root of every cube
number under      million consists but of two figures, the first of
                    a
which, or that in the unit's place, being readly obtained           the                                         by
application  of the  above    table,  there remains   only to  discover
the other figure, which      the cube root of the greatest cube num
                               i3
ber contained in the first period.                                  An

              On definite Proportions in Chemical Affinity.          113
     An example or two will make this clear.          Let the cube num-
\>er   whose root is required be 804357.         Here the first figure of
 the root will be 3, and the root of the greatest cube contained
 in 804 is 9. Hence the root required is 93.
     Again. Required the cube root of 74088.              Here 2 is the
 first figure of the root, and the root of the greatest cube con
 tained in 74 is 4 ; hence 42 is the root required.
     If only the figure of the unit, the two first figures, and the
number of places be given, as stated in the question, the opera
tion will be precisely the same. For by taking the example
 given in the question, the first figure of the root is 6 ; and as the
 number consists of 6 places, it remains only to find the root of
the greatest cube number contained in 430, which is 7. Hence the
 root is 76.      It may be proper however to remark, that this mode
of stating the question fails when the given cube number ter
                                         '
 minates with a cypher.
     Concerning the performing this ''instantly and without any
aid of writing," I beg to Observe, that when I first discovered
the principle, I explained it to two or three young gentlemen,
pupils of mine, about twelve years of age, and who,after practising
it for the short time of half an hour on a slate, would tell without
the aid of writing, the root of any cube number under a million,
instantly, and without the smallest hesitation.
     The method applies also to any cube number above a million,
when it terminates in a cypher; but I have not been able to ex
tend it to cube numbers in general.          I make no doubt but that
with    a  little pains many other arithmetical operations might be
simplified; and it would perhaps explain in a way not the most
unsatisfactory, the truly astonishing powers of the "wonderful
American boy."         I am, &c.

 XXIV.       Observations on the Doctrines    of defmite Proportions in
     Chemical Affinity.      By William        Crane, Jun. M.D. of
     Boston, Lincolnshire*.
It    is often a pleasing task to view the progressive improvement
that is attendant upon different departments of science ; in doing
which we sometimes meet with hypotheses that were considered
at first as crude, ridiculous, and soon almost forgotten, again re
vived, more c.learly illustrated, and not unfrequently advanced
as entirely new.      Among many others that have been proposed in
the science of chemistry, that of bodies uniting in definite pro
portions to form chemical compounds holds a distinguished place.

     Vol. 43. No. 190. Feb. 1814.                H                   Mr.

114                    Observations on the Doctrines
   Mr. Higgins, in his Comparative View of the Phlegistie and Anti
phlogistic Theories, conceiving that bodies were composed of
minute atoms, was led, from the well-known fact that oxygen
and hydrogen gases united in the proportion of 1 to 2 in volume
to form watery and as they unite in no other proportion, to con
sider them as uniting atom to atom.          " We must suppose," he
observes,
             " that they contain an equal number of divisions, and
that the difference of their specific gravity depends chiefly on the
size of their ultimate particles ; or we must suppose that the
ultimate particles of light inflammable air require 2 or 3 or more
of dephlogisticated air to saturate them."        The latter, he infers,
is not the case, from its being impossible to form such an inter
mediate combination as can be effected in the union of sulphur
and oxygen.         From this also he concludes, that oxygen and hy
drogen
          "  are  incapable of uniting to a third particle of either of
their constituent principles." Sulphuric acid, according to him,
is formed of 1 particle of sulphur arid 2 of oxygen, and sulphureous
acid by 1 of sulphur and 1 ef oxygen.
    These speculations, owing to the imperfect state of chemical
analysis, were overlooked and rejected by succeeding chemists,
and little or no notice taken of them until Mr. Dalton, in a work
displaying the vast powers of an enlightened mind, aided by in
dustrious research, reproposed this doctrine, and again turned the
attention of chemists to this important subject ; and it appears
to me, from perusing Mr. Dalton's new System of Chemical Phi
losophy, that he is unacquainted with the writings of Mr. Higgins
on this subject. The former has, in the work just mentioned, stated
that chemical attraction is guided by determinate laws ; that
bodies uniting to each other in one proportion only, unite atorn
to atom, or those which combine in various proportions form
binary, ternary, &c. combinations, one atom of the one element
being united to 1,2, 3, &e. atoms of another.             Examples are
found   in  the  union  of oxygen and hydrogen, oxygen and azote, &e;
one atom of the one uniting to one or more atoms of the other ;
 according to some fixed mathematical relation, which Mr. Dalton
apparently considers to be in arithmetical progression.          In this
view of affinity, it is of importance to determine the number of
elementary atoms that enter into the formation of a compound
 atom. Hence, should this supposition be found correct, the errors
 arising from chemical analysis may be regulated by the aid of
 mathematical calculation.       The two substances that have claimed
 particular attention, by which this may be accomplished, are wa
 ter and ammonia, for the elements of these have as yet been
 found to unite in one proportion only.
    Mr. Murray, in his Chemistry, lias observed, that the facility
 with which the numbers can be assumed is one of the means by
which we may be deceived.                                           Dr.

    Dr. Thomson, in his System of Chemistry, gave an outline of
Mr. Dalton's theory, before the latter had himself made it public,
and in his paper upon the oxalic acid in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1807 has shown a very great coincidence in the com
position of this acid, by calculation, with the result of actual
analysis.    In the 4th section of this paper he states that " it has
been ascertained by decisive experiment, that elementary bodies
always enter into combinations in determinate proportions, which
may be represented by numbers;" and he finds an atom of oxy
gen to be 6, if an atom of hydrogen be estimated as 1.             The   ^
Doctor has taken this estimate by supposing one atom of oxygen
to unite to one of hydrogen, to form water ; estimating the
weight of hydrogen to be 14i and oxygen to be 85£, to form
100 parts of water: hence an atom of hydrogen being to one of
oxygen in the same ratio, it gives when reduced 1 to 6.48, and
the Doctor rejected the decimals.        Mr. Dalton takes his estimate
from the proportion given by Humboldt and Gay-Lussac. It
appears from their experiments to be 87'4 of oxygen to 12.6 of
hydrogen; and the number representing oxygen will be 6-96, which
approximates very nearly to 7, the number chosen by Mr. Dalton.
    SirxH. Davy estimates the specific gravity of hydrogen to
oxygen as 1 to 15 ; and as it takes 2 measures of hydrogen to 1
of oxygen in the formation of water, the ratio of the hydrogen
to oxygen is as 2 to 15 * ; " and it may be regarded as composed
of 2 proportions of hydrogen and 1 of oxygen, and the number
repf esenting hydrdgen will be l,and that representing oxygen 15."
This value is not taken by considering the number of atoms in
the gases, a doctrine truly hypothetical, but from the proportions
in which they unite, and their specific gravity.        In considering
the doctrine of proportion, as Sir H. Davy has observed, we cer
 tainly have no reason to suppose bodies composed of atoms that
 are indivisible uniting orte to one, &c.     In the present state of
 our knowledge this hypothesis of atoms cannot with propriety be
 admitted, as we have ho evidence upon which we can be certain
 of the weight or number of atoms in any compound.               " Our
 numerical expressions," as the author last quoted justly says,
 "  ought only to relate to the result of our experiments."
    It is not a little perplexing to observe Mr. Dalton, in his work,
found his whole calculation upon the combination of oxygen and
 hydrogen as uniting atom to atom to form water; and in his
 chapter upon the combination of these gases, to fmd him de
 clare that   " after all it must be allowed to be possible that lualer
 may be a ternary compound."         This conclusion appears in a great
 measure to be drawn from his experiments upon muriatic and

115                 Observations on the Doctrmes
fluoric acids, in which he concluded they were formed by trier
union of oxygen and hydrogen in different proportions.              Later-
discoveries have proved this not to be the case.         For oxymuriatic
acid, now called chlorine, appears to be the basis of the muriatic
acid ; and fluoric acid, from the experiments of Davy, Gay-Lussac
and Thenard, also has a peculiar base.
    Notwithstanding the theory of atoms is so very hypothetical,
it is applicable to calculation,   as the numbers are relative, and
taken from a fixed ratio.    Therefore, if we take the original pro
position that water be composed of equal atoms of these gases,
I am inclined to think 6-96 as very near the true number for oxy
gen.     I am not fond of rejecting decimals, as these, when there
is a combination consisting of some high multiple, will lead to
 considerable error in the calculation, or when the substance un
 der examination consists of many parts.
    Dr. Thomson in his paper on oxalic acid, when calculating the.
 composition of this acid, takes oxygen at 6, and hydrogen at           lr
 and carbon, with Mr. Dalton, at 4.3 ; and he finds from experi
 ment the composition of oxalic acid to be,
       Oxygen.. 64.69, and by calculation Oxygen . . 61

    The numbers given by Sir H. Davy, being reduced to Mr. Dal-
 ton's views, and applying them as above, appear to be too high.
 After Dr. Thomson, we find that Dr.Woliaston also read a paper
 to the Royal Society, giving an account of some experiments he
 had made upon sub- acid and super-acid salts.             These he con
 siders as particular examples of Mr. Dalton 's more general rule,
 which he states thus : " that in all cases the simple elements of
 bodies are disposed to unite atom to atom singly; or, if either is
 in excess, it exceeds by a ratio to be expressed by some simple
 multiple of the number of its atoms."
    When examining the oxalates, he found the super-oxalate to.
  contain twice the quantity of acid the neutral salt contains.
  Hence it is probable that it unites in the proportion of 1 of potassa
  to 1 of acid, and 2 of add to 1 of potassa : therefore the next
  combination, if it be formed, ought to consist of 3 of acid to 1 of
  alkali. To determine this, the Doctor took 400 grains of potassa
  and neutralized it with 30 of acid ; to this he added 60 grains
                                                                     more

             of definite Proportions   in Chemical Affinity.     117
more of acid ; so there were 2 parts of potassa 24 grains each,
and six equivalent parts of acid 15 grains each ; which ought, as
above stated, to form a salt of 3 of acid to 1 of alkali. But upon
crystallization he found 2 salts, the one a binoxalate, the other
a quadroxalate, or one of alkali to 4 of acid.
    To make this answer to the theory of Dalton, the Doctor
supposes the neutral salt to consist of 2 of alkali to 1 of acid,
and the next 2 to 2, and the third 1 to 2, or 2 of alkali to 4 of
acid. This is altogether hypothetical ; and, as Dr. Wollaston obr
serves, it is far from satisfactory that the alkali should be in ex
cess in the neutral salt.
   Although this appears against Mr. Ualton's theory, it is equally
so to the law of Berthollet,     that the combinations of bodies are
as their relative attractions and acting masses : for, Why in that
case are the salts above mentioned formed ?         The alkali ought
to be diffused equally, and a salt consisting of 3 to 1 obtained.
    Dr. Wollaston thinks it is probable that other ratios will be
found, arising from the shape and polarity of the atoms, than the
simple arithmetical.
    Gay-Lussac has attempted to form a theory departing from
the slrict principles of Berthollet's views of affinity and those of  '
 Dalton.     He thinks chemical affinity may be indefinitely exerted
amongst the particles of matter, and compounds may be formed
of variable proportions ; but that insolubility, cohesion, and elas
ticity have a tendency to produce fixed combinations ; and also
that chemical action takes place with energy when the elements
are in simple ratios, or some multiple of these ratios, by which
.compounds are produced that can be easily insulated.
    By this means he endeavours to explain the phenomena at
tending chemical affinity; that bodies can unite in determinate
proportions, and that under certain circumstances they unite ac
 cording to the quantity of attracting matter, and form com
pounds of variable relations : and a view of this kind has been
in some measure adopted by Berthollet. With respect to the
 combinations of the gases, Gav-Lussac has observed two laws.
 1. That they combine in proportions having simple ratios acr
cording to their volume.      2. That gases by combination appear
 to suffer a contraction in volume in a simple ratio to the gas
added.     After having stated many examples of his first law, he
also adds, that between the elements of the first combination
 there is no simple ratio ; but this takes place in the second com
 bination, when the new proportion will be a multiple of that first
 added.     This, as Mr. Murray observes in liis System of Che
mistry, from which I have taken this outline of Gay-Lussac's
theory, distinguishes his from that proposed by Dalton. To these
speculations of Gay-Lussac, Mr. Dalton has replied in the Ap-

 pendix to the Second Part of his work, appealing to his own ex
 periments and those of the most celebrated chemists, that gases
 do not unite in measures proportionate to their volume.
    After having cited particular examples that many of them do
 not unite in volume according to any determinate proportion, he
 concludes,   " that gases in no instance combine in equal or exact
 measure."      This, Mr. Murray thinks, might be perhaps properly
 extended to the whole doctrine of definite proportions.
    Sir H. Davy, in his Elements of Chemical Philosophy, advances
 an immense number of proofs that the theory of definite pro
 portions is not founded upon hypothetical reasoning.         He, as is
 already   observed,  rejects the doctrine of atoms,  and  founds   his
 calculations on the result of    actual  experiment.   By   this, one
 of the very great objections to Mr. Higgins's and Mr. Dalton's
 theory is removed ; namely, that substances uniting in one pro
 portion only form a binary compound, for we have no grounds upon
 which we can form such an opinion in the language of Mr. Dal-
 ton; it is merely an assumption.       He supports, contrary to what
 Mr. Dalton has said, the theory advanced by Gay-Lussac, re
 specting the union of gases ; which he beautifully illustrates by
 the combinations that are formed by azote and oxygen, carbon
 and oxygen, &c.' And Mr. J. Davy, in his paper published in the
.Philosophical Transactions, On the gaseous Compounds of Car
 bonic Oxide and Chlorine, has given some very decisive examples.
 He observes, " the proportions in which bodies unite appear to be
 determined by fixed laws, which are exemplified in a variety of
^instances, and particularly in the present compounds.         Oxygen
 combines with twice its volume of hydrogen, and twice its volume
 of carbonic oxide, to form water and carbonic acid ; and with double
 its volume of chlorine to form euchlorine ; and chlorine recipro
 cally requires its own volume of hydrogen and its own volume of
 carbonic oxide to form muriatic acid and the new gas."
     Sir H. Davy in his work has noticed several of the experiments
 upon which Berthollet founded his views of affmity, and has
 pointed out the source of some errors.     According to Berthollet's
 views, precipitates could not be thrown down in a state of purity,
 but must retain a portion of the substance with which the pre
 cipitate was previously combined : of this we have many examples,
 to the contrary, as when one metal in solution is precipitated by
 anot her ; and in the precipitation of magnesia, &c.
     Sir H. Davy also observes, "that there is no difficulty in re
  conciling the doctrine of proportions with the influence of quarw
 tity. None of the experiments of M.Berthollet can be considered
  as strietlv contrary to the doctrine, and some of the most im
 portant 1 ?sults of this sagacious chemist afford its confirmation."
     From the above quotations and observations, I think it will
                                                                clearly

dearly appear that the doctrine of Messrs. Higgins and Dalton
with    regard to atoms is truly hypothetical, and cannot with
propriety be at present admitted : objections to this theory have
also beerl pointed . out by Dr. Bos'tock in Nicholson's Journal.
The views I am most inclined to adopt are those of Sir H.Davy,
as in these we are guided by the result of experiment         and fact.
The more accurately our researches are made, the more forcibly
is the doctrine of definite proportions demonstrated.          The re
searches of Mr. J. Davy on the combinations of different metals
and chlorine, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1812,
and the late interesting publication of Berzelius, sufficiently prove
the truth of what is above stated : although not standing the
test of a rigorous? mathematical examination, they are sufficiently
near, considering that chemical analysis is still imperfect, to point
out this grand law.     Objections may undoubtedly still be urged
against  it, and that of solution has been considered          some as      by
the most forcible; since, in this, bodies within certain limits appear
to unite in any proportion.      But surely there     some difference
                                                                   is

 [P. 182] but when the actual elevations of the different parts of the
        edges of the Chalk around this great denudation, are con
        sidered, it will be seen, that a Lake, in any great degree
reviewing the progress in 1813, of his favouiite Geognosy (Ann. of Phil. iii.
29), ascribes to Mr. Thomas Webster (but perhaps rather erroneously?) the
assertion, that the Parisian " new series of jlatz Rocks, which appear to tie
over the Chalk," " constitute almost the whole of the south-east corner of
England." Notwithstanding, that all the south.eastern toast between Folk-
stone and Eaatborne (a direct distance of 45 Miles or more) shows Strata
 that lie under the Chalk, and that the same thing occurs thence inland, as
 far as Far n ham and Peterstield, (distances of 85 and 5.-i miles respectively),
within which large denudated tract, it is impracticable to find any of the
Parisian or London Strata, or even the Chalk on which they should lie:
but a quite different series of strata appear, dipping every where towards
 and passing under the nearest Chalk ranges.
     Another learned Doctor, who claims, I believe, to be still " better edu
 cated," in the Wcrnerian subtilities, thinking perhaps (with an Edinburgh
Professor, and Mr. B. P. M. xlii. p. 167) that the Section previously made
 across this district, formed principally on "Stage.coach observations," was
 utterly beneath the dignity of his Geognosy, and unworthy even of having its
 most obvious facts as above mentioned, attended to, or examined; when he
 returned two or three years ago from a southern Geognostic Tour, presented
 an account (as Mr. Webster is stated by Dr. T. to have done), representing,
 as  I was informed, the strata in this denudated     tract, whose places are
 reallyyar below the Chalk Strata of its edges, as lieing above the Chalk.'/.
 It was however then thought proper to strike this part of the Doctor's dis
 coveries from his paper, before it was inserted in the Geo. Tran. vol. i.
     A very striking feature of the south-eastern Denudation of England, and
 which my manuscript Section made in 1806, mentioned P. M. xlii. p. 167,
 was in a principal degree intended to show, is the rise of the strata from
 the vale of the Thames at London, southward, to a strata.ridge line, rang
 ing nearly E and W, which crosses the London and Brighton Road at
 Hand-cross 35 Miles from London, and the contrary dip of the strata from
 this place to the Sea at Brighton; and also, that from the Thames the
 strata begin to rise again through Islington, from a strata.trough line,
 ranging along the vale of the Thame?.       In your xxxixth vol. p. 271 Note,
 I  have mentioned, that some distance beyond Brighton, the strata rise again
  southward, from another strata-trough line, which ranges thence between
 the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth, and proceeds westward into Dorsetshire.
 Which b.st Trough in the English strata, I investigated to a certain de
 gree, near Portsmouth, and made a Section, of which         I circulated several
 manuscript copies in the spring of 1812; which showed, that the notion
 so often published, of the Isle of Wight having been forcibly rent off (com
 Hampshire, and the channel between them occasioned by the fissure or
 chasm     thereby opened, was entirely without foundation, snd that the
 Is'e of Wight, was on the contrary, a hummock or part remaining, of the
  ridge in the strata, south of the trough above mentioned ; and that instead
  of a chasm, the highest of the known British strata, in unbroken continuity,
 occupies the bed of the Channel and adjoining coasts of the Isle of Wight
 and Hampshire, as my other Section mentioned, had done with respect
 to the Thames Trough at London.           In your last volume, p. 395, Mr.
 Webster appears to have given the names of " Isle of Wight Basin," and

       which supplied edges, (since "broken down" by the Chan

        them, differ most obviously from each other, Rep. i. 109;
        and I entertain no doubt, that when sufficiently minute and
       extended examinations and descriptions of the Reliquia are
       made (Mont. Mag. xxxiii. p. 514), that the species thereof
    . will characterize the different strata, and even the different
        beds, in many strata, in a very satisfactory manner. Mr.

       five numbers are published (9 new), is deserving of every
        encouragement, towards this end, by those who have it in
        their power, to send him ample and perfect specimens of
       fossil shells, with their exact localities ; and when it can be
        done, their places in the strata also : and when several sorts
        of shells are sent, to distinguish those which are found up
        permost, and how far above each other in the strata, &c.

     general be found, on examination, either to have fallen from
     some cliff or steep place, near at hand, or to have been
     moved from some distant stratum; or, if much rounded,
     perhaps from the antipodes, as likely so, as from the lop of

     than Continents, do not grow old, and become less fit for the
     uses for which their bountiful Creator intended them, but the
     reverse of this: and though all the living organized Beings,
     which, in such myriads, people its surface, and have their
     different, but very limited periods of existence, and then their
     visible and material parts quickly loose their bond of con
     nexion, and are fitted to form parts of other living Beings, in
     most cases, yet the Mass of the Earth, seems wisely fitted,
     to continue the theatre of these grand organic revolutions,
      with increasing happiness to the ever changing individuals

     not seen, that the immensely deep Lakes in the line of this
      Canal, may be parts of a valley or chasm, as deep as these
     Lakes, which once opened into the German Ocean, and
     that enough of this alluvium has since been lodged, not only
     to fill up the eastern end of this valley, to its present level,
     but even 100 or 150 feet higher, until a subsequent excava
     tion therein, took place, and left a tablet of this Clay,

my .Note on p. 41); to which classes of Men the distinction is perfectly

£P.202] The principal masses in this conglomerate are quartz
    grains of very various sizes, variously intermixed with masses
    of white Chert, of Jasper, of Slate, &e. &c. It forms re
    gular beds, dipping easily SE, and passing under the very
    regular black Marble Rock (in which there is a considerable
    Quarry and Lime-Kilns called Cwaise-bangor, about \m.
     NNE) constituting the lower part of the Limestone floor or
    trough to the Coal-measures, mentioned in my note on
    p. 108.     In general, where I had opportunities of examining.
    this gritstone below the black Limestone Rock, it consisted
    of very variable coarse. Grit-stone, but in other places, the
    saroe had a few masses of Jasper in it (as I had noticed in
    South- Wales) , masses of Chert in others, and on the W
    side of Nant-hoorva Quarry, %m. SW of Llangefni, the
    masses of Chert are large, resting on coarse Slate, and seem
    to graduate or pass into Jasper, as they do also on the SW
    side of Graig-fawr Rock E3SE of the Town. I much wish to
    call the attention of Geological observers, to the careful ex
     amination of this and other variable Rocks, as presenting
    matter of important consideration, on the formation of
    strata: Mr. Jameson's late opinions and mine, seem very
    nearly to coincide, as to their cotemporary formation.

                                               Windsor.  January 1814.
                                                   for last December,
which contains my paper addressed to you, " On a Pheno
menon of Mount St. Michael in Cornwall," I have found a paper
under the title : " On a saline Substance from Mount Vesuvius,
by James Smithson, Esq." intended to support a new geological
system, thus introduced at the beginning of the paper.
                                                                " It has
long appeared to me, that when the earth is considered with at
tention, innumerable circumstances are perceived, which cannot
but lead to the conclusion, that it has been once in a state of
general conflagration . The existence in the skies of planetary
bodies, which seem actually burning, and the appearance of ori
ginal fire on our globe, I have conceived to be mutually corro
borative of each other ; and at the same time when 720 answer
could be given to the most essential objections to the hypothesis,
the mass offacts in favour of it fully justified, I thought, the in
ference that our habitation is an extinct comet or sun."
    Such is the system : and we must now consider what is
                                                                    that

that mass    offacts that justify the hypothesis, of which it may be
supposed the author adduces the most striking: he thus con
tinues : " The mighty difficulties which formerly assailed this opi^
nion, great modern discoveries have dissipated. Acquainted now,
that the bases of alkalies and earths are metals eminently oxi-
dable, we are no longer embarrassed either for the pabulum of
the inflammation, or to account for 'the production of it.                  In
the primary ttrata we behold the result of combustion : in them
we see the oxide collected on the surface of the calcined mass,
first melted by ht at, then by its increase arresting further com
bination, and extinguishing the Jires which had generated                   it,
                                                                           and
in fine become solid and crystallized over the metallic ball.
Every thing tells that           large body of combustible matter re
                                    a
mains inclosed within the stofiy envelope, of which volcanic
eruptions are partial and small ascensions.             Under this point of
view,        high
               a    interest   attaches   itself  to   volcanoes and their
ejections; they cease to be local phaenomena;                   they become
principal elements in the history            our globe of   ;they connect. its
present with its former condition."
    This surely      as new, as
                           is             grand system

               it

                                                   oj
which he thus continues                       "
                                      The general examination which

                 showed that         was what at that time was called
                                         it

                                    it
in an Italian publication soon after."
    Then he gives the following particulars concerning the man
ner      which that substance had been found
          in                                               " was informed
                                                            :   I

p   1792 or 1793."
    Thus we may judge, that the author has never observed him
self Mount Vesuvius, and that he knows only                     by
                                                               report    few of

 the phaenomena of that volcano.          He then proceeds to detail the
 chemical analysis which he had made of that saline substance                         ;
but as he         aware that so small and even so indirect a fact
                     is
 could not support his igneous system, he ventures on another
ground, in which         shall now follow him, and afterwards return
                                I
 to volcanoes.
    " In support (he says) of the igneous origin here attributed
to our primitive strata,        will observe that, not only no crystal

 imbedded in them, such as quartz, garnet, tourmaline, &c. has
 been seen im losing drops         water, but that none of the materials
                                         of
 of the strata contain water in any state."                            ,
                                                                                  The

       in his Paper on a saline Substance from Mount Vesuvius. 129
        The author appears not to be acquainted with such mountains
     formed of primitive strata as are those observed in the central
     ridge of the Alps, in which is found the rock crystal, of a
     quartzeous nature, and even the purest quartz ; a fact directly
     Contrary to his assertion : but the circumstances attending that
    crystal, and the crystal itself, indicate so incontestably its aqueous
    origin and that of the strata in which it is found, that I shall
    describe the most important of them*
        At the time when I first travelled in the Alps, which was in 1744,
    rock crystal was employed, by cutting            it,
                                                      for various ornaments
    in houses, as lustres, sconces, and frames of various sorts, as
.   may be seen in some ancient palaces.
        Considering that the circumstances attending that crystal in
'
    the strata could lead'to the natural history of the latter, and as
    living at Geneva near the Alps, my brother and myself resolved
    to visit the places whence that crystal came, and to converse
    with those on the spot whose profession            was to extract
                                                         it                  iait,
    order to be informed of the nature of their work.
        After having travelled in many parts of the Alps, we generally
    found that rock crystal belonged to a certain class of micaceous
    schistose strata, with many circumstances attesting the aqueous
    origin of that crystal, and consequently of the strata themselves.
    The following was the information which we received.
      A    general fact    is,that rock crystal     never found but in cavi
                                                    is
    ties,  the  sides  of which   all around  are   covered  with its prisms.
    Those    of  the  inhabitants of the Alps who made that crystal the
    object of their pursuits, commonly called crystal-hunters, know
    ing by the aspect of the strata those in which such cavities
    were likely to be found, and that they could not be discovered but
    in abrupt sides of the rocks, because the rubbish and grass cover
    the other parts, used        very hazardous method to find out those
                                 a
    cavities.     On the top of such abrupt sides in which they disco
    vered their characters, they bored some holes in the solid rock at
    different places, for the following purpose.             They fixed very
    solidly poles in these holes, and twisted round them              arope, at
    the one end of which hung        a  sort of basket      in this the most
                                                              :
    courageous of them was let down, allowing him               greater share
                                                                  a
    of the adventure while his associates, to whom he trusted his
                      ;
    life, held the other end of the rope at the top.
        As that man went down along the different parts of the rock,
    he struck   it   with a  hammer, and      by.the different sound of the.
    Strokes he judged whether the rock was hollow.                If there was
    no sensible difference in the sound, he did not think                worth
                                                                          it
    while to open the cavity; but         the'sound gave him the hope of
                                         if
    finding a   large cavity, then care was taken to secure him better,
    *s he was to open     it,and, entering    it,
                                                to detach the prisms.

ISO       On the geological   Theory supported   hj Mr.  Smlthsdrr,
     Fragments being only used for the common purposes, the mar*
who entered these cavities broke with his hammer all the pro-'
jecting prisms around it ; and the quantity was sometimes so
 great, that the associated made much money from what they ob
 tained in one of them.       Such are the general circumstances con
 cerning rock crystal found in that kind of schistose strata; but
 the particulars to which I now coffie, are no less important to
 the natural history of that mineral.
      I shall mention as a first important circumstance, the size of
 some prisms which have been found.          I have known two prisms,
 one of which was perfectly transparent, employed in a. most beauti
 ful work for the late Empress Queen, which prism was from 9 ts
  10 inches in diameter : the other, less transparent, was above one
 foot.      I think I can now say with more certainty than the
  author   has  done for his hypothesis, that svch crystals have never
  been seen as the product of fusion.       But the character of true
 conclusions from the phaenomena, is manifested by the coincidence
  of circumstances in the same object ; and it is the case in the
  system of the aqueous origin of our mineral strata : a confirma
  tion to which I now come.
       As the men who followed this pursuit knew also that some
  curious travellers in the Alps paid them for the trouble of detach
  ing parts of the crust covering the sides of the cavities with its
 prisms, — which crust, by naturalists of many countries, is called
  druses, — they carefully detached them ; and we had the oppor
  tunity of purchasing many which are in our collection of mi
  nerals remaining at Geneva.       Now, in these druses, many proofs
  are found that they were formed t in cavities during the time that
  our continents constituted the bed of the sea, and that conse
  quently these cavities were filled with water.       That great geo
 logical    fact, so contrary  to the igneous system   of the author, is  >
  demonstrated by the immense quantity of marine exuvite found
  in the strata commonly called secondary.
       By the inspection of the druses that we have in our collection,
  it is impossible not to be convinced that the prisms have been
  formed, not only in cavities filled with water, but by a process in
  which each prism increased successively in size by new addi
   tions; and that they were as shooting at the same time in dif
   ferent directions from the same points.      In one of these, dimes a
   large prism, in its increase of size, has enveloped a small one ;
   thev are both very transparent ; and this phaenomenon might be
   overlooked, did not the small prism project on one side of the
   other : but this circumstance directing the sight in the large
  prism, the small one is seen in it by the different refraction of the
  light. In another druse, by some change in the successive pro
   cess of crystallization, a large prism has divided itself into small
  ones, like the branchea of a tree.                                   It

       in his Paper on   a saline Substancefrom Mount Vesuvius. 131
       It would be endless to describe further the phaenomena of
    druses, all leading to the same conclusion : the various manners
   in which the prisms cross each other) divide and unite again.
    But there is a particular circumstance, which is exemplified in a
   process that we see going on, that of the crystallization of salts
   in liquids. Each salt has its particular character and shape;
   and if a liquid hold in solution different salts, they crystallize
*.
   separately in known circumstances, especially in different tem
   peratures.     Now there is a similar pha:nomenon in the crystalli
   zation of rock crystal, showing that in some of the cavities in
   which it has been formed, the liquid contained in solution other
   mineral substances, one in particular, whence have proceeded
   small crystals of green shorI, from which many pris7ns of rock
    crystal are made, unfit for any other use than . that of variety in
   mineral collections!
       These green shorls were at first supposed to be mosses that
   had grown in these cavities ; a supposition contradicted by its
   being impossible that land vegetables should grow in the sea ;
   but by observing these shorls with a magnifying glass, the mis
   take is soon discovered, by the angular form of their thread.
   We have a prism of rock crystal made almost opake.by these
   shorls, in which one of them having been destroyed, has left an
   angular hole from one side to the other, through which a horse
   hair can pass.
       I now come to the assertion of the author, that none of the
   crystals has ever been seen inclosing drops of water.      This might
   be, without affording any argument against the aqueous origin,
   and for instance, of rock crystal ; for there is no reason a. priorif
   that water should be inclosed in any of its prisms.     However, the
   fact itself contradicts his assertion.  It is natural to infer that he
   has not seen the case himself, since he never alludes to rock cry
   stal, though so important to the natural history of the primitive
   strata. But I have seen many prisms of that crystal containing
   water, and there is one in our collection, the particulars of which
   I shall describe.
       This prism is about two inches in diameter ; it is traversed by
   many small crystals of green shorl, between which a small quan
   tity of water remained engaged during the increase of its size.
   That water is manifested by a bubble of air, which remained in
   closed with the water retained also by the shorls.       By inclining
   the prism, that bubble moves gradually from nearly one end to
   the other of the prism ; but as, according to the shorls that it
   meets in its way, its direction is determined, it does not follow the
   same course in every trial, except when the inclination of the
   prism happens to be the same and on the same side, and it shows
   thus the space which is occupied by the inclosed water.
                                   I 2                              Now,

   Now, since the author says in favour of his igneous system,
that no crystal such as quartz has ever been seen inclosing drops
of water, which ought to be the case in that system ; the con
trary being the fait, is a peremptory proof against it.
   I now come to the inferences which the author derives from
the phaenomena of volcanoes, making however this previous re
mark, that in this case again he has made himself no observa
tions, nor even on Vesuvius, of which alone he speaks ; for he
•ays that he had received his information from a correspondent
at Naples.     But besides, the only fact on which he has built hi*
whole system, is that saline substance, of which even the parti
culars that he relates are either not well expressed, or must
proceed from a very inaccurate observer.       I shall prove hereafter
that this account is erroneous ; but I must first state the nature
of volcanoes, on which all their phaniomena depend.
   What are volcanic eminences ? In what manner do they be
gin to be produced ?     How do they increase in height and ex
tent ?   Fortunately the answer to these questions is obtained
from a known event, transmitted to us by witnesses of the whole
process, from beginning to end, in the formation of a new vol
canic eminence between Naples and Puzzoli, which has retained
the name of Monte Nuovo (new mount) ¦ I have given the
whole account of the event from those witnesses, in p. 398
of the xith volume of my work, Hisloire de la Terre et de
V Homme, of which account the following is a translation.
   "  In the night between the 29th and the 30th of September
1538, after two years of almost continual earthquakes, and es
pecially after a day when the earth had been continually agitated,
at last an opening was produced in a very fertile land ; through
which opening .eame out so much fire, and such a quantity of
stones and cinders, that they produced a small mountain, now
called Monte Nuovo ; it destroyed many houses, fields, men and
cattle, and buried under its materials the borough of Ripercola i
it is about three miles in circumference, and its height is not
much less than that of Mount Barbaro near           it, which   isesti
mated at   a  thousand steps ;  the ejections from that opening ex
tended down to the sea.       At the summit of this mount          still
                                                                   is
seen the mouth which ejected such      a  quantity  of matter  ;which
ejection however ceased very soon.         The Lago lucrino, thus
called from the lucre or profit resulting from an abundant
fishery, was so much filled up    by  the matters thrown out of that
opening, that  it   now only a marslrebvered with reeds."
                    is
   From this known and well circumstantiated event, we are en
abled to answer the above important questions concerning the
formation of volcanic cones.     A first explosion produces an open
ing in the mineral strata of the land through that opening
                                           ;

  come out successively lavas and showers of cinders, which by
  degrees produce an accumulation in the form of a cone ; and
  the materials of such mounts are as distinct from the original

  Mount Vesuvius, since he derives his hypothesis from the speci
  men of a saline substance sent to him from Naples.                    But to
  conclude a system on that specimen, is the same as to decide the
  nature of all the mineral strata of an unknown country, from a
fragment of stone.          If he had known my geological work above
  mentioned, Histoire de la Terre et de             I'
                                                    Homme, he would have
  found in   it,  from the observations of my brother, such an exact
  description of all the phaenomeiia of volcanoes, as mu9t have
  superseded in his mind the erroneous information which he ap
  pears to have received from Naples.
     Nobody, to my knowledge, has observed the various volcanic
 jjhaenomena more thoroughly than my brother, not only of Ve
 suvius, but of Etna, and of the volcanic islands of Lipari, near
 Sicily.     He has seen actual eruptions of Vesuvius, and followed
 the steps of new lavas flowing. over old lavas.                This progress
 continues    as   long  as  the  new  lava    retains   a sufficient heat to
 maintain its softness; but at              agreater or smaller distance,
 though still red hot,    it     hardens and breaks       ; then the broken
 pieces, still propelled by the soft lava, rise in heaps at the ex
 tremity, and tumbling over one another, they produce             a   particu
 lar noise heard at a considerable distance.              Such are the real
 characters of lavas, unknown to the author, who has never had
 the opportunity of observing them himself.
     My brother has been no less attentive to the saline and sul
 phureous substances observed on the sides of Vesuvius.                   The
 author says he was informed            letter, that the saline substance of
                                    by
                                    a
 which he had received a specimen, had flowed liquid from small       a
 aperture in the cone     of   Vesuvius.        think he might have judged
                                                I
himself, that this was impossible.           How could so small     a   quan
tity of matter, suspposed to be in igneous fusion, preserve the
 heat that   is  supposed to make       itliquid, while passing through     a
great thickness of old lavas, long reduced to the temperature of
the air  ?     This supposition, therefore,          absolutely improbable.

 My brother, who has carefully observed those substances that
appear on the surface of the old lavas towards the top of
Vesuvius, and has detached fragments of them preserved in our
collection, has invariably found that they had been, and con
tinued to be, produced in crevices which emif fumes           :    thus show

134   On the geological Theory supported by        Mr.   Smithson,
  With respect to the nature of lavas, — a most important point
concerning all the volcanic phenomena, with which the author
is totally unacquainted, — my hrother has found in it all the cha
racters of a combustible substance, which is burning before it
comes out, and continuing to burn outside as long as it retains a
sufficient heat.       This combustion is shown by the sulphureous
smoke that lavas emit all along their course.         But that smoke is
not the immediate product of the combustion ; it proceeds from
the decomposition of some elastic fluids, which, as long as they
find no vent, are the cause of the ascent of lavas in the cones.
    This circumstance is known to the inhabitants around Vesu^
vius ; for, when they observe almost a cessation of the smoke
issuing from its crater, they are in fearful expectation of the
consequences, as it indicates that some lava, ascending in the
 channel, has cooled and hardened in it.          The first consequence
 is earthquakes ; and the next probable event, which is very dan
gerous, is the bursting of a lava from some other part of the
 cone.     If that new lava flows over cultivated grounds, it s,ets on
fire trees, vines, and even houses.        But the new lava melting
 that which had stopped the channel, the smoke again issues
 from the crater, and these fatal effects cease.
     The showers of cinders sometimes emitted from the craters of
volcanoes, being an astonishing character of their operations, inT
 terested my brother very much, and he resolved to try whether it
 would be possible to observe it in the very crater of Vesuvius.
 At a time, therefore, when it was observed from Naples that
 such showers were frequently emitted, consisting of large red-hot
 masses mixed with smaller, always preceded by a thundering
 noise, and thrown up very high, which in the night appeared
  a most tremendous fire-work ; my brother, taking notice of a
 favourable circumstance, that of a strong wind which repelled,
 these ejections on one side of the crater, thought to avail him
 self of that opportunity.      He therefore set out immediately from
  Naples, and ascended the cone on the side against which blew
  the wind.
     Arrived at the top of the mount, he descended into the crater,
  and came as near the edge of the channel as he thought it pru
  dent.    At first he saw only some redness deep in the channel ;
  but after a little time he heard the thundering noise ; it began very
  deep ; then it was heard to ascend at the same time that the red
  matter rose ; and when its column arrived at a certain height, in
  apart of the channel which was wider, the elastic fluid that had
  pressed it so far upwards, burst through       it, and a shower was
  produced.      This  being
                          a    remarkable  phenomenon, not to be exr
  pected frequently     with the favourable  circumstance of   a  strong
  wind, my brother remained there      a   sufficient time to see  it re
  peated with its various degrees.                              Desirous;

     in his Paper fin    a saline Substance from          Mount Vesuvius.    135
    Desirous to know also in what state was the matter thus
thrown up very high, and falling in showers, he followed with
the sight some of the largest masses ; and observing in what part
of the crater they fell, he hastened there before another explo
sion : he found that they were come out very soft ; for the
largest, preserving longer their heat in their way through the
air, were flattened like cakes ; but the smaller masses, though
still red-hot, had preserved their various forms.
    It is from these ejections, carried out of the circumference of
the crater in different directions by strong winds, that are formed
the slopes of loose cinders whieh make the ascent to the crater
very difficult, because they slide under the feet : those, therefore,
who are not used to climb on all kinds of mountains, are obliged
to employ some men, ready there for that purpose. These men
have a belt, with a loop of string fixed to                it,
                                                   taken hold of by
the people who could not ascend without help, who are thus
 dragged up.                                .
    But my brother, used to climb the slopes of rubhish in the
 Alps, which oppose the same difficulty as those of cinders, judg
 ing that on the slopes of cinders might be found all the kinds of
 ejections from the crater of Vesuvius, walked over them at diffe
 rent times in different directions, with -expectation that they might
 lead to some knowledge both of the depth from which they pro
 ceeded, and of the kind of mineral strata through which they
 burst.    He was not disappointed in that hope            for he found
                                                                 :
 among the cinders large fragments of granite, sienite, of several
kinds of quartzeous stone, and of hard limestone             all of which
                                                                 ;
belonging     to the   lowermost   known  strata, indicate dearly that
the substance of which lava          formed lies under those strata.
                                     is
    Thus, when the real phaenomena are attentively studied, nothing
is  left for the work of imagination.           Ispermitted in presence

 nomena   ?    Had the author considered this, he could not have
 supposed that     a particular saline substance found on the slope of
 Vesuvius coukl lead to conclude that the internal part of the
 globe shows   it  to be an extinct sun or comet      while the ejections

demonstrated, as I have already had occasion to mention, by the
immense quantity of marine exuvice inclosed in the secondary
strata. Now this character is found in the same countries as the
volcanic eminences that are now the object, which I have parti
cularly described, along the left bank of the Rhine, between
Coblentz and Bonn, and in the country of Hessia.              These emi~
nences have all the characters of the actual volcanoes, and in
particular of Vesuvius.       In them and around them are seen not
only lavas   of different degrees of porosity and of mere scoria,
which successively flowed over each other, but between them
layers of cinders and an immense quantity of pumice-stones.
    The pumice-stones are a known circumstance belonging to
Vesuvius, but with a very remarkable character.             It is not an
ejection  from  the  crater,  or from any  known  part of that  volcano ;
it rises from the bottom of the sea, in parts where the water is
very hot.    My brother had the opportunity of discovering that
circumstance by a dog, who was fond of swimming by the side of
his boat, and sometimes cried out as being scorched by the
heat ; and my brother actually found the water hot by plunging his
hand into it. These are probably the places whence the pumice-
stones come up from the bottom of the sea : they are found floats
jng on the surface of the sea, as pumice-stone is specifically
lighter than salt water.
   Now this very important and known volcanic product is found
around some volcanic eminences near the Rhine.               I have seen
very extensive    beds   of  pumice-stones   on  the left  bank    of that
river opposite to Coblentz ; and in some places these beds of
pumice.stones are intermixed with distinct beds of cinders, thrown
up at some intervals from the crater of these volcanoes.           But on
this subject, as on the aqueous origin of our mineral strata,
there are too many circumstances all to be mentioned here ; I
must therefore refer the author to my descriptions.
   These are not the only remains of ancient volcanoes observed
on our continents.      In a new geological work which I have lately
published, under the title of Geologisal Travels through some
Parts of France, Switzerland and Germany, I have described in
the northern parts of the latter country a multitude of basaltic
hills, which evidently are volcanic from the nature of their sub
stance 3 but they are particularly interesting, as they afford a n^w
proof that some lavas come out from the bottom of the sea : these
lavas from their nature, when meeting red-hot the water of the
                                                               ' '
sea, were broken into the prismatic form of basalles.
   Of this effect my brother has seen an instance belonging to
modern volcanoes on the coast of Sicily, near Catana.              A lava
having flowed from the side of Mount Etna down to the sea, the
part which remained on the land retained the character of all
                                                                   lav as }

low-water, to be divided into the prismatic form which charac
terizes basalles.
   I hope, Sirs, that Mr. Smithson will read with interest in your
Journal the statement of various geological facts which he had not
had the opportunity of observing himself.        He will thus under
stand, surely, that geology is too extensive a science for a general
system being formed with any certainty, without having observed
the different characters of the surface of the earth, not in one
country only, but in many ; as in some countries the same phe
nomena are attended with others which may prevent mistakes.
And with respect to information received from countries unknown
to ourselves, he will also conceive that no reliance is to be placed
on the observations of those whose accounts manifest that they
have considered the phenomena with a mind prejudiced by some
previous hypothesis to which they are bigoted.
                    I have the honour to be, sirs,

  XXVII.     On the Pkcenomena of Sleep.       By a Correspondent.
The celebrated      physiologist Dr. Whytt suggested that conges
tion of blood in the head was the immediate cause of sleep.
Though this position was supported by a large induction of facts,
it soon fell into disrepute, upon the discovery of congestion under
circumstances no way analogous, as in lunacy, convulsions, insa
nity, and intoxication.      Dr. Whytt's views however have lately
been revived, and extended with some modifications to an ample
explanation of all the phenomena.         It is now ascertained that
there is a congestion of blood in the head during sleep ; but that
 congestion alone is insufficient, a retarded circulation being also
necessary.     For this modification we are indebted to Dr. Park,
the author of " \n Inquiry into the Laws of Animal Life." From
this work, which is a general outline of physiological science, the
grounds upon which the phenomena of sleep may be explained
are chiefly extracted.     This writer reasons entirely on an induc
tive or analytical process: that which I shall use will be syn
thetic, applying his principles to a very minute statement of facts,
and occasionally advancing ideas of my own.
    Two important facts are established in this work; one relating
to the connexion between the function of every organ and its ciri
culation, and the other to the changes incidental to the circula
tion itself. The former shows that the faculty of feeling and the
                                                               power

138                       On the Phenomena       of   Sleep.
power of motion are subject to change from every change in the
vessels.   Thus, when their action is diminished by cold, sensibility
and mobility are both impaired, while both are increased by                          •
warmth. In like manner a part is rendered morbidly sensible by
inflammation,     but restored to its natural state again by abstrac
tion of blood. The same observation holds equally true with the
function of mind, which changes with every change of circulation
in the brain.     Thus, when the action of vessels is moderately in
creased by wine, we feel exhilarated, and our ideas flow more ra
pidly; if hurried by taking it to excess, the powers of association
are confused, mid by inordinate congestion they are altogether
suspended, and a state of stupor comes on.              On the other hand,
diminished circulation has an opposite effect; the energies of mind
 are enfeebled by it; and if the abstraction of blood be excessive>
fainting and a suspension of mental powers will ensue.               The se
 cond fact illustrated in the work alluded to establishes the nature
 of the changes incidental to the circulation, and points out the
various modes, whether natural or artificial, by which the parti
cular state of the vessels inducing sleep may be brought on.                 It
js shown that the vessels, in common with all moving organs, un
 dergo periodical changes during action, which ultimately render
 them incapable of continuing          it,   and dispose them to relax.
 While congestion thus results from changes natural to all organs,
this state of relaxation      isalso shown to admit t>f being accelerated
 or retarded    by   variety
                     a         of   accidental and artificial means, and
 these     will be a principal object to investigate as we proceed.

     Sleep, then, results from two combined causes            1st.

                                                                      conges
 tion of blood   in  the 'brain    ; 2dly,A    retarded circulation — and  ;
it  will be found that every thing inducing these conditions pro
                                                      ,
 motes sleep, while .circumstances of        a  different tendency prevent
 its approach.      The horizontal posture of the body facilitates
 sleep, because, in that state, the heart        is relieved from the pres
 sure of some pounds of blood, which,                 the feeling of disten
                                                      by
tion, excites the vessels to action. The limbs also being at rest,
 do not employ such an exertion of muscular power as assists to
 make circulation more rapid.            From the diminished feeling of
 distension follows a relaxation of the vascular system, and mode.,
 rate congestion of blood, with retarded circulation, and conse
 quent sleep.    If,  however, the congestion he immoderate,               ex
                                                                           it

already a congestion nearly sufficient for sleep, so that a furtliee
increase produced by the horizontal posture would excite inordinatr
action. Nothing is required but a circulation somewhat slower
than ordinary, which, in vessels habitually inactive, readily ensues
from the unequal pressure on the seat, and the obstruction of the
dress, rendered more tight round the neck and waist by the pos
ture of the body.
     Exercise brings on sleep by the relaxation of vessels, which
naturally follows their continued exertion.        Hence the sound rest
of labouring men ; while persons confined to the house sleep very
lightly, their vessels not having been so far fatigued as to undergo
a full relaxation.      Children are found to sleep more frequently
and more soundly than old people ; the playfulness of the former
 60on inducing fatigue, more especially on account of their great
 mobility of fibre, — whereas the latter have few excitements to per
sonal exertion.      To this we may add, that the circulation in
 childhood is so full, that a slight retardation of the natural ac
 tion creates the requisite conditions, while in old age it is difficult
 to cause much congestion without exciting a degree of action,
 which at that time of life is inordinate.          Fatigue will induce
 sleep even under the most extraordinary circumstances, fre
 quently during intense cold, though the person is conscious that
he can never wake again.         The cold in this case cooperates with
 lassitude, by impairing the sensibility of the vessels.        The ha
 rassed soldier will repose in the trenches, and the malefactor be
 fore execution will yield himself up fatigued in mind and body by
 his violent emotions.       To the same head may be referred the
 cruel artifice of some nurses to make children sleep.         This plan
 consists in frightening them with the idea of some terrible object
 being in the room, so that they lie perfectly still, not daring to
 move a muscle.       This want of motion retards circulation, while
  terror, moreover,   constricts  the vessels so forcibly, though nearly
 exhausted with the play of a whole day, that relaxation and con
 gestion must soon succeed.         If fatigue has been such as to leave
  the muscles in a state approaching to inflammation, the period
  of rest will be a while retarded by painful distention and inordi
  nate action of vessels.
      It is found that sleep is induced by fixing the mind perma
  nently on one impression.        This phaenomenon may be referred
  to the principle, that attention to any one impression diminishes
  the feeling of others, and consequently the action which, when
  felt, they would produce.      If therefore the mind be diverted from
  attending   to the feeling  of  distension in the vessels, they will be
  less excited to action, will gradually relax, and ultimately undergo
  congestion.     Hence we are lulled by the murmuring of waters,

 enough to divert the attention from its general uniformity.               Id
 the same manner, in long stories of one tenor, we at last onlv hear
 the voice of the narrator, and finally fall asleep.          The exclusion
 of light, and the absence of promiscuous noises, by removing sti
 muli to the attention, have the same tendency.                Regular and
 gentle motion, by fixing      the mind   on  its own  uniform impression*
 lulls us to rest, as we daily witness in the effects of rocking upon           >
 children.     Thus also, if the head of a fowl be placed under it*
 own wing, and it be moved gently in a vertical circle, a few turns
 will lay it completely to rest. Here the warmth of the wing re
 laxes the vessels of the head, in which congestion is promoted by
 contortion of the neck, while the uniformity of motion completes
 the effect.    So also children are told to shut their eyes, and look
 steadily for some person that they will soon see ; and it is found
 that, while their attention is so directed, sleep very soon over.*
 powers them. Grief, when fully settled upon one object, has also
 a tendency to bring on heaviness, in which case congestion in the
head is evinced by red and swollen eyes, with other symptoms of
 distended vessels.                ,
    It is further found that every thing which causes a gentle re
laxation of vessels, will, by the concomitant congestion and re
tarded circulation, contribute to sleep.          Hence nightcaps, com
fortable beds, and the warmth of a         fire  after dinner, will all pro
mote drowsiness. If however the warmth be so great as to cause
immoderate congestion, with an accompanying inordinate action
in the circulating system, sleep is prevented, as we find by the un
easy restlessness arising from nightcaps too thick and beds too
downy. As internal impressions excite contraction, so those which
are external cause relaxation ; and upon the principles stated, the
latter ought to create sleep. As pleasurable feelings operate in a
similar manner, their effects ought to be the same. Hence we
incline to sleep by the pleasing sensation of a full meal, which at
the same time operates by its external impression on the vessels of
the stomach, already predisposed to relax by the exertion of the
day.      If,however, the system be not predisposed to relax fully,
a  hearty meal rather exhilarates,      by  augmenting vascular motion    ;
and  if   a heavy supper   be   taken,  sleepis   disturbed from irregular
circulation,   which   results  from  its unequal pressure on the arte
rial system. From the relaxation following external impressions,
children and the inferior animals are lulled to sleep          by   agentle
friction of the head. On the principle that the idea of an impres
sion produces effects similar to the impression itself, some persons
feel propensity to sleep from thinking of
    a                                              it,  or become drowsy
in company from the very apprehension         ;    and  we find birds go to
roost   in   tptal eclipse of the sun.

 tfelaxes at stated intervals, so that a lady of fashion will be quite
lively at a period when the regular citizen is seized with an irresisti
ble drowsiness.      Habit will, moreover, so far divert the attention
from feelings generally causing action, that some persons can sleep
*hile standing upright, or sitting on horseback.
     Upon the principles laid down, it will not be difficult to explain
 the operation of some other means by which sleep may be pro
 moted or prevented.       If the skull be laid open, and the cerebrum
gently pressed upon,     the  animal sleeps from the retarded circula
tion and congestion induced.        Opium and extreme cold, by im
pairing the sensibility of the vessels, diminish their resistance
to the contained fluids, thus retarding circulation, and removing
any opposition to congestion.        Wine taken to excess, after a cer
tain period naturally disposes to sleep ; for its primary effect being
to increase circulation, and accumulate blood in the head, — as
•oon as relaxation succeeds to inordinate action of vessels, the
brain will be under every circumstance requisite for repose. Strong
tea, both by its sensible impression on the mouths of the vessels,
and by the relaxing effect of warmth, promotes secretion, unloads
the vessels, and so far removes congestion, and quickens circula
tion, as to promote wakefulness.         Opium indeed causes relaxa*
tion of vessels, by impairing their sensibility; but instead of in
creasing it usually diminishes secretion, and does not therefore
remove congestion, but increases it.         Acids on the contrary, by
promoting secretion,     unload  the vessels, and, like tea, remove the
foporific  effects of opium.
    Such are the very numerous facts referable to Dr. Park's prin
ciples ; and should any material points have been passed over,
there can be little doubt that they also would reduce themselves
to' the same explication.      He has extended his researches on this
head to the phaenomena of Dreaming, Incubus, and Somnambu
lism.

    Upon a superficial examination of the varieties of kelp me£
with in the market, we soon become convinced that this sub
stance differs prodigiously with regard to its external qualities as
well as chemical composition.      An extended series of experiments
lately made upon different varieties of kelp, gives me reason to
state, that some sorts contain, besides carbonate of soda and the
usual salts peculiar to the sea-weeds from which kelp is ob
tained, a considerable portion of subcarbonate of potash.         Others
abound in sulphurets ; again others^ are almost wholly composed
of common salt, with scarcely a notable portion of mineral alkali ;
whilst others again furnish from 2 to 3{ per cent. of mineral al
kali. In certain varieties of kelp we find a large quantity of sul
phurets, and others again are almost free from sulphur.
    This difference of composition is unquestionably owing to the
mode in which kelp is prepared, as well as the articles of which
it is manufactured.     1 am enabled to sta^e from good authority,
which I have received from different quarters, concerning the
manufacture of this article, that in some places a considerable
quantity of fern, [Pteris aquilina Linn.,] and woods of all kind,
are burnt, together with the leafy Juci, for the production of
kelp ; and that in other districts, a mixture of common salt, sul
phur, and the ashes of peat and brushwood, is added to facilitate
the complete fusion of the ashes of the sea-weeds, to effect which,
is said to require a considerable degree of practical knowledge
of the kelp manufacture.
   Without entering into a further detail concerning other abuses
committed in the~manufacture and sale of kelp, some of which
are practised with a view of giving to British kelp the appearance
of Sicilian or Teneriffe barilla, I shall confme myself, on the pre
sent occasion, merely to point out the characters by which the
variety of kelp best suited for the preparation of iode, may be
discriminated, from those sorts which contain almost none of this
substance, or from which at least it cannot be obtained with
out much trouble and expense; and I shall likewise state the
processes and practical proceedings which I have found to an
swer best to obtain this substance.
    Kelp from which iode may readily be procured in the manner
to be mentioned presently, is of a deep blueish-gray colour.           It
readily  attracts moisture when   exposed    to a damp atmosphere,   and
then becomes intensely black.       It is of a moderate hardness, and
may easily be pulverized.      Its recent fracture is minute cellular,
porous, and earthy [not crystalline] .      It emits a faint sulphureous
odour when moistened with water or dilute acids. It possesses,
a saline alkaline tsiste.   It affords from 2| to 3| per cent. of
carbonate of soda,    and  when   kept in a dry place it becomes co
                                                                   vered

             ofl the new Svlslance called lode, or Iodine.               143
vered with a white efflorescence.         By these characters kelp con
taining   iode   in considerable  quantity may readily be recognised.
    Those varieties of kelp which are of a greenish gray colour
and crystalline fracture, which emit a strong sulphureous odour
when moistened with water or dilute acids, which are of stony
hardness, and do not readily attract water from a damp air, are
almost unfit for the preparation of it ; they yield but very little
iode, and the means of extracting it from those varieties are
tedious and difficult.
    The best kelp is said to be manufactured in those places where
the sea-weeds are cut down by means of a scythe from the rocks
situated between the high- and low-water mark, as i» the prac
tice in the North of Scotland ; and the worst kelp is said to be
 made in those places where it is customary to pull up the algce,
 or leafy marine fuci, from the rocks by the roots, by means of
 rakes or grappling irons, as is practised by the peasantry in some
 kelp districts on the Irish and English coasts.
    Those who are desirous of preparing iode [and who is there
 among the cultivators of chemistry that is not ?] will do well to
 avoid useless trouble by first assaying the kelp they wish to em
 ploy for that purpose, before they proceed to operate upon it.
     To accomplish this object, put a few ounces of           it,
                                                                previously
 pulverised, into a glass or earthenware funnel, and suffer eight
 or ten ounces of cold water to trickle or run over and through it,
 very slowly, so as to wash out the easily soluble matter which             it
 contains.
     To cause the water to pass readily through the mass, and to
 obtain the fluid clear at once, a few large pieces of kelp ought
 first to be introduced into the throat of the funnel     ;   a stratum of
 smaller pieces should be put upon these, and the finer powdered
 kelp placed over all.       When the water has run through the mass,
  pour the obtained solution back again upon the kelp in the . fun
 nel, and repeat this operation for several times.       This being done,
  evaporate the lixivium to about two-thirds of it? bulk        ;   a consi
 derable quantity of salt will become deposited during the evapo
 ration;    remove it    from time to time, and lastly evaporate the
  remaining    fluid  to dryness.    Transfer the mass into     a crucible,
  and fuse   it   for
                    a     few minutes.    From the appearance of the
  melted substances when cold, some conjecture may be formed
  concerning the nature of the kelp with regard to its contents of
  iode.   If  the mass exhibits   a   bright peach-blossom colour, we
  may predict      that it  abounds   in iode; if   itpossesses     flesh or
                                                                    a
  very pale   rose  colour,   contains
                             it       a   less quantity of this substance      ;
  andif it  is   colourless, porcellaneous, resembling white enamel,        it
  then is  almost destitute of it.
     The presence of iode may likewise be rendered obvious,                 by
                                                                        adding

 144                       Further Observations
adding first sulphuric acid in excess to a lixivium of kelp freed
by simple evaporationj of the greatest portion of salt which it
contains; then evaporating this solution to dryness, and again
heating it in a flask or retort, with an additional quantity of sul.'
phuric acid.      If it contains iode, the mass now will acquire a
rose colour,     more   or less intense, according to the quantity of
iode present ; the vessel in which the assay is made will become
filled with a beautiful violet-coloured vapour ; and a dense yel
low or* orange-coloured fluid, which is sulphuret of iode, will con
dense and run down in strie on the sides of the vessel.           If the
solution abounds in hydrosulphurets, the sulphur which becomes
precipitated by the admixture of sulphuric acid should be re
moved before the solution is distilled with sulphuric acid.
                                    Or,
     The before-mentioned dry salt, containing the iode of soda,&C.
may be heated for a few minutes with half a part of its weight
of red oxide of lead, and then distilled with sulphuric acid.
If it contains iode, a violet-coloured vapour will become disen
gaged.
                       Method     of obtaining Iode.
    To procure iode (or iodine) in the most expeditious and
cheapest manner, from kelp, proceed as follows :
     Fill a conical bag, made of coarse linen, or any porous ma
terial, with powdered kelp. Suspend the bag in some convenient
manner, and suffer cold water to trickle through the kelp in as
slow a way as possible.         Four parts of water are thus sufficient
to lixiviate one of kelp. Pour the lixivium which runs from the
bag, back again upon the kelp, and repeat this operation for three
or four times successively. The obtained fluid will be perfectly
transparent, and almost colourless.         Evaporate this solution in
a Wedgwood-ware bason, and remove the salt which becomes
deposited from time to time.           The quantity of salt that falls
down, will diminish as the lixivium becomes concentrated. When
no more salt becomes separated during the ebullition of the fluid,
or when the quantity deposited is but small, the solution may be
evaporated to dryness.         This being done, transfer into a crucible
the obtained saline mass which contains the iodine of soda, &c.
and expose it to a dull red heat. When the mass begins to melt,
a lambent pale blue flame will make its appearance ; and when
this has ceased, pour out the melted matter upon a slab, pulverise
it coarsely, and preserve it for use.
     To obtain iode from this substance, mix it with one-fourth of it«
Weight of red oxide of lead, and decompose it with sulphuric acid,
taking care to add this fluid as long as any effervescence         takes
place,    and proceed   as  stated No.  189,  page 57, PhiL  Magazine,

           on the new Substance called lode, or Iodme.                        145
   If the operation is to be performed on a tolerably large scale,
that is to say, if a pound, or pounds, of the partly-desulphuretted
salt are operated upon at once, the process is most eommodiously
performed by means of an alembic. The iode sublimes in the ca
pital of the alembic in beautiful prismatic needles, possessing a
metallic splendour ; and the residuary saline mass may readily
be removed by the assistance of warm water.
   If two or three ounces of the salt are submitted to the opera*
tion, the following process is convenient :                      te
   Take a flask holding three times the bulk of the salt, adapt
to the neck of  it, by means of luting,   a glass tube about 12 or 18
inches long, and from 3.8ths to half an inch          the bore.
                                                        in           Pour
into the flask first, two parts of sulphuric acid, and then, one
part of the uncrystallizable salt containing the iode.       .    violent
                                                                     A
action ensues, and the flask becomes filled with          dense violet-
                                                             a
coloured vapour.       When the action has ceased, apply a gentle
heat till no more violet-coloured       fumes become disengaged.
Then remove the tube, into which the iode will be found sub
limed.     Wash out the crystals with small portions of water,
and dry the product without heat on unsized paper, placed on
a  chalk-stone.     The iode thus obtained          not pure.
                                                   is                     It   is
usually soiled with some sulphuret of iode, and hence has a
strong odour resembling chlorine.         Itstains every part of the
ekin,  and  other  animal  matter, with  a bright orange colour the       ;
stain lasts for some days, and only disappears                  by
                                                            the natural
change of the cuticle, so that in dead matter       it  indelible.     In
this stateit  becomes converted    by heat, not into     a is
                                                        violet-coloured
gas, but into  a  rose-coloured gazeous fluid.
   To obtain the iode in     a  pure state, mingle two parts of                it
with one of chalk freed from water by previous exposure to
                                               a                               a
moderate heat, or with quicklime      ; put the mixture into a glass
tube, eight or ten inches long and three quarters of an inch in
the bore, furnished at one extremity with          ball, and then re-
                                                   a
sublime the iode into the colder extremity of the tube,              by
                                                                 heating
the ball of the tube over   a spirit lamp.

iode in the manner above stated, .redissolve      in three or four

this in fact forms the cheapest process of obtaining it.                  If the
waste lee contains much animal matter, soap, &c. it then is es

    Before I conclude this paper, I beg leave to state, that I have
 reason to believe that iode does not exist in barilla ; although
 I spoke otherwise in my former letter. The kelp upon which I
operated, being delivered to me under the name of a sample of
barilla, was the cause of the deception into which I was led on
that occasion.         Indeed, there exists much confusion in the mar
 ket between      the    articles of kelp and barilla.       The latter is fre
 quently adulterated or mixed with kelp in so dexterous a manner,
 that even the most skilful dealers in these commodities are of ten
 deceived.      Those who have an opportunity of readily rendering,
 the lixivium of kelp caustic, in the usual manner by quicklime,
will do well so to do. The obtained salt, containing the iode,
when then distilled with sulphuric acid and red oxide of lead, doe*
not effervesce, and the distillatory vessels employed for that pur
pose may be of a less capacity.

                               By M. Bucholz*.
M     . Bucholz, after having referred to the different memoir*
which have appeared, on the subject of the camphoric acid since
the discovery of Kosegarten to that of M. Bouillon-Lagrange, ha*
thought it his duty to publish his own observations on the sub

    The method of proceeding which appeared to M. Bucholz to
be the best adapted for avoiding loss, consisted in treating two.
ounces of camphor with a pound and a. half of nitric acid of the
•pecific gravity of 1.250, to which he adds half a pound of pure
nitric acid of the specific gravity of 1.550, rectifying the whole'
three times successively by employing a middling degree of heat,
and taking away about half the liquor every time, or the quantity
which is necessary that the whole of the camphor might be con-

    The camphoric acid, at the end of the evaporation, is found
 above the fuming nitric acid, under the form of a white and buty-
 raceous substance.       It is separated by means of a glass funnel,
 redissolved in boiling water and crystallized again, in order to se
parate from it all the excess of nitric acid.           This acid perfectly
pure weighed     five drachms,    exclusive   of that  which still remained
in the concentrated nitric acid,       and   which  might amounf to one
 drachm and a half.        This process therefore seems to abridge the
ordinary manipulation.         It appears that the great art consists in
 not pushing the distillation with too much activity, particularly
 towards the end of the operation, because we might run the risk
of decomposing part of the camphoric acid formed by the nitric
 acid in excess, which may always be observed by the brown co
 lour which the residue then assumes.
    The form of the crystallized camphoric acid is feathery like
that of the muriate of ammonia, as M. Bouillon-Lagrange has
 observed : this crystalline form is very different from all those of
the acids composed of several radicals, and particularly from that
 of the benzoic acid.

 weighing 45 grains.       The filter    that one part of benzoic acid

estimating what might be rev

this acid, when its temperature

he would have been right ; for

not agree with those of M. Bou

that the sublimate is not solu

not redden turnsole paper. Rut
he must have certainly been
led into an error by a part of
the sublimate surcharged with
 empyreumatic oil.

 camphoric acid had also an
 aromatic smell like oil of rose

     In spite of the difference between the camphoric and benzoic
 acids as above exhibited, I thought it right to subject them to'
 some new experiments, with a view particularly to neutralize them
 by some bases, in order to observe the properties of their salts.

of lime, and is a little acrid,
 which distinguishes it consi
derably from calcareous ben-

     It  must    also be remarked,
that always when this acid is

   The want of time and of greater quantity of camphoric acid

prevented me from prosecuting the foregoing researches         shall               :   I
content myself therefore with   brief recapitulation of the proper
                                 a
ties of these two acids —
                        :
    1.The camphoric acid    isconstantly crystallized upon cooling
in the form of quill feathers, as observed    M. Bouillon-Lagrange.
                                                     by
The benzoic acid in the same circumstances crystallizes either in
needles or in lamine, or under a ribband form.
   2. The camphoric acid has         decided acid taste, and leaves
                                     a                                                          a
bitter smack. The benzoic acid          mild, sweetish, scarcely acid,
                                          is
and  a  little pungent.
   3. The camphoric acid, in order to be dissolved, requires 100
parts of water, at a temperature of 15 Reaumur, and 10 or 11
                                                     '
parts of boiling water.      The benzoic acid requires 200 parts of
cold water, and a    little more than 24 of boiling water.
   4.         of camphoric acid dissolved in one part of alcohol at
a   middling temperature, and    it   should seem that              it   is   dissolved         in
all proportions in boiling alcohol.      The benzoic acid   dissolved         is
in two' parts of alcohol at middling temperature, and
                            a                                requires         it
weight equal   to its own   of boiling alcohol.

different fro"m those formed     the benzoic acid, as may be seen

 ^an. 27.   The     Right Hon. President in the chair.      A long pa
  per by Dr. Brewster was read, giving a detailed account of hi*
 numerous experiments on light, in addition to those which have
  already been laid before the Society.      Dr. B. has investigated
 with great care the laws which govern the reflexion of light, and
 ascertained that its polarization discovered by Malus is not a ge
 neral but a particular law.    The phenomenon of double reflexion
 has engaged his attention, but it is not possible to convey any
 adequate idea of his new observations and discoveries without
 drawings in this brief report.
     Feb, 3.    Sir Humphry Davy communicated to the Society a
long    account  of his very accurate and ingenious experiments on
 the fluoric principle.   Fluor is one of the many substances which
present great difficulties to the inexperienced operator, and pro
 mise no brilliant results to reward his labour ; consequently it
remained almost unexamined till the important discoveries of this
philosopher naturally led him to investigate its nature and pro
perties.     His former experiments developed many new and cu
rious analogies of nature ; his present confirm the observation that
hydrogen produces as many acids as oxygen, and that it unites to
the peculiar base, which he calls fluorine, to constitute fluoric
acid. His first opinion, founded on analogy, that silica and boron
were metals, he here abandons, and considers them also as pecu
liar undecomposed substances, which, in the present state of our
knowledge, must be admitted as elements, the same as oxygen,
hydrogen, chlorine and fluorine.       The result of many complex
and delicate experiments     is, that fluo-borats can never be pro
duced without the aid of hydrogen          and finally that, contrary
                                           ;
to the supposition of Berzelius and others, who have argued the
point with at least as much zeal for distinction as truth, chlorine
contains no oxygen.
  A    short paperby   Mr. A. Carlisle was read on Monstrosities, a»
an appendix to his remarks on Zerah Colbourn         ; the purport of
which was, that both sacred and profane history record examples
of hereditary monstrosity, particularly in supernumerary fingers
and toes and that these extra-appendages are generally attached
        ;
to the outer side of the hands and feet, very rarely to the inner,
and almost never to any other limb.
    Feb. 10.     Mr. Brodie (through the Society for promoting      a
Knowledge of Animal Chemistrv) communicated an account of
his observations and experiments on the influence of the nerves on
glandular secretion, particularly that of the 8th pair.     In conse
                                                                quence

                            Royal Society.                          155
quence of his having found much secreted fluid in the stomach of
dogs poisoned with arsenic, he determined to ascertain, if possible,
whether such secretion was an effect of the poison or of the
nerves ; and after dividing the nerve which communicates with
that organ, he inserted some arsenic into the thigh of a dog,
which shortly after died ; but on examining the stomach, al
though the usual appearances of inflammation were present, no
secreted matter was found.       The experiments were repeated and
varied   several times with  similar results ; nevertheless, the author
admits that all such experiments on living bodies are inconclu
sive ; that although it is extremely probable the nerves contribute
to effect secretion, yet it cannot be demonstrated indubitably by
any direct experiments ; in other words, that all the positive
knowledge acquired by his experiments is but a small atonement
for the torture inflicted on so many animals.
     A Letter from Mr. Koenig to the Right Hon. President was
also read, describing the fossil human skeleton brought from
 Guadaloupe to this country by Admiral Sir A. Cochrane, and de
posited in the British Museum.         This singular fossil was found
on the shores of Guadaloupe below high -water mark, among cal
 careous rocks formed of madrepores, &c., and not very remote
from the volcano called the Souffriere; the block containing the
 human skeleton is eight feet long, two broad, and weighs about
 two tons ; it is a very hard granular limestone resembling calca
 reous sand-stone, containing a few venus and other shells, some
 of which are unknown.        The skeleton is tolerably perfect, with
 the exception of the skull and some vertebras of the neck, which
 are wanting.     Sir H. Davy found some phosphate of lime in the
 hones, proving the presence of animal matter.        Mr. K. does not
 pretend to guess at the age of this fossil skeleton ; but Sir Joseph
 Banks, whose experience and observation are more extensive,
 considers it of very modern formation.        Other fossil bones have
 been found in the same vicinitv, and calcareous masses or rocks
 continue forming there.       This circumstance seems to sanction
 the judicious opinion of the learned President ; and taking into
 consideration the contiguity of a volcano, the probability of the
 temperature of the water being considerably raised at some times,
 and the known fact that carbonate of lime dissolved in water is
 afterwards deposited in a comparatively short period in masses of
 very hard and solid stone — every person may be convinced of
 the rapidity of the formation and also of the hardness of such
 stone, by inspecting the inside of tea-kettles in which water vul
 garly called hard is boiled.
     Feb. 17.    The doctrine of animal heat, or rather the compa
 rative heat of arterial and venous blood, has occupied the atten
  tion of Mr. John Davy, who communicated the result of his la
                                                                  bours

      bours in this department of science to the Society.       The expe
       riments of- Crawford being performed at a time when the process
      and means of analysis were much less perfect than at present, it
      is necessary they should be repeated before they can be received
       as correct results in the actual state of our knowledge.  Mr. Daw
      operated on the blood of sheep and lambs ; and it must be con
      fessed that the detail of his experiments will be read with more
      pleasure, that no animal experienced any pain from his researches.
       He began by depriving arterial and venous blood of fibrine, ascer
      taining their specific gravity, the former being 1047 and tiie lat
     ter 1050, placing them in glasses of equal dimensions, filling a
      similar glass with water raised to the same temperature, and ob
      serving their relative rate of cooling. In different experiments he
      found arterial blood 93T?ff and venous 92, a result altogether in
      compatible with the theory of Crawford, but reconcileable with
      that of Dr. Black or the opinion of Mr. Brodie.        The posterior
      portion of the brain he found from 1 to 2 degrees higher than the
    _ anterior,
                  and both were as much lower than the rectum.        The
      heat of the body generally diminishes in proportion to the distance
      from the heart.      (This fact is not Very consistent with the no
      tion of the nerves occasioning animal heat, as its focus is not very
      replete with nerves.) In general the temperature of arterial blood
      was from 1 to  .\\     degree higher than that of venous;       only
      one degree was observed between the heat of the blood in the
     left and right ventricle of the heart.      A newly born child raised
     the thermometer to 96 ; after three days it rose it to 99.       Mr.
     Davy also made a variety of experiments on all parts of the body,
     with a view of ascertaining their relative heat ; he avoided all
     theoretical speculations, hut seemed somewhat inclined to the
     supposition of Dr. Black respecting the origin of animal heat.
          Fart of a paper, by Mr. Ivory, on Comets, was read, in which
     this acute mathematician expounded the judicious theory of
     Newton, described their parabolic motion, &c. ; but much of his
     communication was of a nature not to be read.

  had so far melted as to leave the ground in general bare, a circular disk of
  earth was discerned round the roots of the stems of the trees and shrubs in
  the garden ; a circumstance which seems to show that heat was trans
  mitted from vegetable bodies. Tf vegetables as well as animals did not pos
  sess internal sources of heat, it seems that their juices must be frozen
  during hard frosts, and life often destroyed. The circumstance above al
  luded to corroborated this doctrine, and inclines one to think that the
  communication of the warmth is more considerable than is usually ima
  gined.

    Feb. 12. — Overcast and dark day. The conflagration of the
Custom-house occasioned a curious pheenomenon this morning.
Looking out of the window, I observed the air replete with de
tachments of a black light substance, which on minute inspec
tion appeared to be fragments of burnt paper, coming over from
the south in a very gentle wind, from the fire at the Custom
house.     These papers must have been carried to a great height
in the air ; for after the lower current of wind got to E., which it
did for a short time, I observed numerous portions of the said papers
coming also from that quarter.       Whether they were carried up
aloft merely by the current of heated air from the fire, or whe
ther the explosion of the gunpowder which took place heaved
 them up on high, is uncertain ; their long continued appear
ance, and the extent to which they were carried, (for they went
«ome miles into Essex,) seems to indicate the former cause.
    Feb. 13. — Clouded still day, wind southerly.        The floods,
which have been more or less out ever since .the thaw, are daily
abating, and the water-mills on the Lea work again as usual.

    P.S. — In  a former paper,    and also in my Researches about
 Atmospheric Phenomena, p. 92, I noticed that the changes of
 wind appeared to take place first above, and to be continued
 downwards.      Some experiments made with Thermometers sus
 pended at different heights, have induced me to believe the same
 thing to happen with respect to the changes of temperature.         It
 would be a good thing to try this by repeated observations on
 Mr. Six's or the self-registering Thermometer hung at different
 altitudes along high-erected poles.      The instruments might be
 drawn up and down the poles by     means of strings hung over pulleys
 at the top. The old May-poles, which still remain in many of our
 country villages, might be converted to this use.       Paper kites,
 too, might be made large enough to carry up Thermometers at
 their tails.

XXXII. An       Attempt to determine the definite and simple Pro
   portions,   in which the constituent Parts of unorganic Sub
   stances  are  united with each other.      By Jacob Berzelius,

     '     II. Laws for the Formation of Subsalts.
Every       chemist knows what is understood by neutral salts;
but it is by no means easy to give a good definition of what is
properly neutral.      If we take that condition of alkaline salts, in
which both the acid and the base are perfectly indifferent, so as
to produce no reaction on vegetable colours, as an example of
neutrality, it seems that we ought to consider those salts only as
neutral, in which the same quantity of oxygen in the base com
bines with the acid, as in these alkaline salts, and which in double
decompositions would set neither acid nor base at liberty.      Davy,
in his Essay on Electricity as a chemical agent, calls every com
bination neutral, in which the original electric reactions have
ceased. This is in fact the only correct and scientific conception
of a neutral combination ; but it is only relative. For, according
to this determination, the oxygen in the protoxide of lead, for ex
ample, must be neutralised ; it no longer acts on the greater
 number of bodies as a [negatively] electrical substance, yet still
 retains the same relation to more combustible bodies, for in
 stance, to potassium.      Exactly the same is true of neutral salts.
 While potass and soda saturate a quantity of sulphuric acid,
 which contains three times as much oxygen as themselves, so
 completely, that the acid loses its powers, this is by no means the
 case with the protoxide of zinc, the oxide of iron, alumina, or
 zirconia. The attractions of these bases being extremely weak,
 every substance, which comes into contact with the salts, makes
 an effort to deprive them of a part of the acid : hence the action
 of the acid is still perceptible, and the salts appear not to be neu
 tral, although they are the most neutral combinations of which
 the bases are susceptible. We are accustomed to call them super-
 salts, because the acid possesses the strongest powers, and con
 sequently exhibits its effects most distinctly on the taste, and on
 vegetable colours.     But when we consider the combinations of
 the weaker acids with the stronger bases, we find, that the base
 always exhibits its powers the most obviously.         Thus, for ex
 ample, the common deliquescent carbonated potass is sometimes
 called a subsalt ; although the carbonic acid is united in it with
 the same quantity of oxygen, as in the carbonate of baryta or of
 lime, and these three salts are consequently in the same com-

parative state of saturation.       And that both these earthy salts
are neutral, appears from the sufficiency of the force of cohesion
in both to prevent the predominant actions of their very powerful
bases.
    We may therefore, I believe, consider all those earthy and me
tallic salts as neutral, in which the acid is united with as much
of oxygen in the base, as is found in another decidedly neutral
combination of the same acid with an alkali or an alkaline earth.
Thus, I consider as neutral all those sulphates, in which the base
contains one-third as much oxygen as the acid ; and all arseniates,
carbonates, muriates, and phosphates, in which the base con
tains half as much oxygen as the acid.          Salts in which there is
more oxygen than this in the acid, I call super salts; and subsalts,
those in which there is less.
    In the first series of my experiments on definite proportions,
I have adduced two examples of subsulphates. I thought that I
had found that in the sulsulphate of the oxide of iron the acid
was combined with four times as much of the base as in the
neutral salt, an opinion which appeared to be confirmed by a su-
perficial examination of the subsulphate of the oxide of copper,
But as I obtained more correct ideas on this subject, it appeared
that the rule for the relation of the oxygen of the acid to that of
the base by no means agreed with this determination : for, if the
result of the analysis had been correct, the oxygen of the acid
would have been      f  of that of the base, and neither an integral
multiple    nor  a  submultiple.    I therefore repeated the analyses
with greater accuracy.
                 1.  Subsulphate  of the Oxide of Iron.
    I  dissolved some red oxide of iron in concentrated sulphuric
 acid ; I heated the mixture until the acid was completely sa
turated, then dissolved the salt in water, filtered the solution,       i
 decomposed it with caustic ammonia, but so as not to precipi
tate the whole of the oxide, and digested the fluid for 24 hours
upon the precipitate ; which was then washed on a filter, as long
 as the presence of any sulphuric acid was indicated by the test
 of a salt of baryta.    The salt, when well dried, had completely
 the appearance of the common precipitated oxide.            When de
 prived of its water over a spirit lamp,, which expelled from it no
 thing but pure water, it left a red powder, exactly like the col-
 cothar of vitriol.    Ten grammes of this powder, strongly ignited,
 left behind 7'9S of oxide of iron, 'and disengaged sulphurous' acid
 during the operation : the remaining oxide, dissolved in muriatic
 acid, and tested with a salt of baryta, afforded no perceptible
 trace of sulphuric acid.
     In this subsalt, therefore, 202 parts of sulphuric acid were
                                                                 united

                        On definite Proportions.                   163-
united with 79.8 of oxide of iron, containing 24'47 of oxygen,
while the acid contained 12.12 ; or, without any material error,
half as much as the oxide. We Isee therefore that in the sub-
sulphate of the oxide of iron the acid saturates six times as much
of the base as in the neutral sulphate ; for, according to the
analysis of the neutral sulphate, which I have already described,
 100 parts of sulphuric acid saturate 65 .5 of the oxide of iron,
and 65.5 x 6 =393.        But, according to the present analysis of
the subsulphate, 100 parts of the acid are combined in it with
395 of the oxide ; and the difference is so small that it can only
be attributed to an error of observation.
    I then collected a quantity of orange-yellow ochre, which had
formed itself from a vitriolic solution in a vitriol work ; I washed
it carefully, and dried it in the sun. When the water was ex
pelled over a spirit lamp, it had lost 21*7 per cent.     By ignition
it lost 15 .9 per cent. more of sulphuric acid, and the remaining
red unmagnetical oxide amounted to 62.4 per cent.          According
to this experiment, 100 parts of sulphuric acid combine, in the
subsalt, with 392.52 of the oxide, and the yellow ochre is thus
constituted :
               Sulphuric acid            15'9      100
               Oxide of iron            62.4       392.52
             Water                   21.7
The quantity of water contains 19.15, the oxide of iron 19.13,
and the sulphuric acid 9.54 parts of oxygen.   Consequently the
base and the water contain equal quantities of oxygen, and the
acid exactly half as much oxygen : so that, notwithstanding the
great difference in their appearance, the yellow ochre and the
brown red precipitate are exactly the same combination.    I am
sorry that the former analysis was made at a time when I had
not begun to collect any observations respecting the water of
crystallization.
   I was not a little anxious to know why this result differed so
much from my former analysis of the same salt, and therefore
prepared some more of the compound in the manner which I had
then employed ; dissolving some iron in diluted sulphuric acid,
to which, for the sake of increasing the quantity of the oxide, I
had added a little nitric acid.        When nothing more was dis
solved,  I  put, in order to expedite the separation of the subsalt, a
piece of polished iron into the filtered solution, and exposed       it,
in an open vessel, to   a    temperature of 25° or 30° [77° to 86°]
for several days,   1   thus obtained    a  considerable quantity of an
ochre-coloured powder, possessing the characteristic property of
the subsulphate of iron which    I    first analysed
                                                   ;   itwas very little
soluble   iu muriatic acid, and when dried scarcely at all so, and
was not altered   by   caustic potass.    When first dried this pow-

der, after washing it well, in the sunshine, and then heated it in
a small glass retort, I obtained in the receiver some water strongly
impregnated with ammonia, amounting to 18*5 per cent.                 By
ignition 32 per cent. of sulphuric acid was expelled, and 49.5
per cent. of red unmagnetic oxide was left behind.           It appears
therefore that, in my earlier experiments, the nitric acid, which
I had employed for oxidating the iron, and which I then thought
it unnecessary to mention particularly, had produced a combina
tion of a totally different nature from the pure subsalt ; and I had,
in all probability, examined a mixture of these substances. This
ammoniacal combination is very reniarkable; it appear* to be a
triple subsalt, analogous to the ammoniacal copper.          When heat
is applied, the sulphuric acid, which had been in combination
with the ammoma, unites with the oxide of iron, and the am
monia is set at liberty.    This substance., in its difficult solubility
in acids, and in its incapability of being altered by caustic alkalis,
seems to approach in seme degree to the triple combinations of
ammonia with muriatic acid and tin, described by Davy, and to
the combination with muriatic acid and phosphoric oxide.              As
I had probably obtained only a mixture of this substance with
the subsalt of the oxide, I thought it useless to attempt a more
correct determination of its component parts.         But I shall en
deavour on a future occasion to obtain the combination in a state
of purity, and to examine the proportions of its constitution.
    It is demonstrated by the analysis of the pure subsalt of the
oxide of iron, that the relation between the iron and the sulphur,
which I had inferred from my first analysis, is incorrect.           We
shall see in the following analyses, that in the subsulphates, the
oxygen of the acid is either equal to that of the base, or an in
tegral submultiple of it.      And hence it will follow, that, in all
the subsulphates, the sulphur is in such a proportion to the metal,
that its quantity is ail integral submultiple of the quantity in the
sulphuret at a minimum, or of the quantity in the neutral sul
phate of the protoxide of iron.      In the salt of the oxide of iron
here described,    thy proportion of the sulphur to the iron is ex
 actly one-fourth of the quantity in the sulphuret at a minimum,
and in the sulphate of the protoxide.
    I must here call the attention of the reader to a circumstance,
which is of the highest importance for the completion of the
 doctrine of defmite proportions in mixtures, and without attend
ing to which, we can scarcely hope ever to see the doctrine of
the combination of organic bodies sufficiently illustrated : that    is,
to the existence of the* absolute minimum      of  the combination of
 one substance with another, of which all other combinations must
 be multiples.    Since only very few degrees of combination can
 exist between two bodies separately, that      is, without the inter
                                                                vention

mention of one or more other bodies; and since these perhaps
never, or at feast very rarely, exhibit combinations at a minimum,
we are obliged to seek for these minima in more complicated
modes of combination.       It will be difficult to discover the true
minimum ; but every good experiment, made with this view, will
be productive of interesting consequences.       The subsalt of iron,
just analysed, may      serve as an example in illustration of this re
mark.     If  we should hereafter discover no combination of the
sulphuric acid with a greater quantity of iron in the salts of the
protoxide or oxide, and should the proportion of the sulphur to
the iron, found in this experiment, be the greatest common di
visor of all the numbers expressing the proportions which are
found in the mixtures of sulphur with iron, we might be allowed
to hope that we had found the minimum of sulphur with which
iron could combine ; 100 parts of iron here being united with
 14.66 of sulphur.      In the magnetical pyrites, called the su'phuret
at a minimum, because it is the lowest stage of combination
which can be separately exhibited, or in the neutral sulphate of
the protoxide of iron, 100 parts of iron are combined with
 14.66 x 4 = 58'64, in the sulphate of the oxide with 14.Q6 x 6=s
87'96, and in the common pyrites with 14.66 x 8=117.28 parts
of sulphur.      Consequently these are multiples of the lowest pro
portion by 4, 6, apd 8, and we fmd that these multiples agree
with the results of the experiments a/s far as the thousandths of
the whole.      It may be supposed that the multiple by 2, which
is here wanting, still exists, although perhaps in a combination
which is yet unknown ; for instance, in a subsalt of an oxide, in
which the sulphuric acid and the oxide contain equal portions
of oxygen.       If now 14.66 parts of sulphur were the smallest
quantity   with    which 100 parts of iron could combine, it would
follow,  that  no   subsalt of the protoxide of iron could exist. But
if, on the contrary, such a subsalt should be discovered, 14.66 of
sulphur for 100 of iron would not be the minimum, and        it could not
be greater than 4.9, which would be the greatest common divisor
of all the combinations of sulphur with 100 of iron.            Nearly in
the same manner     I   have attempted to find the minimum of oxy
gen in the combinations of carbon         ;   but in order to discover
which of the various numbers that might represent the quantity
of oxygen,      the true minimum, a great number of experiments
               is
would be necessary, which would require the labour of several
years before they could afford   a    tolerably certain result.

                                                   Copper.
 I  precipitated some sulphate of the oxide of copper with caustic
ammonia, taking care not to throw down the whole of the oxide,
and heated 10 grammes of the precipitate, well washed and
                                 L    3                           dried,

dried, in a glass retort, over a spirit lamp, as long as any aqueous
vapours were expelled.     The salt, thus dried, had lost 14.5 per
cent, of its weight.     When I dissolved it in nitric acid, and
added a salt of baryta to the solution, I obtained 8.55 gr. of
ignited sulphate of baryta, corresponding to 21-28 per cent. of
sulphuric acid.   Consequently this salt consists of            ,

   The sulphuric acid contains 12-74, the oxide of copper 12.66,
and the water 12'87 of oxygen; so that each component part
contains an equal quantity.     Consequently in this salt 100 parts
of sulphuric acid saturate three times as much oxide of copper as
in the neutral sulphate.             '

   Mr. Lagerhjelm found, in his experiments on bismuth, that, in
the sulphate of the protoxide, the acid contains three times as
much oxygen as the base.          I therefore decomposed         a quantity
 of the neutral salt by adding water to        it,
                                             and washed the subsalt,
 which remained undissolved,          by
                                   the addition of fresh portions of
 water.    The salt, being long and thoroughly dried on         sand-a
 bath, was then ignited   ina crucible of platina, as long as a  trace
 of sulphurous acid was disengaged.          had lost 14

 I   have already treated, in the Second Continuation of my Essay,
of the subnitrate, subnitrite, subsubnitrate, and subsubnitrite of
the protoxide of lead, and of the subnitrate of the oxide of cop
per  ;and    have shown how far they serve to confirm my opinion
             I
of the composition of nitrogen, as well as the laws which     have   I
here laid down for the formation of the subsalts.
                 5. Carbonate    of   the Oxide   of   Copper.
   Ten grammes of carbonate of the oxide of copper, precipitated
at the boiling temperature, and dried in the sunshine, being
ignited in a small glass retort, afforded in the first experiment
7' 16, and    the second
             in             17 gr. of blr.ck oxide of copper.

considerable quantity of water was collected in the receiver.
Consequently this salt cannot contain so much carbonic acid, as
                                                                         ta

to constitute with it a neutral compound ; and the acid and the
oxide must therefore contain equal quantities of oxygen ; and
71*7 parts of the oxide must take up 1973 of carbonic acid :
the remaining 8.67 must be water, containing 7'5 of oxygen.
This quantity of the oxide contains 14.34 of oxygen ; so that
the oxygen of the water is half as much as that of the base.
The slight difference in the results must depend on a little acci
dental moisture left in the oxide, from the imperfection of the
process of drying.
    Carbonate of copper, precipitated from a cold solution, affords
a very bulky powder, of a blueish-green colour: but when a boil
ing heat is employed, we obtain a heavy, fine-grained, yellowish*
green precipitate.     I at first considered these two precipitates
as different carbonates, and attempted to collect the former, and
to wash it with cold water ; but it was converted by this process,
in great measure, into the heavier yellow-green substance, and I
could not obtain it in a pure state.     I had accidentally placed on
the sand-bath some carbonate of the oxide of copper, precipi
tated the day before, and still remaining in the fluid : when the
carbonic acid had been expelled from the fluid, I observed that
the carbonate of the oxide of copper, next to the bottom, col
lected into masses, and became of a yellow-green, without the
 least appearance of effervescence ; and this effect extended by
 degrees upwards as. the fluid became warm.          The alteration in
 the form appears therefore to depend not on any alteration in the
 quantity of carbonic acid, but merely in that of water ; exactly as
 the carbonate of the protoxide of zinc, in a temperature below
 the boiling point of water, sets at liberty the water combined
 with it, and unites into heavier grains, and as the blue hydrate
 of copper, when the fluid      isheated, separates from the water,
 and is  deposited in the form   of   black oxide.
                                          a          Other subsalts of
 copper also, which, when they are precipitated cold, are light
 and bulky, become heavier          the effect of heat, and assume
                                     by                             a
  yellower colour.
                          6.    Submuriates.
   We have found     by some of the former analyses, that the mu
riatic acid, in the submuriates of the oxide of copper and of the
protoxide pf lead,  is combined with four times as much of the
                            Since the muriatic acid must contain
 base as in the neutral salt.
 twice as much oxygen as the base by which        neutralised, the
                                                 it   is
 oxygen  of the acid in
                     these subsalts amounts   only to one half of
 that of the basis.
                           7.    Conclusions.
    From these experiments     think myself authorised in drawing
                                 1
 the following inferences respecting subsalts.
                                          L4                 a.) The

                        On definite Proportions.
    a. ) The oxygen of the acid in a subsalt may be either a sub-
 multiple, or a multiple, by a whole number, of that of the base.
    b. ) The quantity of a base, which is combined with a given
 quantity of an acid in a subsalt, can be a multiple of the quantity
 in the neutral salt by such a number only, as is capable of ex
pressing the proportion of the quantity of the oxygen of the acid
 to that of the base. For instance, in the subsulphates, the base can
only be a multiple by 3, 6, 9, of the quantity in the neutral salt,
 and not by 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.       On the other hand, acids which con
tain, in their neutral salts, 2, 4, 6, or 8 times as much oxygen as
the bases, may take up in their subsalts 2, 4, 6, or 3 times as
much of the base as in the neutral salts ; but not 3, 5, 7, or 9
times.                .                                                 >
    It still remains to be inquired, whether there exists a subsalt,
in which the base is less than double that of the neutral salt ;
for instance, whether any subsulphate exists, in which the acid
contains twice as much oxygen as the base, or a subnitrate, in
which the acid contains exactly four times as much oxygen as the
base.
        III.  Laws'   for the Formation of double Salts.
    The combinations which, in the first Antiphlogistic Nomen
clature, were called triple salts, have been latterly more properly
denominated double salts ; being always composed of two neutral
combinations ; and they may commonly be obtained by mixing
the solutions, and crystallizing them together.
    These double salts may be of different kinds : containing either
one acid and two bases; or two acids, or substances representing
acids, and a single base.       Of the former kind we are acquainted
with several salts, of the latter with only a few, and with none
very accurately.
                   1.   Double Salts  of a single Acid.
    The principle of the formation of these double salts is not dif
ficult to be found, since we know that most of the supersalts, if
they are saturated with a second base, afford such salts, and it has
been shown that the supersalts contain twice as much of the acid
as the neutral salts.      Consequently the new base must contain
exactly    the same    quantity^of oxygen as the base of the supersalt.
For example, the soda, the protoxide of iron, or the protoxide of
antimony, with which the supertartrate of potass is neutralised
in pharmaceutical preparations, must contain as much oxygen as
the potass, because it neutralises an equal quantity of the acid.
We shall find from the analysis of alum, that the existence of the
double salt, in these cases, depends not so much on the acid, as
on the affmity of the bases ; for alum cannot be obtained by sa
                                                               turating

    turating the superfluous acid of the supersulphate of potass with
    alumina, unless the supersulphate be in great excess.       Besides,
    certain bases afford double salts with almost all acids, although
    most of the acids are incapable of forming a supersalt with either
    of these bases.   Thus ammonia, for example, affords double salts
    with magnesia, with the protoxide of manganese, with the oxide
    of copper, and with the protoxide of zinc; and we have great
    reason to think that these bases always observe the same rela
    tion to each other, containing equal quantities of oxygen.    I shall
    adduce some few examples of double salts of the jirst kind, which
    may be sufficient to illustrate the law of their formation.
                  Sulphate   of Ammonia           and Magnesia.
       Ten grammes of this salt, finely powdered, and dried in the
    sun, were heated in a platina crucible, and then ignited.        They
    afforded exactly one-third   of  their weight   of sulphate  of mag
    nesia, whence the magnesia is found t6 amount to 11*11 per cent,
    and its oxygen to 4*43 per cent. of the whole weight.           I now         ,
    mixed, with these 3.334 gr. of sulphate of magnesia, a quantity
    of sulphate of ammonia, in which the oxygen of the ammonia
    amounted to -443 gr. that    is, 4.181 gr. the two salts were dis
                                                    :
    solved in boiling water, and dried on         glass dish in the sun
                                                    a
    shine: their joint weight was found to be 10.006 gr.          Conse
    quently the sulphate of magnesia had taken up 2.49 gr. of water,
    containing 2.2 gr. of oxygen, that       is,
                                            five times as much as either
    of the bases contained.      But since the sulphate of ammonia
    contains water of crystallization of which the oxygen        equal to
                                                                       is
    twice that of the base, the whole water of the salt contains seven
f   times as much oxygen as that of each of the bases         and the re
                                                                   :
    spective portions of oxygen in the different substances entering
    into the combination are as    1,   1,  and
                                             6,         7.
            Sulphate   ofAmmonia and the Oxide               of   Copper.
      Ten grammes of this salt, finely powdered, and dried in the
    sun, were mixed with lime in small retort, and the ammonia was
                                  a
    expelled in the same manner as in the analysis of the sulphate of
    ammonia.     The apparatus had lost -827 of its weight.         Ten
    more grammes, dissolved in water, were mixed with about as
    much of the carbonate of potass, as was required for the satura
    tion of the sulphuric acid, and then evaporated to dryness. When
    again dissolved in water, they left behind carbonate of the oxide
    of copper.    The fluid, which had slight excess of alkali, exhi
                                             a

    per.   The  oxide  of copper obtained, weighed, after ignition, two
    grammes.     These contain '3932 gr. of oxygen       and the -S27

equal quantities of oxygen.      If now we compute the quantity of*
sulphuric acid necessary for their neutralisation, there will remain
a quantity of water of crystallization containing seven times as
much oxygen as either base.        Consequently in this double salt,
each of the two simple salts retains its appropriate water of cry
stallization, as appears from the respective analyses.    The quan.<
tities of oxygen of the several component parts are here related,
as in the former case, in the proportions of 1, 1, 6, and 7»
                                 Alum*
    Alum is generally considered as a double supersalt ; but my
analysis appears to show that it is in fact a neutral double salt.
    Twenty grammes of pure alum were heated in a platina cru..
cible, over a spirit lamp, till they lost no more of their weight.
The swollen mass was compressed into the crucible, and at last
covered, in order that the heat might pervade every part of it
equally.      It had now lost 9 gr. and I could find no trace of the
escape of an acid, which must have been discoverable by the
smell.     Consequently alum contains 45 per cent. of water of cry-
stallization.     The dry salt was again dissolved in water, the as-   «
sistance of heat being required for the solution; muriate of
baryta was added, and the precipitate, when ignited, amounted
to 19.973 gr. or very nearly to the original weight of the alum :
so (hat, in a crystallized state, this substance contains 34*255
per cent. of sulphuric acid [; or, according to the corrected
analysis of the sulphate of baryta, which appears to contain from
34-314 to 34-48 per cent. of sulphuric acid, at least 34-27 per
tent. Gilbert.'].
    Ten grammes of alum were dissolved in water, and digested
with an excess of ammonia: they afforded alumina, which, when
well washed and burnt, amounted to 10-67 per cent.        As this did
not agree with Mr. Thenard's result, I repeated the experiment
with 50 gr. of alum. After filtration, the fluid mixed with the
 excess of ammonia, and the water, with which the earth was
washed, were evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in water,
 when they afforded a small quantity more of alumina : the whole,
 being collected and ignited, weighed 5-43 gr. and lost nothing
 more of its weight by repeated ignition.         Consequently alum
 contains only from 10 67 to 10-86 per cent, of alumina.
    Ten grammes of alum, dissolved in water, and digested in a
 small glass flask with carbonate of strontia, as long as any effer
vescence existed, and then with new portions of the same car
 bonate added in excess, were deprived in this manner of the
 whole of the sulphate of alumina.     The precipitate was not swol
 len, as might have been expected from the alumina, but heavy
 and easily washed.      The fluid, when filtered, was not alkaline,
                                                                   nor

                        On definite Proportions.                      171
nor did it become turbid upon the addition of ammonia.              When
evaporated, together with the water used for washing the powder,
in a platina crucible, and ignited, it afforded 1.815 gr. of sul
phate of potass, answering to .981 gr. of potass.
    Since we have seen that alumina contains about 46.7 per cent,
of oxygen, it is impossible that the bases can here contain equal
parts of oxygen.       Alum, according to these experiments, is thus
 constituted :
    Sulphuric acid . . 34.23            Or,
    Alumina .             10.86         Sulphate of alumina      36.85
    Potass . .             9.81         Sulphate of potass . . 18.15
    Water . .            45.00          Water                    45.00
    Now, 9'81 parts of potass neutralise S.37 of sulphuric acid,
 and 25.86 parts of sulphuric acid remain for the alumina : con
 sequently the alumina saturates in the alum three times as much
 acid as the potass, for 8.37 x 3=25.^1; so that the alumina
 must contain three times as much oxygen as the potass.               But
 9.81 parts of potass contain 1.674 of oxygen, and 10.86 of
 alumina 5.077 ; and 1.674 X 3 =5.022.            The 45 parts of water
 contain 39.71 of oxygen, and 5.022 x 8=40.17.             It is true that
 this analysis  is not  correct to  the last places of decimals : but it
 is at least sufficient to prove, that in alum the alumina contains
 three times as much oxygen as the potass; and in this instance
 we have a double salt, in which the oxygen of one of the bases is
 an integral multiple of that of the other.
     Since the proportion of the alumina to the sulphuric acid, in
 this analysis, agrees as nearly as possible with that which was
 found in the neutral sulphate, it is impossible that alum should be
  a supersalt; but it is indebted for its acid properties to the weak
  attraction of the alumina to the sulphuric acid which belongs to it %
  the sulphate of alumina preponderating so much above that of
 potass, that it communicates to the compound almost all its out
  ward characters.
     Alum and the other double, salts afford us interesting examples
  of the combinations of more than two oxygenized bodies. The
  potass here contains the smallest quantity of oxygen, which must
  therefore be the common divisor for the quantities contained in
  the other component parts.        If we call this quantity 1, the alu
  mina will contain 8, the sulphuric acid 12, and the water 24.
     Finally, I must observe, that my analysis of alum differs in
  some measure from that of Thenard and Roard.           These chemists
  found in alum 12| per cent of alumina, and only 16 per cent. of
  sulphate of potass.      [Vauquelin found the component parts al
  ways 10.5 of alumina, 10'4 of potass, 30.52 of sulphuric acid,

haps from the same causes of error which affected Berzelius's first
 experiment. Gilbert.']       MM. Thenard and Roard employed 489
 grammes of alum, from which they obtained 61 or 62 of alumina,
 a quantity which, when moist, would occupy the bulk of ten
pounds of water, and which must have been received either on a
 very large filter or on several small ones : in both cases, the wash
 ing  it,and its separation from the paper, must have been sub
jected to great difficulties.      It also probable, that the separa

 tion of the sulphate of potass from the fluid obtained,        the ad   by
 dition of lime, could give no very correct result. Probably there
fore the difference of our determinations       rather to be attributed
                                                  is
 to the more or less appropriate methods employed than to the
 experimenters.      Besides,  it   certain that an analysis on too
                                    is
large a scale can never afford a very correct result      nor do these

 gentlemen appear to have been in pursuit of very minute ac

                           A   double Subsalt.
   There exist also some double subsalts but       ;         have hitherto
                                                             I
examined only one, that is, the combination known in pharmacy
under the name of cuprum ammoniaium .                 In order to, prepare
this salt,      dissolved some sulphate
                I                             of the oxide of copper in
eaustic ammonia, precipitated the double salt with alcohol, washed
it again with alcohol, and dried         in the air.
                                          it                  very difficult
                                                             It    is
to observe with accuracy *the moment of the attainment of per
fect dryness; for the salt     is  decomposed on the surface, before
the alcohol has been expelled from its internal parts             then be
                                                                    ;   it
            it by
             degrees of
comes                    a sky-blue colour,    and   at  the  edge green.
Hence          impossible to obtain
                is                          very correct analysis of this
                                              a
salt ;  but     will not be difficult, with the assistance of the laws
                    it
of combination which have been here developed, to discover its
true composition, since the result of the analysis cannot deviate
far from the truth.
 I    drove off the superfluous ammonia from           apart ef this salt,
on a sand-bath, until     it became quite gray         ;  had lost 2033
                                                           it
per cent. in weight.       When repeated the experiment in small
                                I                                             a
retort,  I  found that    a little water escaped at the same time.
The gray powder, when water was poured on                  became first of
                                                             it,
a light blue, and then, as     I  gently   heated      it,
                                                        of     dark-brown
                                                                   a
colour.     This  unquestionably depended       on  the  decomposition of
the salt, and the formation of a portion of neutral sulphate of
ammonia and copper, while some hydrate of copper was first
produced, and then decomposed             by
                                          the application          of
                                                               heat.    The
solution had a faint blue colour, and left 40 per cent. of sulphate
of ammonia, mixed with a small quantity of the double salt.
The part undissolved, being        a mixture of black and green oxide,
                                                                 amounted

                         On definite Proportions.                          173
amounted to 48*7 per cent. : so that the products obtained
weighed 9 per cent. more than the salt employed.                 This partly
depends    on  the  quantity   of  water   of  crystallization   in  the sul
phate   of  ammonia,    and   partly on   that  of the   new   double  salt.
   In order to determine more correctly the composition of this
subsalt, I dissolved 5 grammes of it in water, saturated the so
lution with muriatic acid, and precipitated the sulphuric acid
with muriate of baryta.           The precipitate, when washed and
ignited, weighed in one experiment 4.685, and in another 4.7
gr., answering to 32.25 per cent. of sulphuric acid.
   The superfluous baryta was thrown down with sulphate of
soda, and then the filtered solution mixed with carbonate of
potass, and evaporated to dryness. The mass, when redissolved,
had an excess of potass, and afforded a greenish solution ; the
potass was nearly saturated with muriatic acid, and the carbonate
of copper, received on a filter, washed, dried, and ignited.               The
liquid, still a little alkaline, exhibited by means of sulphuretted
hydrogen a small residuum of , copper, which being separately
ignited, and weighed with the rest, made together 1*7 gr., or 34
per cent. of oxide of copper.          We therefore find in this salt the
same proportion between the acid and the oxide of copper, as in
the neutral sulphate, and its properties as a subsalt are wholly
dependent on the ammonia.            But does the salt contain a quan
tity of ammonia capable alone of forming a neutral salt with the
same quantity of sulphuric acid ? • I was at first persuaded that
it did.
    I mixed, in order to examine this, 5 grammes of the same salt
in a small glass retort, with fmely levigated lime, and decomposed
it exactly in the same manner as I have related respecting the
sulphate of ammonia.             The little apparatus had lost 1-32
grammes, consequently the salt must have afforded 26.4 per
cent. of ammonia.         The 7'35 per cent, wanting must have been
water,    so that  the  cuprum ammoniatum is thus constituted :
                      Sulphuric acid     ....     32.25
                      Oxide of copper . . 34.00
                      Ammonia                     26-40
                      Water                        7 .35
 This quantity of the oxide of copper contains 6.68, and the
water 6.5 parts of oxygen, so that the oxide and the water are in
the same proportion in this salt as in the subsulphate of the oxide
of copper. The ammonia contains 12.424 parts of oxygen, or
about twice as much as the other component pm ts ; for we have
seen that it is impossible to exhibit this salt in a state of dryness,
without depriving it of a little of its alkali; so that the quantity
jnust appear too small in this analysis.
    It is evident that the two bases taken together here contain
                                                                             an

174                       On definite Proportions.
an equal quantity of oxygen with the sulphuric acid, that             the     is,
oxide of copper one-third and the ammonia two-thirds as
much.     Consequently this salt      so constituted, considering both
                                     is
its bases, as to agree with the rule for simple subsulphate. The
                                                 by a
quantities of oxygen are expressed               for the oxide,
                                                      1           for the 1
water,     for the ammonia, and
           2                         3 for the sulphuric acid.
     It  not so easy to determine the nature of the alteration which
          is
the cuprum ammoniatum undergoes                  by
                                              exposure to the air. But
it appears,   when  long  kept  in vessels  imperfectly closed, so as to
fall into a sky-blue powder, to lose half of its ammonia, so that
the sulphuric acid then stands to each base in the same relation
as in the neutral salts.     When    it   changed to
                                          is               green powder,

a still greater quantity of ammonia          lost, and the residue
                                               is                                   is   a
mixture of more or less dry neutral sulphate of ammonia with
subsulphate of oxide of copper, accordingly as the alteration has
been made      bythe effect of heat, or        by
                                             exposure to the air. The
green powder formed            by
                               heat   iscapable of supporting       tem       a

wards emits sulphurous acid, sulphite of ammonia, water, and

 2. Double Salts with two Acids, or Substances representing
                    Acids, and one Base.
   These salts have been little examined, and their number seems
to be small.   The only examples, in any degree well established,
are afforded     the combinations of base with sulphur and sul
                by                             a

 I   have mentioned, in the First Continuation      of my Essay, on
occasion of the investigation of the relation of the oxygen of the
acids to that of the bases of salts, a double salt consisting of the
nitric and arsenic acids with protoxide of lead. When         endea       I
                                                                              voured

          Observations on Electrical and Chemical Terms.                 175
voured to analyse this salt, I found its component parts inde
finitely varying, accordingly as the solution from which it was
crystallized was more or less concentrated.             Since also it is de
composed by     solution  in water,    it does  not  appear that it can be
considered   as  a. double  salt :  and   it is  perhaps only an intimate
mixture of crystallized particles of the nitrate with those of the
arseniate of the protoxide of lead.
    Another similar instance has also occurred to me.                 I had
mixed together a solution of muriate of ammonia and of muriate
of the oxide of iron, and, having concentrated them, left them to
crystallize.    The salt which I obtained had formed cubes of a
fine ruby colour ; and upon analysing them, I found only              If  per
cent. of the oxide of iron.         When dissolved in water, they lost
their colour, and I obtained from the solution first an almost co
lourless, and then a light reddish-yellow salt, which in some
parts was free from any tinge of colour, and in others was un
equally coloured, and only of an orange red.              Consequently this
triple combination     is to be considered      rather  as  a mixture, than
as a true double salt.

XXXIII.      Observations on Electrical and Chemical Terms.               By
                             Mr. J. Murray.
          I thank                               Colchester, March 4, 1814.
                       you for your prompt insertion of my paper in
No. 189 of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal. Be pleased
to supply the word except before " on the latter supposition."
In reference to the question of theoretic electricity, I may further
remark, that it is a solecism in philosophical language,as in logic,
fo use the term negative electricity.           To charge a jar with no
thing, (for the negation must mean here, as it does in common
language, an absolute prioation,) is incompatible with a correct
mode of expression, and it happens that this negation exhibits
powers as active and positive as its antagonist.                 We cannot
attribute to a state of rest, the lively character of motion.               If
two powers be intimately blended together (rosin on sulphur and
red lead), and projected by an elastic gum bottle against a figure
described by positive electricity, on the ball connected with an
electric sphere, charged positively, the rosin or inflammable sub
stance will separate from the mass, and adhere to the communi
cated electricity ; and if negative electricity is the agent em
ployed, the metallic oxide will be the subject of attraction. These
are experiments familiar to every electrician.               In my opinion,
the same fluid in different quantities should only attract different
portions of the same substance.
                                                                        I  see

 176             On Electrical and Chemical Terms.
    I  see that   Mr. Singer, in   " the  Elements of Electricity and
 Electro-chemistry,"     does not  consider the propulsion of a pith
 ball by the electric discharge as any proof of the direction of the
 current ; and I agree with Sir M. Davy respecting the inclina
 tion of flame, generally adduced as an evidence on the same
 side. Much therefore as I revere the opinions of Canton, Franklin,
,&c. I pay no respect to great names if inconsistent ivith them
 selves, and at variance with truth ; — and as for the terms
 "  oxygen and hydrogen electricity," they unfortunately do not
 apply.    Surely the more dispassionately our reasoning is con
 ducted, the more truly philosophical it is.       I think Mr. Singer
 has much merit as an able practical electrician ; and under this
 impression, I presume with due deference to remark, that though
 his application of the term expansion may be conceived to apply
 to the phsenomenon where the indents are directly opposed to
 each other, it can scarce be admitted to weigh as an argument
 in my experiment, where two or more wires were used with one
 above, &c.     I am at a loss to comprehend what is meant by
 " out of the circle" in the paper alluded to. Perfect insulation,
 like absolute contact, is not to be conceived.      I think that Mr.
 Singer's plan of insulation is exceedingly ingenious, and founded
 upon just principles; because, by limiting the ambient conducting
 medium, he also confines the conducting power.          The following
 curious experiment , which I made, presents phaenomena not easily
 reeoncileabla with the Franklinian hypothesis.         Having coated
 the lull connected with the internal coating of the charged
 electric, and one of the balls of the insulated discharging rod,
 with China ink, both being uniformly obscured, a vertical card
 was placed between.      The discharge was then made. The paper
 as usual perforated a circular 'portion of the China ink displaced
 from both balls, and an indent appeared in the centre cf each.
    I confess I am astonished at Mr. Walker's mode of reasoning,
 in his " New Outlines of Chemical Philosophy." Chemistry,
 he seems to say, now, is what astronomy was in the days of
 Kepler. This appears to me, as if be Had said, the facts are suffi
 cient, but as yet. system eotists not.   Now, I happen to think that
 discovery has not yet unfolded a sufficient number of data.        Let
 experiment be diligently cultivated, or the gate leading to im
 provement will be for.ever shut.       None can more sincerely la
 ment the imperfection of our chemical nomenclature than I do.
 I should however lie sorry that it should be framed anew, by the
 insulated effort of one, and not by the united labours of many
 competent to a task so arduous.
    In No. 189, page 22, Mr. Walker, after condemning terms in
 general use, and want of precision, adopts two new words "sanc
                                                                 tioned

        On   the   Simplification of Mathematical Analyses.                  177
tioned by the terms Thermometer and Photometer now in com
mon use."      I shall only remark respecting Mr. Walker's " P/w-
togen," that in the language of the Greeks (from whence the
two words composing this term are derived) the literal inter
pretation is to generate light.      How this applies to " the im
ponderable element of combustibles," I have to learn. Irt page 24,
 Mr. Walker observes " that light and heal are produced in the
electric discharge.     I observe none sufficient to affect our most
delicate thermometers. I have by this means suffered metallic

XXXIV.       On the Simplification          Mathematical Analyses: —
                                             of
   a   Paper read        to the   Liverpool Philosophical Society. By
   Mr. Egerton Smith Eyres.
In   all inventive sciences,    happens that particular methods for
                                  it
determining every possible proposition cannot be laid down        for    ;
the science would in that case be no longer ah inventive, but
barely a substitutive one.     But although we experience the im
practicability of discerning rules so universal as to include every
known case of the branch of knowledge with which they are con
nected, yet   it   very possible,
                   is                       by
                                       proper explanations and con
cise methods, much to facilitate the operations and assist the in
vention; for the whole art of solution consists in reducing com
plex matter to     more simple form and therefore,
                    a                            :        we can de
                                                           if
termine wherein the complexity of problems consists, as opposed
to their simplicity, we may know, not only when we have re
duced a complex to       simpler problem, but also in some measure
                             a
obtain rules concerning the method to be pursued in such re
ductions.
  I  think we may assume          as an axiom, that complexity in
                                   it
creases with the number of data or things to be considered      that ;
 is,complexity      as the number of data directly; and, therefore,
                    is
one division of the method of reduction will consist in diminish
ing the number of data from         greater to a lower number, till
                                        a
 we arrive at the simplest possible conclusion, and that will be

 the case when the number of data is reduced to one ; of less thaH
 which it is plain no problem can subsist.
     There is also another source of complexity in mathematical
 propositions, and that is the nature of the data when their num
 ber remains the same ; and this will in most cases be found de
 pendent on the peculiar properties of the subject under consi
 deration.     But in geometry it has always some relation to the
 properties or habitudes of lines considered in a geometrical sense,
 as their sum, difference, ratios, rectangles, squares, cubes, &c.
 or the position they are in with respect to other lines known or
 unknown.       It is not perhaps possible to say decidedly, that any
 ops of these data is more complex than the others ; only it
 seems natural to infer, that it is a simpler relation of lines, to
 consider them merely as regarding their length or ratios, than to
 draw the inferences necessary to solution from data concerning
 the squares or rectangles of lines, which latter combination may
 be conceived simpler than one which is connected with the cubes
 or solids. Moreover it is found that some relations of lines, whose
 habitudes or number of dimensions remain the same, are more
 difficult of determination than others, though apparently of equal
 simplicity : thus it is found that
                                       " Given the rectangle and dif
ference of the squares of two lines to determine them," is a much
 more difficult problem than " The rectangle and sum of the
 squares."    But we are not acquainted with any method of reason
 ing by   which   this difficulty might have been foretold ; and are
 only able to estimate it by the nature and difficulty of the re
 quisite analysis.    There may however a reason be assigned for
 this difference of difficulty, and this in great measure depends
 upon the almost unaccountable prejudice that most mathema
 ticians have in favour of the circle above all other curves,. which
 prejudice induces them to reject all other modes of solving pro
 blems, that can by any possible, although intricate, analysis, be
 made to depend only upon the intersections of circles with cir
 cles, circles with right lines, or right lines with right lines.     And
 so it happens, that when in any problem we can obtain the locus
 pf a certain point connected with the determinations requisite to
 the solution of the problem supposed to be under consideration,
 that problem is then simplified in a degree proportionate to the
 value of the point whose locus is determined: but strict geome
 ters confine this method of simplification      to the cases in which
 the determined locus is a circle.      And the only reason assigned
 for this rejection of other curves is, the greater relative difficulty of
 their deicription. This, as matter merely practically considered,
                             a
is  certainly an objection of great weight; but in the theoretical
 determination of a problem,   I    cannot conceive why a prejudice
pf   that nature should be indulged, at least to such an extent as
                    x
                                                                    ?ven

 .even to exclude the conchoid,    a curve full as easy  to describe as a
 circle.
     From the very nature of things it follows, that some curves arc
 more fitted to the solution of some problems than others, and
 for that reason it would seem equally rational, to require a ma
 thematician to give solutions to the purely circular loci and pro
 blems, by means of the conic sections, or higher curves, as to
 fasten him down to the use of a circle and right line, in problems
 whose solution would be much simplified by the use of conic
 sections, or curves of the higher genera.         It is impossible with
 the aid of all the known curves, excluding the circle, to apply a
 line of a given length, from a given point, to a curve of any
 order : therefore, in this case it plainly appeal's that the place of
 the circle cannot be supplied by any of the other curves; whence
 it follows that, strictly speaking, the circle is here a curve of the
 highest order, since it overcomes difficulties the others are unequal
 to.    Whether this rejection of the other curves be well or ill
 founded, I may hereafter discuss, but shall for the present confine
 myself to problems requiring only the right line and circle.       Now
 as it was before shown, that one part of the art of analysis con
 sists in diminishing the number of data; therefore it follows,
 that we should first of all know how to apply the properties of
 our tools, which are here only twoj a right line and circle. The
 application of those known properties, in a manner most suitable
 to the attainment of the desired end, in a great measure depends.
 on having a perfect knowledge and experience of the nature of
 the geometrical loci, by means of whose proper application, one
 of the conditions of the given problem may be always so fulfilled,
 that there will not be any necessity of that condition occupying
 the attention of the geometrician any more ; and so, if two loci
 be discovered, the problem is still further simplified,
                           Rules for Analysis,
     The great art of obtaining geometrical solutions depends on a
.proper application of the geometric loci ; therefore our first rule
 will direct their substitution whenever the nature of the data ad
 mits of such a simplification.
     Rule 1 . If you have either the sum or the difference of any
 two lines given, to determine them with the further assistance of
 some other given data, — A line must be taken equal to the given
 sum or difference, and the problem will be reduced to finding in
 that line a point, such, that the lines determined by that required
 point, and the two already known, may satisfy the conditions
specified in the given data.        But in case of the two lines pro
 ceeding from two given points to intersect under conditions that
                                   .MjS                                dp

ISO   On the Simplification         of Mathematical Analyses.
do not allow them to Form one continued right line, then the
locus of their intersection is the curve of an ellipse or hyperbola,
according as the sum or difference be given ; which locus being
described, simplifies the problem to one consisting of a less num
ber of data.
    Rule 2. If the ratio of any two lines proceeding from two
known points be given with any other data, the construction of
the locus is, by joining the two given points, and finding two others
 (one within and the other without), such that the ratio of the
segments intercepted between the two given points may be equal
to the given ratio then describing.
                         ;                   acircle to pass through the
two last found points, and whose centre shall be in the continua
tion of the right line passing through the given points — that  :
circle will be the required locus.
    Rule 3. In case of the difference of the squares of two lines
proceeding from two known points being given, to determine their
locus, we connect the two points        bya right line, in which we find
a third point, such that the difference of the squares of the inter
cepted segments may be equal to the given difference of squares,
and erecting    a  line from that point perpendicular to the before-
mentioned line,     it will be the required locus.
    Observation     1.    Ifthere be given the difference of squares, to
which the squares ef the lines under consideration have given
ratios, the locus    is obtained on the same principle by merely      al
tering  the situation   of the given points, according to the ratio the
squares bear to each other, on the principle of similar triangles.
    Observation     2.   If the lines in question do not proceed from
two given points, but are tangents to two circles, whose centres
and radii are known, the problem          is solved in nearly the same
manner as before shown, on the principle of a tangent being
perpendicular to the radius, passing through the point of contact,
and from that arguing upon the Pythagorean proposition.
    Rule 4. But      if the sum of the squares, along with any other
data, be given, to determine the locus of lines proceeding
from two given points, — Bisecting the right line that connects
the two given points, and finding another line, such that double
of its squares, together with double the square on half the given
line, may be equal to the sum of the squares of the two lines
whose locus   isrequired; then describing       circle with radius equal
                                                 a      a
to the line just found, and whose centre shall be the middle of the
line, joining the given points, — then will that circle be the locus
that was required to be described.
    This rule will, as well as the last, admit of two additional
cases.   1.  When there         given the sum of squares having given
                               is
ratios to the squares of the lines intercepted between the two
                                                                    given

          On the Simplification   of Mathematical Analyses.        181
given points and the point of their intersection with the required
locus. 2d. When the two lines do not proceed from the two fixed
points, but are tangents to two circles whose radii and centre
are known.      Both these cases will admit of circular loci, on the
same principle as the similar cases adduced to Rule 3.
    If you have the ratio of two right lines with other data, varying
according to the circumstances of the case, there are a great
number of loci that may be applied, according to the different
forms the problem may assume. One of the most generally useful
of that species of loci, is given in the second rule ; but the fol
lowing are some that apply to problems involving other con
ditions or data.
    Rule 5. If it be required to determine the locus of one ex
tremity of a line revolving round a point as a centre, and meeting
a right line given in position when the ratio of the segments in
tersected by that line is a given one, — Draw any line. from the
fixed point to the line given by position, and continue it till the
parts obtain the given ratio ; then drawing through its extremity
a line parallel to that first given, it will be the locus required, as
will be evident by drawing any other line through the given point
to meet the two parallels.
    Rule 6. If it be required to determine the locus of one ex
tremity of a line, which being parallel to a line given in position
is always interposed between two other lines given in position, and
continued, so that the ratio of the segments may be equal to the
ratio of two known lines, — Draw any line parallel to the line
given in position, and continue it so that the ratio of the seg
ments may be equal to the ratio of the known lines; join the ex
tremity of the line so continued, and the point of intersection of
the two lines given by position ; then will the line so drawn con
stitute the required locus.
    Much more might undoubtedly have been added to the above
rules on so important a subject as the geometrical loci ; but as
most of the higher and therefore more interesting geometry
concerns the conic sections, &c. which are so much more diffi
cult in their enumeration as hardly ever to admit of being de
scribed by mere words without diagrams, I have therefore here
omitted them.

     nace in Hasland, (Rep. i. 397), as I was observing the same
     in November 1808, with William Anderson, the Foreman
     of the work ; a fissure or small fault, eight or ten inches
     wide, filled with rubble and soil, was seen descending dowa
     from the surface, through the Binds and thin stone beds, fat
     about ten feet, and there terminating, on an eight-inch strong.
     Stone bed, which was not in the least cracked or disturbed,
     or any of its under-measures ; but the measures above, rose
     from this bed, towards the fault, and were supported by the

^P.209] on the S side of the fault or derangement ; whence the
       effects of a lifting action on these strata, was most evident,
       see my Note on page SO.
           It was perhaps, to such shallow or superficial faults, that
       Mr. Williams alluded, under the name of hitches, in p. 23
       of vol. i. of the 2d Edit. of his  "  Mineral Kingdom."
           That all the faults whose derangements are considerable,
       must extend to vast depths in the Earth, no one can doubt,
       and to me it seems most probable, that the Earth is broken
      through to the antipodes, by an immense number of these
      .fissures,  in almost every direction, and that the separate
      pieces or piles of strata, after having for long periods slidden
       by the side of each other, in obeying the powerful Tidal
      actions that then prevailed (by which their surfaces became
      worn and polished, see my note on p. 208), at length came
      to rest in equilibrio, in their present positions, but from
      which positions, the parts of the Earth, thus only slightly
      adhering by their mutual attraction, are liable to be again
      moved, by any extraordinary Tidal action.
          According to the Theories adopted by M. De Luc and
      some other Geologists, the faults terminated beneath, in
      Vast subterranean Caverns, which formerly existed, as they
      imagine, but of which I think they have failed in producing'
      the ieast proof: or of their adequacy, for producing the in
      equalities and frequent changes of. strata, in position and
     kind, now observable on the surface of our Planet : but all
     of which complicated phenomena, appear to me, clearly
     explainable, by these general dislocations and tiltings. of the
     strata, (which however, had previously, great inequalities
     in their planes and thicknesses), and the subsequent denu
     dations, and the excavations of Valleys, &e. see Fep. h 1 17,
      123, &c.
          The frequency offaults, in all districts where the Earth has
     been penetrated by Quarriers, Miners, Colliers, &c., and the
     absence hitherto, of any general knowledge or principles of
     this phenomenon, have occasioned the immense number of
     Names (amounting to near eighty) by which they have been
     called, see Rep. i. 118 N.      Several of these, are very im
    proper to be used by Geologists, because they have also, ap
    plications to other phenomena of the Eartli ; the term Slip
    is among this number, which notwithstanding its other and
    more proper application, to modern subsidences of masses of
    Strata, (Rep. i. 73, 75, &c.) which have been partly under

      very different phenomena, as observed, Rep. i. 74 Note, I

      some instances, in this way " shoot up," for short distances,,
      into the Rock which covers them.

      in Antrim, P. M. xxxv. p. 365, and in many others, where.
      Whin-dykes intersect Basalt and its 1 under strata, it may
      have been, that the fissures below existed, when the Basalt
      stratum began to be deposited, and that the same deposit
      descended into the fissure, instead of the matter of Whin-
      dykes being forced up from below."         The vast stratum of
      Basalt, which I believe to have once covered all the Forth
      and Clyde Coal-field, before its astonishing denudations

      deposit, those Whin-dykes therein, which do not now con
      nect with the Basaltic Hummocks remaining..
          But there is another, and to me a more probable supposi
      tion, viz. that in the instances mentioned, of Whin-dykes
      intersecting strata, which lay either above or below Basaltic
      strata, the Dyke, in reality, passes through the Basalt as well
      as its upper and under strata, although its similarity in sub
      stance and structure, may require nice discriminations and
      well-conducted researches, to trace the Dyke through the
       Basalt, where the same does not derange or dislocate the
       strata : and the same of Granite or other Dykes, intersecting
       similar strata to their own substances.      Where the Dyke.
       Joes derange the strata, or there is a lift on one side or sink
       on the other side of   it,
                                there must think be less hesitation
                                             I
       in concluding, that the Dyke passes through its similar Rock,
       however indistinct the traces of      therein may be, than in.

       in their present situations, before the strata on each side of

      your account of Mr. B's Lectures in vol. xxxix. p. 236, that
      he there particularly noticed them, and attempted to account
      for their formation, in a manner, to which I opposed some
      facts (in page 427 of the same volume), to which he has not
     replied at p. 47 of vol. xl. but this common and important
     phaenomenon, is almost excluded from his subsequent work.
         That the shrinking or contraction of the masses of Lime
     stone, have oceasioned the Caverns and large cracks, which
     so remarkably distinguish calcareous Rocks, can admit of
     no doubt, as observed in my Rep. i. 292 ; and the same
     principle will doubtless account, for nearly all known natural
     Caverns, I believe, as well as for the opening of Mineral
     Veins, in general, which I have more effectually shown, I be
     lieve, (Rep. i. 246, P. M. xxxix. p. 428, &c.) than any
     other English writer, and yet, at p. 223, Mr. B. persists in
     ascribing to M. Werner, only this mode, viz. of shrinking,
     for opening of Veins ; notwithstanding his own express re

     in places that at first sight presented no unusual appearance,
     and thereby turned up several plano-convex lenses of large
     size and very regular form, out of the stone floor, which
        lenticular    masses,he called shells and skelps : on examina
        tion,   they proved to be almost entirely composed of cornu-
        ammonii, (curiously covered by branching spar, which ap
        peared compressed), and of other shells : but what occasions
        my mentioning the same here,             is,

          It  might be important, for those who have the oppor
        tunity of repeating these observations, to ascertain, whether
        these fibres are of vegetable or of animal origin:       seemedit

 XXXVI.    Memoir upon the Employment of O.rygen Gas in
              of suspended Animation. By M. Sementini*.
  various Cases
The      object of this memoir is to suggest a speedy and efficacious
 method of contributing to the processes at present in use, for the
 restoration to life of drowned or suffocated persons.
      What is meant by suspended animation, maybe understood by
 referring to the cessation of the motion of a pendulum, merely
 from a mechanical stoppage of its oscillation, while none of the
 parts of the machine have been injured.       Now when there is a
 want of sensation and motion caused by      an  absolute suspension
 of the same faculty, we may expect the return of life by giving
 it such an action that it may resume its natural state, as the
 pendulum resumes its functions when a mechanical impulse has
 restored the oscillation which is peculiar to it.
     But the animal organization is such, that the state of suspended
 animation speedily becomes dangerous, and apparent death is
 soon changed into the reality, on account of the facility with
 which the humours of an animal body are changed.
     Now suspended animation may be produced by causes which
 act either on. the general system, or directly upon the organ of
 respiration; but I intend to allude here to those cas^s only which,
 deriving their origin from any given cause, have instantly pro
 duced such a derangement in the functions of the lungs as t6
 produce apparent death.
    Recently, when directing my attention to the contrivances
 called fumigatory boxes, it occurred to me, that since inflation
 was generally regarded as the most energetic method of restoring
 animation, oxygen gas might'be employed instead of common
.air.   I afterwards became acquainted with the work of Dr.
               * Annalet de Chimie, tome lxxxvi.   j>.   140.
                                                                Goodwin,

      On Employment of Oxygen Gas in suspended Animation.                   191
Goodwin, published at London in 1788*, and                I found that this
author had tried the oxygen gas administered by inflation to ani
mals drowned on purpose, and that he had fully ascertained its
efficacy.      I repeated his experiments with success, and they-
added confidence to my own previous opinions.
    But the case of an animal drowned for the express purpose of
an experiment, and which had been saved by the inflation of
oxygen gas previously prepared at leisure, is very different from
that of a man who has been drowned by an unforeseen accident.
In the former case, every thing is arranged for the experiment,
and the oxygen gas is ready beforehand ; but if it be requisite
to afford speedy assistance to a human being just taken out of
the water, too much expedition cannot be used in preparing and
administering the gas. It is the object of this short paper, there
fore, to exhibit the method which I have contrived for introdu
cing oxygen gas into the lungs instantaneously, and while they
are yet warm.
    For this purpose I had recourse to Berthollet's important dis
covery of the hyperoxygenated muriate of potash, which, among
other wonderful properties, possesses that, of containing nearly a
third of its weight of oxygen, which, when exposed to a moderate
heat, is reduced to a state of gas; and upon this remarkable pro
perty my process is founded.
    If inflation, therefore, be the principal resource in cases of sus
pended animation, if oxygen gas be preferable to atmospheric
air, and if the apparatus which I am about to describe be proper
for developing the oxygen gas in a very short time, and for intro
ducing it instantly into the lungs, I shall not have uselessly di
rected my humble talents to the welfare of society.
                     Description   of the Apparatus.
    In fig. 1. (Plate III.) is seen a cylinder of wood A, with lead
at bottom to keep it steady. Into this is screwed the neck of
the brass retort B.       To the foot of this cylinder a spirit lamp is
fixed, the flame from which embraces the belly of the retort.
To the cylinder a flexible leather tube, ddd, is attached, which
at the other extremity unites at F with the bellows E.                  These
bellows terminate at G with a portion of a tube of elastic gum,
which is furnished with a small brass plate to fit the human
mouth.       The bellows are provided at F with a valvef, and the
inflation of the gas is effected as follows : The cylinder A is placed
on a small table by the side of the bed on which the patient re-

ture in the under side pf ajl bellows. — Editors.

                                                                    of potash is
    introduced into the retort B, and it is screwed to the cylinder :
   the lamp is lighted, and the bellows E are applied to the mouth
   of the patient, while an assistant holds the nostrils firmly with
    his fingers.       The oxygen gas begins to be developed ; and as in
   the    interior    of the cylinder the aperture of the retort communi
    cates with that of the tube ddd, this gas, not having any other
   vent, proceeds into the bellows, which are kept open on purpose.
   When the bellows are supposed to be full, or nearly so, they are
   shut; and the gas, not having any way of escaping, from the valve
   being shut, is compelled to enter into the patient's mouth and
   lungs.       This process, which may be repeated at intervals, along
   with the other methods already known, forms the essential part
  of the very simple method which I propose. I have had the
.
   pleasure, with the above apparatus, to restore animation to one
  person, who was taken out of the sea, and supposed to be
   drowned.
   XXXVII. Extract from            a Memoir upon the Existence of Alcohol
        in Wine.       By M. Gay Lussac. Read at the French Insti
        tute, March 1, IS 13*.
.It was my object            to determine more precisely than has hitherto
  been done, the true epoch at which alcohol is formed in wine.
   Is it formed during distillation, as many chemists suppose from
  the experiments of M. Fabronif, or at the moment of fermenta
  tion, as Mr. Brande thinksj without however giving any thing
  like satisfactory proofs ?                             x
        It will be recollected that M. Fabroni established his opinion,
  by demonstrating from his experiments that alcohol could not be
 extracted from wine when saturated with subcarbonate of potash ;
 whereas, by the same method, the smallest quantity of alcohol
 which might have been added to the wine was recovered.
        Mr. Brande proves incontestablyj,' that we cannot extract alco
hol from wine by M. Fabroni's process ; but he does not destroy
 his opinion, without showing that we constantly obtain the
 same quantity of alcohol from wine by distilling it at the varied
 temperatures of 93 ',3, G7°,7, and 82°,2.             It is nevertheless evi
dent that the temperature 82°,2 is still high enough for the for
mation of the alcohol during distillation : hence it follows, that
 M. Fabroni's opinion is not completely overturned — far less is
that of Mr. Brande very clearly established.
       I have proved that subcarbonate of potash may be used to de-

    monstrate the presence of alcohol in wine ; but we must begin
    by isolating the foreign substances which are mixed or combined
    with      and which oppose its separation.
             it,                                     The process which                  I
    consider as the most advantageous for this purpose, consists in
    shaking the wine with well pounded litharge           speedily becomes
                                                               :   it

    tractive matter    the subcarbonate of potash then very easily de
                           :
    monstrates the presence of alcohol.
     I   can give another proof of the existence of alcohol in wine,
    equally conclusive,           by
                             distilling wine in vacuum at the tempera
    ture of 15°, which, as     well known,
                                       is       very inferior to that which
                                                    is
    is developed during fermentation, for         obtain

    dedly alcoholic.
       These two experiments prove beyond doubt that alcohol                                is
    not formed during fermentation, as was generally supposed pre
    viously to M. Fabroni's experiments.

                    ir    Isaac    Newton, for the purpose of decomposing
    light, made a small hole in his window-shutter a quarter of an
    inch in diameter, and, having placed      prism so as to refract and

    lours in the following order red, orange, yellow, green, blue, in
                                            :

    That this philosopher was mistaken in supposing he analysed in
    cident light, will appear evident from the following experiments
    and observations.    When we look with       prism ata  window, tha     a
    light passes through the panes, and likewise through the prism, to
    the eye, urldecomposed, and consequently coleurless; but when we
    look to the frames, we perceive an artificial rainbow of reflected
    blue, red, and yellow. Any opaque substance, as a piece of black
    cloth or paper, when pasted on the window, will produce the same
    effect; and the more dense or dark, the deeper the tints or fringe*.
         *
         I   use the word fringe as much more appropriate          than penumbraf whose
    derivation     is   absurd.

  194        Incident or impingent Light not decomposable
  The north or top of the paper will be fringed with blue ; the
  south or bottom, with red and yellow rays.         Now it is evident,
  if light were decomposed by merely passing through the prism,
  according to the different refrangibilities of its coloured rays,
  that light admitted through the panes should be equally de
  composed with that in the vicinity of the opaque frames.          To
  place this objection in a stronger point of view, I made the fol
  lowing experiment.
      I cut two holes in my window-shutter, one the diameter of a
  quarter of an inch, mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton, the other the
  diameter of four inches ; and having darkened the room, and ap
  plied a prism, I found that the small aperture admitted light tinged
• with the seven colours, which I could receive on a sheet of white
  paper : the larger orifice was also fringed round with seven pris
  matic colours, and pencils of white light passed tjhrough the centre.
      Here I must again observe, if white incident light were de
  composed by merely passing through the prism, why was 'not
  that coming through the centre equally decomposed with that at
  the edges ? And however contrary to received opinion, I am con
  fident it is nevertheless true, that incident light has never yet
  been decomposed, but that all experiments hitherto made have
  been on light condensed and reflected by opaque substances. If we
   paste a piece of black cloth on the window, whose colour, as I
  have shown in my last communication on blackness, arises from
   the reflection of condensed rays of blue, red, and yellow; on
   applying the prism, a fringe of red and yellow appears at the
   south. This does not proceed from a decomposition of incident
   light striking on the edges of the cloth, but it proceeds from an
   actual decomposition of the condensed coloured rays of the black
   cloth itself.  The prism decomposes these three primary colours
   according to the order of their different refrangibilities;   and as
   the red and yellow rays are more refrangible than the blue, as I
   shall show in my next communication,       they are brought down
   by  the prism,  and the  black cloth remains  of a blue colour. The
   further we move from the window, the more refrangible the red
   and yellow rays become, and consequently the decomposition is
   the greater.    In this experiment the north of the cloth reflects
   blue rays, the south red and yellow, proving in the most satis
   factory manner that there are but three primary colours ; and as
   all the secondary or mixed colours can be formed of blue, red,
   and yellow, to call others into existence would be contrary to the
   beautiful simplicity of nature, and unnecessary.     But it might be
   asked, If there are but three primary colours, how did Sir Isaac
    Newton produce a spectrum of seven ?
       The following experiment will explain : Paste a strip of black
    cloth or paper, six inches by three, on the window : on the south

                      into the prismatic Colours.                   195
you perceive a fringe of reflected red and yellow : paste another
similar strip parallel to this, at about four inches distance, on
looking through 'the prism you perceive the north to be fringed
with blue. Thus we have three primary colours nearly in contact.
The yellow rays of the upper paper, being the most refrangible,
come nearest to the blue of the lower paper j and if we approach
them, a green is formed by their mixture, so that we can now
without any difficulty account for five of Sir Isaac Newton's co
lours, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.       By making a small
hole in his window-shutter, he brought the northern and southern
fringes into contact or mixture, and produced five colours with
three.     It now remains to account for the indigo and violet; and
here I must again refer my reader to my last communication, in
which I have shown that blackness arises from the reflection of
blue, red, and yellow ; which being granted, the solution of this
otherwise difficult question becomes easy. The red and yellow of
the lower cloth or paper, being more refrangible than the blue,
were brought down by passing through the prism, leaving the
upper part of the lower edge (when illuminated by the undecom-
posed light coming through) blue. Under the blue appeared in
digo, which, as I shall hereafter show, is composed of blue, red,
and yellow, in a different state of condensation from black. And
at the bottom of all appeared violet, arising from a great quan
tity of yellow and red, which had been brought down, mixed with
the black rays. From this experiment we might conclude, that
Sir Isaac Newton by mixing three primary colours made seven.
    But I am aware, it might be objected, that Sir H. Englefield
and others decomposed, or thought they decomposed, incident
light coming immediately from the sun, by passing it through a
prism placed at an open window.        So far however from refuting,
this experiment confirms my opinion, that incident light was
never yet decomposed, as I shall now endeavour to prove.           The
prism, being a semitransparent substance,       when   turned in such
a manner on its axis as partly to reflect and partly to transmit
the rays of light, (for it will never decompose if turned at right
angles to the sun,) condenses and reflects fringes of blue, red, and
yellow, from each of its angles ; and these fringes of reflected light,
being carried forward through the prismatic planes by the inci
dent and undecomposed light, intermix by their different refran-
gibilities, and form a spectrum of seven colours ; and as there are
three angles in every prism, so there are two spectra always
formed, in the same manner as three strips of paper, pasted pa
rallel to one another on the window, will also form two spectra.
As I am well aware that my experiments and opinions are in
opposition to authorities of the first respectability in science ; and
                                 N2                                  M

196 Incident    Light not decomposable into the prismatic Colours.
as  I am also certain that science and liberality always go hand in
hand,   I rest my ideas on experimental inquiry.
    To show that the decomposition of light takes place only at
the prismatic angles, and arises entirely from those fringes of re
flected light, I made the following experiment : When the sun
was shining very powerfully, I placed my prism on a table at the
open window ; and having formed a spectrum on a sheet of white
paper, I slowly turned the instrument on its axis, until I separated
the red and yellow from the blue, and in place of green, white
or undecomposed light passed through between the angles. I
now ascertained that the red and yellow rays passed through the
upper and thin angular edge, by intercepting them with my fin
ger placed on it; and by running my finger along the middle an
gle, I intercepted the blue rays ; and by pasting a narrow strip
of paper between those two angles I made two spectra. But to
place the fact beyond the possibility of doubt, standing at a little
distance, I looked by means of another prism at the light passing
through, and perceived three beautiful fringes hanging from the
angles.     Indeed it is surprising that those fringes, so easily
proved, so evident to the eye, and so highly important in their
consequences, should have escaped the observation of such able
and accurate experimenters as those already mentioned.          I shall
conclude this paper with the following deductions.
    1st. That incident light has never yet been decomposed ; and
that Sir Isaac Newton and other philosophers only decomposed
light reflected from opaque substances, or fringes of blue, red, and
yellow.
    2dly. That there    are but three primary colours, blue, red, and
yellow, by   the mixture  of which, either by the prism or the painter,
all the others are formed.
   3dly. That Herschel, Leslie, Davy, Englefield, and other phi
losophers, drew their conclusions, relative to the heating power of
the prismatic colours, from erroneous data, viz. from experiments
on reflected light, whose heat must in a great measure depend
on the reflecting media, and also on the thickness or thinness
of those parts of the prism through which the fringes pass. Thus
the red and yellow rays passing through the very thin upper an
gle, must be accompanied by more radiant caloric than the blue
rays, which pass through the thickest.
    The following diagram will demonstrate my opinions ; and as
 I am at present engaged in a series of experiments, to prove
that the prismatic colours have similar heating powers, I shall
not anticipate.                                                   I

These carry forward the angular fringes formed by reflection,
which being refracted towards the perpendicular fall on the spec

angle A, must be more heated, when falling on the spectrum H,

XXXIX.       Observations on Colours, as applicable to the Purposes
          of the Artist. By Mr. Thomas Hargreaves.
          I take                            Liverpool, Dec. 32, 1813.
                    the liberty of addressing to you some observa
tion on colours, the result of great attention to the subject, and
of long experience as an artist, which may perhaps be useful for
the purpose suggested by Mr. Forster, in his communications
inserted in your last and the preceding numbers.
    I agree with him in the theory of three primary colours only,
and with his account of the effects of the binary and ternary
compounds ; but his idea of the, precise tint of one of those pri
mary colours is certainly incorrect, from his having adopted the
prismatic scale, which is defective, as I trust will be evident in
the course of the following remarks.
    Before I proceed, I think the annexed figure (fig. 2. Plate III.)
will assist me in my explanations.      In this figure the three sim
ple primary colours, red, yellow, and blue, are placed at the three
angles of a triangle, and the three intermediate colours, orange,
green, and purple, in their proper situations between the respec
tive colours which compose them, and at the angles of another
triangle.     The space between a primary and intermediate com
pound is likewise marked by the two letters on each side : thus,
between yellow and orange is put yo, to signify yellow orange,
or an orange colour approaching to yellow.           It is evident that
the simple colours are like mathematical points, neither extend
ing one way nor the other ; but an intermediate colour has an
infmite variety of tint, from the verge of one of its components to
that of the other.. White and black, with all the intermediate
degrees of gray, are equal combinations of the three simple co
 lours.   Pure white, by uniting all the colours, can only be pro
 duced with the rays of light, as shown by the prism ; but all the
different degrees of broken white or gray, down to black, may be
 produced by the coloured substances used in painting. An equal

portion of two simple colours makes the exact intermediate one,
as of yellow and blue makes a green ; but another equal portion
of the third simple colour, as red, neutralizes the whole, making
it a gray, light or dark, according as the colours employed are
light or dark.    If only a small quantity of the third colour ba
used, it breaks the tint, making it approach more to a neutral
tint, according to the quantity used. By neutral tint, I do not
mean the tint so called by landscape painters, which is inclined
to blue and sometimes to purple, and ought rather to be called
an aerial tint ; but I mean by        it,
                                      that negative gradation between

                        a

   The effect of the three intermediate colours mixed together
will be the same as the three simple ones, that is, they will pro
duce     agray or neutral tint of a depth proportionate to the
strength of the colours employed, which will be evident on con
sidering them.     It  will be unnecessary to say further, that equal
portions  of all the colours, simple and intermediate, will still pro
duce a neutral tint,     as  will be evident from what        shown is            al
ready.
   The figure shows at once what colour or tint will neutralise
another, they being directly opposite in the circle.           Thus, op

 with its opposite in the same way, it will produce as many va
 rieties of gradations ; and by going thus round the whole circle,
 every tint that can be seen in nature, or imagined, will be formed.
    As it is of consequence that the peculiar tint of each of the
 three primary colours should be determined, I will endeavour to
 communicate my ideas of each of them >by reference to flowers,
 or more particularly to those pigments used in (water colour)
 painting which approach the nearest to them.
    With respect to the primary colour of yellow, there is less un
 certainty in the general application of the term than with either
 of the others; for the least tinge of orange readily procures it the
 name of orange or golden colour, and so likewise the slightest
 tinge of green gives it the name of green.        This colour is pro
 cured in all its different degrees of strength from gamboge.
    Blue, the name of the second primary colour, is applied with
 much less precision ; for we find that it is given to many of the
gradations towards purple, and likewise when it falls into a
greenish hue.      From an attentive consideration of the colours of
flowers, I have remarked that the most usual tints are different
gradations of orange, purple, and red. The primary tint of yellow
is seldom seen pure, and the blue still less, scarcely ever ; the
pigment approaching the nearest to which is Antwerp blue*
Ultramarine and Prussian blue tend more or less to the purple.
    I come now to the third primary, red ; and here we find the
greatest uncertainty, as the term is given to all the shades of orange.
This error is particularly adopted in the Newtonian theory.        This
arises from its being founded on the prismatic experiments : in
the prismatic spectrum the third primary colour is not shown,
the two ends of the spectrum are equally near to it : if there be
any difference, I think the violet is more inclined to it than the
other.    In the figure, the colour which falls under the denomina*
tion of orange is precisely that which is called red in the prismatic
spectrum: its tint is between that of vermilion and red lead,
and is of course, from what has been said, exactly neutralised by
blue.    In the same manner, the colour called purple in the figure
js nearly the same with the prismatic violet, and is neutralised
by yellow.     This will readily be proved likewise with the prism j
for, if the spectrum is thrown on a strong blue ground, the colour
which is there called red will disappear ; and if on a pure yellow
ground, the violet will be neutralised.
    The true primary colour of red is that which is called crim.r
son : this colour in its various degrees of strength is very fre
quent in flowers ; the rose gives it in its paler gradations ; but
the pink or carnation shows it in all its gradations from the palest
to the most deep. This colour is most nearly given by carmine.

certainly imitate every tint in nature ; with gamboge and carmine
the prismatic red, and all the other gradations of orange, may be
made : and carmine with Antwerp blue gives the prismatic vio
let, indigo, &c.     But if instead of carmine he takes vermilion,
or any other pigment of the hue of the prismatic red, he will find
it impossible by joining it with blue to produce crimson, pink,
violet, or any of the purples.
    On looking through the prism, or a convexjens, objects are
tinged on their edges with a fringe of colour ; according to the
relative positions of light or dark, that fringe is either yellow
running into prismatic red, or blue running into violet.             These
two fringes united in the prismatic spectrum form the whole
range of colours there shown. But, from what I have said, I think
it is evident that it is deficient one third of the circle, which
third includes the true primary colour of red with its most im
mediate compounds.

 XL.    On the pretended Formation of Oxalic Acid in a Mixture
        of Alcohol and Sulphuric Acid. By M. VoGELf.
 A.   considerable time has elapsed since M. Cadet de Gassi-
 court announced, that oxalic acid could be formed by the sim
 ple contact of sulphuric acid and alcohol.         The author expresses
 himself in the following manner      J ":     I made a mixture of equal
 weights of well rectified alcohol and sulphuric acid : this mixture
 remained at rest for about thirty hours.         At the end of this pe
 riod I perceived at the bottom of the flask, and attached to the
 lower sides, a quantity of crystals about ten or twelve millhnetres
 long, and formed by tetrahedral prisms terminated by a dihedral
 summit.     After having decanted the liquor, I examined these
 crystals ; and I ascertained, with the help of calcareous salts and
 reagents, that it was oxalic acid."          M. Cadet then promises to
 resume this experiment on a large scale ; which, so far as I know,
 he has not yet done.
     This very remarkable result of the formation of oxalic acid by
 rneans of the sulphuric acid, has been nevertheless quoted in. a

great number of works, and no person has hitherto called the fact
in question.
s  Having occasion annually to make a quantity of sulphuric
ether, I have always remarked that the mixture of equal parts of
alcohol and sulphuric acid becomes milky, and deposits a white
crystalline powder.
   With a view to collect this crystalline deposit, I mixed the li
quids in a large flask, and I decanted it after a few days in order
to proceed to distillation.
   After having preserved the precipitates for several years, I
mixed them together in order to subject them to an ulterior ex
amination.
   This powder, when mixed with some fine needle-formed cry
stals, being dried with a gentle heat, had an acid taste, owing to
a little sulphuric acid which was interposed, and which I took up
by washing with alcohol.      This alcoholic liquor contains merely,
as I have said, sulphuric acid, and not a trace of oxalic acid.
 The powder when thus washed was perfectly neutral : it did not
even contain any substance of the organic kingdom ; for, when
heated in a retort, it is not carbonised, and no gas is extricated.
Boiling water dissolves a small quantity, and this solution is turbid
with oxalate of ammonia, as well as by the muriate of barytes.
 The white residue, insoluble in boiling water, immediately becomes
black on placing it in contact with sulphuretted hydrogen,,or
rather with the hydrosulphuret of ammonia.
   I pass over other details of experiments ; for it is easily seen
that the crystals, which are deposited from a mixture of equal
parts of sulphuric acid and alcohol, are nothing else than a com
 pound of sulphate of lime and sulphate of lead*.

sphere, is  problem that has engaged the attention of mathema
             a

ferences deduced from the most accurate observations of experi
mentalists, and the investigations of mathematical theorists, have
almost rendered the researches of modern philosophers hopeless
of acquiring the truth from theory alone.
    We shall merely notice    afew of the many observations which
have been made to determine this problem.

                    Cassini,&c   ....  1 106.
    We shall not stop to examine the source of these discordant
results, but merely observe, that the remarkable disagreement ex
hibited by these philosophers, in all probability, arises either from
their not using proper pendulums vibrating seconds or aliquot
parts of a second, but strings suspended with a plummet oscil
lating : — or, the distances of the stations from whence the sound
was propagated, and observed, were either too near each other,
or not exactly ascertained, so as to render any degree of preci
sion to be expected from their inquiries.
    The experiments of Dr. Derham are perhaps the most to be
relied upon of any that have been made in this country ; but the
spaces through which the sound was propagated were not ri.r
gorously verified.     This objection does not apply to the labours
of Cassini, Maraldi, &c. who made these observations in France
about the year 1738.         They observed the velocity of sound
under a variety of circumstances, — during a diversity of winds,
in calms, and different changes of weather, — with nearly the same
results : besides, the distance of one station from another had been
previously determined, with accuracy, in measuring the terrestrial
meridian through France.        The mean velocity of sound, as de
duced from their experiments, is 1038 Paris feet in a second;
 and if the length of the French foot be to the length of the
English foot as 1-06575 to 1, as stated by General Roy, the
distance will be equal to 1 106 English feet ; and it is highly pro
bable, that this determination is more to be relied upon than auy
other experiments which have hitherto been made.
     It may not be improper here to mention the excellent oppor
tunity afforded us in this country, of settling this point in the
most satisfactory manner.       I allude to the many favourable situ
 ation* which present themselves, whose distances from each other
have been most accurately measured during the grand Trigono
 metrical Survey of England by Lieut. -col. Mudge, &c.
    The theoretical principles of the propagation of sound, ad
vanced by Sir Isaac Newton in the 47th proposition of his Ma
 thematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, are simple, elegant,
 and appear consorant to the visible operations of nature, so far
                                                                    as

                    On the Propagation      of Sound.                203
as he proceeded upon the true principles of philosophy: his
subsequent surmises are not worthy of notice, except as coming
from such an exalted character.
   This great man has demonstrated in the fore-mentioned pro
position, that the number of pulses propagated is the same with
the number of vibrations of the tremulous body; that they are not
multiplied in their progress ; and that as soon as the pulses cease
to be propagated from the tremulous body, it will return to a
state of rest.   Again, in the 48th proposition of the same book,
Newton has clearly solved an important question, in favour of
the theory we have advanced ; viz. that the velocities of the pulses
are in a ratio compounded of the subduplicate ratio of the den
sity of the medium inversely, and the subduplicate ratio of the
elastic force directly.
   If the atmosphere were of a uniform density at different di
stances from the earth's surface, the velocity of sound as deduced
from the law of pendulous bodies would lie exact ; but, as the
air is a medium that decreases in density as the distance from
the earth increases, it appears to me to require a different view
of the subject.
    When the height of the mercury in the barometer and the
temperature of the atmosphere are obtained, we can easily find
the altitude of a column of air that would reach to the top of
the atmosphere ; and if it were of an equal density and elasti
city in all its parts, the velocity of sound as recorded by Newton
would be rightly stated. But it is otherwise ; the atmosphere is
not equally dense at every elevation, which the proposition of
Newton requires. The question is then. What force Is necessary
to overcome the elastic power of that portion of the air which
exists above the assumed height of the atmosphere, in order to
compress the whole mass of the air within that limit ?
    Before we proceed in the investigation of the proposed subject,
several preliminary inquiries are requisite.         It appears from ex
periments carefully made by Mr. Tralles*, that the density of
dry air at 32° of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and under a pressure
of 29-92 inches, is equal to -00129918, the specific gravity of
water being taken as unity, and under the, same circumstances ;
and to -0012770 when, the same thermometer is at 39°-83, which
point Mr. Tralles has ascertained to be the maximum density of
water, the barometer remaining as before.            The specific gravity
of mercury is 13-59925 at the former standard, and 13*59655 at
the latter.    Now by taking a mean between the experiments
made by Gay-Lussac and those of Dal ton on the expansion of
dry air, it appears that for every additional degree of Fahrenheit's

thermometer a corresponding dilatation of the air equal to
•002078 is produced.
   According to the researches of Sir George Shuekburgh, the
mean annual range of the barometer at the surface of the sea is
30.04 inches, and this elevation is constant in every degree
of latitude.     In calculating the temperature, we have followed
the formula invented by that great philosopher Tobias Mayer of
Gottingen. From these data we find the mean annual tempera
ture at the surface of the sea in latitude 45° equal to 57°'5 of
Fahrenheit; and the mean density of the air .0012353 ; and by
making use of the numbers ascertained by Mr. Tralles for the
density of mercury, we find it in the same latitude and tempera
ture 13*59043.       Then to find the elevation of a column of air of
equal weight, we have
        1339043      3004.

for the height of the atmosphere.
   Now to find the pressure of the air, or, in other terms, at what
elevation the mercury in the barometer would stand, if taken to
the height of 4590-163 fathoms, is an important part of what we
require.
   In order to approach as near to accuracy as possible, it will be
requisite to determine the precise decrease of temperature for
every increase of altitude in the atmosphere.           Saussure has found
a decrease of one degree of Fahrenheit for every 289 feet.
Daubuisson* found, under the same circumstances, an elevation of
319 feet corresponding to 1° upon the same scale.               The best ob
servations for deciding this question, we think, are those ob
tained from the journals of the Monks residing in the venerable
priory situated upon Mount St. Gothard in Switzerland.                    The
mean annual height       of the  barometer   kept    in this  place  is 21*77
inches, and of Fahrenheit's thermometer 29°.8.                Now the lati
tude of the place is about 46° 30' North ; and the mean annual
temperature of this latitude at the level of the sea, as appears
from Mayer's formula before mentioned, is 56°-1.                  Calculating
the height of the priory from these data, by De Luc's method
for ascertaining the altitudes of mountains by the barometer, we
find it equal to 8557 feet.                      .

 greater than that of the earth, it would require an additional force
 equal to a pressure of 9'99 inches of the barometer, or nearly
 one-third of the whole weight of the atmosphere.                Therefore,
 to resolve the proposed problem correctly, we must augment the
 velocity of sound, as deduced from the Newtonian theory, in the
 subduplicate ratio of the density of air, under a pressure of 30.04
  inches, and 20.05 respectively.        The density of air made use of
  in the preceding part of this memoir is .0012353, 'the square
  root of which is .03514.         The air under a pressure of 20.05

     To find in what space of time a pendulum whose length is
  2754 1 feet will make one vibration ; we shall assume the measure
  of the one which oscillates seconds, in latitude 45°, as equal to

 206                     On the Propagation   of Sound.
Wished law of pendulous bodies, we find the time in which it
will make one vibration 91.766 seconds. But as the pendulum
performs its going and return in the same time that an undula
tion moves forward over a space which expresses the velocity
of sound in a second ; therefore 91*766 x 2— 183.532 seconds ;
and the space passed over in this time is the circumference of a
circle whose radius is 27541 feet.

   Therefore                     = 942.9          the velocity of
 sound in a second, according to Sir I. Newton's method of cal
 culation.
     To account then for the wide difference that exists between
 the numbers as deduced from this theory, and actual experiments ;
 Newton makes surmises very much beneath his usual penetra
 tion : he first supposes the crassitude of the solid particles of the
 air, and the intervals between those particles, to be in proportion
 to their diameters as 1 to 8 or 9, and from this source he aug
 ments the velocity 109 feet.          Still the velocity is deficient ; and
 to account for    it,  he next takes in the vapours floating in the
 atmosphere, as being of       a   different tone from the air, and con
jectures    their  proportion  to be    to that of the air as 21 to 20;
 and these vapours are calculated to accelerate the progress of
.sound in that ratio      ; thus increasing the velocity to      1   142 in a
second, or until the velocity from theory agrees with that ob
 tained from experiment.          That these conjectures are not even
 plausible, the most ardent admirers of Newton must admit.                  In
the first place, the proportions of the diameters of the particles
of air to the intervals between them are merely imaginary, and
the quantity of vapours calculated as existing in the atmo
sphere   is    absolutely erroneous.    If     Newton failed ultimately, in
this problem, to anticipate the law of nature, the superstructure
is  raised upon an unerring base that can never fail. He had done
enough for glory     ;   and the specks upon his fame are, like those
upon the luminary        of  day, invisible to the unassisted eye. But
while we admire the greatness of the man, let us not tamely follow
his splendid path    ;   the perfection of philosophy requires the un
biassed assistance of the highest flights of human intellect, con
ducted   by   reason, and completed      by   experiment and reflection.   .
    The theory     of LaPlace,  though highly ingenious,    is  nevertheless
very improbable.        That   a momentary      evolution  of caloric  should
take place during every vibration in the aerial medium, we can
not imagine.        But allowing   it   really to be the case, though the
evolution of caloric might be separated with such rapidity as to
escape our means to detect         it  from a single tremor of the air     ;
yet  I   say  that
                 a    sonorous   body, kept in  a    continual state of  vi
bration, must finally render the separation of caloric evident to
                                                                          the

the sense.    Independent of this consideration, we might inquire,
how much the temperature of the particles of air must be raised,
to cause an increase in the velocity of sound, as obtained from
theory, amounting to nearly one-fifth of the whole ?
   What we assert constitutes the real error in Newton's calcula
tion is this, that he omits nearly one-third of the elastic power
of the air, by supposing the whole to be compressed within an
assumed limit ; and that, although the velocity of sound, as esti
mated from the altitude alone, is correct, yet it is evident to us,
that to compress the whole of the atmosphere within the distance
of 27541 feet . from the earth's surface, an additional force,
equal to nearly one-third of the incumbent weight of the atmo
sphere, is necessary : therefore the velocity of sound at the sur
face of the globe, as deduced from Newton's theory, must be in
creased in the subduplicate ratio of 30 04 to 20.05 ; and we
have before ascertained these two numbers to be 35 14 and 2996 :
therefore,                  =  ^ 105.9 feet, the true velocity of sound
in a second, agreeing with the observations of Cassini exactly.
    By this method we have calculated the velocity of sound under
the equator, and at the poles ; and find it greater by about 53
feet at the former than at the latter place; and this difference
will be observed between the fervid air of a summer's day and
the chilling atmosphere of December's reign ; and the velocity
of sound in the latitude of London will be about 1102 feet —
estimating the increase and decrease to correspond with the va
riation of the latitude at the rate of one-sixth of a foot for every
degree.
   An interesting paper was published by Modeste Perolette*, in
which he has made it appear extremely probable that the action
of the solar rays materially affects the propagation of sound.
From his ingenious experiments I should infer that the velocity
of sound during the day was greater by about              of the whole
than in the night, or 22 feet in a second. Every philosophical
observer must have observed the striking difference between the
notes of a sounding body at midnight and noon ; also the very
different tone of the globe itself between a dry surface, and when
the ground is covered with snow.

      XLI I. On the supposed Evolution       of Heal from    Vegetable*.
                                                         March 19, 1814.
    _   . ,    N your  Magazine for February, Mr. Forster in a note
   on January 30th, in his meteorological journal, attributes the
   thawing of the snow around trees and shrubs to the
                                                            " heat trans
   mitted from vegetable bodies."         Having observed the same ap-
.
   pearance,    I at first  also attributed   it to the same cause ; but
   from further observations I soon found reason to reject such an
   explanation of the phenomenon,           because the snow, which lies
   around any substance whatever is affected in a similar way.
   Stones and rocks, and large or small pieces of wood inserted in
 , or lying on the ground amidst snow, present the same appear
   ance precisely, as trees, shrubs, or any other living vegetables.
    Since then we cannot attribute the disappearance of the snow
   in the latter instance to heat, it strikes me that it may be ac
   counted for in another way.       During the late snowy season, I ob
   served that the thaw uniformly commenced and proceeded only
   on the surfaces of the snow ; even that next the earth being con
   siderably affected.     The surface adjacent to a rock or other in
   animate substance thawed slowly for a short time, till a free
   passage for the air was formed ; afterwards melting as rapidly
   as the upper surface, and receding gradually from the rock as a
   centre.
       Thus, whatever the substance may be around which the snow
   has fallen, — when a thaw commences, all the surfaces of the snow
   absorb caloric in the same proportion, or nearly so ; and conse
   quently an uniform retreat of the whole depth of snow will take
   place, and a bare piece of ground will be seen around the sub
   stance, of whatever kind it may be, in the form of a rude circle.
        I have not made the above observations as an argument
   against the supposition that vegetables give out heat, but merely
   to show that Mr. Forster's explanation of the phenomenon which
   has occurred to both of us, does not in all instances hold good.
   This he will have an opportunity of observing, in all probability,
   during the next winter.       It' would be interesting to try a few
   experiments in order to elucidate this matter ; and also to deter
   mine, by the thermometer, if possible, whether or not heat is
   really evolved during the circulation of the vegetable fluids.        Is
   there any sensible heat in cold-blooded animals?            If not, it
   seems improbable that vegetables should afford any.

                                   Compton Street, Soho, March 21, 1814.
                he following   method, which I have lately employed
 for procuring iode, I take the liberty of communicating for inser
 tion in the Philosophical Magazine, (should you deem it of suffi
  cient importance,) and which, in addition to the information al
 ready therein contained on the same subject may not be altoge
 ther unacceptable to some of your chemical readers.               It is as
  follows :
      1 . To a concentrated watery solution of kelp (or the waste ley
  of the soap-maker where kelp has been employed) from which
  the greater part of the crystallizable salts have been separated by
  the usual processes of evaporation and crystallization,         add red
  oxide of lead in the proportion of one ounce to about a pint of
 the former ; boil the mixture over a slow fire to dryness, and in
  crease the heat towards the end of the solution so as to carbonize
  any animal or vegetable matter which the substance may contain.
. This last may most conveniently be performed in an iron ladle.
       2. Digest the dried mass in a quantity of cold water suffi
  cient to extract the greatest portion of the soluble matter, filfer,
   and evaporate the clear liquid to the consistence of a syrup.
       3. Introduce the liquid obtained in the last process, together
   with the saline matter which may have separated during the eva
   poration, into a glass mattrass, and pour thereon about twice its
   bulk of alcohol ; digest with a gentle heat for a few minutes and
   then suffer the vessel with its contents to grow cold.
       4. Decant the clear alcoholic solution into a tubulated retort,
   adapt a receiver, and by means of a gentle and gradually applied
   heat distil off the alcohol.     The saline matter which remains in
   the retort    is to be washed out and evaporated to dryness in a
    capsule of Wedgwood's ware.
       5. Introduce the dry salt thus obtained into a mattrass with a
    short neck, to which a glass tube about six or eight inches long,
    and sufficiently large to fit over the external diameter of the neck,
    has been luted, and pour over the salt by means of a long-
    necked funnel twice its weight of strong sulphuric acid.           Heat
    the mixture gradually by a spirit or Argand's lamp, and the jode
    will immediately begin to rise in the form of a dense and beau
    tiful violet-coloured gas, which will be condensed in the upper
    part of the vessel in black shining crystals; when the gas ceases
    to be disengaged the mattrass should be allowed to cool : the
    iode may then be washed out with water, dried on white filtering
    paper at a temperature not exceeding 100° of Fahrenheit, and
    inclosed in a bottle accurately fitted with a glass stopper.
        The chief advantage of the preceding processes is to separate

    pretty completely all the foreign salts contained in the kelp, and
    to obtain, in a nearly insulated state, the saline compound, from
   which alone iode is to be obtained.
        The mass remaining in the mattrass from which the iode has
   been separated, consists of sulphate of potash with a small pro
   portion of sulphate of soda ; hence it would appear probable that
   in kelp an iode may exist in combination with potash or soda, or
   both, as iodine of potash or of soda.         When iode is added to a
  solution of subcarbonate of potash a combination takes place,
  and the mixture assumes a dark-brown colour.                If a gentle heat
  be applied, this colour dissappears and the solution remains of a
  pale straw-yellow colour, a boiling heat does not separate iode
  from this combination, but if the solution be evaporated to dry
  ness, the addition of sulphuric acid to the dry mass separates iode
  under its characteristic form.

                     thank you to notice in the Philosophical Maga
 zine for next month the following typographical mistake, which
 occurs in some copies of that work, published last month ; namely,
 for the words oxide of lime, page 146, line 6, read oxide of lead.
      Having been applied to from different quarters concerning this
 mistake, you will perhaps do me the favour to reprint by way of
 answering my correspondents*, the paragraph again in which
the error occurs.      This paragraph should read thus :
               " Another      Process of obtaining Iode.
     " Iode  is to be found in abundance in the waste or spent lee
of those soap manufacturers who employ kelp in the preparation
of soap. To obtain the iode from the waste lee, let it be boiled
for a few minutes with quicklime ; strain the fluid and mingle it
with sulphuric acid in ex cess f. This being done, evaporate the

correspondents who have honoured him with their inquiries concerning the
above error of the press, &c. but reminds thtm that it is usual on such
occasions, to pay postage.
    f  The boilmg of the lee with quicklime is not essential, but it is neces
sary that the'sulphuric acid should be added greatly in excess.

 flask, or retort with red oxide of lead and sulphuric acid.         The
 iode will thus be obtained in abundance; and this in fact, con
 stitutes the cheapest process of obtaining it."
    If  the product to be distilled with manganese has not been
 freed sufficiently from the muriates in which the soap lee abounds,
 there then          copious production of chlorine, together with
               is
               a                                                             a
 yellow   fluid, and   then the quantity of iode becomes considerably
 diminished.       This loss may be guarded against,   it by
                                                          adding filings
 of zinc to the mixture, previously to submiting         to distillation.
 In fact, the addition of zinc filings effects the expulsion of an ad
 ditional portion of iode from the mass, after the oxide of lead
 or manganese has ceased to act.
     For the knowledge of this fact,   I am indebted to the chemical
 professor of the Royal Institution.
    It   isobvious that instead of waste lee, the so called black ash,
 dissolved in water, may be successfully employed.       •

                                                               March 1814.
               r. Accum having given to the public through the
 medium of your Magazine, some processes for preparing iodine,
I  have repeated them with success     ; and I beg, through the same
 channel, to point out another method of preparing iodine not
 mentioned     by
                that chemist, but which has been found to answer
 well.   The  operation consists in concentrating the waste lees of
 the soap manufacturer,        by
                               boiling, and then mixing     with spirit
                                                               it
 of wine, or alcohol the salts of the lee become precipitated, and
                        ;
fall down to the bottom, but the iodine remains         inthe spirit of
wine.     Ifthe spirit now be distilled off, and the residue be then
 heated with   a little sulphuric acid, and manganese, or red lead,
the iodine sublimates in the neck of the retort. About one drachm
of iodine was thus procured in the presence of the members of the
new Chemical Society of London, from ten wine gallons of soap
lees, and this substance     therefore unquestionably, as Mr. Accum
                             is
observes, the best substance for obtaining iodine.

XLVI.       On the Capacity for Heat, or Calorific Power       of various
              Liquids.   By Benjamin Count Rumford*.
This     subject is of rather an obscure nature, and it has been so
little examined, that it will be useful to begin by elucidating it as
well   as 1   can.
     Let   us suppose two cylindrical   vessels, with very thick sides,
made of lead or any other metal, and perfectly equal in size, each
being capable of containing a pint.
    These two vessels being at the freezing point, we shall pour
into the one a pound of water at the temperature of 96 F
 ( = 28| R) being that of the blood, and into the other a pound
of olive oil at the same temperature.
    Each of these liquids will heat the cold vessel in which it ii
placed, the vessel in its turn will cool the liquid, and both the
liquid and the vessel will latterly be of the same temperature.
    If water and oil of olives had the same calorific power, a
pound of water at the temperature of 96° would heat its cold
vessel precisely as much and not more than a pound of oil would
heat its vessel, the two vessels being of the same weight, and at
the same temperature at the commencement of the experiment.
    But experience shews that water heats its vessel much more
than oil does : consequently the calorific power of water is greater
than the calorific power of oil of olives, when the quantities
of these two liquids are estimated by their weight ; and if we de
signate the calorific power of water by 1. the calorific power of
oil of olives will be expressed by a fraction under 1.
    The power with which any given body, solid or liquid, being
at a given temperature, resists the calorific or frigorific action of
bodies warmer or colder than itself, is in proportion to its calo
rific power ; and the greater is this power, the longer it resists
these actions of surrounding bodies.
     If,under equal surfaces, a pound of water and        a  pound of oil
of olives, both at the same temperature (96          F)    are placed at
the same time in a place where the temperature            is  lower (that
of freezing   for instance) the oil of olives will be cooled  much more
rapidly than the water.
     Ifit be in    warm place that the two liquids are exposed, the
                     a
oil of olives will still have its temperature most rapidly changed      ;
it  will be more heated than the water.
    In two cylindrical glass vessels of equal size and very thin,
place equal quantities of water and at the same temperature
(96 F.)

   A piece of lead weighing a pound, and a piece of copper of
the same weight, having been cooled in a mixture of pounded
ice and water, remove them from this cold mixture and plunge
each of them suddenly into one of the vessels of water.
   The two masses of water will be cooled : but that which con
tains the copper most, for the calorific power of copper is greater
than the calorific power of lead.
   We may also say that the frigorific power of copper is greater
than the frigorific power of lead, and in the case in question,
the expression perhaps will be most suitable.
   It is always the same power : it is thai by means of which any
body resists the action of surrounding bodies, and which tends
to change its temperature either by increase or diminution.
   Much obscurity has been introduced into the science by vague
ideas, being attached to the words hot and cold; but it will not
suit my purpose to enlarge upon this subject at present.       1 have
already delivered my opinion in a former paper.
   The little heat which I discovered in the condensation of al
cohol, having induced me to think that the specific heat of this
liquid had not been accurately determined, and wishing to know
it precisely, in order to enable me to finish the calculations which
were necesssary for elucidating the results of some of my experi
ments, I constructed a small and very simple apparatus, by the
help of which I could easily, and as I presume accurately, deter
mine it.
   This apparatus consists of a small bottle of a particular form
constructed of thin leaves of red copper, intended to contain
the liquid which is to be the subject of the experiment ; and a
small cylindrical vase, also constructed of thin pieces of red
copper in which I place water at a certain temperature.          Into
this water I plunge the bottle of copper containing the liquid
which is the subject of the experiment : this liquid being of a
different temperature from that of the water in the outer vase.
   As the capacity of the vase for heat, as well as that of the bot
tle are known, I determine by a very simple calculation, the ca
pacity for heat of the liquid contained in the bottle.      This cal
culation which is well known, is founded in the changes which
take place in the temperature of liquids, in the vase and in the
bottle, by taking an uniform temperature, when the bottle is im
mersed in the water contained in the vessel.
   In order that this equality of temperature may be speedily
brought about, the form of the bottle is such that it has a very
great surface relative to its small capacity, and in order to ma
nage it without touching    it, its neck which  is smallis  closed by
a long cork, which serves as a handle.
    In order to diminish as much as possible the effect of the at-

mosphere, and of surrounding bodies upon the apparatus, while
the experiment is going on, the quantity of water in the vessel
is regulated so as to keep the bottle wholly submerged in the
liquid, and even the upper end of the neck covered, when the
bottle is immersed.     The vessel which contains this water is
placed and suspended by a ring of cork in another vessel larger
and higher, and the interval between the two is filled with eider
down.
   The form of the bottle is such that its horizontal section pre
sents the figure of a rectangular cross.        Some idea may be
conceived of its form and dimensions, if we suppose a square
piece of stick, each facet of which is four lines broad by four
inches three lines in length, upon the four faces of which we
have fixed four sticks of the same length       e.   inches    (i.
                                                                lines) 4          3
but  each  of  them being four lines thick    eight broad.    by
   The four sticks last described will exhibit the figure of the
bottle :  for the square piece of stick will be concealed        them             by
from our view.
    The neck of the bottle     in the prolongation of its axis
                                      is                                               :   it
is four lines diameter           by
                           four high       ought to be circular
                                                     :   it        the                :
cork should be an inch long, and the bottle weigh 76,07 grammes
without its cork.
   The cylindrical vase which contains the water          two inches        is
diameter, and four inches nine lines high, and         weighs 74*65    it
grammes.
   The exterior vessel in which the latter          suspended by the cork
                                                              is
ring,  is five inches three lines high and three inches diameter, so
that the sides and bottom are every where separated              an interval by
of six lines    :this interval       filled with eider down as already
                                          is
mentioned.
    To prevent the water from touching the eider down, the cork
ring  is covered with      thin coating of mastic.

liquid which        contains, without being obliged to plunge
                    it                                                 ther       a
mometer into the bottle, which would in this case be incon
venient,    I employed       very simple method.
                              a
 I    placed a large bucket filled with water in              room witha                   a
northern aspect          allowed

room, taking care to shut the door and windows day and night.
I  placed the small bottle on        standa      this bucket, keeping the

small   and  has     large surface,
                     a                 speedily acquires the temperature

the bottle and the liquid which              contains have acquired the

    .ii giving a detailed account of an experiment made with this
apparatus, I shall have an opportunity of giving clear and precise
ideas of the different parts of my apparatus, and of the particular
objects which they are intended to attain.
    Having found by various preliminary experiments made with
water that the capacity for heat of the cylindrical vessel with that
of the thermometer employed to determine the temperature of
the water which it contained, was equal to that of 24.3 grammes
of water, and that the specific heat of the bottle of copper was
equal to that of 8'36 grammes of water.             I made the following
experiment with purified linseed oil.
    I put into the cylindrical vessel 1 80 grammes of water : the
temperature of the room was 59\° F.           I filled the copper bottle
with the above oil, and corked it. I cooled it in a bucket of
water at the temperature of 44|° F.              The oil in the bottle
weighed 82 55 grammes.
    The bottle having had time to acquire the temperature of
44 10 F. was withdrawn from the bucket, and placed in a cylin
drical vessel of tinned iron, of about four inches diameter, and
six high, filled to the height of four inches and a half with water,
at the temperature of 44 \° F.
    The bottle being submersed in this vessel of cold water, was
carried into the room where I had placed the small vessel of
copper belonging to the apparatus : it was then taken out of the.
cold water and plunged into the water contained in the small
cylindrical vessel of copper which contained 180 grammes of
water, at the temperature of 59£° F.
   A thermometer having a cylindrical reservoir four inches long,
which was placed in this vessel beside the copper bottle, soon
fell, and in three or four minutes it marked 56 j° of F. where it
remained a long time stationary, and afterwards began to ascend
slowly.
    The capacities for heat of the warm bodies which were cooled
in this experiment, were equal to that of 204'3 grammes of
water; viz. That of the water employed                    180 grammes.
               That of the vases and thermometer 24.3
                                          Total        '204.3-
    The capacity for heat of the bottle containing the oil was
equal to that of                               S'36 grammes of water.
    And to this we must add the cold water
adhering to the bottle, when it came out
of the cold water, and was plunged
into the water contained in the copper
vessel,   I found by a particular experi
ment that this quantity of water was     ....   1-04

   Now as the temperature of the warm Water in the cylindrical
vase of copper was that of 59| before the mixture, and 264 after
the communication of the heat had been obtained, it is evident
that this water was cooled 2J°.    But if we multiply the number
of grammes of     water which the  specific heat of this water re
presents, and that of the vessel = 204*3 grammes by the number
of degrees which it has been cooled (2£'') we shall have a pro
duct which will express the number of grammes of water, which
would have been cooled one degree of F. by a loss of heat equal
to that which the vessel and its contents supported in this ex
periment.    It is 204.3 x2-75 x561-84 grammes.
   We 6hall now see what part of this heat was communicated to
the bottle, and to the small portion of cold water attached to               it,
and what part to the oil contained in the bottle.
   As the temperature of the bottle and its contents was 445° F.
before the mixture, and 65        afterwards,
                                     \°            evident that the
                                                   it   is
bottle  had  acquired 12£°  of  heat: consequently     we multiply
                                                             if
9-4 (the number which expresses the ium of the capacities for
heat of the bottle, and of the cold water adhering to         12|°,
                                                                  it)   by
we shall have a product which will express the number of
grammes of water, which would have been heated one degree                    by
the heat communicated during the experiment to the bottle, and
to the small portion of water which adhered to it.
   It    9.4 x 12.25 = 115.1.4 grammes.
        is
   If from the heat lost        by
                             the vessel and the
warm water which we have found equal to
that which      necessary for raising the tem
                  is
perature   of  561 .86 grammes of water, one
degree   of       F                             561.83 grammes.
   We take the quantities which the bottle and
the water adhering to the bottle have received 115-15
                     We shall have          446.69 grammes
of water heated one degree, expressing the quantity of heat em
ployed for raising to 12|° F. the temperature of the 82-55
grammes of linseed oil which were put into the bottle.
   On dividing this number (446-69)      12   by
                                              we shall see how
                                                   J,
many grammes of water would have been heated one degree,                     by
the quantity of heat in question.
  It    is   therefore 446*69
                       —
                                                 .
                            .   =Jb-4b4 grammes of water.
   By the results of this calculation we find that the same quan
tity of heat which     necessary to raise the temperature of 36*464
                           is
grammes of water 12 degrees and         half of Fahrenheit's thermo
                                          a
meter,    sufficient to raise the temperature of 82*55 grammes of
             is
oil the same number of degrees.
                                                              Consequently

             or Calorific Power   of various Liquids.                          217
   Consequently the capacity of water for heat is greater than
that of oil of linseed in the proportion of 82,55 to 36,464 : and
if we express the capacity of the water by unity as is usually done,
the capacity of the above oil ought to be expressed by the frac
tion 0.44172.
   These details must no doubt appear superfluous to those who
are versed in the higher branches of knowledge, and who are
accustomed to express the most complete relations by algebraical
signs : but it must be recollected, that the subject of which I
treat is familiar to few, and that it is necessary to explain with
rigorous accuracy the principles upon which the method em
ployed is founded, as well as the manner of using the apparatus
which I recommend. .
   On repeating twice the experiment made with pure linseed oil.
I had as a result in one of these experiments a capacity for heat
equal to                                               0'44411
   And in the other equal to                           0'47193
    If to these two results we add that of the first
experiment, equal to                                   0*44172

heat in sulphuric ether,, but my astonishment was diminished
when 1 recollected that this liquid can unite with alcohol in all
proportions, without exhibiting any symptoms of a chemical
action : for this reason therefore, we ought to expect to find the
same capacity for heat in both liquids.

w     e have already had occasion to notice the successful labours
of Mr. Adams in that branch of medical science which regards
the treatment of the diseased eye.        We have now before us a
most interesting publication occasioned by the same gentleman's
professional exertions among the pensioners of Greenwich Hos
pital, and since printed by the express order of the directors, after
a careful investigation of the merits of the practice which it re
commends, the high sanction of official authority is now superin
duced upon the well earned fame which Mr, Adams has already
acquired.                                                                   j

   Tn a short advertisement    prefixed to the present publication,
we are informed that the directors     of Greenwich Hospital, having
heard of the great improvements made by Mr. Adams, in the
modes of operating on the different kinds of cataract, he was re
quested to examine the blind pensioners, with a view to ascer
tain what could be effected for their relief.
   Mr. Adams accordingly selected twenty cases for operation,
consisting of cataracts, closed pupils, and the Egyptian ophthalmia.
For the temporary accommodation of these patients, a house in
town was taken by the directors, and they were placed under the
immediate care of Mr. Adams, who very handsomely disclaimed
all expectation of remuneration for his services.
   The Reports of -the Medical Officers of the Institution having
certified that the operations performed by Mr. Adams had been
attended with the greatest success, a special meeting was called,
at which the directors personally examined and interrogated the
pensioners, who had been under treatment for diseased eyes,
                                                                 " as
well those who had been under the care of former oculists, as
the patients of Mr. Adams."
   The result was highly honourable to the professional reputa
tion of Mr. Adams and the directors considered it to be a duty
which they owed to humanity, to give publicity under the au
thority of their names to the whole proceedings which had taken
place.
    In a communication dated May 25, 1813, from Mr. M'Laugh-
lin, surgeon to Greenwich Hospital, that gentleman informs the
directors " that the first set of patients sent to London, requiring
thirteen eyes to be operated on, are all cured, with the exception
of one man, David H6ar, a person of notoriously perverse charac
ter, who was attacked with fever, and sent back to the Hospital
for the cure thereof ; but even in this case there is every prospect
of success, from a repetition of the operation.     Eleven other pa
tients who were sent to replace those already cured, have all been
operated on, and with the prospect of complete success (except
ing two that had been previously couched by another oculist), five
being already capable of seeing, and the others proceeding as fa
vourably as could be expected.
   " The superior success of Mr. Adams's new modes of practice,
when compared with the operation performed on the pensioners
for the last fifteen years, is very striking. . On examining the
latter it appears, that out of twenty-Jour eyes operated upon,
several had been destroyed ; in other instances the pupils had
become obliterated, and one only had been benefited, and even
that the success is incomplete.
   "  Among the men already cured, some of the cases are so re
markable as to merit particular notice.
                                                           " Edward

220                  Notices respecting New Books.
    " Edward Turner had, during six months that he was a patient
of the London Eye Infirmary, undergone thirteen operations;
nevertheless, he obtained but very little benefit in one eye, and
none in the other : Mr. Adams has cured both by one operation
on each.
    " Hartgill had been blind for near twenty years, and was con
sidered by every oculist of eminence in London to labour under
Gutta Serena.       Mr. Adams has successfully operated on him,
and   he  is now capable of reading the smallest print.
    " Bray, aged seventy-nine years, is cured of cataract in both
eyes, and was capable, in the space of a fortnight, of seeing the
minutest objects.
    " Douglas, aged thirty-two, with closed pupils, after having
been above five . years a patient of the oculist before referred to>
without experiencing the least benefit, has had an artificial pupil
formed, by which he is enabled so see the most minute objects
with distinctness ; his other eye has been since operated on, and
promises to be equally successful.
    "  I cannot, in justice to Mr. Adams, conclude this Report,
without expressing to you how greatly I am indebted to his li
berality and disinterestedness in communicating to me much va
luable information and instruction relating to diseases of the eye,
which I trust will eventually be attended with considerable ad
vantage to that class of objects, the afflicted blind, who constitute
no small proportion of the invalids admitted into this noble
asylum.
    Subsequently Mr. M'Laughlin reported that in consequence
of the absence of Mr. Adams from London, for a few months it
was requisite to recal the pensioners to the Hospital — and,"    "
this gentleman adds,     "   I have infinite pleasure in repeating that
Mr. Adams's practice and operations upon them have been sucr
cessful in a most extraordinary degree.         Many are perfectly re
stored to sight ;   and  all  the others, where there was any reason-,
able prospect of a cure, though as yet necessarily only convale
scent, are going on favourably ; and should it be the pleasure of
the governor and directdrs to review those that have undergone
operations, I beg that they may be presented before them, for
that purpose, at the next Board at the Royal Hospital."
    A vote of thanks from the governor and directors succeeded
these flattering testimonies; and, latterly, the whole medical
officers of the Institution made the following communications            to
the Board, which we consider to be so interesting as to require
no apology for giving at length.

tions for the cure of cataract which have been practised upon the
pensioners of the Royal Hospital, the great disparity in which
cannot fail to make a strong impression on the minds of the ho
nourable members of the Board.
  "   In order to bring them equally acquainted with the extent
of the failures in extracting the cataract, as formerly practised,
as well as with the great success of Mr. Adams's improved modes
of curing that disease, we have given a detailed description of
the result of each, with the present state of the eyes which have
been submitted to the trial of the two systems.
    " The proportion of the eyes totally destroyed by the operation
of extraction amounts to one-half the number operated upon ;
to this the success of Mr. Adams, more particularly in the casea
which had been considered incurable, as well as those previously
operated upon without benefit, forms a very striking contrast, as
it will be seen that his operations have failed but in one instance.
    " To enable the Board fully to appreciate this success, we
think it proper to point out, that even in the men whose vision
is not at all, or but partially, benefited (with the exception of
 Ford), the operations were as perfectly executed as on those
whose sight is completely restored.        To the disease of the optic
 nerve, therefore, and not to the failure of the operation (as was
 the case where extraction had been formerly performed), is to
 be attributed the want of that perfectly successful issue which is
so conspicuously displayed in the " unexceptionable cases."
   "   This diseased state of the optic nerve in those patients was
 originally apprehended by Mr. Adams ; and when, at their ur
 gent solicitations, he was prevailed upon to perform the necessary
 operations, he stipulated, that, should the event confirm his un
                                                                        v
 favourable opinions, we should attest the circumstances under
 which they were undertaken.
   "   Itis, however, very important to have ascertained,     by actual
 experiment, as Mr. Adams has done on several of the pensioners,
 that the optic nerve, although so much diseased as to have de
 terred a former practitioner from operating, yet, by the removal
 of the cataracts, and subjecting the eyes to     a  particular plan of
 discipline, their functions have been sufficiently recovered to
 afford useful, and sometimes almost perfect, vision. An instance
 of the latter is shown in the case of Hartgill, blind for nearly
 twenty years, as supposed,    by  all the highest authorities in Lon
  don, from gutta serena, for which disease he had been treated.
  Bray's and Wilkins's perfect restoration to sight are little less
  extraordinary, from the great age of the former, and the latter
  having had an artificial pupil formed after a   complete obliteration
                                                                     of

 of that aperture, by    an unsuccessful operation of extracting the
 cataract, performed seven years since.
    " These, together with the other cases included in the two last
 divisions of the Report No. 2, prove that a very large proportion
 of persons unhappily afflicted with blindness, and hitherto con
 sidered incurable, are now susceptible of relief from the new and
 improved operations, and the after- management of the eyes,
 practised by Mr. Adams.
    " In addition to the gratifying contents of the second Report,
 we think it our duty to state, for the information of the Board,
 that Mr. Adams has discovered a mode of curing the Egyptian
 ophthalmia, which has been successfully practised upon several
of the pensioners, some of whom had been blind for three or
four years, and given up as incurable by the most eminent ocu
lists then in London.      The communication that this destructive
 and hitherto intractable disease admits of cure we conceive will
be gladly received by the Board, and the promulgation by Mr.
Adams of this important discovery be considered as a great na
tional desideratum.
    " By the adoption of his practice we are of opinion, from what
we have seen of its effects, that a very large proportion of the
seamen and soldiers, who have been discharged the'service, blind
of the ophthalmia, might be again rendered fit for duty, or be
made useful members of society.
    " We cannot conclude this letter without stating, in justice to
Mr. Adams, that he has freely demonstrated his practice ; and
that he has, in the most liberal and unreserved manner, given us
every information that we required relating to the treatment of
diseases of the eyes.

       In   a letter to the Governor   and Directors explanatory of his
     practice,  which follows   the  above  interesting documents, Mr.
     Adams observes, " from the statements which have been made of
     the success of the practice of extraction, the public have been
     taught to believe that it possessed all the excellence of which any
     operation for the cure of cataract was susceptible.       It became,
    therefore, highly necessary that such an experiment as the pre
     sent should be instituted ; and that, under the immediate super-
     intendance of impartial and disinterested persons, whose testi
    mony could not be doubted."
        All personal allusions to other operators are thus handsomely
    disclaimed.
       "   And here I beg leave to repeat the observation I made at my
    first interview with your honourable Board, that it is the opera
     tion, and not the operator, which I deprecate. Were he to
     adopt my operations, or were 1 to follow his, the results of the
    two modes of practice would probably be nearly the same as they
'
    are now found to be ; nor shall I hesitate to add my firm belief,
     that superior manual dexterity is not to be found in this king
     dom, than is possessed by the operator whose efforts have proved
    so unavailing, in the many instances submitted to your considera
     tion.   It is,  conceive, the want of
                      1                        personal experience of the
                                                a
    superior efliacy of my practice, which prevents his adopting       it
    with the same promptitude, as another oculist of long-established
     Celebrity has done, since he saw me operate    ;   who, before that
    period, was distinguished    by his practice, as well as writings, as
    one of the wannest advocates of the operation of extraction,
      "    Itmay be proper to inform your honourable Board that        I
    have not confined myself to any individual operation in the treat
    ment of the pensioners blind of cataract intrusted to my care.

     Mv instruments and modes of operating have varied as the na
    ture of the case required.    Where the consistence of the cataract
    has admitted of an immediate and complete division,         I     have
    placed the separated portions in       situation which insured their
                                            a
    absorption in five or six weeks. In these cases, the general success
    of the operation exceeds all credibility with those who have been
    in the habit of witnessing the results of other modes of practice.

I      have performed this operation,    have not lost an eye.

    instances alone, in which    I   was prevented from repeating the
    operation,  it did not produce the anticipated benefit and should

in   a state favourable for the operation.      Hence arises a very im
 portant question : To what period of life does this particular
 practice apply ? To which I have a ready answer ; — That I have
 never failed in being enabled to effect this necessary division in
 persons under forty years of age ; very rarely in those between
forty and fifty, and have frequently succeded in persons in the
 most advanced periods of life.
     " Where the cataract is too hard and solid to admit of this
 immediate division, I do not attempt, as was my former practice,
 to effect its absorption by a frequent repetition of the operation;
 but I at once extract it. This, however, is accomplished by a
 process totally different from that I have felt it a duty to de
 precate ; a process which I must claim to be novel, and which
 happily attains the highly important desiderata which had been
 hitherto considered unattainable, while it obviates the many
 causes of failure which rendered the usual mode of extraction so
 generally unsuccessful.       From the principle upon which it is
 founded, and the favourable results of its termination during the
 last two years that I have extensively practised       it,I   feel myself
 warranted in asserting that    it  possesses the. utmost degree of ex
 cellence which   it   ispossible for extraction to arrive at, and that
 its general success will prove nearly as great as the operation for
 the removal of the soft cataract.       To deter other persons from
 claiming  it  as their invention, or anticipating me in its commu
 nication to the public (as was the case with my instruments and
 operation for the cure of the soft cataract, and my successful re
 vival of an obsolete operation for artificial pupil), have requested

 stages of this operation, as he has seen me perform          iton several
 of the pensioners.
     "I  trust thatit  will not be considered as irrelevant to the sub
ject of the present communications to inform you, that there.
 are different modes of effecting the cure of cataract         by  the ab
 sorbent practice.       My    friend  and   preceptor,    the   late   Mr.
  Saunders, pursued     a system different from that which     I    have so
 warmly supported in this letter.        The operation which he pre
 ferred had been performed thirteen times during six months on
 one of the pensioners (Edward Turner) without         a  removal of the
 disease.    Oh one of my private patients the same operation had
 been performed seventeen times prior to my having been con
 sulted, ten times on one eye, and seven on the other, in the
  course of as many months, and with no better success.             In both
  instances    perfected the cure    by
                                      a  single operation   on  each   eye

  have effected the complete removal of the cataracts in the space
  of five or six weeks. This difference in the two modes of ope
  rating, it is of great importance to myself distinctly to specify,
  otherwise, from its being generally known that I was the sole.
  confidential pupil and assistant of the late Mr. Saunders in his
  operations for cataract, among those who are now pursuing the
  profession of an oculist, it might be considered by many, who
  have not seen my work on diseases of the eye, that I still, as in
  the commencement of my practice, follow his modes of opera
  tion, whereas I have long since found it necessary wholly to aban
  don them."
     In the formal official report) with which the publication con
  cludes, the directors state that having examined the pensioners
  " on whom operations had been performed by other oculists of
 undoubted character and eminence, it appeared that many of
 these pensioners had irrecoverably lost their sight, the eye being
 in several instances entirely sunk, and, except in one instance,
 none had experienced the desired relief."
     The directors then proceed to pay the following just tribute to
 the merits of Mr. Adams :
     "  The pensioners who had been under the care of Mr. Adams
 were next examined and interrogated, and their respective cases
 wire compared with the report enclosed in the above-mentioned
 letter from the physician, surgeon, and apothecary ; and the
board were much gratified by so many instances of the great suc
cess which had attended the operations of Mr. Adams.            The
effect of those operations appeared to be accurately in the report
in question."
     While we congratulate our readers on the manifest improve
ments thus recorded in the treatment of that most delicate of all
human organs, the eye, it affords us additional satisfaction to
learn that, the directors of Greenwich Hospital have requested

A   long paper by Dr. Herschell was read, detailing the result of
many years observations on the sidereal and nebulous appearance
of the heavens. The Doctor began by relating his observations
on the relative magnitudes of the stars, considering those of the
first magnitude to be equal to our sun ; determined the magni
tudes and changes in the appearance of a great number of fixed

stars ; gave a history of the alterations which he ha3 noticed in
the aspect of the sidereal heavens, during the last 30 years ;
and described those stars which have increased in magnitude, or
brilliancy, have lost or acquired surrounding nebule, or have
had wings, tails, or other peculiarities.     He seems inclined to
believe, from his observations, that' .new sidereal bodies are in
a constant and progressive state of formation, that nebulous ap
pearances gradually assume a globular character ; that the hea
vens are not infinite, and that stars have a "compressing power."
He considers the origin and progress of sidereal bodies to be
nearly in the following order : first, vague and indistinct nebule,
like the milky way ; second, detached or clustered nebule, which
consolidate into clusters of stars ; thirdly, these stars becoming
more definite appear with nebulous appendages in the different
forms of wings, tails, &c. ; and lastly, that all are finally concen
trated into one clear, bright, and large star.     Dr. H. concludes
that the progressive discovery of nebule will be equal to the im
provement of our telescopes, and that in proportion as we are
possessed of more powerful space-penetrating        instruments, will
our knowledge of the sidereal heavens be extended.           Many of
his latter observations directed to ascertain the absorption or con
densation of nebule were made on stars, which he Ijad before
described in his numerous papers in the Phil. Transact. ; othfts
were made on those whose places have been determined by foreign
astronomers.
     March 10. Mr. Seppins, one of the surveyors of the Navy, in
a letter to the President, described his new system of ship-build
ing ; he observed that notwithstanding the rapid progress in all
 the arts and sciences, no improvement in naval architecture has
taken place during many years.        In order to make the simple
but great improvement which he has introduced more intel- ,
 ligible, he began by describing the old structure of ships, of
 their keel and ribs or timbers placed at right angles, and the
 bottom and decks composed of parallel planks.           According to
 the new construction, on which three ships have already been
 built, awl four more are building, the timbers are crossed wjth
 diagonal girders at angles of 45, so that the whole frame is ren
 dered much stifFer or more inflexible, and all parts of the struc
 ture made to bear their due portion of the pressure at the same
 time.    The first advantage of this plan is the prevention . of
  what is called hogging, or having the centre become convex on
  the upper, and concave on the lower side.     Mr. Seppins fills up
  the space between the timbers with pieces of wood taken from
 old ships, macit in the form of wedges, which are reversed, driven
 in tight; paid with tar, and made impervious to water, so that
 should an outer plank start, the vessel will be in no danger of
                                                               sinking

sinking,   as in the old system. This method not only adds greatly
to the stiffness and strength of the vessel, but also prevents the
timbers and flooring from becoming a prey to the rot occasioned
by moisture and stagnant air.            Mr. S. exposes the notion of
ships being    elastic, and contends    that they are stronger and bet
ter in proportion as they are non-elastic, and capable of resisting
pressure in whatever direction it may be applied.          Considerable
advantage he also considers must attend his plan, from the su
perior stiffness and strength of the decks, composed of frame
work with diagonal binders, so that the deck, instead of being a
series of parallel boards, having very little connection with each
other, and susceptible of being detached in any emergency, will
present a continuous mass of timber, having its grain placed in
all directions best adapted to make the greatest possible resist
ance to any external force.        There are many other minor im
provements     in  this new method,     such as obviating the necessity
of much iron work, so that no extrfi-weight is occasioned by tha
filling-up between the timbers ; less ballast is required ; much
old ship. timber can be used with advantage ; and lastly, in the
 construction of a 74 gun ship, 178 trees, of 50 feet each, are
 saved.
     March 17. A paper by Dr. Alex. Crichton was read, contain
 ing' an account of his experiments on the vitality of organized
 matter.     The author having observed that organized bodies are
 influenced by laws very different from those of chemistry, that
 living matter overcomes affinity and gravity, and that whenever
 life ceases, the decomposition of organized bodies commences,
seems thence to infer that there are two kinds of matter, or that
 organized matter still retains some latent vitality, notwithstand
 ing its chemical decomposition.       To ascertain this point, he made
 a variety of experiments on different vegetables, on dried barks,
 flowers, &c. using decoctions of vegetable matter exposed to the
 action of oxygen and other gases in glass tubes over mercury,
 and in all of them, except a decoction of liquorice root, he dis
 covered traces of vitality or fructification in a few days. The leaves
 of flowers he always found yielded the greatest quantities of orga^
 nized or vitalic matter.
     March 24. Dr. Young, with that acuteness and facility of ap
 plying mathematical principles to practice for which he is di
 stinguished, presented a paper to the Society, which was read,
 consisting of remarks on the principles and improvements in naval
 architecture proposed by    Mr. Seppins.

      M. Delambre, the secretary to this branch of the Institute,
   commences his report by lamenting the death of IVf. Lagrange,
  and the consequent suspension, of the publication of the Me-
  chaniqve Analylique, the printing of the second volume of which
   had just commenced when the author died.
       M. Laplace, the report proceeds, who last year favoured
  the scientific world with a complete Treatise on Probabilities, has
  this year applied his theory to one of the most abstruse ques
  tions in astronomy; viz. the origin of comets and the nature of
  their orbits.
      Dr. Herschel's opinion on this subject is fresh in every one's
  recollection.     Perceiving almost every where in the celestial re
  gions   a faintly luminous matter, interspersed with points, denser
  or more luminous, he conceived that in time the system of uni
  versal attraction might unite round these centres the nebulous
  matter with which they are surrounded ; that in consequence of
  their mutual attraction two or more of these centres might ac
  quire a movement, that this motion might carry them to the
  surface of the sphere over which the attractive energy of the sun
, exerts its influence j and that this motion, combined with the solar
  attraction, might convert these centres into as many new comets
  circulating around the sun, and obeying the same laws as the
  planets : that this may have been the origin of all the planets,
  and also of the sun and stars ; for if we are constrained to admit
  the anterior existence of these immense bodies, we may with
  equal propriety assign the same date to the lesser bodies which
  circulate around them.
     These new orbits will of course he circular, elliptic, parabolic,
  or hyperbolic.
     In the case of the orbits being circular, they will be always in
  visible, unless, in defiance of probability, we suppose that then.
  mass and inherent lights are sufficient to render them visible
  at so great a distance, for the nuclei or centres of Dr. Herschel
  are invisible by a common telescope.
     If the orbits are elliptical or parabolic, the comets may come
  so near the sun that they will become visible in a portion of their
  orbits comprehended between the perihelion and the parometer,
  and even somewhat beyond it.         This supposition accounts with
  tolerable plausibility for the phenomena hitherto exhibited by
  comets.     Their larger axis must go beyond the sphere of the
  sun's energy, which must extend much further than the orbit of
  Uranus.      Such elongated ellipses will evidently be confounded
                                                                  with

\vith parabolas, having the same summit.            The revolutions of
such comets will be so tedious that we can scarcely expect to see or .
know them again, after the many alterations which they may have
undergone in that part of their orbit, out of the reach of all hu
man view, and where so many causes may modify their elements.
    The above, if adopted, would also account for the length and
tenuity of their tails.      The nebulous matter, condensed by at
traction so as to form the comet, being dilated by the solar heat^
would resume nearly its primitive tenuity, and might even eva
porate and be lost in space.          Having thus lost its tail and its
nebulosity, the comet will be exactly similar to the four little
planets.      It may even by being dissipated, cease to exist, and
astronomers might lose all their labour in calculating its ele
ments.      It would be sufficient for them to be in possession of
the coarse approximation, which puts it in their power to satisfy
the public curiosity, without much trouble, during the short time
that the comet is visible from our earth.
    Some comets, however, have exhibited peculiarities inconsist
ent with this hypothesis.       Halley's, for instance, has the great
axis   of its  orbit smaller than that of Uranus. The comet of 1770
had a great axis less than that of Jupiter.       According to M. La
place, these singularities may be produced by the planetary at
 tractions or the resistance of the sthereal medium ; but the pla
netary attractions ought to be very weak at the entrance of the
comet into the sphere of the sun's energy ; and Laplace himself
has rendered the resistance of the aerial medium very problematic
and inconsistent with the constancy of the great axis of the pla
netary orbits.
    If an elongated elliptical orBit be confounded with a parabola,
the difference is not greater between the parabola and hyperbola.
 The insufficiency of the parabola in some cases having been as
 certained, it has been found necessary to have recourse to the
ellipsis.     How has it happened that the necessity for the hyper
bola has never been felt ?        Of 117 comets whose elements we
are acquainted with, two only are decidedly elliptical : the re
 mainder are parabolic or elliptical.     In fact there is nothing to
prevent us from considering these orbits as hyperbolic, but dif
fering infinitely little from the parabola, and in this case there
would be no occasion for surprise at the nature of these orbits
having escaped us. The elliptical orbit of the comet of 1759
was only ascertained by its various returns in the interval of 75
or 76 years, and but for these returns its orbit would have been
 regarded as parabolic.        Hyperbolic comets never return ; and
 hence we have no opportunity of rectifying any mistake : hence
 also we have no evidence that the hyperbolic orbits are more rare
 than the elliptical. They may be even much more numerous

without any suspicions being entertained on the subject, but
M\ Laplace confines his observations to those only whose hyper-                        •
bolic orbits may   be recognised by actual observation.   In fact we
are not acquainted with one of the kind.
   Why are hyperbolic orbits so rare ? This is a question which
Cannot be completely answered ; and all that we can do is to
apply to it the calculus of probabilities.               If,
                                                among several cases,
all appearing equally probable, there be one which seldom or
never occurs, we may be authorised to conclude that there exists
a cause for its being so rare.    The chances which give       para          a
bola must be very few in comparison with the others.         M. La
place, in fact, has ascertained that we may safely predicate that
a  nebulosity which penetrates within the sphere of the sun's ac
tivity, so us to lie capable      being seen, will describe
                                       of                       very             a
elongated ellipse or a hyperbola, which, from the magnitude of
its axis, will sensibly coincide with parabola in the part ob
                                                  a
served.     Itfollows, from the analysis of M. Laplace, that in the
case most favourable to hyperbolas           56 to
                                               it   that the hyper
                                                    is            1

                          FOSSIL HUMAN SKELETON.
This     singular fossil   now placed among the minerals
                            is                                  the Bri     in

                                                                       is
erect in one of the glass compartments               little more than
                                                         ;   it   is
four feet long, about two broad, and from four to nine inches
thick.    Although the head, neck, and feet are wanting,             evi     it   is
dent that the being to whom these bones belonged must have
been of a    stature rather less than men     general.in   The finger-
bones of the left hand are situated so closely between those of
the pelvis and thigh, being almost touching, that all the integu
ments must have been destroyed before these bones were en
veloped with the calcareous matter.       The block itself         a fine    is
granular limestone,      neither so  compact  as to appear uniformly
crystallized, nor so porous as our common calcareous sandstones.
There  is   some very similar limestone in the neighbourhood of
Maidstone and West Mailing, in Kent the chief difference being
                                                  j
that parts of the fragments of shells in this Guadaloupe stone are
a bright red, while those in the Kentish stone are gray or yelr
lovvish.    Its fracture presents an appearance between that of a

  »              Soundness      of Precious   Stones. — Patents.           23S
calcareous stone         formed by simple deposition, and by imperfect
crystallization ;     it   is just such as might reasonably be expected
to be formed in the vicinity of a volcano, where the solvent was
considerably above the natural temperature of water, and much
below that of metallic fusion.
                     SOUNDNESS OF PRECIOUS STONES.
     It is of great importance to lapidaries, and purchasers of pre
cious stones, to possess some means of ascertaining their sound
ness or freedom from flaws when in the rough state.                    Hitherto
artists had no rule to direct their judgement in this respect, and
have in consequence often sustained much loss.                To remedy this
defect, Dr. Brewster proposes the following method : Immerse
the rough unwrought stone in Canada balsam, oil of sassafras,
 or any other fluid of nearly the same refractive density (as oil of
 anise seeds) and turn it round with the hand so that the rays of
 light may pass through it in every direction.             By this means the
 slightest    flaws   or    cracks   may  be  instantly  perceived   in conse
 quence    of   the  changes      which   they produce    on  the transmitted
 light. If the stone be examined in water the flaws become more
 perceptible than when viewed in the air ; and the distinctness
 with which they are seen increases as the refractive powers of
 the fluid approach that of the solid.                 Thus diamond jargon,
 spinelle ruby,     &c.     which    exceed  any   fluid in refractive power,
 have their imperfections detected when immersed in oil of cassia
 or muriate of ammonia.               Natural and artificial stones may be
 likewise discriminated by oil of cassia, as the refractive powers of
 diamond, jargon, ruby, garnet, pyrope, sapphire, tourmaline,
 rubellite, pistazite, axinite,          cinnamon stone, chrysoberyl, and
  chrysolite, exceed it.          If  an object be viewed through two po
  lished and inclined surfaces, of any substance supposed to be
  one of these minerals, when plunged in oil of cassia, the sub
  stance is a paste or artificial stone if the refraction is from the
  point to which the surfaces are inclined, and a real mineral when
  the refraction is made towards that point.              The soundness and
  purity of glass for lenses may be ascertained in a similar man-
  per.

     The present period      has exhibited an example of long con
 tinued  frost and snow, which has rarely happened this time of
 year, in the memory of persons now living. Abundance of sea
 fowl have been shot^in the marshes.            A few days ago a man at
 Wisbeach, near Ely, shot four swans out of a large flight passing
 over that place on the wing.           They appeared to be the wild
  Swans, (Anqtes Cyaii feri) for, in one which I dissected, I found
 the trachea entering the hollow of the sternum, and reflected
  again over it into the chest.

 at intervals, to the 13th; when there was a slight fall of snow, for the first

 were now thc leading occurrences to the end: — the minimum temperature
 of 22° was on the night of the 25th.
     February — Was decidedly a warm month, as it was attended for the
 most part with a south and south-west wind, but which blew very strong;
 on five days hurricanes occurred, they blew chiefly from the south-west
 quarter, and were attended with frequent showers of rain. — On the 13th,
 there was a faint lunar halo ; and on the 23d, hoar frost.
    March. —The first ten days were mild and warm, with a few showers of
 rain; but the tempereture experienced a sudden depression on the 12th;
 this arose from a change of wind from west to north, but its continuance
 in that quarter was of short duration; for the monthly maximum was on
 the 18th, being an augmentation of31°. — Rain, with slight showers of snow,
 closed the month. — Wind south, and west, on nineteen days; its strength
never reached a hurricane. — Upon the whole, the weather was favourable
to vegetation.
    April — Was ushered in with a low pressure, and temperature ; the latter
 showed its monthly minimum on the fourth; previous to which, there were
several showers of snow, and hail, and peals of thunder; which were suc
 ceeded by a quick augmentation of temperature, as well as a gradual one
of pressure. — On the 10th, the weather became so serene, warm, and biil-
liant, that the thermometer indicated a summer's heat, being as high as 66s,
which was an increase since the fourth, of 37": — vegetation, of course,
made a rapid progress, but being too early, a check might be expected;
accordingly the last ten days were marked with frequent showers of snow
and hail, and boisterous north and north.east winds, which did great damage
to vegetation, particularly to tender buds, and foliage in exposed situa
tions. — Blossoms of fruit trees, &c. were never known to be more pro
mising, but the severity of temperature, and hail-storiris, particularly of the
strong east winds, almost stripped them of their beauty.
    May. — .Although there was a gradual increase of heat, from the com
mencement of this period, yet the prevailing easterly winds had not ceased
to be destructive till about the seventh, when the weather became more
mild, and nature seemed once more eager to repair the injury done to trees
and vegetation. — Rain about this time was much wanted, as the fall in the
two preceding months had scarcely exceeded two inches in depth. — From
the seventh to the twenty-sixth, rain fell daily, with the exception of the
twelf th, sometimes in very heavy and long continued showers, and iu four
instances with thunder and lightning.     On the 24th, a hail-shower: — this
period was generally favourable to the productions of the earth.
    Juke. — In two instances the diurnal temperature was lowered to 50p, the
first was on the sixth, and was in consequence of an easterly wind; the latter
was on the 19th, and which was immediately preceded by six days of al
most incessant but gentle showers of rain. On the 13th, a shower of hail.
This month was frequently marked with brilliant days, which, with the
rain, were very seasonable.
    July — Was remarkable for much thunder and lightning, interspersed
with showers of rain, and in two instances hail.— On the 30th, after a high
but desultory state of temperature, there was a sudden augmentation of
S3", being as high as 83° : — the monthly minimum of 44°, occurred on the
third, being a difference of 39°.
    August. — The first twelve days of August were cloudy and rainy, which
had the effect of lowering the temperature, for on the 24th the minimum
was as low as 42°. — The force of evaporation obeys the vicissitudes of tem
perature ; in the present instance, the monthly quantity is four-tenths of
an inch less than the evaporation for July. — Neither thunder, lightning, or
hail, occurred ; and there were few changes of atmospherical pressure, but
the two principal ones commanded great ranges.
                                                                   September

      SEPTEMBER. — The weather for the first fifteen days, was very gloomy,
  cloudy, and wet, with an unsettled state of temperature. — In about sixty
  hours, viz. from the 7th to the 10th, there was a loss of 27° of temperature,
  when it became more settled ; with a brilliant serene atmosphere, and a
  high barometrical pressure, which continued to the end.
      OcTOBER.— On the fourth, the temperature was at the monthly maximum,
  when rain fell very copiously ; the temperature, now continued to descend
  to the 18th, when freezing was observed the first time this season. — The
  heat soon after rose, and the weather to the end was fme and dry, with the
  exception of the two last days. — Prevailing winds, south.west.
      November. — The most prominent variation in this month was, the vi
  bratory impulse given to the atmospherical pressure during the first half of
  the month, indeed a similar occurrence took place at the same time with
  the temperature.      The weather upon the whole was mild for the season, as
  the temperature was very seldom under freezing. — Rain fell copiously from
  the 8th to the 18th. — No hail was noticed, and there was only one appear
  ance of snow.
      December, — Was decidedly gloomy, cloudy, and rainy ; but not so cold
  as is usually the case at this time of the year; except the few last days,
  the nightly state of temperature, (in consequence of a continuance of a gen
  tle north wind) was lowered upon three instances, eight degrees under
  freezing.
      The annual barometrical pressure for the past year, is 29,900 inches. Th«
  maximum of 30,75 occurred twice, viz. on the22d of January, and the 26th
  of December; the minimum of 28,24 inches, was on the 17th of October;
  the range of the two extremes of course will be 2,51 inches. — The greatest
  variation in twenty-four hours for the whole year, was on the 14th of No
  vember, being 1,55 inches.
      The mean annual temperature is 48°,66, being half a degree more than
  the animal temperature of 1812; the maximum was on the 30th of July,
  and the minimum on the 26th of January; the difference of the two ex
  tremes, will m%ke a range of 61".      Greatest variation in twenty-four hours
  was 28°, which occurred on the 14th of April. — The mean temperature of
  the six summer months is 56°,28, and for winter 41*,04.
      The annual fall of rain, snow, hail, &c. is near 35 inches in depth ; Mr.
  George Walker's account of rain, is two inches more, but the low situation
  of his gnnje, compared with nunc, will partly account for the difference.
  I   am enabled to state, that May, October, and November, were the wettest
  months of the year, and April the drye^t.       I have been favoured with an
  account of rain, taken at White Holme Reservoir, upon Blackstone.edge, by
  my friend Mr. Matthew Leadbetter, of Lane-Side, near Middleton.agentle-
  man whose accuracy of observation I can place implioit confidence in ;
   his account commences on the first of April, as will be seen in the above
  table ; the very |rreat fall of rain upon Blackstone.edge is most astonishing,
  being 86 inches m depth, in nine months. — At a future opportunity,          I in
  tend to give adescription of the.place where the gauge is fixed, at present
  it may be proper to observe, that the funnel is exactly the same diameter
  us mine, and the same means are used in measuring the quantity collected*
  From so remote and elevated a place, situated as it is upon the borders of
  the two counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire, perhaps where no observa
  tions of the kind were ever before made, it cannot fail of being particularly
  interesting, but in an especial manner to the Proprietors of the Rochdale
   Canal, as their hopes of supply are principally drawn from that source.

L.           of atmospJieric Moisture on an Electric Column
      Influence
            of Discs of Zinc and Siluer. Jiy Mr. Thomas.
     composed
  Howldy, of Hereford.
                                      Hereford, March 34, 1814.
Sirs, — Hiably in the spring of last year, J discovered that the
regularity of the action of Mr. De Luc's Electric Column was
much affected            by'
                    the varying state of moisture in the atmqsphere                     ;
and in consequence of this discover previous to the                 9th             1   of
April) J  had repeatedly exposed an instrument of the kind tp the
rays of the sun, as well as fq the warmth                 fire, qf qrder tq
                                                                     a         jn
dissipate from the surface of the glass tube the film of moisture
.which that substance when unyarnished invariably acqujreg from
the air, except when the latter          in a very dry state, puring
                                              is
the succeeding summer and       autumn,     as well as the present win
 ter,I  have often observed the alternate effects produced on the
 column      by
             a moist atmosphere and          dry one. a    As the quantity
of moisture        in
                 the ambient    air  increases,     greater deposition
                                                            a                           of
it  takes place on the surface of the glass tube and in propor^iorr
                                                                 ;
as this effect     produced, the insulating faculty of the glass is
                    is
impaired, and the electrical phaenomena of the cojumn are di
minished in intensity; because the electric fluid, which would
otherwise accumulate at the zjnc end of the column, seizing on
 the moisture, and       its means traversing the exterior surface
                               by                                                       of;
the tube, restores, either partially or entirely, between the ex
tremities of the column, the equilibrium which its electromotive
 power has    atendency to destroy.       But in proportion as the am
 bient air grows drier, the film of moisture which had been de
 posited en the surface of the glass tube          lessenedis   and conse ;
 quently jts resistance    to the   passage   of the   fluid'   increased is            ;
 an accumulation of electric fluid proportioned to that increased
 resistance, therefore, takes place at the zinc extremity of the
 column  ;  and consequently the intensity of its electrical phae
 nomena becomes augmented.

 their former extent, the middle of the glass tube was touched,
 and the leaves again closed.       The leaves having regained their
 original divergence, the waxed extremities of the tube were
 touched in succession, the leaves experienced a diminution of
 their divergence each time, but did not quite close.
     Series 2.    The wire of communication was removed from the
 negative end, by which the column became insulated : after
 waiting some time, the utmost divergence that the leaves attained
 was scarcely one-eighth of an inch ; the tube was then touched
 as before, and the leaves instantly closed ; this was repeated se
 veral times with the same effect.
     Series 3.    The column was now taken and held to the fire for
 about four or five seconds only, every part of it being exposed to
 its heat.     It was then placed as described in Series 1, and the
 gold-leaves opened to the extent of three-fourths of an inch. The
 glass tube was then touched in various places, as well as its waxed
 extremities ; but no decrease in the divergence of the leaves en->
 sued ; nor did any ensue when the contact was continued for se
veral seconds.        The communication with the ground was re
moved as in Series 2, and the touching repeated ; but the leaves
remained unaffected.
    The column was left thus insulated for about six minutes ; on
 returning to it at the end of that time, the leaves of the electro
 meter were seen diverging as in Series 2, about one-eighth of an
 inch ; and on touching the glass tube they immediately closed,
so quick had been the deposition of moisture on the glass.
    At the time the foregoing experiments were made, there ap
 peared to be abundance of moisture in the air; the sky was
covered with a continuous sheet of cloud, which was depositing
moisture in drops so small as to be invisible ; and the streets and
 all objects out of doors were very wet.
     Series 4.    Made on the 14th instant, when the atmosphere
was in a    drier  state than in the former instance.    The column
was in the position described in Series 2, and the gold-leaves di
verged three-eighths of an inch.       The glass tube was touched,
 and the contact continued for a second or two, but the leaves
experienced only a very slight diminution of their divergence.
The negative end of the column was now made to communicate
with the ground by putting a fmger upon it ; the gold-leaves
doubled their divergence almost directly : the finger being re
moved, the glass tube was touched, and the leaves were imme
diately reduced to their original divergence of three-eighths of an
inch. The same effect followed when the negative extremity of
the column was kept in the hand while the tube was touched.
    The column was next presented to the fire for two or three
seconds j and when its extremity was replaced upon the cap of
                                                                ther ,

   an Electric Column composed      of Discs of Zinc  and Silver. 243
the electrometer, the leaves opened instantly nearly to their full
extent ; and though the finger was put upon the tube in various
places, the leaves struck, and continued to strike, the sides of the,
electrometer.
    For a considerable time, during which a great number of ex
periments similar to the above were made, the results obtained
were uniformly the same as the preceding, except in two or three
instances which occurred when the column was insulated, and
the leaves of the electrometer had only a small divergence : in
those instances the leaves seemed to increase rather than diminish
their divergence when the glass tube was touched ; especially
when the finger was laid upon it near its negative extremity : but
the difference of divergence being exceedingly small, I was at
first inclined to think that my sight had deceived me. I deter
mined, however, should the apparent anomaly recur in any future
experiment, to ascertain whether it were real or fantastical ; but
some weeks elapsed before I had the opportunity of ,de^isively
establishing its reality.      The subsequent experiments made on'
the 18th of the present month exhibit this remarkable fact di
stinctly, and show that opposite effects may sometimes be pro
duced by the same cause.
    The column had been in the position as in Series 2, for several
 hours ; the leaves of the electrometer diverged about j'^th of an
 inch. The glass tube was touched near its middle with the
 finger ; the divergence of the leaves was not lessened as is ge
nerally the case, but, on the contrary, seemed to be increased by
it ; the finger was therefore again placed upon the tube, and the
 contact continued ; it then became evident that the leaves were
 opening wider, and in about two seconds their original divergence
 was fully doubled ; the finger was, removed from the tube, but
 the leaves still retained their divergence.     As no alteration took
 place  in the leaves,  the finger was next  laid upon the waxed ex
 tremity of the tube next to the electrometer; the .leaves then
 very slowly lest their divergence, and finally closed.     As soon as
 their separation was again perceptible, a finger was laid upon the
 glass tube near to its negative extremity; the leaves now opened
 more quickly than before, and presently attained a divergence of
 one-fourth of an inch. The finger was withdrawn from the
 tube, and after a few seconds was again laid upon the waxed ex
 tremity next the electrometer; the leaves gradually diminished
 their divergence ; but before they quite closed, the finger was
laid upon the opposite (negative) waxed extremity; the leaves
 began to open wider, and as the contact was continued, they
 soon regained their foimer divergence of one-fourth of an inch.
    When the negative end of the column was made to communi
 cate with the ground, the leaves attained a divergence of only

 five-eighths of an inch in three minutes, and when the tube was
 simply touched that divergence was reduced to three-eighths of
 an inch.      The column was then held to the fire for a few se
 conds ; and on replacing                 it,
                                           and laying the fmger on its negative
 extremity,     the    leaves   struck     the sides of the electrometer in less
 than half      a  minute.        The   finger being withdrawn, the column
became insulated, and the strikings were prevented                        the glass
                                                                            :
tube was then touched in various places, as well as its waxed ex
 tremities  ;    but the divergence of the leaves remained unaffected
 by   it,
        as they also did             by
                                      a continuance of the contact.
    To the above, the following observations and conclusions may
not improperly be subjoined.
      1.That when the air                  tolerably dry, simply touching the
                                          is
glass tube      is  not sufficient to produce the greatest diminution
of divergence in the leaves of the electrometer, but the contact
must be continued for two or three seconds                      and still longer
                                                                ;                         if
the waxed extremities            be  touched        and
                                                     ;   when  the  air   very dry,
                                                                            is
the diminution.            scarcely perceptible
                          is                              by
                                                          any continuance of the
contact.

former extent, have ceased to diminish their divergence when
the tube was touched            ;  the fmger having partially removed from
its surface the film of moisture, as well as the electric fluid
which was creeping along                  it but after waiting a few seconds,
                                              ;
on renewing          the    touching,     the    same effect has followed as at
first.
    4. When the column has been exposed to the ravs of the sun,
or to the heat of a fire             ;  the moisture has been completely di

spersed     from    its   surface,    no  decrease nor increase in the diver
gence    of  the   leaves    will  ensue    when the finger        kept in contact
                                                                      is

power of the column             is always found to be augmented.
    6.  On the whole            may be fairly concluded, that the variation

       The foregoing experiments and observations will, if I mistake
   not, place the electric column in a new point of view ; for to its
   other singular properties may be added that of an hygrometer :
   they will likewise account in an easy, natural, and satisfactory
   manner for the phaenomenon observed by Mr. De Luc, and de
   scribed by him in Nicholson's Journal ; without compelling us
   to have recourse to the hypothesis of " the production of a new
   quantity of electric fluid in the column by the sunbeams*."
       The same may be said concerning the phaenomena noticed by
   Mr. Singer when he placed an electric column, and a bell-ringing
   apparatus, before a firef.
       In the experiments alluded to, the Ileal dispersed from between
   the extremities of the columns the moisture which impaired the
   insulation ; and thus enabled the electromotive power of the in
   struments to produce a greater accumulation and deficiency of
   electric fluid at their opposite extremities than could possibly exist
   while that moisture was interposed between them.

   LI. An     Attempt to determme the definite and simple Propor
       tions, in which the constituent Parts of unorganic Substances
       are united with each other.           By Jacob Berzelius, Pro
      fessor of  Medicine    and   Pharmacy,     and M. R.A. Stockholm.
                            [Concluded   from p. 175. J
     IV. General View of the Results of the Experiments
                  RELATED IN THESE DIFFERENT ESSAYS.
    When       two substances, which we consider as simple, are ca
  pable    of being united in more than one proportion, these pro
  portions, for a given quantity        of the [positively] electrical body,
  are multiples by ly, 2, 4 . . .       of the least proportion in which
   the [negatively] electrical     body is capable of combining with it.
       [We must not, however, understand this multiplication of pro
  portions in the strict mathematical sense of the terms, which is
  equivalent to the involution of powers, but simply as relating to
  the multiplication of the quantities by the numbers in question.
   Gilbert.]
,      There are however many phcenomena which make it probable,
  that the multiple \ \is only apparent; and hence it follows, that
  the combination, from which it is deduced, does not exhibit the

true minimum, but that there are other lower propnriions, ac
cording to which it may be a multiple by 6, 12, or 18.     Thus,
for example, the arsenic acid contains once and half as much
oxygen as the arsenious ; but the black oxide of arsenic, which
is formed by the oxidation of the metal in the open air, contains
only one-fourth as much oxygen as the arsenious acid ; and hence
the oxygen of this acid is truly a multiple by 4, and that of the
arsenic acid by 6, of the oxygen in the black oxide.       I have
shown how a similar remark is applicable to the acids afforded
by sulphur.
    The progressions hitherto discovered are expressed in even
rmmbers.     The only exception is the progression for the com
binations of oxygen with ammonium, which, if we set aside the
possibility that hydrogen may be an oxide, will advance, in the
following irregular manner: I, 1{, 3, 4}, 6, 1\; that is, sup
posing the oxygen ef ammonia to be unity.        Hence we may in
fer that this series cannot begin from the true minimum, and that
there must be lower stages of oxidation of ammoniuirt, than ni
trogen, one of which must probably be identical with hydrogen.
If' then the oxygen of nitrogen is a multiple of the oxygen of hy
drogen by 6, 1 2, or 1 8, the series will becom.2 perfectly regular.
I must also remark, that from the point at which ammonium
changes its electro-chemical     modification in forming nitrogen^
the series proceeds with greater multipliers.
    The relations, which are found between the component parts
of more complicated substances, are all conformable to the'laws
which regulate the simpler combinations ; for instance, the pro
portions of sulphur to iron in the sulphates.
                                 2.
    When two oxygenized bodies are combined, their proportion
may be most readily determined from the quantities of oxygen
which 'they contain, the one being always either equal to the
other, or to an integral multiple of it.
    To these combinations belong :
    a. Salts.    In neutral sails the oxygen of the acid is a multi
ple by 2, 3 . .8 of that of the base,    la the super salts the num
ber may be still higher.     In the subsalts, the oxygen of the acid
is sometimes a multiple of that of the base, sometimes equal to
it,  and not uncommonly an integral submultiple.
      b.Hydrates, or combinations     of  water first, with acids.
                                               :
 In these the water takes completely the place of base the acid
                                                   a     ;
takes up a quantity of  it  which contains exactly as much oxygen
 as any other base with which   it   would be saturated and this

water     totally distinct from the water of crystallization
           is                                                    con
 tained     by
            some of the acids.

                      On definite Proportions;                 247
   Secondly : with bases.     Here the water takes the place of an
acid, but contains, only an equal quantity of oxygen with the base,
or sometimes even a submultiple only.      The water of crystalliza
tion is here again distinct from the water combined in the place
of an acid.
   c. Combinations of alkalis, earths, and oxides, with each other
in pairs.. Although my experiments exhibit no example of such
a combination, it is obvious that it must .be classed in this place.
For, whether we call the oxides of chromium, molybdaenum,
tungsten, tantalium, and tin, acids ,or oxides, the rule must be
equally applicable to them, and that which is a law for one oxide
must also hold good with respect to others.      Besides, since such
combinations of two bases are the foundations of double salts
with double bases, and since the law prevails with respect to
these salts, we may consider this as a sufficient proof of the ge
neral law.
   Combinations of two acids belong also here, for example, the
fluoboric acid, in which the weaker acid probably occupies the
place of a base.
                                  3.
    When three or more oxygenized bodies unite with each other,
the oxygen of the body which contains the smallest quantity
is a common divisor, or rather an aliquot part of the oxygen of
the others, each of which must therefore be an integral multiple
of this smallest quantity .
    To this law belong :
    a. Salts containing water of crystallization.     In the neutral
sa Its the water of crystallization   contains 1,2,3,4,5.. times
as much oxygen as the base, or more rarely \,            % as much.
 In stibsalts in which the oxygen of the acid is a submultiple of
that of the base, the water of crystallization contains a quantity
of oxygen which is a multiple of both the quantities, in the acid
and in the base.
    b. . Double salts.   Examples of salts in which the oxygen of
the one base is either equal to that; of the other, or an integral
multiple of     it,are afforded respectively by  the double salts of
ammonia and magnesia, and       by  alum.    When water of crystal
lization   is present, the substance   isa quadruple compound, and
the oxygen of the component part, which contains the least        of
it,   is
      a   common divisor, or an aliquot part, of the oxygen of the
 others, as we have seen in alum, in which the oxygen of the po
 tass is  contained three times in the alumina, 12 times in the sul
 phuric acid, and 24 times in the water.
    c. Combinations   of   several alkalis, earths, and oxides, in
 cluding crystallized minerals.     Although we are not authorized

  By any direct experiment related in these Essays to form a con
   clusion respecting crystallized minerals, there is however nd
   doubt of its validity ; for why should marble, fludr spar, and pon
   derous spat-, be formed according to a law which is not ap
   plicable to other minerals ?      Such a diversity is scarcely con
   ceivable.
       On the other hand; the application of the rule will obtain for
   mineralogy a degree of mathematical certainty, and afford td
   chemists; who are engaged in the analysis of minerals, A ready
   mode of satisfying themselves, how far their operations are cor
   rect ; while, without some such means, these analyses can nevef
   be brought to a sufficient degree of accuracy.       It is true that;
   according to this view of the subject, the greater number of such
   analyses, everi wheri performed by the greatest masters, dan Only
   be considered as approximations,       which in many tfases scarcely
   come at all near to the truth ; but such is the ordinary cdhrse of
   human labdurs:      Slrice Bergrtiahn's analyses of salts, which were
   So masterly fdr his time, 30 years are scarcely elapsed, and yet
   many of them can at present hardly even be called approxirnas.
   tions.    And the numerical determinations of the proportions of
   mixture of various substances, which I have attempted to obtain
   with the greatest fcarS, arid with thev utmost possible- accuracy,
   and which I have inserted in this Essay, will certainly not be
   sufficient for the future ; and it will be possible, with the assist
   ance bf the laws here developed, to correct them, and to bring
   them nearer to the truth.       But I am confident that our succes
   sors will pardon   the  imperfections of my experiments ; as it must
   be allowed that chemistry, in its present state of advancement,
   must still be grateful for the Valuable labours of Klaproth, Vau-
   quelin, and dthers, although mbst of their analyses are become
   insufficient for its purposes of progressive investigation;
      Lastly, when several combustible substances, wh7ch we con
   sider as simple; unite with each other, the proportions, in which
   these combinations are possible, are determined by their capacity
  for oxygen, the combinations taking place in stich a manlier, that;
   if they were oxidated in a certain degree, the oxygen taken up by
  one of the substances, would be a multiple by 1, Sj 3 . . i of the
   quantity taken zip by the other.      Thus sulphur, phosfihbrusj and
   arsenic; unite with metals in such proportions, that a salt may
   be produced by the bxygenization of the compound, or at least
   would be produced according to the general rule.
       The same is also true of other metallic compounds, which are
  separated from mixtures in.a state of fusion, by chemical cau*es,
  such as crystallization or heat: for instance, of crystallized amaH
                                                                  gamsj

                           On definite Proportions*
gams, or Crystallized alloys, which are sometimes Obtained in p\i*
rifying metals by assaying them.          The union by fusion is analo
gous   to  the  solution  of   a salt in water;  and may be effected in
almost all proportions : but when a salt Crystallizes, a defmite
combination with water takes ^place; and when crystalline alloys
are formed in the gradual coolmg of mixtures, the part, still fluid
bemg poured off, the crystallized part exhibits a fixed and defi
nite combination.         When a combination of two metals is capa
ble  of  affording  saline   bases by oxidation, each part, in its con
version into a protoxide, commonly takes up the same quantity
of oxygen.       The arbor Diance affords an example of such a com
bination which is easily examined.          When a compound contains
several metals; it may happen that some of the multipliers may
be very larg^e.      It is difficult to obtain sucli combinations in a
state of purity; and I must defer, for the present, the publication
of the few experiments which I have hitherto made oh them.
    The combinations of some combustible substances with oxides,
for instance those of sulphur, sulphuretted hydrogen, borac'ium,
and telluretted hydrogen, with alkalis and alkaline earths, follow
the same laws, as if they were combined With the metallic ra
dicals of the alkalis or earths without oxygen ; or as if they weie
united with oxygen, and entered into combination, as acids and
Oxides, with the alkalis or earths.
    In these few lines, we have gone through the whble structure
of inorganic nature, arid have seen, how it may be reduced to a
few very simple principles.          Oxygen, the only absolutely [nega
tive]   substance    in  all  nature, is every where the standard, by
which the proportions between the component parts of all com
binations may be measured.            From the existence of such a com
mon measure, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that com
pound bodies, when they mutually decompose each other, never,
or at least very seldom, set at liberty a single atom of their com
ponent r)arts ; that neutral salts, for example, decompose each
other without losing their neutral condition ; and that sulphurets
Seeompose water without disengaging hydrogen.
    It is unnecessary to expitiate here on the additional import
ance which chemistry gains, as a science, by such a reduction of
its results to mathematical principles.         This is however still but
an inconsiderable ,sifep towards the mathematical perfection . of
the science; and it requires the united and powerful exertions of
all chemical philosophers, to bring it nearer and nearer to the
lelevated rank, which it may be hoped that it will ultimately at
tam in the system of human knowledge.

                It                                   Lynn, March 38, 1814.
                   has been ascertained by philosophers who have writ
    ten on the respiration of animals, that no air passes through the
    membrane of the lungs into the blood, for the same quantity of
    air that enters the lungs is returned again into the atmosphere,
    but its properties are changed.         Messrs. Allen and Pepys have
    proved by    a  series of  experiments, that
                                                             "
                                                     when atmospheric air
    alone is respired, no other change takes place in          than the subit,
    stitution of a certain portion of carbonic acid gas for an equal
    volume of oxygen *."
        And Mr. Ellis observes, that            "
                                           in man, as well as in the lower
    animals, the conversion of oxygen gas into carbonic acid con
    stitutes the only essential change which the air of our atmo
    sphere experiences in the lungs during its respiration \."
        The modes in which the atmosphere            depravedis    the living    by
    functions of animals,          chemical process which has never been

                               a
    clearly explained.        But from the preceding theory of combus
    tion   X, the changes induced on the air, and on the temperature
    of the blood, in respiration, will admit of an explanation which
    may not be deemed unsatisfactory.
        Part of the thermogen which            contained in the air, taken
                                                    is
    into the lungs, passes through their thin membrane into the
    blood, in the same manner as the electric fluid passes through
    this or any other animal matter, and, meeting with photogen,
    generates animal heat, in        amanner which will be more fully ex

  According to M. Lavoisier, carbonic acid gas consists of 28
parts of charcoal united with 72 parts of oxygen, and that car
bonic acid gas is composed of these two bodies combined in that
proportion.                                                ,
   Example.    Suppose Q  = 100.
  Then a + h = 100 = the given quantity of oxygen gas ; conse
quently a + c = 100 = the quantity of carbonic acid gas expelled
from the lungs in respiration.
          a = 72 oxygen.
          c =* 28 charcoal.

    I believe that it has never been explained, in a satisfactory
manner, how animal heat is generated, although different hypo
theses have been invented to account for this wonderful effect.
It  is, however, generally supposed that heat      generated in the            is
lungs.     Indeed, from the construction of the lungs, and the*
change which takes place in the air in respiration, there remains
little reason to doubt of the truth of this supposition.
    The internal surface of the lungs in man      estimated     Dr.        is                   by
 Keil to be about ten times the external surface of the whole
body, or about 150 square feet*.        On this surface the blood                                      is
exposed in respiration       and part of the thermogen contained in

   combinations, were not restored to it again, the air would soon
   become unfit for the supporting of animal and vegetable life.
   And if the thermogen which enters the animal system, by means
   of the lungs, were not conveyed out of the body as fast as it is
   received, this invisible element Would be constantly accumulating
   till it put a total stop to all the animal functions.
       As neither thermogen nor photogen can be annihilated, We
   may infer, that the thermogen which is taken into the blood,,
   after having entered into new combinations and passed through
   the animal system, flies off from the surface of the skin in com
  bination with photogen.            When this compound comes into the
   atmosphere,       the  thermogen is converted into oxygen gas by
   uniting   with   the moisture contained in the air ; and the photo-
-
  geh, by the sarne means, becomes hydrogen gas, and ascehds to
  the upper regions of the atmosphere, from Whence it descends to
  the earth in a manner which will be described in some future
  communication.
       The following facts are sufficient to show in the most satis
  factory manner, that a strong attraction obtains between ther
  mogen and moisture.
       The electric machine never acts so well in a moist atmosphere
  as in a dry One, because the moisture attracts the thermogen
   (positive electricity) from the apparatus, and prevents its accu
  mulation.       And we experience more cold in a damp atmosphere,
  the thermometer being at 40°$ than when the air is dry, though
  the thermometer may be as low as 25°.               The reason is evident :
  the moisture in the air attracts the thermogen from the animal
  system faster than it is supplied by the lungs.

     mentions chalk at Ridlington, in Rutland, and Stukeley, in
     Hunts. : I have been through both the Stukeleys in Hunts.
     which are on the great Clunch-clay, (Rep. i. 1 13) covered
     locally with alluvial clay, flints, small chalk holders, &c. :
     and I have passed very near to Ridlington, in Rutland, on
     its S and on its E sides, and the same must be situated, on
     or near to the Northampton Sandstone, (Rep. i. 1 14) : and
     not unlikely, has alluvial chalky Clay patches, such as I
     have noticed in many places in and near Derbyshire, Fep.i,
     308, and of which I saw several instances between Leicester
     and Uppingham.       It is greatly to be lamented, that Mr. T's
     work abounds with errors, wherever he attempts to speak
     of the facts of the British strata, beyond his own personal
     observations, and neighbourhood, in the west of England.

     the   work  here  quoted,   Mr.  T. acknowledges, being unac

     until he learned the same from Mr. William Smith, in •
      1801, (they first became acquainted in June 1799, I have
     been told), who before then had completed his Map of
     this part of the country, and had very freely shown the
     same, and communicated his facts to great numbers of per

      me .of greater importance, since reading an account of the
      strata in Gothland, in Dr. Thomson's Travels in Sweden ;
       where, evidently, I think, the Danby-Dale Coal-field occurs,,
       (and not that of Newcastle, as is there said) N of Hessing-
      borg : the Coal-field near Boulogne, described in the 2d
       Edit. of Williams's Min. King. ii. p. 335, is with difficulty
      referred to the Danby-Dale, or to any other of our Coal
      fields, from the particulars there given; it seems however
       to occur in the eastern end of our great south-eastern de
      nudation, (PsM. xxxv. p. 130) below the chalk, but how
       far ? it is extremely interesting to know, more accurately :
      perhaps some of your Readers can supply more particulars
      pf this part of the F rench Coast, and of the southern part
      x>f Sweden, &c.      Do not these Coal-measures also appear
      across the northern extremity of Jutland, north of the Vi-
      borg district ? Do they not occur on the north-eastern side
      of Bornholm Island, in the Baltic ? Do not lifted and de-
      nudated parts of these Coal strata appear at RehbUrg on
      the NW, and Osterwald on the SE of Hanover ? and again
      near Aix-la-Chapelle and near Liege? see M. De Luc's Geo.
      Trav. in France, &c. vol. i. pp. 342, 345, 365, 366, and
      260 ; Kirwan's Geo. Ess. p. 305, and Parkinson's Organic
      Rem. i. 181. I have mentioned, P. M. xxxix. p. 100 N.
      the probability, that very thin seams of Coal, belonging to
  1
      this field, have been noticed in the wells on the north side
      of Battel, in Sussex. . Mr. Charles Smith, a Coal-master
      in Yorkshire, lately informed me, that about the year 1800,
      he sent some of his Colliers to Ashdown Park, in Sussex, to
      bore there for Coals, for his friend Thomas Bradford, Esq.
      and that in boreing 150 yards, they passed through nine
      thin seams of Coal ! which probably therefore helong to this
      Danby-Dale Coal-field ? So may the Coal .in Portland
      Island, and at Kimmeridge, which       J have not seen.

     employed on this boreing, knew better ; they had invariably
     seen, as they ascended the valleys, higher aud higher beds
     of their Alum Shale, then the Doggers, then Gritstone and
      Shale strata, &c. belonging to the Coal-measures,        each
      crossing in succession and being lost in the beds of the
      Brooks, instead of the stone there, rising "from under the
      alummous schist," which Mr. B. here tells them of !
         Since Mr. B's work was published, and the above was
     written, it appears that he has again travelled across this
     district, and made some stay at Whitby, and I cannot avoid
     remarking here, that a part of Mr. B's time on this occa
     sion, might have been more profitably spent, whether we
     regard his own reputation as an observer and writer, or the
  ' interests of science, in revising, " by a calm investigation of
     facts," and correcting, the completely erroneous description
      (as I know from an actual Survey of part of them) , that he
     has here published, of the structure of these eastern Moorland
     Hills, (see P. M. xxxix. p. 97), than it was in addressing to
     you, his very ill-timed Letter, (P. M. xlii. p. 121), dated
      " Whitby, July 15, 1813," replying rather vauntingly, to a
     Letter of mine, that was not written until the day after this
     date, or published until the 31st of July !.

                               I

LIV.   Facts and Observations towards a History of the Coot.
   binations of the yellow Oxide of Lead with the Nitric and
  Nitrous Acids.      By M. Chevretjl *.
   i.   M.   Proust    having observed that the octahedral nitrate
of lead, when boiled with lamine of this metal,         was converted
into a yellow leafy salt, concluded that the lead was oxidated at
the expense of the litharge, the base of the octahedral nitrate,
and that consequently there was one oxide more at the minimum
than the latter.    Mr. Thomson, in a work upon Lead, resumed
the examination of the yellow salt described by M, Proust: hei
was led by his experiments to regard it as a salt which differed
from the octahedral nitrate only by an excess of base.           In his
System of Chemistry, Mr, Thomson renounced this opinion for
that of M. Proust ; but at the same time he observed that the
quantity of oxygen in the oxide at the minimum differed very
little from that of the litharge.       He has not besides added any
new fact, in order to prove the existence of a new oxide of lead.
       At a time when the imagination and experience of che
mists carefully examined the laws which preside over the com
bination of bodies, I have been surprised at the very little atten
tion paid to a salt which might contain a new oxide, and raise to
four the number of the oxides of a single metal.       This considera
tion  induced  me  to resolve  the following questions :'
    Is there an oxide of lead less oxidated than litharge ?     If this
oxide exists, what is the quantity of oxygen which it contains ?'
and in what ratio is this quantity with that which constitutes the
yellow, the red, and the puce-coloured oxides of lead?
    3. The first inquiry which occupied my attention, was the
analysis of the octahedral nitrate of lead ; for I could not deter
mine the proportion of oxygen which the lead absorbs in order
for its solution iu the nitrate, except by being perfectly ac
quainted with the proportions of the elements of this salt, since
they furnished to the metal the oxygen which it required.              I
took octahedral nitrate, which had been crystallized, twice washed
it with water, and reduced it to powder. 1 dried it by exposing
it for several days to the sun, and afterwards heated it on paper.
This nitrate was divided into several quantities scrupulously
weighed, in order to be used in the various experiments about
to be detailed.
    4. I put five grammes of nitrate into a platina crucible
weighing one ounce four drachms and 43 grains.               I exposed
jt to a graduated heat, in order to reduce the salt to its base, and
withdrew the crucible from the fire when no more nitrous va
pours were extricated.      I weighed  it,and heated it  once more red

    On the Combinations             of the yellow Oxide of Lead, &c.           263
hot in order to discover if all the acid had been volatilized. When
I perceived that there was no more diminution of weight, I found
it necessary to put into the basin of the balance, in which the
crucible was, 1.65 gr. in order to restore the equilibrium.     This
weight representing that of the acid contained in five grammes
of nitrate, it follows that this salt is formed of
                  Acid                     33    100
                  Oxide                    67    203
A result which differs very little from that of M. Berzelius. This
excellent chemist found

    5. Before commencing the examination of the yellow salt, I
wished to know the action of the oxide of lead on the nitrate..
I heated in boiling water equal weights of these two substances,
and filtered the liquor in a flask while still warm. When the latter
was full I closed it up, in order that the liquor might not come
in contact with the carbonic acid of the atmosphere.                Upon
cooling, crystals of nitrate of lead were deposited in scales *.
This salt has a slight saccharine and astringent taste : it crystal
lizes in scales or small needles.     It is not acid. When we pass
a stream of carbonic acid into its solution, we reduce it to octahe
dral nitrate, and to carbonate.      Two hundred parts of nitrate
heated in a platina crucible lost 39.72.      Previous to decomposing
this salt, I  ascertained that  no  more    water  was extricated when
heated in a close and very long glass tube.        The nitrate is there
fore formed of Acid                   19.86        100
                 Oxide                80.14        403
    This analysis confirms the law laid down by Dr. Wollaston for
the combination of the elements of salts, for in the nitrate of
lead we find that the quantity of the basejs double that which
 is contained in the acid nitrate.
    6. The nitrate of lead differs so much from, the yellow salt in
 respect of its physical properties, that it was impossible to regard
 them as identical, and to adopt the same opinion with Mr.
 Thomson ; and what confirms the difference which existed be
 tween these two salts,       is,
                             that having prepared      little yellow salt,
                                                             a
I   found that     itsent forth nitrous acid gas with nitric acid;
 whereas the nitrate did not emit any.        From this moment was          I
 of opinion with M. Proust that there was an oxide still more at
  the minimum than litharge.
    7.  In order to determine the quantity of oxygen in this oxide,
I   put into  a matrass 350 grammes of water, four grammes of
  acid nitrate, and six grammes of lead cut in small pieces.                      I
  boiled the whole, and took care to pour boiling water into the
fI  shall call this salt nitrate    oflead, and the octahedral nitrate, acid nitrate.

 264     On the Combinations of     the   yellow Oxide   of Lead
  matrass as evaporation took place.     The Jiquor gradually became
  of a fine yellow, and after two hours boiling the colour was at its
  maximum of intensity : subsequently it gradually diminished,
  and ended by entirely disappeaiing.      There was deposited in the
  course of the operation a white substance which resembled hy
  drate or carbonate of lead.     After twelve hours boiling, the ni
  trate apparently having no more action on the metal, I decanted
  the liquor hastily into a vessel, which I shut carefully : the lead
  when dried weighed 0-6 gramme : there was therefore 5-4 gr.
  of lead dissolved by 4 gr. of nitrate.     This result is widely dif
  ferent from Mr. Thomson's, who says that 100 grains of nitrate
  can dissolve only 44 grains of lead.
     8. It was easy to determine the proportion of the elements of
  oxide of lead at the minimum, since we knew the quantity of metal
  which had been dissolved by the acid nitrate. But two considera
  tions prevented me from attempting it : in the first place, the
  yellow colour which the nitrate had assumed in dissolving the
  lead was certainly owing to the solution of this metal ; but this
  colour having disappeared, was it not probable that the oxygen
  of the atmosphere was the cause of this discoloration ? In the
 second place, the white matter which was deposited did it not
 proceed from the absorption of the oxygen or the carbonic acid
 from the air ?      In order to appreciate the influence of external
 agents,   I repeated the experiment in the apparatus about to be
 described.      In a matrass similar to that which had served for
 the experiment above mentioned, I put water boiled with four
  grammes of acid nitrate and six grammes of lead.        1 adapted to
 the matrass two glass tubes, one in the form of S, destined to
 replace the water which should be evaporated ; the other doubly
 bent, which fitted into the upper part of a bell-glass filled with
 air. I had put into this bell-glass, which rested in a lime-bath,
 a glass containing a mixture of iron and moistened sulphur.        In
 three days the oxygen of the air of the vessels having appeared
 to be absorbed as well as the carbonic acid, I lighted a fire un
 der the apparatus, and the ebullition of the liquid was kept up
 fourteen hours without interruption.       When the water began to
 boil it became yellow : the colour fell away in two Iwurs, and
finally disappeared. There was also, as in the foregoing experi
 ment, a precipitation of a white substance.      It was evident from
 this, that the oxygen and the carbonic acid of the atmosphere
 were not the cause of these phenomena.          When the operation
 was ended, I allowed the liquor to rest, and decanted it in a flask
 which was made quite close.        I passed water into the matrass,
in order to detach the white matter from      it, as well as the lead
 which had not been dissolved.
      The latter when washed and well dried weighed six deci
                                                            grammes.

                with  the Nitric and Nitrous Acids.               265
grammes.       The white powder was treated with weak nitric
acid,  it was dissolved without effervescence with the exception of
a black powder weighing two centigrammes, which was nothing
but sulphuret of lead.     As this sulphuret formed part of the lead
employed in the experiment, it is evident that it must be united
to that which had not been dissolved : consequently the four
grammes of nitrate had dissolved 5-38 gr. of metal.            As the
sides of the matrass were opaque, I washed them with weak
nitric acid, and added the washings to the solution of the
while matter : notwithstanding       this washing they were always
opaque. Finally, by inspecting them more closely, I ascertained
that the glass had been corroded ; and after evaporating the ni
tric solution to dryness, and taking up the residue by water, I
obtained five centigrammes of silex.        The part soluble in the
water of the residue was nitrate of lead, which contained 4/ cen
tigrammes of yellow oxide : the white matter was therefore
formed of silex and hydrate of lead, retaining perhaps a little
acid.
   9. The solution of acid nitrate of lead which was boiled over lead,
and which had been decanted in a flask, deposited, after eleven
hours, crystals in silky needles united into stars.     They weighed
5.95 gr. after being dried.       The liquor in which they were
formed, concentrated without the contact of the air, gave at se
veral times 2.7 1 gr. of crystals similar to the foregoing.     There
remained a mother water containing a little of this salt as well
as of nitrite of potash ; for the sulphuric acid made it emit a
nitrous vapour, and the muriate of platina made an abundant
precipitate in it of triple salt of potash.    I separated almost the
whole alkaline nitrite from the salt of lead by means of alcohol.
This result strongly confirms the decomposition of the glass ob
served above, and seems to demonstrate that the 47 centi
grammes of oxide contained in the white matter had been pre
cipitated from the solution of the nitrate by the alkali of the
glass which was dissolved.
    10. To resume the facts of this experiment, and draw the
consequence which must follow upon the hypothesis of an oxide
more at the minimum than litharge, 5-38 gr. of lead were dis
solved by 4 gr. of aeid nitrate of lead which contained 2*68 gr.
of litharge ; but as there was 0-47 gr. of the latter precipitated, it
is evident that the lead was not oxidated but at the expense of
2-21 gr. of litharge.       Hence it follows, that by adding this
quantity to the 5-38 gr. of lead dissolved, it is easy to ascertain
the composition of the oxide at the minimum, since we know             .
that 2.21 gr. of litharge contain 0-158 gr. of oxygen and 2*052
of lead. We find according to these data that 100 parts of lead
ought to absorb 2*125 gr. of oxygen.
                                                              11. The

     1 1.   The small quantity of oxygen which the lead     seemed to
absorb in order to be oxidated at the minimum, and the reflec
tion that this quantity did not follow any. relation with the
known oxidations of this metal, began to create doubts in my
mind as to the existence of an oxide more at the minimum than
litharge, and incline me to think that it was not improbable that
the lead was oxidated at the expense of the nitric acid of the
iiitrate ; that consequently the salt obtained from this operation
was only a nitrite with a base of litharge ; and that the nitrous
 acid extricated from this salt by the nitric acid (6) was merely
separated from       it,
                      as when we pour nitric acid over an alkaline
nitrite.    What   supported this opinion was      1st, the nitrite of
                                                           :

 the litharge and the nitrous acid which this salt constantly
yielded, whether       decomposed           it   by
                                         heat, treated     with acetic
                                                                    it it

                                                 It   is   may be ob
jected that in these decompositions the oxide at the minimum
is   re-oxygenated in the operation at the expense of the nitric acid
which       converted into nitrous acid
            it                              but what weakened this
                                                      ;
 objection was the observation       made of the non-action of the
                                           I
oxygen gas upon the solution of the salt.      At first   seemed proit
bable that, by, boiling the lead with the acid nitrate, this metal
 onlv took from the nitric acid the quantity of oxygen which forms
 the difference between this acid and the nitrous acid but the 5.38 :
 gr. of lead having to absorb 0.4 1426 of oxygen in order to be
 converted into litharge, whilst the nitric acid of the nitrate could
 only yield ()• 1557204 in order to be converted into nitrous acid,
I   concluded that there must have been      decomposition of water,
                                                      a
 or rather that    a portion of nitrous acid  was itself decomposed.
 This consideration induced me to make the following experi
ment, in order to collect the gas which might have been dis
charged.
    12.   put into
            I          matrass the same quantities of lead, acid
                           a
nitrate, and water, which had employed in the foregoing experi
ments.       Iadapted to           it I
                              a tube doubly curved, the vertical
branches   of  which  were  very much elongated.     One of these
branches, which entered the upper part of bell.glass 15 lines
                                                           a                             in
diameter, resembled       funnel.
                               a   When the apparatus was well
luted, the water of the bell-glass was three lines below the edge
of the funnel. According to this arrangement,       was easy to see
                                                               it
if there was any production of gas.    had given great length to

the vertical branches of the tube, in order that there should be
the least possible quantity of water to be volatilized   and   had       ;       I
widened the branch which communicated into the bell-glass, in
order that all the water which was evaporated might be collected
in the tube, and not mix with, that in the bell-glass.     made              I           a

    fire under the matrass, and. took care during the whole opera
    tion to keep up a boiling heat only.         By these means there was
    but very little water to be vaporized.            The experiment began
    at seven in the morning 5 at eight the          water   was boiling.      The
    air in the bell-glass was dilated.          At nine the liquor was of a
    fine yellow.      At half past ten red nitrous vapour was formed in
    the tube, and it augmented gradually.               \Vhen it reached the
    bell-glass   absorption   took   place, and   a   piece   of turnsole paper
    which I introduced into it was strongly reddened.                At eight in
    the evening the operation       was  stopped:    it  was   evident  that the
    air of the apparatus had been reduced into azotic gas, and that
    there had been a little nitric acid condensed in the tube.                Tins
    experiment puts it beyond doubt, that it is not at the expense of
     the oxygen of the litharge that the lead is oxidated, but rather
     at the expense of that of the nitric acid ; in the second place, that
     the nitric acid is reduced by the lead into nitrous acid, which
     remains in combination with the oxides, and into nitrous gas
     which is liberated.       I am ignorant if the decomposition goes so
     far as to give out azotic gas.
         13. This decomposition of the nitric acid fixed to one base is
     certainly very remarkable ; and if actual experiments had not
     proved   it,
               I   could not have thought        possible. it   The aeid nitrate
     of lead   is  not the only salt of its kind which             susceptible of

     upon cooling, we find in the mother water plenty of nitrite of
     potash, which emits the red vapour when we mix sulphuric acid
     with it. This mother water contains merely an atom of lead,
      which sulphuretted hydrogen demonstrates.             In this experiment,
    it   is to all appearance the affinity of lead for oxygen and for
      water, which determines the decomposition of the nitric acid,
      while in the former           the affinity of lead for oxygen and for

instead of being precipitated in yellow scales, it takes the form
of pale-red needles which unite in stars. As this salt is only
formed after the yellow salt, and with a greater quantity of lead
than that which served to form the latter, it is evident that it
ought to contain more base, and that it ought to be regarded as
a subnitrite.     Before explaining the properties of these two salts,
I shall premise that it is very difficult (perhaps even impossible)
to obtain perfectly pure nitrite by M. Proust's process : in fact,
if we have not boiled the acid nitrate long enough over the lead,
the nitrite may contain nitrate.         Finally, if the ebullition has
been too long, the nitrite retains some subnitrite, as appears
from its colour verging towards red. The best process for pre
paring the nitrite consists in passing a current of carbonic acid
into the solution of subnitrite, and in evaporating the liquor se
parated from the carbonate of lead.           We then obtain crystals of
nitrite, which we must press between bibulous paper to dry them :
afterwards they must be exposed to the sun.          Almost all my ex
periments     were  made   with nitrite of  lead produced by the sub
nitrite.

    15.   It crystallizes in yellow leafy flakes.
    16. It is not very soluble in cold water: besides, its solution
has but a slightly astringent and saccharine taste.       100 grammes
of boiling water may dissolve about 9'41 gr. 100 parts of water
 at 23° of the centigrade thermometer, when mixed with 2 gr. of
nitrite reduced into powder, dissolved 1*26 gr. after being 24 hours
in contact.      When we make a solution in boiling water, and
when we cool it to 23", the water retains more nitrite than it
would have dissolved at the same temperature.
    These determinations are not rigorous, because, when we dis
solve the nitrite in water, there is always a portion of it decom
posed by the carbonate of ammonia contained in the distilled
water.
    It appears to me, that when we crystallize several times the
nitrite (coming from the subnitrite) the first crystals obtained
from it contain more base than those which are formed after
wards, and that the mother water of the latter was slightly acid.
 The first crystals were of a deeper yellow than the rest : they
yielded when analysed one centieme of base more than the latter.
    17. . The solution of nitrite is yellow, it brings back to blue
 turnsole paper which has been 'reddened by an acid : it does not
 perceptibly absorb oxygen gas, at least after a contact of three
 days ; when exposed to the air it is covered with a white pellicle
 of carbonate.

 I desire to impress that it affords to my mind a convincing proof,
 that the two fluids {culled positive and negative) do not inter
fere with each other, on their passage in opposite directions; and
 this may be further elucidated by coating each side of the inter
 mediate card with mucilage (gum), for in this case no bur will
 be raised, and two apertures found.
     M. Walsh, in the penultimate number of " The Annals of
 Philosophy," states some interesting experiments on the electri
 city of paper.    The attractive power which writing-paper, being
 well heated, acquires by friction with caoutchouc, (and as I find,
 also, with wheaten bread, Sic.) is a circumstance which most
 electricians are aware of.     So much is this adhesive property
 manifested, that paper thus treated will append to a wall for
 some minutes.      Paper is a well known electric      burnt paper,
 according to my experiments, becomes a conductor of electricity ;
 but when converted, by combustion, further, into white ash, it
 reverts to its former electric state.
     As every fact, though humble in itself, and insulated, is ne
 cessary, before we report on the nature and properties of a new
 substance, I shall deviate in this instance from any thing like a
 natural order or arrangement.
     lode, that most singular body, a correct estimate of which
 seems to baffle our best researches, appears to me to be " gifted"
 with a most inappropriate title, and the same objections militate
 against the term Iodine. — Iodegene is at once expressive of its
 generating a violet colour by heat. The term gas most in
 aptly applies, — for at common temperatures it is not a perma
 nently elastic fluid; — and if it should ultimately be pronounced
 to be a metal, then, according to the more modern acceptation
 of the nomenclature, its name will be Iodium.
     In the external characters of opacity and lustre, iode assimi
  lates to a metal, and the circumstance of its forming a fulmi
 nating compound with ammonia is allied to this opinion.        The
  crystals of iode examined with a lens present uniformly rhom-
  boidal prisms.    Iode is much like ore of irridium, a specimen
  of which I have lately obtained.
     I kept for some time a glass tube inclosing iode in a tin case,
  and on examining it found the tube broken, and that the iode
  had disappeared , not a trace of it could be ascertained.   I then
 moistened a slip of litmus paper with distilled water, and intro
 duced it into the tin envelope.       When it was withdrawn, a few
 red spots appeared on it ; and as on contact of liquid ammonia,
  the original colour was restored; there seemed evident signs
  of an acid.
     When iode rises in vapour, its odour is somewhat like that of
  chlorine.
                                                                  By

        By repeatedly exposing this substance in vapour, and the cry
    stalline state, to the sunbeams, a deposit of a dew of a greenish
     colour is effected ; so that, though heat does not alter          light        it,
     produces from its chemical affections a most important change.
     Some of the iode       Ihave now with me in          tube hermetically
                                                                 a

        The violet vapour which rises on application of heat cannot

       Process for obtaining highly dephlegmated Spirits of Wine
       without Injury to its constituent Principles.    By M. Dvbuu, .
       of Rouen*.
    For    upwards of two centuries, chemists have been proposing
'
    methods for freeing common spirits from            certain quantity of
                                                              a
    water,  malic acid, and  other  foreign bodies  which they obstinately
    Tetain, in order to procure pure alcohol, or highly rectified spirits
    of wine.     It    now about
                      is                hundred years since Boerhaave,
                                             a
     Cartheuser, Stahl, and other chemists were occupied with this
    object, and since, by means of their improvements, this valuable
    fluid has been obtained freed from the heterogeneous substances
    which alter its properties.   Of all the old methods, that of Lemery
    seems the best    :   consists in distilling in
                           it                         vapour-bath spirits

 tentigrade) : this liquor, when at such a degree of lightness, is
 described by Baume as highly rectified spirit of wine.                 " Its
physical and chemical properties, in addition to its levity, consist
in being perfectly diaphanous, very volatile, very inflammable,
burning without smoke, having an agreeable smell, a hot taste,
 and it does not alter the aqueous tinctures of turnsole, or of the
 petals of violets."
     Such are the characters which ought to distinguish every al
 coholic extract of wine, cider, perry, rum, &c. when well recti
 fied, deprived of water, and of the malic acid which we meet
with almost always in weak spirituous liquors.
     We may, by means of salt or alkaline and earthy matters, bring
 alcohol to a superior degree of rectification, to the point of
marking 46 or more in the areometer : but it is clear that these
substances act more or less on the elements of alcohol during di
stillation; for the liquor which results has new properties, since it
acts differently with the reagents from the spirit of wine obtained
without intermedium, such as that prepared by Lemery's process,
which we shall henceforth call pure alcohol.
     Lowitz, Richter, and other chemists successively suggested
various substances, which have a great affinity for water, in order
completely to dephlegmate alcohol.              In short, if the substances
mixed with spirit of wine, only take up the aqueous principle                 •
which it contained in excess before it attained its last stage of
rectification, we may then conceive what immense advantages,
by these processes, spirituous fluids might confer on the arts and
commerce in general * ; but the series of experiments about to
be detailed will remove all uncertainty on this head, and enable
us in future to appreciate the means hitherto employed in the
rectification of alcohol.        We shall show that every saline ad
mixture changes spirit of wine more or less, either by acting on its
constituent principles, or by being dissolved, or even interposed
in a state of minute division.
     The substances which have been alternately employed in these
operations, or the dephlegmalion of spirit of wine, are; 1st, the
two fixed alkalis ; 2d, the muriate of lime ; 3d, the muriate of
potash ; 4th, quick-lime ; 5th, calcined gypsum ; 6th, sulphate
of soda, and latterly, acetate of potash fused and reduced to
powder.
     In consequence     I successively distilled pure spirit of wine (from
    *  It would be highly useful, as is now the case with most of the acids,
the sulphuric in particular (the highest (fcgree of concentration uf which it
is capable being; known), if the maximum of lightness or rectification of al
cohol was also fixed in an invariable manner : hut in order to avoid errors,
the hygrometers ought to be graduated alike in every country.

3S to 40 degrees) with these different salts, following precisely
the processes pointed out.
   This alcohol, when rectified with the alkali of tartar or of soda,
either caustic or partly carbonated and very dry, acquires in truth
three or four degrees of lightness : after this proof, its smell be
comes more subtile ; but it loses its natural mellowness.            It
greens the aqueous tincture of the petals of the violet :• in addi
tion it abundantly precipitates the water taken from wells charged
with calcareous sulphate; effects which demonstrate that spirit of
wine rectified over alkalis is altered in its elements, or receives in
addition some heterogeneous principle.
   Pure alcohol rectified over the muriates of lime and potash
slightly calcined, acquires also levity, and even more than with
the alkalis, but the liquor produced by it also contracts new pro
perties.   These do not belong to good alcohol : they give it a
hot, bitter, pungent taste.      It is easy to demonstrate the pre
sence of the salts employed in this rectification, either by am
monia, or by the nitrates of silver and mercury, &c.
    Quick-lime coarsely pulverized and mixed with pure alcohol,
creates sufficient heat to permit a portion of the fluid to distil over
without employing external heat : this first product gives cer
tain sign* of alkalinity, by acting sensibly on the aqueous juice
of the black plum.        The residue distilled in the vapour-bath
contracts   more   and   more   the pungent property, and instan
taneously becomes turbid on mixing with it common water satu
rated with carbonic acid : it is easy by putting the liquor in a
large conical glass, to perceive at the bottom after it rests two
days a remarkable quantity of carbonate of lime, &c.
    Pure alcohol distilled over calcined gypsum also acquires light
ness, less however than with the four foregoing substances: the
spirit of wine produced contracts a peculiarly disagreeable smell :
besides, it renders turbid the infusion of flowers of red poppy,
whereas pure alcohol heightens the colour of it : it likewise com
municates a shade of dead leaves to the tincture of violets, — pro
perties which indicate its alteration, or the presence bf a foreign
body in the spirituous fluid.
    Glauber's salts, or sulphate of soda calcined and deprived com
pletely of its water of crystallization, seemed an excellent inter
medium for dephlegmatmg alcohol without acting on its ele
mentary principles.      I repeated this operation several times with
success, and always obtained, by employing a part of this salt
pulverized over two of liquid at 36, 37 and 38 degrees, a spirit
of wine marking from 38 to 40 degrees, and which had all the
properties of that prepared without any intermedium : but not
withstanding its agreeable smell, it held in solution a small quan
tity of the saline substance employed in its distillation, for pure
     /                                                         barytes

                    On Alcohol or spirituous Liquors.               275
 barytes occasioned in it a slight precipitate.       It was also easy
 afterwards, by means of the blue vegetable colours, to discover in
 it the presence of the alkali set free by the subtraction of the
 sulphuric acid united to the ponderous earth.
      By a second rectification over the same calcined salt, we may
 have alcohol at 42 degrees, but vain will be the attempt to give it
 a higher degree of levity by other distillations : this liquor differs
 only from spirit of wine prepared without intermedium, in so far
 as it contains a slight quantity of sulphate of soda in solution.
                   By  the calcined Acetate  of Potash.
     This method, which was lately suggested by an eminent che
 mist of Paris, succeeds beyond every other : pure alcohol distil
 led in the vapour-bath over this salt acquires more than 46 de
 grees (at the temperature of 10 + 0 Reaumur) ; but having ex
 amined this liquor, I soon perceived that it was no longer spirit
 of wine : it differed from it, 1st, by having a very pungent
 smell, something like the tincture of salt of tartar of the shops.
 2d, It had an acrid soapy and bitterish taste. 3d, It changed
 into green the aqueous tincture of the petals of violets, &c.
     It is therefore very evident that the alcohol obtained by this
 process is of a great levity, but the properties peculiar to this fluid
 remove it from the rank of pure spirit of wine, and make it a
 new liquid.
     From the above short detail, and the facts resulting from ex
 periments carefully made on pure alcohol from 38 to 40 degrees,
 extracted from the various mucoso-saceharine substances which
 have undergone the spirituous fermentation, it appears demon
 strated that all the six saline substances above cited, have an ac
 tion more or less direct, not only on the last portions of water
 which adhere very strongly to the alcohol, but also upon the con
 stituent parts of this same fluid : hence we must conclude, that
 all these intermedia do not exactly procure a spirit of wine de-
 phlegmated to the maximum, and preserving all the physical and
 chemical properties which ought to render it saleable and useful.
     It has also been proposed to subtract the water from alcohol
 at 36 degrees, by distilling it in the vapour -bath with a weak
 dose of sulphuric acid : for instance Vg.th of its weight.      I have
 observed that so long as spirit of wine does not exceed 38 de
grees, it preserves by this rectification the properties which cha
racterize it ; but if we add a new portion of acid to the latter,
the product then acquires, with its specific lightness, a fragrant
odour slightly ethereated : this already announces an alteration
in the elementary principles of the spirituous fluid.
    The common alum of commerce calcined, considering the
great quantity of humidity which it loses during its exposure to fire,
                                   S 2                            seems

276              On Alcohol or spirituous Liquors.
seems also very convenient for      taking up the superabundant wa
ter in the composition of alcohol : in consequence I added one
part in powder to two of this liquor marking 36°.           After two
days,  the  whole  was   distilled in the vapour-bath,  and this spirit
of wine then yielded 39°. It had a very agreeable taste, but L
was much surprised at the new property which it had acquired:
it reddened strongly the aqueous tinctures of turnsole and flowers
of violet. I then rectified a third time this last alcohol over varied
proportions of calcined sulphate of alumine, and obtained con
stantly nothing but a liquor from 39 to 40 degrees.       Hence I con
cluded that alum deprived of its water of crystallization does not
take up the phlegm which is foreign to pure alcohol, without act
ing directly on its constituent. principles ; 'but a., weak portion of
this salt is also volatilized during the operations, and held in so
lution, or in a state of minute division, by the spirituous fluids ;
for not only does it redden the blue vegetable colours, but it is
also evidently disturbed by the water of barytes ; effects which in
dicate the presence of alum in this alcohol.
    I have also rectified alcohol at 39 degrees over gray calcined
muriate of soda : we know that this salt retains a great part of
its weight in water of crystallization,     and that a red heat long
continued can remove it : it was in this state that I presented it to
pure spirit of wine, hoping to give it a superior degree of purity:
but after several rectifications and distillations in succession of
these two substances in the vapour-bath,         the alcohol remained
in its primitive state, and with all the properties which charac
terize it ; which proves that the muriate of soda, even when der
prived of water, does not act in any way upon the spirituous fluid
at a strong degree :— only like the sulphates of soda and of
alumine, a feeble portion of this salt is volatilized by the caloric
and the alcohol during the operation ; for this liquor becomes
sensibly whiter by the addition of some drops of nitrate of mer
cury and silver, an effect which does not take place when the
spirit of wine is very pure. It seems very astonishing that salts
equally well fixed as alum is in the fire, the sulphates and the
muriates of soda, should be volatilized during the distillation of
the alcohol, and by a heat so moderate : but something analogous
has been already noticed in No. 1G3 of the Annoles de Chimie.
 Messrs. Dabit and Ducommun of Nantz found muriate of am
monia, carbonate and sulphate of lime, in the distilled water pro
ceeding from a reservoir which had previously contained animal
substances.     Kirwan and Lavoisier also say that the nitrate of
potash is volatilized with boiling water.        I can also say that I
collected very often the vapours which emanate during the pre
paration of the alkaline salts, or of tartar emetic, kermes mi
neral, sulphate of iron, acetate of lead prepared on a very large
                                                                 scale,

                   On Alcohol or spirituous Liquors.               277
scale, and I found it always easy to discover traces of saline
metallic substances which form the base of it; which explains in
some measure the volatilization of salts which has been mentioned, .
and their solution or mixture in a state of minute division with
alcohol after the distillation of these substances.
    Reflecting on the hygrometrical properties of charcoal, and on
the aptitude of pure alumine and common clay for water which
it retains in abundance and even at a high degree of heat, and
considering also the inertnes of these substances towards alcohol,
I employed them successively in the dephlegmation of spirit of
wine : consequently I made various experiments, the chief of
which only I shall detail here.
                           1st.  By Charcoal.
    In one litre of alcohol at 36^ mean temperature, I put four
ounces 128 grammes of burnt birch wood while yet warm,
shaking the whole frequently to.facilitate the immersion and im
bibition of the charcoal : in four days I filtered, and the alcohol
still marked 36 degrees.        A similar operation took place with
very pure alcohol marking 36 degrees : after several days mace
ration over charcoal this spirit of wine had also preserved its pri
mitive state.      These effects tend to establish that charcoal ab
sorbs both the alcohol, and the water which it contains in super
 abundance.,
     The mixtures of charcoal and of spirituous liquor were after
wards distilled to dryness in the water-bath: the alcohol, which
 marked originally 36 degrees, rose one degree by this operation,
 but the latter remained as it was.      I repeated these experiments,
 1st, upon animal charcoal ; s2d, upon the charcoal of various
 woods ; but I only obtained alcohol at 39 or 40 degrees even when
 operating on very considerable masses, and by dividing the products
 into fractions in order to establish areomstrical points of con
 tact ; which proves that charcoals have not more affmity for pure
 water than for alcohol merely (and this has been already re
 marked). Alcohol, frotn.wrratever substance produced, acquires by
 its rectification on charcoal, a sweeter smell and a more agreea
 ble taste than that which is obtained in the common manner or
 without intermedium.
                  By pure Alumine and common Clay.
     Into one litre of alcohol at 39 degrees I put eight ounces of
 pure well dried alumine: after two days immersion, and always
 at the same temperature, I decanted with precaution a sufficient
 quantity of spirit of wine, and observed that it yielded 40 de
  grees.    Afterwards  I distilled in the vapour-bath      to 'dryness.
  The fluid which came over had     a pungent very disagreeable smell,
                                   S3                               and

           '
   278              On Alcohol or spirituous     Liquors.
   and marked 41 degrees : I heated the alumine stronglv in order
   to deprive it of about 32 grammes of moisture which it had im
   bibed from the alcohol, and redistilled the latter over this earth.
   The liquor acquired upon a second rectification a new degree of
  lightness, to the point of marking 42 degrees of strength mean
  temperature.
      This alcohol constantly retains all the properties which cha
  racterize good spirit of wine : the smell, taste, and far less the
  reagents, do not discover the presence of any foreign bodv : its
  specific gravity as to that of water is nearly : : 8.292 : 1O000.
      We may also obtain alcohol in its highest degree of rectifica
  tion, by employing, instead of pure alumine, common potters' clav
  well washed, then passed through a sieve, and finally well dried
  before using it; but the attempt is vain in this way to give a greater
  degree of lightness to alcohol, as I was convinced after successive
  distillations and rectifications.     I conclude therefore that this
  earthy substance has no action upon the elements of alcohol, and
  that it only deprives it of the water which is superabundant to
 its spirituous essence.    In consequence of this, and as we are ig
 norant if this intermedium has already been employed in any si
 milar case, we suggest this new method to chemists. and distillers
 with confidence, and from our experiments we are of opinion that
 this liquor the most highly rectified, and not at all altered in
 its constituent principles, ought always to mark 42 degrees in
  Baume's areometer mean temperature.             We may add that al
 cohols    of a higher degree distilled  over saline intermedia are more
 or less altered in their constituent principles, that nevertheless
 the practice may be advantageous in the preparation of varnishes
 Tor the perfumer and watchmaker, and for coating metal work.
 But these liquors can neve'r be called good potable alcohol.
     We are also of opinion that alcohol rectified over saline and al
 kaline substances, even reduced to a proper degree, cannot be em
 ployed in the composition of medicines, because every thing in
 clines us to believe that it thereby acquires new properties which
 might deceive the medical attendant who prescribed it.
     We shall conclude our present paper with some general obser
vations upon alcohol, or ardent spirit, produced by the fermenta
tion of every kind of mucoso-saccharine substance.
     Since the fine experiments of Lavoisier, and of several chemist",
we know that the inflammable liquid known by the name of
spirit of wine is composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and a
little azote according to M. de Saussure.              Setting out from
these data, we may conclude generally that all alcohols, from
whatever substance produced, ought to be perfectly identical and
homogeneous in their elementary principles; because, since they
                                                   >                 are

 p                 On Alcohol or spirituous Liquors.                    279
are composed        same radicals, the proportions of which are
                of the
known, they ought to have the same properties, the same taste,
and act in the same way with the reagents, being well purified,
and having attained their highest degree of rectification.
    This alcoholic identity may exist within the range of physico-
chemical possibilities: but I candidly own that 1 was never
thoroughly convinced of it ; for notwithstanding numerous ex
periments for twenty-five years past on the alcoholic fluids pro
duced by wine, cyder, rum, cherry brandy, fermented grain, &c.
I constantly remarked that all these liquids, when distilled and
rectified several times even in the vapour-bath without mixture,
or the intermedium of charcoal as recommended by Lowitz, and
brought to their highest degree of spirituosity , still exposed their
origin, and that it was always easy to say which alcohol came
from wine, cider, perry, rum, &c.
    The odour which issues from the various kinds of alcohol when
rubbed on the hands, the organ of taste, in diluting these fluids
in a sufficient quantity of warm water, and their mixture with a
little sulphuric acid, are the most simple as well as the most cer
tain methods for instantly unmasking the peculiar aroma of each
kind, and the substance from which it has been produced.
    There exists a term, however, at which all these alcohols cease
 to be cognizable; but they are then denaturalized, if we may so
express ourselves, and this happens in their etherificatibn.
    In fact, the extremely volatile odorous and expansive fluid,
long known by the name of ether of Frobenius, which chemists
prepare by distilling equal parts of alcohol at 36 or 37 degrees
and concentrated sulphuric acid, may be made with every kind of
spirituous liquor; and when the product which results from it is
well rectified, and marks from 36 to 60 degrees in Baume's areo
meter, then I do not hesitate to assert that it is impossible to
ascertain to what kind of alcohol ether thus prepared belongs.
It would seem that at the moment of the affusion of the acid
over the spirituous fluid, the aroma which characterizes it is va
porized or destroyed by the dissociation or alteration undergone
by the elements which compose it *.
    I may add that the various alcohols at an equal degree of veri
fication do not always produce one and the same quantity of
   * By the effect of the reaction of the concentrated acid on alcohols, and
by the aroma which emanates from     it, we may always distinguish the kind
of ardent spirit employed in this operation hut as soon as the mixture
                                                :                           is
half cooled, then the liquors which result from are perfectly identical, as

to their smell alone;   but their colour    more or less intense: this seems
                                           is
to depend on the different proportions of the oleaginous aromatic principle
which characterizes each kind of alcohol, and which      isacted upon  by the

 LIX.      Description of a Hydro-pneumatic Blow-pipe for the Use
     of Chemists, Enamellers, Assayers, and Glass-blowers. By
     %lr. John Tilley, of Whitechapel* .
Sir, ---Being         a travelling fancy glass-blower,      I work with a
 machine      which  I  have  contrived  for my  own    use, and which I
 have been advised, by a great number of respectable gentlemen,
 to lay before the Society of Arts, &c.       The invention consists of a
 tin-box, with a partition in it reaching from the top at one end
 to within an inch of the bottom.           The vessel is air-tight at this
 end.      It is three parts filled with water, By means of a tube
 reaching within half an inch of the bottom, I blow into the water
 at the air-tight end ; the air rises in bubbles through the water
 to the top, and forces the water under the partition into the
 other compartment.          The weight of the water acts upon the air
 which had been blown in, and forces it through a blow-pipe di
 rected to the lamp, and keeps up a continued blast till the air is
 exhausted.        More air may be blown in from time to time, so as
 to keep the blast regular and continual.         It is thus I execute my
 fancy glass-blowing.        The whole apparatus, including lamp and
  case, weighs only three pounds and a half.
      I believe I am the first glass.blower who ever worked with such
  a  machine.
      if the Society should think me deserving of any reward, it will
  he very thankfully received by,
                           Your obedient humble servant,

              Blow -pipe. —Plate IV. Fig. 4, 5, 6,7, 8.
     The utility of the blow-pipe, in the arts, to raise a great heat
 in a small object, from the flame of a lamp, is too well known to
 require pointing out. "The assay of minerals, the arts of enamel
 ling, jewellery, soldering metal works, but above all the blowing
 of small articles in glass, are purposes to which it is better
 adapted than almost any other mode of applying heat.                The
 usual manner of producing a stream of air for blowing glass, is
 by means of a small pair of double-acting bellows, fixed beneath
 a table, and worked by the operator's foot; a pipe proceeds from
 these bellows to the top of the table, and termmates in a small
 jet, before.^vhich a lamp is placed, and the flame blown by the
  current of air upon the object to be heated.        The defects of the
 bellows are, that the stream of air is not perfectly regular, which
  causes a wavering of the flame, so that it does not fall steadily
  upon the object which is to be heated.         Mr. Tilley's blow-pipe
  corrects these defects, by using the pressure of a column of water
  to regulate the stream of air, and the supply is furnished from
  the mouth of the operator, by blowing through a tube, fig. 4, C,
  at a section of this instrument, and fig. 5 shows a perspective
  view of it in action.     A A is a vessel of tinned iron, or copper,
  about seventeen inches high, five wide, and nine broad ; the lid
  of which opens and shuts on hinges, and supports the lamp B,
  which burns tallow instead of oil.          C is the blowing-pipe, by
  which the air is thrown into the vessel t this, as shown in the
  section fig. 4, has an inclined partition D, which divides it into
  two chambers, E and F ; but as the partition does not reach
  to the bottom of the vessel, the two compartments                 com
  municate with each other underneath it: that marked F is
  closed at the top so as to be air-tight ; but the other is only co
  vered by the lid of the vessel, and may therefore be considered as
  being open to the outward air.        The pipe C, fig. 4, is soldered
  air-tight,  where   it passes through the top of the chamber, and
  descends very near to the bottom of the vessel, deeper than the
  partition D does, so that its mouth is always immersed beneath
  the water.     The metallic part of the blow-pipe G, which con
  veys  the  blast of air to the flame of 'the lamp, is likewise soldered
  into the top of the chamber F ; it holds a bent glass tube, a,
                                                                    which

which terminates in a very small and delicate jet,                      and is fitted
air-tight into the tin or copper tube G. Now, by                        blowing into
the tube C, the air is forced out at the bottom of                             it,

bubbles through the water into the upper part of                         the chamber
VF
 ;   this displaces a corresponding quantity of water,                  which passes
under the partition D, into the othur chamber E, elevating the
surface of the column of water, and depressing the other, as
shown in the figure            the water endeavouring to return to its

forces      itthrough   the  jet      into the flame of the lamp.

is filled with tallow, which, melting by the heat, becomes fluid,
and burns as well as oil, but with a less offensive smell, and when
 cold, being solid, is more conveniently carried than oil.          This
lamp is placed within another vessel marked B, figs. 4, 5, and 8,
which supports it at a proper height, leaving a space between
them all round, to receive any tallow which may run over the
 edge of the interior vessel or lamp.
    In using this blow-pipe, the following observations being at
 tended to, will greatly increase its effect.       The long flat cotton
wick of the lamp will be found to act better than the usual round
 cotton wick; but in either case, the flame which it raises will be
 considerable.    The end of the glass pipe a must be just entered
into the flame, and the current of air will throw out a cone
 of flame from the opposite side.          If it is well managed, this
 cone will be distinct and well defined, and extend to a con
siderable length.      Care must be taken, that the stream of air
 does not strike against any part of the wick, as it would then be
 disturbed, and the cone split into several parts.          (A wire bent
 at its end, as shown at fig. 7, is very convenient to smooth the
passage through the      wick :) the jet of air must be delivered some
 what above the wick ; and . as, unless the flame was considera
ble, there would not be sufficient for the stream of air to act
upon, for this reason the wick is opened, as shown in fig. 6, that'
 it may expose the largest surface, and produce the greatest
 flame ; the stream of air from the pipe should be directed through
 the channel or opening between the wick, so as to produce a
 cone the most perfect and brilliant.       On examining this cone of
 flame, it appears  to   be formed   of two  different colours, the part
 nearest to the lamp being of a yellowish white, and that beyond
 of a blue or purple colour.
    The subject which is to be heated, is held in the flame at the
 termination of the yellowish-white       flame, where it receives the
 greatest  heat, and   is  not  discoloured   by the soot which accom
 panies the white flame.
    Glass tubes are, when applied to this flame, quickly rendered
 pliable, and may be bent or drawn out into threads or points,
 and hermetically sealed ; or, by blowing into the other end of
 the tube, it may be expanded into a small globe, so as to form
 various small articles at the pleasure of the operator.
    In chemistry, mineralogy, and the arts, the blow-pipe is an
 extremely useful instrument, being capable of throwing such a
 powerful heat on a small object, as would be difficult to obtain
 on a larger quantity of the same substance, in tke most powerful
 furnaces ; and with this advantage, that the process is always un
 der the inspection of the operator ; whereas he can only con
jecture what passes in the centre of a furnace.                        In

    In using the blow-pipe for experiment,                       a piece   of charcoal   is
generally used to support the subject, and held in the. flame of
the lamp ; the charcoal should be of a close compact grain, and
properly burnt ; for, if it is too little carbonized, it will flame like
a piece of wood, and obscure the object ; and if it is too much
burnt, it is so quickly consumed, and burnt to ashes, that the
object is in danger of being lost in it ; the charcoal greatly in
creases the heat, by reverberating the flame, and by heating the
object at the opposite side ; itself being converted into fuel, and
excited by the blast, and thus creates an atmosphere of flame
and heated air around              it,
                              which prevents the heat being carried
off so fast, or the object being so much cooled, as           should for   if
                                                                            it
an instant be moved out of the cone of the flame, from the un
steadiness of the hand, or from accidental currents of air, which
would disturb the flame, and cause such a wavering in the point
of the cone, as to divert       in some measure from the object.
                                    it                                 In

I  have smce added some improvements to the instrument, which
make       more convenient and correct.
          it
    The first improvement consists in cutting       hole through the  a
                                                                  card,

card, , about an inch square, between the two bobs of the pen
dulums*.      A piece of card paper, rather less than an inch square,
is inserted into the place where the card was cut out, and be
tween the two ends of the wires, for the electric spark to pass
through.     As soon as this card has been perforated, it is taken
out, and another piece of equal dimensions put into its place ;
and thus a number of experiments may be made with very little
trouble.
    The second improvement consists in fixing a thread to each
pendulum rod.        These threads pass through two separate holes
in the card in contrary directions, so that by taking hold of their
ends the pendulums may be drawn close to the plane of the in
strument.
    When an electric charge is passed through the two wires, the
                              '
pendulums are thrown off in contrary directions, and conse
quently the threads are drawn through the card, and show the
mechanical forces of the two elements.
    The length of the thread drawn through the card in eleven
experiments by the positive force, thermogen, was 23 inches ;
 and the thread drawn through the card, at the same time, by the
other force, improperly called negative electricity, measured 22
 inches.
     In four of these experiments the mechanical forces were equal :
 in some of the rest the positive, or thermogen, acted with greater
 energy than the photogen; in others it acted with less: but these
 differences were only such as might have been expected from the
 nature of the elements which were the objects of investigation.
    Whence we may infer, notwithstanding this small difference,
 that the electric spark is composed of two elements passing
 through each other with equal forces, in contrary directions.
 Consequently, positive and negative are words that have no de
 finite meanings in chemical philosophy ; thermogen and photo
gen are more appropriate ; and as I have clearly denned those
 terms, my meaning cannot be misunderstood by men of science.

 LXI.    Description of a mechanical Substituie for Leeches, in
    Bleeding. By Mr. J.Whitford, of St. Bartholomew's Hos*
    pital *.
 To   the Society  for   the Encouragement           of Arts, Manufactures,
                                dud Commerce.
 Gentlemen, —       I   have taken the liberty of offering myself a
 second time to your notice, and to lay before you a small appa
 ratus I have lately invented, as a substitute for leeches : a deside
 ratum particularly to be cherished, when it is recollected that in
 severe frosts leeches cannot always be procured, and very often
 at too great a price for the afflicted necessitous to obtain.               My
 invention consists of a small spring instrument, with three trian
 gular-pointed lancets, which can be regulated to any degree of
 depth that may be required; the rest of the apparatus is a small
 exhausting syringe, with three glasses, of different sizes, to be
 applied as the nature of the case1 may require ; as frequent com
 plaints have been made by medical men, who were in the habit
 of using the exhausting syringe and glasses for cupping, that after
they had applied the glass, in the usual way, with the pump, if
 they withdrew the syringe from the glass for the purpose of ap
 plying others, the air would frequently get under the valve and
 cause the glass to fall off ; and I feel happy in stating, that I have
 completely succeeded in the improvement I have made on the
 cup of the glass, which will prevent the possibility of that occur
 rence. Notwithstanding the maiiy alterations I have been .making
 on the apparatus for the last four years, I found that I was in
 the exact situation, as to the mode of applying the glasses, as
gentlemen who were in the habit of using the exhausting syringe
and glasses for cupping.          I could but apply one glass at a time
without the danger, if I removed the syringe, of the glass falling
off, as it most frequently happens you have occasion to apply two
or more leeches.       I found it therefore necessary to make a further
improvement on the instrument, that you might apply as many
glasses at a time as you might think proper, which is done as
follows : — I made a small stop-cock, on the cap of the glass, un
der the valve, which when the glass and syringe is used in drawing
up tile skin, by turning the stop-cock, makes it completely air
tight, so that it is impossible for the glasses to fall off, until you
may think proper to remove them.                  1 have the pleasure of pre
senting several certificates from some of the most respectable of
the faculty, who have obligingly given me their opinion ; and if
you, gentlemen, should require further explanation respectingmy

    Sir, — I have      had frequent opportunities of using your leech-
instrument, and am happy to inform you that it has answered
far beyond my expectation.              I have found it particularly useful
in many cases where the indigent class of people have stood in
need of leeches, but from the high price could not procure, them.
I have also found it very convenient in two cases, where the pa
tients had a great aversion even to the sight of the leech, con
sequently the instrument proved to them its most beneficial effects.

 very useful reptile, which, from its dearth and scarcity, cannot

    Sir, — I have      made use of your artificial leech, and, from my
 experience, I think it will prove of great utility.             In cases where
 leeches are necessary I think it will answer every purpose, and in
 many instances will be preferable.               The operation can be per
 formed much cleaner, with considerably less fatigue to the patient,
 and the quantity of blood taken away can be ascertained with
 more accuracy than if drawn by the natural leech.                  The extra
 vagant price    of leeches     often  puts   it out of the power   of the lower
 class of people to procure them ; and frequently, when procured,
 they will be found sickly, and their power of action so languid as
 to disappoint the hopes of the patient, and the expectation of
 the practitioner ; a disappointment which is prevented by the
 artificial leech : and where prompt and immediate bleeding by

 winter season,      when    leeches are so exceedingly expensive, and
when generally they are more wanted, it will prove a valuable
substitute.       The additition of the stop-cock, as it will preserve
 a more perfect vacuum, will enhance its value.

    This instrument operates nearly in the same manner as the
scarificator and cupping-glass, but in a more delicate way 5 the
piercing instrument being provided with sharp points, instead of
lancets, so as to make three very small punctures in the skin (in
stead of incisions, as by the scarificator) ; upon these a small glass
cup is applied, and a syringe used to exhaust the air from it, and
increase the flow of the blood.

   portunity of perusing     a work  entitled  "  Elements of Natural His
   tory and Chemistry," and guided by other references which it
   has been my study to embrace, I find there are earths and stones
   that may be calcareous without having the power to effervesce
   with acids ; and my late experience has confirmed the fact, that
   even the best white lime, after having been exposed for some time
  to the air, will lose that quality which I conceive to be essential
  in decomposing rich, matured, good cane juice. From the fre
  quent stoppage of fire, occasioned by the mill by no means sup
  plying the three small vessels on this estate, the liquor often got
  tainted in the boilers, which its smell immediately made known.
  And here I must remark, that neutralised liquor assumes a new
  character, and, I have every reason to think, yields soon to the
  more powerful agent, acidity, and can only be restored by a free
  use of active lime applied to the boiled liquor, simply putting it
 into, the ladle therewith, and straining or rather throwing it on a
  skimmer on the liquor in the coppers ; nor should the operator
  apply lime with too cautious a hand.          I take the liberty to affirm,
 that half a .pint, or even a whole one, applied over and above in
 the receiver in tempering, would not have any other effect than
 that produced by a like quantity of salt in cu*ing a large round of
 beef.     So also, as a restorative, should the liquor, by staying
 process, lean to taint, apply liberally temper lime, to destroy the
 acid, and rather let the smell of alkali predominate ; — do not
 fear the result, as no discolouring of the sugar nor scaling the
 tache will take place.        But to come more immediately to the
 point : an excellent small kiln of white lime, composed of the
 coarse grained common limestone, and calcined by the strongest
 hard wood, was burnt on this estate.           Previously to commencing
 crop this year, several hogsheads were headed up, and some was
 deposited in the boiling-house in casks ; one burst very soon after,
which for a time served the purpose of temper ; but in a little I
 found it to lose its proper effect.       My late reading had given me
the idea of effervescence.         On applying a half pint, or rather
more, of this lime to the boiling liquor, it had not that quality,
though it approached to granulation, but not in so active a de
gree as it ought.        I caused another cask^ to be used, and found
that with a much less quantity, thrown into a ladle of liquor, the
effervescence was so strong and turbulent, as to force its way over
the side of the ladle, and was more efficacious.            Hence I infer,
that   too  little attention   is paid to the quality of the stone, and
the state of the temper lime commonly used.               From the works
                                                                      which,

feelieve, that, if large vessels were in use, alum would very essen
tially and powerfully resist fermentation.From analogy, in the
animal and vegetable kingdom, I conclude, that as alum is found
to resist putrefaction in a greater degree by forty times than
common sea-salt, so I think it may act as a preservative from
the great evil to be avoided in the manufacture of our grand
staple, sugar.

    June 29.— Since my last communication I made the following
experiment to prove how far alum acted in resisting fermentation
by applying it to cane-juice in the manufacture of sugar, which
 I briefly subjoin : — On the 23d inst. I filled a large decanter
with cane-juice as it flowed, from the mill, and five three-ounce
phials, prepared, the first, as a standard from the mill ; into the
second I put a small portion of alum ; with the third I took
clarified liquor from the receiver, in which Jthere was also some
alum ; the fourth contained simply clarified liquor ; and the fifth
eane liquor out of the decanter, satur, . tel, with white lime.           I
theji filled up the decanter       with  Seville orange-juice.    The de
canter was in a rapid fermentation the next morning.             The first
phial was not observed to ferment on the 24th, but on the morn
ing of the 25th it was visible ; the second, with the alum applied
<o it,  has not to this day any sign of fermentation         the third has

not yet shown any degree         of  agitation, though both the latter
smell and taste         alittle acid   ;the fourth fermented on the
26th ;    and the fifth did not show any sign of fermentation until
the 28th, and then slowly.         Thus have endeavoured in
                                                   I                acrude
state to ascertain the power of alum to counteract the great evil
to be avoided in making sugar, leaving to those who are more
able to determine with precision its due effect and properties,
and humbly hoping that the attempt, however imperfect, may be
considered as an offering of one using his best endeavours to pro
mote useful knowledge.

the liquor ; consequently, it wpuld have the same effect in the

capable of elucidating its properties and effects, should you con

LXIII.   Experiments upon Mushrooms.                By M. Vauquelin*.
M    . Jatjme St. Hilaiue, so well known by his botanical ac
quirements, having requested me tp submit to chemical analysis
three kinds of poisonous mushrooms, viz. the agaricus theo-
galus, bulbosas, and mitscarius, I turned to the memoir of
M. Braconnot on the subject, inserted in the lxxixth volume of
the Annates dp Cliimie.
   The results obtained by this chemist appeared to me to be so
interesting that I immediately resolved to verify them by ex
periments, and with this view I began an accurate analysis of
the common mushroom which is to be procured daily in the
markets of Paris.
   It is to the common mushroom, therefore, that my present
work chiefly refers. I shall subjoin the results obtained from the
three kinds of mushroom above mentioned.
   M. Braconnot discovered in mushrooms a great number of
principles ; the most prominent of which I shall enumerate
here : for instance, in the agaricus volvaceus there are, ac
cording to him, 1st, Fungine, or the fibrous part common to
all mushrooms.     2d, Gelatine.    3d, Albumen.     4th, A parti
cular kind of crystallizable sugar.   5th, Oil. 6th, Wax. 7th,
Adipocire.    8th, Benzoic acid.    9th, A very evanescent delete
rious principle. 10th, Finally Salts, such as phosphates, acetates
and muriates of potash,
   In the other species he sometimes found new acids, an un
known animal matter, and animal mucus.
         ANALYSIS OF THE COMMON             EATING MUSHROOM.
   Agaricus campestris.. After having skinned
                                                         it,
                                                       was pounded

ina  marble mortar, adding    little distilled water, and the mois
                                  a
ture was afterwards expressed.
   These manipulations were repeated until the water which was
added came off almost colourless.
   The juice was filtered    : had a slight red colour, and the
                                  it
husks {marc) were set aside in order to. be treated with alcohol,
as afterwards described.

    The husks assumed a blackish colour from the contact of the
air, and the juice underwent the same change from the same
Cause.
    The juice, when filtered and subjected to the action of some
reagents, exhibited the following effects :
    1. With the nitric acid} a coagulation like albumen diluted with
water.
    2. With acetate of lead, a very abundant precipitate.
    3. With the aqueous infusion of gall nuts, the effects were
the same as with diluted albumen.                                  •  .
    4., With the nitrate of barytes, a slight precipitate.
    5* With oxalic acid, no change.
    6b With ammonia,      no precipitate ; only the red colour be
came brown.
    7. With turnsole paper, no change.
    8. This juice when exposed to heat coagulated like albumen
diluted in water, and the matter which was separated from it
seemed to be of a deep black*
    Such are the tests to which the juice of mushrooms was ex
posed : they prove scarcely any thing, except that it contains a
substance which acts like animal albumen, but which, according
to appearances, carries with it upon coagulating a body which
 communicates a black colour to it.
    This juice was evaporated at a very gentle heat to the con
 sistence of a soft extract, and was afterwards treated with boiling
 alcohol.
   Expressed Hiisks     of Mushrooms     subjected to the Action   of
                                Alcohol.
     I poured upon them, when deprived of whatever was soluble in
 water and strongly pressed, three times their weight of alcohol
 at 38°, which was boiled a few minutes.       The boiling liquor was
 passed through   a  cloth, and  the husks were  strongly pressed.
     The alcohol, which had assumed a yellowish red colour, de
 posited upon cooling a white flaky matter, which was separated
 two days afterwards by filtration.
     The surface of this matter when dry was of a slight brown
 colour.
     Examination of this Substance. It was of a white colour in
 ternally, brownish externally : its consistence was solid and firm :
 to the touch it was unctuous : when thrown upon burning coals
 it melted, but imperfectly, giving out white smoke, like that of
 grease.                                        '<
     When again heated with alcohol, this matter was dissolved,
 excepting a small quantity of brown flakes which were doubtless
 the colouring principle.

    It is speedily precipitated in the form of flakes, if the
cooftng of the solution be rapid ; but when the cooling pro
ceeds very slowly, it takes upon separating the form of crystal
line lamine, like spermaceti : it is then very white, brilliant,
soft and unctuous to the toucli ; in short, it does not seem to
differ from common spermaceti.
   This substance, which was known and described by the name
of adipocire by M. Braconnot, as one of the elements of mush
rooms, exhibits a fact as new as it is interesting, since hitherto
chemists have met with it in the animal kingdom only.
Examination of the Alcohol which was boiled over the Husks
  of Mushrooms, and which deposited upon cooling the Sper
  maceti just described.
  This alcohol, when distilled in a retort, left a liquid re
sidue  of a brownish yellow colour, in which grumous greasy
particles were swimming.   This residue contained scarcely any
more alcohol ; it was the water contained in the mushroom
husks, at the moment of being treated by the alcohol, which
gave it fluidity. This liquor was filtered ; and after having se
parated the fat matter from        was evaporated into a syrupy
                                             it,   it

   If was this substance which M. Braconnot took for wax,
           it
I think he was mistaken.:         rather a kind of fat, which
                                            it   is                                              it

                                         ;             it    is
which M. Braconnot described by the name of wax.
Examination               of   the fibrous       Part        the Mushroom,

                                Fungine      by    M.   Braconnot.
    The mushroom     having been cleansed, as observed above,
successively         by
                water and      alcohol, from every thing which
                                            by
was soluble in these two agents,     was afterwards dried, and
                                                        it

                                                                                                 the

  the neck of the retort, and the nature    of which could not be
  ascertained.
     4. A charcoal, the parts of which were not joined into one
 mass by heat.
     5. This charcoal > when burnt in a platina crucible, gave a
 small quantity of whitish ashes, mostly composed of phosphate
 of lime and lime itself.
    This result differs essentially from that which M. Braconnot
 says he obtained from fungine subjected to the same operation,
 since it announces that its product Was ammoniacal, without
 however containing carbonate; which appeared to be impossible.
     I am doubtful whether we ought to form a particular prin
 ciple of this substance : its numerous analogies with the com
 mon ligneous principle seem to indicate that it is merely this
 principle slightly modified by some matter which remains mixed
 or combined with it.
        Juiee  of Mushrooms   extracted by means  of Water.
     It will be recollected that the juice of mushrooms so ob
 tained was evaporated to the consistence of a soft extract, and
 afterwards treated with hot alcohol.
    The latter dissolved a considerable quantity of matter, which
 communicated to it a brownish red colour ; but it also left a
 certain quantity of other substances, the greater part of which
 consisted of albumen coagulated during the evaporation of the
juice.
    The first portion of alcohol not appearing to act any longer,
 it was decanted, and replaced by a second, and so on until this
 fluid was no longer coloured.
    All the portions of alcohol were collected, and distilled in the
vapour bath, in order to obtain the principles which were dis
solved in it. We shall recur presently to this part of the opera
tion ; in the mean'time we shall examine the matter insoluble
 in alcohol.
    I began by washing      it in water, which extracted a deep
brown colour from it     : when fresh quantities of water, passed
over this matter, no longer took any colour, it was dried by a
gentle heat, and a portion was distilled. The washings above
mentioned were evaporated,        and put by themselves to be used
as will afterwards appear.
    When once dried, this matter was of a blackish colour, and
was considerably hard and brittle : the fracture was shining :
when put upon burning coals it softened, and emitted a smoke
the smell of which resembled burnt horn.
    When distilled, it furnished abundance of carbonate of am
monia crystallized in the neck of the retort : another portion
                                  T4                              in

296             Experiments upon Mushrooms.
in the liquid state, abundance of reddish and thick fetid oil J
lastly, a charcoal which joined in a single lump, although the        .
substance had been reduced in very small fragments.
   From these properties, it does not appear doubtful that the
substance in question is of an animal nature, and of the albu
minous kind.     This did not escape the sagacity of M. Bracon-
not.
   The presence of albumen in these vegetables explains the rea
son of their assuming, when roasted, a consistency and firmness
which they had not when raw, being brittle and very spongy.
   It also accounts for their soon becoming putrid, and emitting
a fetid smell, when they attain their highest point of vegetation j
and also shows that they afford substantial food for carnivorous
animals, whereas herbivorous animals never touch them.          We
shall see, however, that albumen is not the only animal substance
which mushrooms contain.
Examination    of the Matters   dissolved by Alcohol when applied
                to the   Extract of Mushrooms.
  We have already observed, that the juice of mushrooms       eva
porated to a soft extract had been treated with alcohol, which,
had dissolved that part of it which had been obtained separate
by the evaporation of the solvent.
   This reddish-brown substance, when dried by a gentle heat,
was again treated with alcohol : it was divided into two portions :
the most abundant was dissolved by alcohol, and another portion
remained at the bottom in the form of a brown extract.         We
shall see that this last resembles that which remained with the
albumen, and which we separated from it by means of water.
    The alcohol filtered warm deposited upon cooling a crystalline
substance in the form of silky white needles, and having a taste
slightly saccharine.    On reducing by evaporation the quantity of
alcohol, we obtained a fresh quantity of this substance.
  Examination of the above crystalline saccharine Substance.
   This substance, after having been separated from alcohol and
dried on Joseph paper, was of a yellowish white colour : it was.
dry and brittle. When dissolved again in boiling alcohol,, it re
appeared of a perfect white colour, and always in the form of
fine and silky needles.
   It is by no means so sweet as common sugar : the smell which
it gives out when burnt does not resemble that of the latter : it
is sharper, and has more analogy to the smoke of wood.     Con
centrated sulphuric acid dissolves this substance, and makes        it,
take  a  red colour; but   itdoes not char   it as common sugar
does..    If
           we put water into    mixture of this sugar and of sul-

phuric acid, a white coagulum is formed, which upon agitation
renders the liquor milky.
    Although this saccharine principle be more soluble in water
than in alcohol, it is nevertheless not more so than common
sugar, and it crystallizes much more easily than the latter.
    I was at first inclined to think that this kind of sugar was si
milar to that which M. Fourcroy and I discovered in the nlgce,
melon, onion, and manna : but as M. Braconnot assures us that the
sugar of the above plants ferments, whereas that of mushrooms
does not, I forbear giving an opinion until I obtain a quantity
large enough to verify the fact.       In the mean time I regard the
sugar of mushrooms as being sui generis.
 Examination of the extractive Matter of the mushroom which
                        was insoluble in Alcohol.
    We have already shown that, by treating the extract with
 alcohol, the former was divided into two portions, one of which
 was dissolved, and the other remained at the bottom : it is of the
 latter that we shall now speak.
     It is of a deep brown colour, and has a decided and rather
 pleasant.taste of mushrooms.       Its solution in water is abundantly
 precipitated by the infusion of gall-nuts, as well as by the nitrate
 of silver : when evaporated into a syrupy consistence, it furnishes
 crystals of a pungent taste, but entangled in the extractive matter.
     As it appeared to be impossible to separate these crystals so
 as to have them pure, a portion of the matter which contained
  them was burnt in a platina, crucible.
     The following phenomena were then exhibited : 1st, A bubbling
 took place on account of the humidity which still remained, and
  a very agreeable smell of mushrooms was emitted. 2d, After
  wards ammonia was sent out in such quantities, that it affected
  the eyes and nostrils, and instantly revived the colour in turnsole
  paper.    which had been reddened by an acid and moistened.
  3d, It furnished a charcoal easily incinerated, and which left an
  abundant grayish ash, the taste of which was salt and pungent.
  4th, These ashes were almost entirely dissolved in water, there
  remaining only some slight molecules of charcoal.         The reagents
  indicated that the salts contained in the lixivium of these ashes
  were the phosphate, the muriate, and the carbonate of potash.
      If it be asked, what is the nature of this substance ? does it
  belong to a species already known in the organic kingdoms ? or
  is it a peculiar and new composition ? I can scarcely answer
  the questions in a satisfactory manner.
      M. Braconnot found, it is true, in mushrooms, gelatine and
  animal mucus; but when I compare this substance with either of
  the above, I find no perfect identity.       In fact, gelatine properly
                                                               evaporated

  fevaporated    passes into a jelly more or less solid upon cooling,
  which the substance in question does not : the gelatine is not
  dissolved in alcohol even weakened to 24 degrees, and the latter
  is dissolved in alcohol at upwards of 30°.
     On the other hand, animal mucus, on being united with
  water, communicates to it a consistence and a viscosity of
  which the latter is not susceptible.
     Besides, animal mucus is not sensibly precipitated by the
  aqueous infusion of gall-nuts, whereas the substance in question
 is abundantly.                                  t
     Can there be a portion of albumen, which in consequence of
 the long continued action of heat has become soluble in this
 fluid ? I am inclined to think so ; but I shall not assert it posi
 tively until I make some comparative experiments on a future
 occasion.
 Examination        of the Principle of the Mushroom which is soluble
                          in Waler  and in Alcohol.
     This substance is of a reddish brown colour : in taste and
 smell   it resembles broth a little salt.                  „
     When dried by a moderate heat, it preserves its transparency
 and becomes brittle : in this state it keenly attracts humidity from
 the atmosphere, and all its parts become glued together on the
 application of moisture.
     When thrown upon burning coals it melts, and is reduced
 into smoke which has the smell of fried meat mixed with fat.
 It furnishes upon distillation a thick brown oil, and carbonate
 of ammonia : its voluminous charcoal is presented in a single
piece.
    There were found in the charcoal of this substance muriate
of   potash and subcarbonate of potash, proceeding no doubt
from the decomposed acetate.
    The solution of this substance in water is entirely precipitated
by the infusion of gall-nuts.
    When triturated with a little potash and water, ammonia was
liberated in a very marked manner : it contains in fact a little
muriate of ammonia.
    From the above details it appears that the substance in ques
tion has all the properties at present known of osmazome, and
as* such in my opinion it may be considered.         I found it in all
the mushrooms I examined.
    Eight of the various substances found in the common mush-
loom are produced by vegetation: viz.            1. Adipocire.  2. Oil
or grease. 3. Albumen. 4. Saccharine matter.               5. The ani

animal substance insoluble in alcohol. 7. The fungine of M.

substance of a yellow colour and an acrid taste.             4. An acid
salt which is not a phosphate, for it does not disturb lime
water.     The husks of this mushroom furnished an acid product
by distillation.       »

   Agaricus muscarius.        It contains : 1 . The two animal mat
ters above mentioned.       2. The fatty matter. 3. Muriate, phos

   The parenchyma of the two latter agarici gave also an
acid product upon distillation.
   The above three kinds of mushrooms probably contain
other principles ; but the small quantity which I possessed did
not afford me an opportunity of entering upon a detailed exa
mination. I shall take up the subject on a future occasion :
in the mean time, if they contain any deleterious substance,
it must be looked for, in my opinion, in the fatty matter already
described.

 JHhe subject of this analysis is a tiew mineral, which has
been recently found in the county of Sain, at Treusbourg.             My
preliminary experiments gave           me   as    its chief  constituent
parts nickel and antimony.         The novelty of this union induced,
me to undertake a rigorous analysis.

fragments: it is easily pulverised.          The specific gravity of dt
specimen     freed   by washing    of a  brown  oehre proceeding from
efflorescent sparry iron is 6*580.
    A. a.) 300 grains of ore, purified from iron as much as
possible, were brought in contact with a mixture of five parts of
muriatic acid and one of nitric acid. When cold, the solution
of the metals had already taken place in a great measure, and
the sulphur was separated. This residue, when treated again with
the same acid cold, mixed, and washed afterwards with alcohol,
gave 5 1 grains of dry sulphur.        When burnt there remained ten
grains of a blackish residue, which was almost wholly dissolved
in the above mixed acid by means of a slight heat.
    b. ) The solution was concentrated in a retort, and the liquor'
when highly concentrated was diluted with water, which occa
sioned an abundant white precipitate.
    The liquid decanted from the precipitate was concentrated
again, decomposed afterwards by water, and the new sediment
 added to the former.       This precipitate, which at a cursory glance
might have      been    confounded  with Algarotti's muriate of anti
 mony, was recognised to be an arseniate of antimony.
    c. ) After having separated the precipitate from the solution,
it was again concentrated, and appeared then to be of a deep
green.      Ammonia in excess was poured into           which redissolved
                                                        it,
the precipitate except        the brown   oxide  of  iron, the weight of
 which was found, after washing and calcination, to be thirteen
grains and  a    half.
    d. The ammoniacal solution was evaporated to dryness, and
      )
 the saline mass was afterwards made slightly red-hot in a porce
 lain crucible, in   order to decompose the neutral ammoniacal salt.
 The residue of muriated oxide of nickel, which presented             heap
                                                                       a
 of shining micaceous laminae of brownish yellow, was wholly
                                         a
dissolved in the muriatic acid      bymeans of heat, yielding    asolution
 ofa    grass green    colour.   By means   of caustic  potash, the  oxide
 of nickel was precipitated from it, which in the state of hydrate
 was of an apple-green colour.             This precipitate when well
 washed, dried, and made .red-hot in a platina crucible, left 93            1
 grains of pure oxide of        a schistous gray colour.      In order to
 determine the relation of this oxide to metallic nickel, we dis
 solved in nitric acid 100 parts of pure nickel obtained               by
                                                                        re
 duction    of the  chrysoprase   and   the  pimelite,   and  the solution
was precipitated by means of potash.             The precipitate when
 washed, and made red-hot in        a  platina crucible, yielded 132 and
 a half of oxide of nickel according to this, the above 98| grains
                            :
 of oxide of nickel yielded 70| grains of metallic nickel.

           Analysis  of a  new Variety  of  Ore   of Antimony.      301
mony was subjected to several experiments with a view to deter
mine the proportion of arsenic, but the results were not success
ful.    The object was obtained, however, in a satisfactory manner
by the following process,
    a.)    200 grains of ore pulverized and mixed with 600 grains
of nitrate of potash were gradually introduced into a red-hot
porcelain crucible : this mixture occasioned but a slight deto
nation.     The pasty mass of a clear brown was diluted with
warm water, and sufficiently washed in this menstruum.               We
added to the alkaline liquor a slight excess of nitric acid, of
which a small quantity only was requisite for saturation.           The
Jiquor   was  not  made   turbid by the addition   of the acid : a proof
that the potash had dissolved none of the antimony,             I poured
in lime water, which occasioned a voluminous precipitate. This
precipitate when washed and dried was mixed with one-third
its weight of charcoal, and eublimed in a small retort. The
metallic arsenic sublimed in .» shining crystalline stratum weighed
 19j grains.      The residue in the retort mixed with one-half its
weight of boracic acid, and heated again, sublimed two grains
and a half more of metallic arsenic.
    b.) The brownish substance when well washed was digested
with a mixture of seven parts of muriatic and one of nitric acid :
almost complete solution was the consequence.             The antimony
was precipitated from the filtered liquor by water.
    The precipitate when well dried weighed 116 grains.            As in .
a comparative experiment 100 parts of metallic antimonv gave
 130 of white oxide, the 1 16 grains represent 89 grains of metal
lic antimony.
    C. In order to determine with equal accuracy the quantity of
sulphur in this ore, 100 grains were distilled with nitric acid, and
this operation was repeated with additional portions of acid until
all the sulphur had disappeared from the solid residue. The
matter remaining being well washed by water, and the liquor
mixed with muriate of barytes, gave 102 grains of sulphate of
barytes, in which the sulphuric acid answers to\l4j grains of
sulphur.

    shire*.
Sir, — Permit me          to lay before the Society of Arts, &c. a sub
stitute for wheat-flour paste.           I have given it a fair trial for ten
months past, in order to convince myself and others of its useful
ness.     From these experiments,> I have no doubt it will prove
equal to, if not surpass, that made from flour, for paper-hangers,
stationers, weavers, trunkmakers,             calico-printers, &c. and also
for labels, cards, and pasteboard, as it may, with ease, be made
free from lumps, and does not admit the air to get under the
paper as in common paste, or injure the colour.                It is free from
any   offensive smell,   and  not    above    one-third  of the  price of that
prepared    from  flour.    The   use    of potatoe paste will cause a saving
of many thousand bags of flour annually, to be applied to the
nourishment of mankind.
    One peck of potatoes, when prepared, will make upwards of
thirty-eight pounds of paste, and one acre of land planted with
potatoes would produce more than many acres of wheat.                          I
shall be happy to attend, and give the Committee full explana
tion upon the subject.

                              Mth of April 1814.
 Sirs, — As I        believe that you will not be unwilling to insert in
 your journal any information which may have for its object
 the advancement of science, I shall describe to you, as well as
 I am able, a most remarkable meteoric phaenomenon, which
 extended across our horizon from about north north-east to
south-west on Sunday night, the 17th of April, and remained
so for a considerable time.
     About nine o'clock P. M. I observed the horizon towards
the west north-west strongly illuminated. I at first imagined"
that this appearance was caused by the zodiacal light ; but as
the sun descended, the light extended itself, until at length it
covered nearly the whole hemisphere, and occasionally almost
reached the zenith. About midnight the light was so strong
that the city was illuminated as if there had been moon-light.
At the window where I sat observing it I could see to read. v
At one o'clock it still continued to diffuse the same splendour.
                                                                          It

304               Description        of   a splendid     Meteor.
It was by some circumstances connected with this phenomenon
that mv attention was attracted, much more than by the bril
liant light which it diffused ; a portion of the sky towards the
north-west appeared at first very dark, as if covered by a heavy
cloud.    When I took notice of                    it,
                                           rose about 15 degrees
                                                     if it
above the horizon, and appeared as          was a section of an

arch      of considerable extent.          It
                                        gradually increased, preserv
ing the     same shape,      untilattained an elevation of about 45
                                     it
degrees, and covered nearly one half of the horizon.            should      I
have supposed      itto have been a very dense clpud, had the

appeared to sparkle through          with increased brilliancy. The
                                          it
circumference of this immense body of darkness was covered
all round with a strong yellowish light, resembing the morn
ing's dawn when the sun approaches the horizon this circle              :
of light was in depth about five degrees, in some parts            was           it
broader, in others narrower.
   The wind was at south. The sky was sprinkled with heavy
unconnected masses of clouds, of the kind called cumulus                               :
by  the direction of the wind, they approached towards the
north. According as each cloud arrived at the dark space
above described,       rapidly diminished in size, until
                        it                                     was en       it
tirely dissipated.       appeared to me as
                         It                       the gradual increase
                                                         if
of size of the dark space was owing to the quantity of heavy
clouds which were decomposed when they came into apparent
contact with it.
    When the dark space had attained its greatest size,            ob~           I
served a gleam of light shooting across                       it,
                                                     in two or three
places, close to the horizon, and immediately the upper part
of    all round began to move. The brilliant circumference
     it
was tinctured in many places with prismatic colours, and ap
peared to be composed of bundles of radii emanating from
a  centre. 'Flashes of light the most vivid darted from every
part of this vast circle, reaching to the zenith the whole mass     ;

mena were repeated, and the same grand spectacle was again
exhibited.     As ceased to observe these appearances at one

      March 24.     D r. Young's Remarks on the Employment of
  Oblique Riders, and on other Alterations in the Construction of
  Ships, were read.
     This paper contains a theoretical discussion of the mechanical
  properties of the different arrangements of timbers in ships and
  other fabrics, according to their direction and modes of com
  bination. The author first investigates the nature and magni
  tude of the forces to be resisted, which are the weight, the pres
  sure of the water, the impulse of the wind, and the resistance of
  the ground, or of a rock: and the action of the pressure in a
  longitudinal direction, as a cause of arching, which has not hi
  therto been observed, is particularly examined. The force of the
  waves, both in a vertical and a transverse direction, is estimated
  as far exceeding in magnitude the more permanent causes of
  arching, although from its transitory nature it has been less
  commonly noticed as requiring particular counteraction.           He
  next adverts to the insufficiency of a hasty view of the subject
' for the determination of the best arrangement, aud shows that it
  is the stiffness of a fabric, and not its ultimate strength, that is
  most materially affected by the obliquity of arrangement, where
  the depth is given, and the fastenings are perfect; and that the
  question of the utility of oblique braces must be determined by
  the manner in which a ship usually breaks, whether by the altera
  tion of the angular situation of the parts, or by the giving way
  of the fastenings.     From actual observation he concludes that
  about half of the effect is generally produced in one way and
  |ialf in the other; and hence, infers that the advantage of oblique
  timbers must be very considerable, provided they be sufficiently

  strong to resist the forces to which they are peculiarly exposed :
   and he finds upon calculation that Mr. Uppings's braces are
   likely to be strong enough to resist any force which can easily
   be applied to them.         He concludes by recommending the cau
   tious adoption     of these  improvements, the most decided of which
   appears to be the filling up between the timbers in the hold, as
   both increasing the strength, and materially tending to prevent
    the decay: and even the obliquity of the planks of the decks, he
    thinks, may in some eases be of advantage, especially when it
    becomes neccessary to have the ship hove down on her side.
         March3 1 . A paper by S. Groombridge, Esq. was read on Atmo
    spherical Refraction, correcting Observations on the circumpolar
    Stars by the barometric Pressure and thermometrical Temperature.
         This may be considered as a supplement to the author's for
     mer paper 911 atmospherical Refraction ; wherein he had pro
     posed a certain formula for the computation of the quantity,
.    from observations made to less than SO0 of zenith distance.
     Having since applied this formula from 80° to 89° 42', he has
     found that the refraction so computed exceeds that observed
     from 80° to 88° ; and below 88° gives the quantity less than
     from observation.       He now proposes another formula, which will
      agree with the observed quantity to 87", and, corrected in a cer
      tain ratio, thence to the horizon.
          The computation of the refraction, with the corrections. for the
      barometer and thermometer, from the tables prescribed by the
      author, will be very direct and simple, and obtained without
      the tedious process of logarithms.        In the result they will agree
      nearly with the French tables,, to within 2° of the horizon ; when
      both the observation and the refraction become uncertain.
          Part of a paper by Dr. Olay was read, on that part of per
       spective which relates to circles as distinct from conic sections.
       The author acknowledged his obligations to Mr. Kerrick, the
      librarian of Cambridge University; stated candidly what was ori
       ginal, and what was only digested from others ; and laid down
       six propositions, only a part of which were of a nature to be read.
       The Society then adjourned, in consequence of the holidays, till
          April 21. The Right Hon. President in the chair.          The first
       part of a letter from Dr. Brewster to the President was read,
       detailing some further experiments and curious discoveries on
       light and colours, particularly some optical effects of mother of
       pearl.    The prismatic colours exhibited by mother of pearl have
       always been considered as furnishing a good demonstration of the
        Newtonian theory of colours, by its diversified lamine ; and Dr.
        B's experiments do not contradict this explanation.         He found
        that mother of pearl polarizes light as well as agate and other
        bodies, in addition to which it has the singular property of com
                                                                   municating

quality is retained even after exposing the body to a considerable
degree of heat, so that it is not actually fused.    This fact was
discovered by Dr. B. in consequence of having cemented a piece
of polished mother of pearl on a goniometer to take the angles
of refraction.   He cut and polished the mother of pearl as well
as possible in various modes, but still found it retain its striae or
cavities resembling the fine lines used by map engravers to define
the limits of land or water. To these striae he attributed in some
degree the formation of the prismatic colours.

    The parabola itself is only a limit, a mere single case be
tween .the ellipse and hyperbola, the dimensions of which may
vary ad infinitum.      Hence there is scarcely any probability of
a parabolic orbit.      The hyperbolas are scarcely perceptible,
and from experience it would seem that the ellipses are hardly
more so.      Hyperbolic comets never return.--elliptical return
after a long interval.     There is no reason for being surprised
that only one has hitherto returned constantly.
    Laplace has discovered in the attraction of Jupiter a probable
cause why the comet of 1 770 has not appeared eight times since
that period.     Perhaps it is entirely evaporated, or reduced to
a nucleus so small, and so little luminous, that it will remain
for ever invisible.    Both these explanations are not incompa
tible, and they may have concurred in producing an effect
which has excited the curiosity of mathematicians and astro
 nomers.
    It may be presumed that this new hypothesis will consider
ably diminish the importance of comets : it is similar to the
 opinion of the ancients, who considered comets as temporary
 collections of vapour which are speedily dissipated and destroyed.
 Hence the astronomers of old did not think them worthy of
being scrupulously observed.       All the difference          is,

assign the situation and dimensions of the planetary orbits for
any epoch.     In a mathematical sense, the problem is resolved.
The arbitrary constant quantities are mostly determined with a
sufficient degree of accuracy for these researches.      We are ac
quainted even with the quantity    of matter  in those planets which
have satellites, as Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and the Earth ; but
Mars, Venus, and Mercury have no satellites. We have no other
means of determining the quantity of matter in them than the
alterations which they produce in the eccentricities and inclina
tions, or the equations which they give for the movements of the
aphelions and nodes.       But these variations are extremely slow.
Good observations go no further back than 60 years.         There re
main only the periodic equations of the longitude, and these
equations are not greater ; but their periods are shorter.       Half a
period is sufficient to obtain a double effect, since it is alternately
positive and negative.     The moon is nearly in the same situa
tion with Venus. Notwithstanding the assistance drawn from the
tides, &c. we have not as yet an exact knowledge of the quantity
of matter in our system.
   Yet unless we adopt at least a hypothetic value for these un
known quantities, it is impossible to have exact tables of the ap
parent motion of the sun.        Fortunately, during the last sixty
years   we have   a prodigious  number  of good observations.      The
estimates of the quantity of matter in these planets, which agree
best with the average of these observations, will be, if not pre
cise, at least the most probable values of these doubtful quan
tities.
    In order to determine them, the author of the tables of the
sun had chosen, out of all the observations which he had calcu
lated, those where each of the quantities of matter in the
planets produced sensible effects. The results which he obtained
did not appear even in his own eyes so certain, that they might'
not be somewhat changed, either from other observations, or from
the same observations differently combined, especially if different
elements be used in reducing them, such as the right ascensions
of the stars.
    It is the same with the mean secular motion of the sun. He
had determined it by the comparison of a great number of ob
servations made about 1/52 and 1800, which only gave him the
movement of 48 years, that       is, little less than one half of the
                                       a
 secular motion.    He   presented  this  movement not as certain,
 but as agreeing best  with  the observations calculated    byhimself.
 He perceived, that the slightest change       in  the position of the
 stars at the two extreme epochs would introduce an equal change
 in the movement obtained.       He did not venture to affirm that
 this movement was preferable to that which M. de Zach pro
                                                                 posed

   posed about the same time; and which was fixed upon by him
   self in his first researches.   He remarked, in his preface, that
   time alone could decide upon a point so delicate.
      But whatever is to be obtained in a long interval of time, and
   by more numerous and more precise observations, may likewise
   be obtained, at least in a certain degree, by redoubling present
   vigilance, multiplying calculations,   and employing more correct
   data.    This is precisely what M. Burckhardt has attempted.
      He began by calculating 36 years of observations from 1774 to
   1810, in order without inconvenience to be able to dispense with
  the small equation of the latitude of the sun, which ought to
  pass several times over all the* values of which it is susceptible,
  in this double revolution of the nodes of the moon.         He em
  ployed besides 3 10 observations of Bradley in 1752.         By this
  means he gained eight years, which have elapsed since the con
  struction of the last tables.   To calculate these observations, he
  took a mean between the corrected right ascensions of Maskelyne
  and those of M. Bessel.      The author of the tables had employed
  the right ascensions of Maskelyne corrected by his own observa
  tions in 1800.     And for 1752 he had taken the right ascensions
  of Bradley, newly corrected by Hornsby, Bradley's editor.      From
  these changes, which the researches and observations made of
  late years rendered possible, there ought to result a difference
  in the meati motion, and probably likewise in the value of the
  quantity of matter in the planets.                                  \
      M. Burckhardt finds 3-8" to be added to the motion for 49
  years, which gives 7-7" for the secular motion.      This motion is
  the mean between that of .Zach and that published by La Caille
  about 56 years ago.      Mayer, who attempted to correct this mo
  tion, considerably increased the small error in it.     Lalande di
  minished Mayer's motion 20", and gave a quantity 8" greater
  than that now given by Burckhardt.
     We see at least that in these oscillations the error is always
 diminishing, and that, if we have not y<?t obtained the true quan
 tity, we have made an approach to it. The mean length of
 the year, according to M.\jnrckhardt, is 365 days five hours
 48' 49.7".      The author of ti> otfables made it 5 1 .5".   But in
 the second volume of his Astron my, which was published about
 a year ago, we find that he inclines to 50", and was therefore
 himself approaching to the new determination.         The difference
 is now only 5'3", a quantity respecting which it will be always
'difficult to decide.
     The author of the tables had found for the lunar equation 7'5";
 La Caille supposed 7.05", Maskelyne 7'1", M. Burckhardt 6.8".
 The mean will be 0. Id". So that the uncertainty is reduced to
 a small fractiow   of a second.

    M. Burckhardt finds that the quantity of matter in Mars pre
viously determined must be dimished                Now as the equation
itself is very small, this correction, very uncertain on many ac
counts, does not deserve any attention.
    The most considerable correction is that for Venus ; and as the
equation is much more sensible, the uncertainty ought to be much
less.    M. Burckhardt diminishes its quantity of matter              which
will produce a diminution of about 1" in the greatest equation.
    The quantity of matter was supposed by Laplace            ....   1.0000

     The mean of these four results is 1.0555, and differs only
 from that supposed in the tables.
     It was by the movements of Mercury that M. Lindenau en
 deavoured to determine the quantity of matter in Venus.                  He
 has united the results which he obtained from the .motions            of the
 aphelion and the nodes.        His mean is 1.0964, so that he aug
 ments the equation of the tables as much as we should diminish
 them if we were to make choice of the above mean.                 Between
 these opposite testimonies,      the author   of the  tables  may adhere
 to his own number.        But he puts    no  greater   confidence     in his
 determination than in any other.          He even admits that the re
 sult obtained by M. Burckhardt, founded upon a greater number
 of observations, and upon newer researches, offers in consequence
 a greater degree of probability.        A reason of great weight adds
 strength   to the   necessity of  diminishing the mass of matter of
 Venus, and this reason long excited distrust in the author of the
 tables.    In whatever manner he combined the observations of
  Lacaille, Mayer, Bradley, Le Gentil, Maskelyne, Piazzi, and
 his own, he could never obtain more than 48'' for the secular
 variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic.         The mean obliquity
 which he found in 1800 has been         since  confirmed    by all the sol
 stices observed at Paris.      That which results for 1750, from so
  many observations agreeing remarkably well with each other,
  cannot be wrong further than \".         Hence he concludes that the
 secular diminution cannot be greater than 50".               He has never
 believed   that it  amounted   to  52".    We  may   therefore   ascribe to
  Venus a quantity of matter which would give 48" or 50" for the
 secular diminution, and give to the equation of Venus in the
  solar tables the value which will result from this supposition.
     M. Burckhardt proposes a diminution of 1" for the greatest
 equation of the centre. If we collect together all these corrections,
 it will follow, that the sun's place, calculated at present for
                                                                       1850,

   1850, may differ 6" from a perfect observation made at that time.
  But, before this can happen, we must suppose, what is scarcely
  possible, that all the three errors are at the maximum, and have
  the same sign.       The greatest error that can be supposed is ft"
  at the end of 50 years.       We wish the instruments by that time
  may   be   brought  to such  perfection that an astronomer can make
  a single observation with no greater error.           But this slight error
  may be easily avoided by adopting the corrections of M. Burck-
  hardt.     The most important of them is that of the secular mo
  tion. It is easy to diminish it TV of a second per year.                The
  two other corrections would give still less trouble ; but as they.
. are periodic, and often of no consequence, they may in many
  cases   be neglected.
      Corrections so little sensible as not to pass the limits of the
  errors of the best observations, may pass for a confirmation of the
  tables, as well as for a melioration of them.             We may be even
  sorry  for  astronomers   devoting   themselves    to calculations  so long
  and so fastidious, and yet obtaining only results so little 'different
  from those which we possessed before.            But the tables of the sun
  constitute the foundation of all our calculations : they cannot be
  too frequently verified.     It is particularly the duty of the members
  of the Board of Longitude to attend to this verification.            It was
  on this account that M. Burckhardt has undertaken a still more
  laborious investigation of the tables of the moon, in order to ob
                                                 '
  tain meliorations of the same kind.              The very minuteness of
  these corrections is a most satisfactory proof of the singular per
  fection which astronomical observations and calculations have
  reached.

  in Greece of two Danish Gentlemen, Messrs. Koes and Bronsted.
  They were at one period the fellow travellers of our countryman
  Mr. Cockerill.        M. Bronsted undertook in J 812 to dig into
  the ruins of Cathaia in the island of Zea, near Attica.             He ob

  a torso of a colossal statue of Apollo Musagetes : the trunk of a
  horse, and several interesting inscriptions which were engraved
  on the pilasters of the temple.         These inscriptions contain trea
  ties of peace or alliance, written in the Doric language, with the

upon the sites of the four ancient cities of the island, are the
property of M. Bronsted, who is well qualified to decypher them.
    M. Bronsted in returning stopped at the island of Ithaca, so
much celebrated by the father of Ionian poetry: on passing by
Leucadia to Prevesa, he became acquainted with Ali Pacha, an
old governor, full of energy and of a remarkable character.       He
traversed Albania, and was detained at Corfu by contrary winds.
Here he found that abundance of medals had been obtained in
consequence of the excavations ordered by General Dauzelot,
                         RUINS OF FOMPBH,
    We translate from L'ltulico, a valnable periodical work pub-
lished in the Italian language in London, and conducted by the
learned Dr. Augusto Bozzi Granville, the following account of
an excavation made among the ruins of Pompeii on the 18th
of March IS 13. It is drawn up by an eye witness, and addressed
in the form of a letter to Dr. Granville,
    "They have commenced the execution of a great project
here, viz. the clearing of the whole of the walls which sui>
round Pompeii, and which are supposed to be about 1600 or
 1700 toises in circumference.     Great advantages will of course
be derived in future excavations from the denudation of the walls.
The streets which lead from the various gates will be more easily
found, while there. will be a greater facility in transporting the
ashes and earth, and a guard may then be placed over the mo
numents to prevent dilapidations.
    " The walls of this city are real fortifications: they are from
 18 to 20 feet in height, and in some places higher : they are for
tified at intervals with a kind of quadrangular towers partly
destroyed ; and they do not seem to have much exceeded the
height of the wall.    They are furnished with small gates, which
seem    to have  answered   the same purpose with those in mor
dern fortresses.    Certain it is that two of these already discor
vered were used by the brave inhabitants of Pompeii in their
sorties against the troops of Sylla.
    " The walls are twelve feet broad : they are ornamented, both
on the side, towards the city and towards the country^ with para
pets, which probably served in time of war as a security to the
soldiery, and in peace as a promenade for the inhabitants.      The
parapets are furnished with loop-holes pretty close to each other,
and with scuppers to carry off the water : — in several places
there are flights of steps leading up from the city.
    c< The walls are not
                           uniform, in consequence of the injuries
they have sustained at various periods ; they are mostly built of
masses of fine stone four feet broad by five long; and two in
                                                          thickness,

thickness, without lime, and yet well joined together, but so ir
regularly that the architecture is of the kind denominated incer-
tnm. If we are to believe that these are restorations made in the
last days of the city, about the time of the siege of Sylla, and
the earthquake A. D. 63, then the upper part of this description
of architecture and the lower will be found to be more regular.
Among a great number of these stones there' was a monogram
formed of an H and an E : on another a resemblance to the
Greek L or cross formed of two Zs, similar to what we see upon
paintings of ancient vases and in the monograms of medals.
These probablv were the characteristic marks of those who fur
nished the materials, while the Greek and Roman names which
are so frequently met with, may have been those of the work
men, who probably did not think they would have been handed
down to so late posterity.
   Among the works on coins and medals which enrich the Ca
binet of Medals at Milan, there is a work in Chinese, published
in 1750 by order of Kien Long.      It contains designs of upwards
of 900 antique vases which strongly resemble the Etruscan, and
they are of a very remote asra.
   The Austrian Government has recently directed its particular
attention to the diffusion of the' means of education in Hungary.
As the inhabitants of this kingdom speak four or five different
languages, and their manners and religion are also different ;
three large schools have been founded, at which teachers will in
future be educated, who will afterwards spread themselves over
 Hungary. These schools have been established at St. Andre,
 Pest, and Arad. Every branch of education necessary for the pre
sent state of European civilization will be taught at these semi
naries, and the learning requisite far the Greek, Wallachian, and
 Ulyrian churches.
   A late number of a Journal entitled Mines d' Orient, published
at Vienna by M. de Hammer, gives an extract from a curious
letter respecting Arabian horses written by Dr. Seetzen, and
dated Moka, 14th of November 1810.            The writer maintains
 that these animals are much less numerous than has generally
been supposed, and he mentions 5,500 as being the whole num
ber of horses in all Arabia.      He also combats the opinion ge
nerally entertained  in  Europe, respecting the beauty and good
 qualities of the Arabian breed of horses.

  The work will embrace a vast number of original anecdotes of
  the most celebrated characters of Europe and America during the
  last sixty years.   It will be, particularly interesting to artists and
 students of art, not only for the development of the principle*
 which the president has followed in his long and splendid career,
 but for his critical opinions on the remains of ancient sculpture
 and the great paintings in France and Italy.           Mr. Gait, having
 himself visited many of the finest collections both in this country
 and abroad, will interweave in the narrative the observations of
 ingenious men, whom he has met with in the course of his tra
 vels.     No work equally comprehensive, relative to the moral
 utility of the fine arts, and their actual state in the world at this
 time, has yet appeared.       It will, besides, be as minute in the bio
 graphical   details as if it had  been executed by Mr. West himself.
     Mr. Thelwall is preparing for the press, a Report of the re
 sults of his experience in the Treatment of Cases of Imperfection
 of the Roof of the Mouth, Uvula and Velum Palati, and other
 defects and malconformations of the Elocutionary Organs.           Cases
of this description, the author observes, have hitherto been re
garded both by medical men and teachers of elocution, as totally
incapable of relief : and though some ingenious dentists have
attempted to supply the deficiences by artificial organs ; these, it
is asserted, have not only been found very imperfectly to answer
the purposes of speech and intonation, but at the same time, in
a considerable degree, to be both inconvenient and dangerous.
 Mr. T. maintains that in every one of the cases which have been
submitted to his management, — the details of which will form
the bulk of this little volume, — he had been completely successful,
without any application of artificial apparatus, not only in pro
ducing a perfect intelligibility of utterance, but also in removing
the offensive peculiarities of voice resulting from such malcon
formations.     To this will be subjoined, Reports of several Cases
of Amentia, or tardy and imperfect development of the faculties.
A considerable portion of this volume was intended to have ap
peared in a pamphlet announced about this time last year, in
reply to the assertion of the Monthly Review, that Mr. T's pre
tended discoveries were nothing more than the most exploded of
poetical errors.     Professional engagements having prevented at
that time the prosecution of that work, the materials are now
thrown into another form ; and it may be interesting to inquire
what connection there can possibly be between discoveries or
principles by which such effects are to be produced, and any de
scription of poetical errors exploded, or unexploded.
    The work will be addressed to Mr. Cline, by whom several of
the cases to be detailed have been referred to the Author's ma
nagement.

According to his analysis, it is a compound of carbonate of lime

of the mineral arragonite discovered by professor Strbmeger.

ment to the works of Winckeltnan and M. Leroux d'Agincourt.
The work will be divided into six books.        The first will relate to
the origin of the art.      The second will contain tha history of
those temples, ancient and modern, which are distinguished by
ornaments of sculpture.       And in the four subsequent the author
will give the history of sculpture properly so called, divided into
five periods : 1st, from Nicolo Pisano to Uonatello ; 2d, from Do-

  NEW ZEALAND FLAX CULTIVATED WITH SUCCESS IN FRANCE.
    In a letter from M. Faujas St. Fond to M. Thouin, inserted in
 the Annates du Museum d' HUtoire Naturelle, he announces
 that the Phormium ienax, or New Zealand flax, which had hi
 therto never flowered in Europe, had given out flowers in the
 garden of M. Freycinet, the father of two officers who were in
 Capt. Baudia's expedition.
    "  The Phormium ienax," M. Faujas St. Fond adds,               " was
 cultivated in the garden of M. Freycinet and in my own.             We
 took care   to cover it in winter ; but as we were at first anxious
 to multiply our plants, we cut off shoots every year, which greatly
 impoverished the principal plants, and of course interrupted their
 flowering. At length, when we became anxious to see them flower,
 we reserved about a tenth, and left them to themselves.
    "  These plants soon increased prodigiously, and on the 10th of
 May (1813) M. Freycinet informed me that a very vigorous
 flower-stalk was shooting out from the centre of one of his
 strongest plants.      Seven days afterwards this stalk was three
 feet high : on the 31st it was five feet six inches, and on the
  7th of June six feet ten inches.  On the 14 th, its term of greatest

increase, it was seven feet six lines ; the stalk was then three
inches and four lines in circumference at the base, and two inches
and a half half way up.      The flowers to the number of a hundred
and nine are borne upon alternate peduncles, and have a pleasing
effect.    The colour of the flower is a greenish yellow, that of
the stamina a golden yellow.
    " I intend to make a drawing of the plant, in order that it
may be compared with the figure published by Foster in Capt.
 Cook's Second Voyage.         I have made some very strong ropes
with the leaves, from which I obtained the flax by a very simple
process.     I shall send these ropes to the Museum of Natural
History."

For the Relief of the ruptured Poor throughout the Kingdom.
    We give publicity to the following official statement respect
ing this useful and extensive charity with great pleasure. From
the great number of persons among the labouring poor who
tvere afflicted with hernia, and for whose relief no adequate
provision existed, on the 14th of October 1 807 Dr. Squire, Dr.
Herdman, John Taunton, the Rev. H. G. Watkins, James Hor-
wood, Michael Bartlett, Joseph Atkinson, John Middleton,
John Gardner, and John Whitford, met at the City Dispensary,
and formed themselves into a Society " for the Relief of the
ruptured Poor throughout the Kingdom, the Cityof London Truss
Society."
    From this very humble beginning, the Society has increased
in its means by the exertions of a few individuals, and is now
extending    relief to nearly 2,000 patients annually.
    The following account of herniary cases, and their varieties,
must be interesting to the philosophical as well as medical
reader.
   The great facility of obtaining trusses, and the liberality of
the Committee in allowing Governors to recommend patients for
relief, the expense of which often exceeds the amount of their
subscriptions ten-fold, have contributed in no small degree to
the extension of its benefits, whilst the strict oeeonomy observed
in its expenditure has enabled them to meet the demands with
hut a trifling defalcation.      *
   The little extra expense and the statement of accounts are
perhaps unparalleled.       The whole subscriptions from the com
mencement of the Society, which are brought into one view,
will enable a liberal public to judge at once of the correctness
with which its benevolence is applied.
   The following statement of the situation and occurrence of
hernia, at different periods of life, has been extracted from the

    March     15  to 26. — The frosty and winterlike weather with
 snow showers and easterly winds continued till the 2Uth, when
 signs of a change appeared.          From this time the air got con
 tinually warmer, features of cirrocumulus again ornamented the
 sky, and foreboded the return of spring.             The great change of
 temperature about the 23d, the fine warm air and south-west
 wind of that day with beautiful forms of the cirrocumulus, the
 opening of crocus and other spring flowers, and the singing of
 the birds, and busy appearance of rooks constructing their nests ;
 were circumstances so rapidly supervening on a long protracted
 and unseasonable frost, as to have a very pleasing effect, and to
 put one in mind of the sudden return of spring in the northern
 countries of the continent.        We had a fine warm shower in the
 evening of the 26th.

 beautiful features of cirrocumulus and cumulus.

LXIX.       Improvement in the Axis of large Water-Wheels,. to
    prevent the Gudgeon from getting loose in the Shaft, or to
     repair it when damaged.              By Mr. Robbrt Hughes, of
     Ruabon, Denbighshire*. ,
Sir, —    I  beg  leave to observe to you, that lirom the common
mode in which the gudgeons, for cranes or water-wheels, are
now fixed, they are liable to heat in working', and soon become
loose ; and by attempting to secure them with wedges, the shaft
gets split, injured, and rendered useless.
     To obviate such inconveniences, and even to repair an injured
shaft, I have invented and practised a plan, which has perfectly
succeeded, and of which I have sent a model to the Society.
     Upon this plan, more firmness and security is given, without
weakening the shaft by the deep mortices usually cut therein for
fixing the gudgeons.         My invention is also cheaper than the old
method, in which the hoops alone cost about four guineas, and
the cast-iron gudgeon il. 12s.; whereas on my plan the expense
of the whole will only be 41. 16s. If necessary, I will furnish cer
tificates from persons who have made trial of my invention.
                         I am, sir,
                                 Your humble servant,

     On the 14th of June, 1811, Robert Hughes, of Ruabon, in
structed me in making a cast -hoop gudgeon, for a tumbling shaft
of a large and powerful water-wheel for grinding clay for bricks,
tiles, &c. which I have found to be a great improvement, as
witness my hand this 3d day of October 1812.
    Trefynant, Ruabon, Denbighshire.                     THOMAS EVANS.
     This is to certify, that Robert Hughes, of Ruabon, formed a
new construction of gudgeons, for the shaft of a water-wheel he
built for me, in the year 1 806, which wheel is 28 feet diameter.
These gudgeons took in the whole body of the shaft, and wedged
the outside.       I have not been put to any expense since the
making thereof, nor am likely so to be until the shaft decays by
time.      In short, I cannot speak too much in his praise, with re
gard to his ingenuity and workmanship.                 Witness my hand, at
the Pant Mill, August 20, 1812.

322       Improvement on the         Axis of large Water-Wheels.
   The wood shaft of a water-wheel, 18 feet diameter, was se
worn and decayed at one end, by frequent putting in and wedging
of the gudgeon, as to render a repetition of that process im
practicable.   Robert Hughes, in this difficulty, contrived a cast-
iron gudgeon, with a hoop to     which inclosed the end of the
                                          it,
shaft;     was put on and fastened, and has worked steadily ever
since.    I it
           am informed, that he puts the hoop gudgeon now on
new shafts, and      seems to me a great improvement upon the
                        it
gudgeons formerly in use.

    The ordinary method of fixing gudgeons into wooden shafts,                    is
 to have an iron cross, formed on the end of the gudgeon, which
is  let into the wood, to     a     considerable depth, and    is    held fast    by
 small wedges, driven in round             it, hoops being fitted round the
outside of the shaft, to prevent the wedges splitting it.                     The
 defects of this method are, that the shaft           is   much weakened,         by
 the cutting into       it
                         ;    and the constant strain of       a    heavy wheel,
 always acting      in  different    directions,   causes   the  wedges to be
come loose, and at length fall out              ;the failure of the gudgeon       is
frequently attended with more serious damage, for the wheel
falling upon the hottom of the race, generally breaks the nm and
buckets       byits own weight.                                          '
    The improvement made             by    Mr. Hughes, consists     in   applying
a  cast-iron     box   to  the   end  of the  shaft, and to this the iron cross
of the gudgeon      is    screwed, so as to fasten   it    more firmly than       by
the old method, and without weakening the wood by cutting                         it
away.      AA, fig.     1,   of Plate V. represents portion of the end of

the wooden shaft, which         is      of an octagonal form, and has the
water-wheel fixed upon        it;    it   is long enough to reach across the
pit, in which the wheel works, and having                  a   gudgeon at each
end,  is is supported and revolves upon them in proper bearings.
BB        the cast-iron box, fitted fast upon the end of the shaft,
and being wedged tight, preserves the wood from splitting as
effectually as any hoops can do upon the end of the box
                                          ;                                  is  a
projecting flanch,        aa,   and   in   the  face  of  this  four  gjooves   or
notches are made, for the reception of the arms of the iron cross
bb, dd, which      is   part of the gudgeon C,. on which the shaft re
volves;    this cross    is    firmly attached to the box,         by four screw
bolts, which pass through the flanch, and also through the ends
of the arms of the cross, having nuts screwed on the outside to
                                                                           make

BB, separated, to explain the manner of fitting them together,
the inside face of the cross having projections ee, which enter
the end of the box, and keep the pivot in its true centre : thus
the bolts have only to hold the gudgeons fast on the end of the
box, the principal strain being taken off by this manner of fitting
the cross into the box.
   When the gudgeon of a wheel, fitted on this plan, becomes
worn out, so as to require a new one, it can be removed, by
taking off the four nuts, and a new one applied.
   The cross and gudgeon, being of small dimensions, admit of
its cylindrical part C being very conveniently turned in the
lathe.
LXX.     Description of a Carriage-Wheel Guard, by which
   the  Wheel is returned safe upon the Axis in case of the
   Linch-pin coming out.         By Mr. John Padbury, of Speen-
   hamland*.
Sir, — From      a conviction of the good wishes which the Society,
for which you act as Secretary, ever feel for ingenuity, in its va
rious branches, I am induced to lay before you a plan of my in
vention, for the more effectually giving safety to the wheels of
carriages, to prevent their breaking, or to avoid any mischief
from loss of that very considerable support, the Linch-pin, on
the dependence of which the lives and limbs of so many are con
tinually exposed.
    The plan I now offer for the investigation of the Society, is
calculated to obviate the danger which may arise from such an
accident ; the great repute it has obtained, and the almost ge
neral application of it by the coach proprietors of the Bath and
other roads, together with the prevention of many accidents
since its adoption, will, I flatter myself, plead a sufficient apology
for my offering it to your notice.
                    I am, sir,                      , ,
                               Your obedient humble servant,

   Reference to the Engraving      of Mr. John Padbury's Guard for
      a Carriage-Wheel, by which the Wheel is retained safe upon
      the Axle, in case of the Linch-pin coming out. Plate V.fig. 4,5.
      This contrivance can be applied to any carriage, as it does not
  require any part of the carriage, or axle-tree, to be altered,
  further than the addition of an extra iron hoop upon the inner
  end of the nave of the wheel.
      This is fully explained by figs. 4 and 5, Plate V, the former
  being a section, lengthways, of the axletree, and the latter a
  transverse section ; AA represents the iron axletree of a carriage,
  bolted beneath the wooden bed BB, or frame, of the carriage ;
  CC is the wheel ; DD its nave, the axletree box dd being fitted
  through the centre of it as usual ; a is the linch-pin, passing
  through a mortice in the end of the axletree ; EE is a circular
 box, fastened to the bed BB of the carriage, and surrounding the
 inner end of the nave of the wheel, to prevent dirt from getting
 into the axletree ; the extra hoop, before mentioned, which is
 fixed on the end of the nave, is contained within this box, and
 runs round without touching it ; it consists of a strong hoop bb,
 fixed fast upon the nave, and having a flat circular ring, formed
 out of the same piece with it: the latter, when fixed, makes a
 circular projecting rim, upon the end of the nave, as the figure
 plainly shows.       •
     The same clasp band F, which, by means of two nuts beneath,
 fastens the axletree AA to the bed of the carriage, also fastens
 down a piece of iron G, upon the bed B ; in the extremity of
 this piece of iron is a hole for the reception of a screw e, the
point of which enters within the box EE, and comes before the
projecting ring bb, so as to effectually prevent the wheel from
 coming-off its axle, even if the linch-pin should by accident drop
 out : the point of the pin e is so situated as not to come in con
tact with the plate bb, when the linch-pin is in its place; there
fore it occasions no friction to retard the motion of the carriage.
    When it is required to take off the wheel, for the purpose of
repairs, or for greasing the axletree, the screw e is taken out,
and the linch-pin being removed, the wheel can be taken off.
    In the xxviith volume of the Society's Transactions, at p. 147,
will be found a description of an invention, by Mr. J. Varty, of
                                                           Liverpool,

Liverpool, to be applied to the linch-pin of a carriage, to prevent
the wheel coming off its axle, if the linch-pin should drop out ;
this contrivance being wholly applied at the extremity of the
axletree, close to the linch-pin, it may be used in combination
with Mr. Padbury's invention, and would then render a carriage
so secure that it would be scarcely possible for the wheel to come
off, by any accident short of the breaking of the axletree: and
even then there would be a chance of the wheel being retained,
in the circular box EE, by the point of the screw e, so as to
sustain the carriage from falling, unjil the horses could be stopped.

 [P. 275]    a soft Coal, generally of five yards thick, the next a hard
       Coal, mostly of two yards thick, and the lower one is usually
       three quarters of a yard thick. . Clunch or fire Clay occurs
       under each of these three Coals, as usual (Rep. i. 179 and
        446 and P. M. xliii. p. 28), and Shale, Bind and Gritstone
        beds on and between them ; altogether these Coal-measures
   .'   seem about 150 yards thick : below the three-quarter se,am,
        there is a thickness — perhaps 40yards, of barren Coal-mea
        sures, in which, although the appearances are very pro
        mising and have induced several trials, seams of sufficient
        tbickness to work, are rarely met with.        Below this occur
        what I have denominated the Floor Rocks of the Anglesea
        Coal-trough, (vol. xlii. p. 356 and 360) and seem together
        to be about 90 yards thick, consisting of a variably and very
        coarse Gritstone with Jasper fragments in it occasionally;
        below which is a gray Limestone Rock (very cherty and bad
        in quality in Llanfihangel) ; then the middle coarse Gritstone
        Rock, often containing huge massesof Chert (as Graig-fawr,
        vol. xliii. p. 126) and Jasper fragments, coaly masses, &c.
        Below this the black Limestone or (Kilkenny) Marble Rock
        in thin beds, occurs; and then the lower variously coarse Grit
        Rock, graduating locally into Conglomerate, see my Note on
        p. 202; and then the coarse Slate succeeds. Both the Lime
        stone Rocks above mentioned, are 1 believe included in the
         Halkin or highest of the three Limestone Rocks mentioned,
        vol. xlii. p. 53, 59, &c.; in which case, they would with more
        propriety perhaps be called four Rocks of Limestone, that
        surround, and basset on more than three sides of the slaty
         mountains of Wales. And, if these are classed with the four
         Limestones of the Peak of Derbyshire, what very anomalous
        substances must we not admit, in the places of its three
         Toadstones ?.

     for publication, by Mr. J. Cary, some years ago, whereon the

     are 75f. 7in. 114f. 6in. 48f. Oin. and 212f. Oin; to which

     made under Mr. Brown's direction in 1810, contained in
     Mr. Rennie's printed Letter of the 26th of October 1810, on
     the intended " High- Peak Junction Canal," that the further
     rises of 129f. Oin. and 189f. 9m. attain the summit level of
     this proposed Canal, which passing from near Malcalf

     is between Lords-Seat and Kinder Scout) emerges again
     at Dale.end in Ecal Valley on the S side of Kinder Scout

       the Clee-Hills on its Coal-field (and the Rowley Hills also
       on another Coal-field, which circumstance Mr. B. has over
       looked) ; and in assimilating these Basalts with the coarse
       Slate of Charnwood Forest (as I have done, Rep. i. 155),

   ^[ Several months after this was written, my friend Mr. Benjamin Bevan
(in April 1814) informed roe, that he had obtained Sections of the strata
in the Bedworth Coal-"field, and had certainly ascertained, that the regularly
stratified Red Marl and imbedded Basalt or Greenstone, &c. are laid un
conformable/ over the dipping Coal.measures,   in this case; in Somersetshire
the same was long ago asserted by Mr. John Strachey, in No. 360 and
No. 391 of the Philosophical Transactions; but after many conversations
with Mr. Smith and others, on the facts of the Somersetshire Coal.field,
and very anxious inquiries, as to the correctness of Mr. Strachey's state
ments, I   never could obtain satisfaction, as to the Red Marl, &c. being
regular and undisturbed, which had been proved by sinking through         it,to
overlie the Coal.measures in an unconformable manner: and therefore         I
have always doubted the correctness of a fact, so very contrary to my own
observations, and that of hundreds of others,    so many other situations, and
                                                 in

       shire, it would have had a far more minute examination, and
       I should have been able to speak rather positively, as to
       what thick Rocks would be seen in ascending any particular
       Brook (except perhaps in some Coal-districts,) here I can
       not be equally confident.        In page 158, vol. i. of my Re
       port, I have mentioned the appearances, as justifying the
       inference, that the Grace-Dieu limestone rock passes under
       the Forest Slate: and when I now recollect, the confidence
       with which Mr. B., from Theory only, has asserted, in his
       Note on page 266 (see my Note thereon), that similar dis
       coveries of lower strata might be made, by ascending the
       ravines in the North Eastern Moorlands of Yorkshire, he must
       excuse me for continuing to think, that he is not less mistaken
       as to the Grace-Dieu ravine, until I shall happen to have
       the opportunity of examining the spot more minutely, or of

   5f This remarkable Limestone Rock (see top of Mr. B's page 16), from
its pozolanic property, the fossil Bones and flat scaly Fish, the Pentacrinus,
&c. &c. that it contams, seems to me, from the translation of M. Cuvier's
Geology, p. 260, to enter the Coast of France at the mouth of the Seine,
and to paSS inland by a circuitous route westward, to Alencon in the depart
ment of Orne, and perhaps in the dep. of the Mayne and Loire, &c.      If I am
right in these conjectures, the fine Bath Oolite near Caen in the departmeut
of Calvados, whence it is said that Henry the Seventh's Chapel in Westminster
was built, prohably occupies the tops of the hills (unless a depression or
trough occurs there ?) as it does to the E and SE of Bath, (see my 2d Note
on page 167); the Bridge in which last City, stands on the eastern edge of
the ring of Lias, that surrounds another of Red Marl, including and over-
iieing a small denudated Coal.field, occurring between Bath and Keynsham.

[P.287] the forest" from the Canal or Water-level belonging to
     the Leicester Navigation (in the cutting of which, nodules
     of Lead Ore were found, as mentioned in his Note on the
     preceding page) I am at a loss to conjecture ; when they
     are more properly on the same side, and the general direc
     tion of this crooked Canal points for Barrow on Soar.
     Without doubt, I think, the Lias strata, on Red Marl, once
     overlaid the whole of Chamwood Forest (but not any of the
     Limestones of Derbyshire) before the Denudation thereof,
     (P. M. xxxvii. p. 442) ; and it is perhaps equally probable,
     that the holders of Lead Ore mentioned, may be moved
     from the edges of the Lias strata, or some others further east
     ward, and lodged in the Gravel on the Forest, as that they
     are the produce of thin and perhaps unconnected veins of
     Lead Ore, in the coarse Slate, of the spots where they are
     found.     Spars of any kind, are rarely found, in many of the
     Lead Mines in Cardiganshire, owing to which, the discovery
     and tracing of Veins there, is far more difficult than in the
     Peaks of Derbyshire.

        November 1809: an abstract of all the most generally use

        of the Board for the year 1810 was closed, by a long Speech
      , from the President Sir John Sinclair, .which was soon after
        printed and circulated. In this Speech, a general review was,

         commencement, progress or conclusion, of any part of the
        labours intrusted to them by the Government and the Coun

     B. has not in his work, taken more notice of the fact, that
     in many Coal-measure and other Rocks, of Gritstone in
     particular, certain beds, are uniformly crossed at                 high      a
     angle            by

     beds in the same quarry, the stratula will sometimes be found
     inclined at different angles, and sometimes in contrary                           di
     rections, from those in other Beds.            Writers seem to have
    been little acquainted with this phaenomenon, (Mont. Mag.
     xxxiii. p. 517, P. M. xxxviii. p. 357, &c.) and many er
     roneous descriptions of the dips of strata have been given
     in consequence. Mr. Townsend supposed, when he saw the
    stratula of a thick bed of Rock near, Bath, that an enormous
     convulsion had happened,                   by
                                             which the strata were first
    tilted almost to an angle of 46°, and then their top edges
     (and he tells us nothing of their bottom edges) were swept
    or worn off to an exact plane, and that after this, other strata
     were horizontally deposited upon them Such,                am inclined
     to think, have in many instances been, the " unconform

   Postscript. — I beg to mention, before I close these Notes, that
it appears by a Letter of the 29th of April 1814, from Mr. Elias
Hall, of Castleton, to Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., which he did me
the honour to show me, that in the present Spring Mr. Hall has
extended his survey northward from the Peak of Derbyshire,
and made a Model, (see P. M. xlii. p. 1 13) of the Strata of the
Grand Ridge, and the adjacent country east and west of           it,
                                                                al
most   as far as Westmorland   ; and that he finds Pennigant Hill,
N   of Settle in Yorkshire, to be capped with the 2d Grit Rock,
and to have'   a basis of 1st Limestone.
    More than ten years ago, learned from Mr. Wm. Smith, that
                              I
Whernside hill, about 6j miles NW of Pennigant, was capped
with Coal-measures (although esteemed there, to be the highest
hill  inEngland) and this latter circumstance
                   ;                               was, as well as
                                                  it

                                   by
or his Geological Work, of his favourite position; viz. that the

conclusions, as I have done in my three Letters and Notes on
Mr. B's Work, in this and the previous volume of the Phil. Mag.
   Mr. Hall's observations seem to me to render it now almost         1
certain, that Mr. B. has mistaken the 1st Limestone Rock for
the 4th, as I have often before hinted, and the result seems an
important one ; viz. that the Slate of Ingleborough (see vol. xlii.
p. 59 and 170) must probably be referred to the same stratum
as the 1st Toads tone of Derbyshire! instead of a stratum under
the 4th Limestone, as Mr. B. has contended.      How far this new
suggestion, of which I have recently added a hint, in my Note
on page 275, may be correct, and its influence may extend to
wards the explanation of the real structure of the British Isles,
I shall be industrious to inquire, and shall gladly receive the
facts or suggestions that your Correspondents may be able to

LXXII.    Facts and Observations towards a History of the Com
  binations of the yellow Oxide of Lead loith the Nitric and
  Nitrous Acids.    By M. Chevreul.
                        [Continued    from p. 270 ]
                 Analysis   of the Nitrites of Lead.
30.   JThe nitrite of  lead, when exposed to the sun for several
days, retains some water, as we may see on heating it in a long
close glass tube: that which has been exposed in a retort at the
heat of boiling water, until no more humidity is extricated, loses
a portion of acid.
   100 parts of nitrite which had been exposed to the sun, lost
by heat from 19.5 to 20 of acid and water.
   31. As the acid of the nitrite begins to be extricated from it
at the temperature which is necessary to separate the water
from  it,
        I  preferred analysing  a nitrite which could retain water,
rather than trouble myself to analyse one which might have
lost acid:  1 think therefore that the salt which was used in the
following analysis retained   alittle water.      had been dried in
                                                   It
the sand-bath with great care.        Ityielded .
              Acid                        18.15    100
                Oxide                      81.85        450
                                  -   Y3                        As

342       On the Combinations    of the yellow Oxide of Lead
    As it may reasonably be supposed that a little acid might
have been volatilized when the nitrite was. dried, I distilled a
certain quantity of this salt dried in the sun, in a small retort
communicating with a tube filled with muriate of lime : the re
sult was conformable to that of the preceding analysis : deducting
the water only, the quantity of base was a little more than in
this analysis.
     32. 100 parts of sub nitrite which had been exposed to the
sun, and at a temperature of 100° (centigrade), lost by heat 10.5
of acid and water.       The same salt dried in the sand-bath with
great care yielded Acid              •           9*9      100
                      Oxide                     901       910
     33. The analysis of nitrites of lead proves that in the sub-
nitrite the base is double that of the nitrite ; for, if we multiply
by two 450, which is the quantity of oxide found in the nitrite,
we have 900 : and in the analysis of the subnitrite we found 910.
     34. In the sulphites and alkaline nitrites we know that the
base is in the same proportion with the radical of the acid, as
in the sulphates and the nitrates of the same bases ; so that if we
take away, for example, from the sulphate and nitrate of potash,
 the quantity of oxygen which forms the difference between the
sulphuric and the sulphurous acid, and between the nitr/c and
 the nitrous acid, we ought to have sulphite and nitrite at the
 same degree of saturation with the salts from which they pro
 ceed. The same appears to be the case with the nitrate and
 nitrite of lead.    We may judge of this if we convert the acid
 of the nitrate into nitrous acid. According to M. G. Lussac,
  100 parts of nitric acid contained 88.203 of nitrous acid.        If
 what we have said be exact, the nitrite ought to be formed of
                Acid                    8S.203     17.85
                Oxide                 406.000      82.15
                                       494.203"  TOO.OOO
     Now    if we compare this proportion with that found by
 analysis, we shall see that the difference is only 30 centiemes of
 one part in a hundred.
      35. I wished to know if there was a nitrite of lead corre
  sponding to the acid nitrate ; and I thought that, if this salt ex
 isted, I ought to fmd it in the solution of nitrites precipitated
 by the carbonic acid ; for I have said a little higher, that this
  liquor contained oxide of lead and nitrous acid in excess : I cal
  culated in the first place the proportion, and I found that it must
  be formed, supposing that it existed, of
                Acid                     88.203      30.3

                    with the Nitric and Niti.ous Acids.                343
     36.   I dissolved in water    five  grammes of subnitrite     of lead,
 containing

                                                 5.0000
     I  passed a current of carbonic acid into the solution, and ,1
separated 3. 18 gr. of oxide in the state of carbonate* : there re
mained therefore in the liquor 1.2950 gr. of oxide, and 0.4917
 gr. of acid, or
                    Acid                              27.52
                     Base                             72.48
Which differs by 2.?8 from the determination made by calcu
lation.
     37. The solution precipitated by the carbonic acid was con
 centrated, and there was an extrication of nitrous acid ; and
 upon cooling, yellow leafy crystals of nitrite were deposited.
The mother-water several times concentrated gave leafy nitrite
to the lastf.
     38. In order to determine what was the decomposition which
the nitrite of lead would undergo by the carbonic acid, I took
five grammes of nitrite (coming from the subnitrite) which con
tained
                       Acid                        0.887

    t set aside a portion of this mother-water, with a view to ascertain

would not contain more acid than those obtained by concentration and

344     On the Combinations        of I he yellow Oxide of Lead
which differs by 2*11 from the determination made by the calcu
lation*. The solution of nitrite separated from the carbonate,
and afterwards concentrated, acted like that of the subnitrite ; it
gave out nitrous acid, and yielded crystals of nitrite.
    39. It follows from these facts: 1st, that the nitrite and the sub-
nitrite are partly decomposed by the carbonic acid, because the
affinity and the quantity of the nitrous acid are insufficient to
overcome the whole of the tendency which the carbomc acid has
to form an insoluble combination with the oxide of lead ; but the
instant there is a certain quantity of nitrous acid set free the
decomposition stops, because this acid is much more soluble than
 the'carbonic : 2dly, that the nitrous acid of a solution of nitrite,
 when passed to the carbonic acid, seems to be to the oxide which
 is not precipitated from it in a proportion corresponding to that
 of the elements of the acid nitrate of lead : 3dly, that the affi
 nity of the nitrous acid set free for the nitrite is not great, since
 by concentration and crystallization we obtain nitrite only :
 4thly, that, the nitrous acid set free being very capable of sepa
 ration from the nitrite, it is possible to decompose a given quan
 tity of nitrite by the carbonic acid.
     40. I shall conclude this memoir with an examination of the
 nitrite of lead prepared by M. Proust's process.          I have said a
 little higher, that when we wished to prepare this salt, and
 when we boiled too long the acid nitrate of lead over this metal,
 we obtained a nitrite which contained subnitrite, or more base
 than the nitrite f.   In order to avoid the production of the sub
 nitrite, I made several experiments with a view to ascertain if
 each of them would give me a homogeneous and identical pro
 duct.    I obtained two varieties of yellow crystals, one in com
 pact leaves, the other in flexible scales.    These crystals being of
the same species,    I confounded them together.            I   regarded them
in stars. I    thought at first that they were acid, because they reddened
turnsole paper; but, having pressed and dried them, they gave a solution
which reddened at first turnsole paper slightly, but soon became blue again.
I  had not enough of these crystals to ascertain by analysis their quantity
of base. The solution yielded yellow needles.
    * In an experiment similar to the latter, I obtained
                          Acid                        30.7
                         Base                         69 3 which is ostensibly
 the same with that of the calculation : but what prevents me from having
 as much confidence in it as in the foregoing,    is, that the nitrite employed
 had been crystallized twice, and that it  seemed to coutain a little subnitrite,
 or more base than the nitrite.
    f  This salt
               is   of a redder colour than the nitrite.     When we dissolve  it
 in  boiling water, we obtain yellow and orange crystals, which contain much
 more base than the iiiti ite, and less than the subnitrite.

  bable, as they presented to the eye all the characters of a homo
  geneous substance, and as they were formed in the midst of a
  great mass of liquid ; but ulter'or experiments convinced me
  that this salt was formed of nitrite and nitrate, and that it was
  a kind of double salt with two acids.           I was led to this singular
  result by the decomposition which the carbonic acid made it
  undergo.
      41. In order to show more evidently the difference of these
  crystals from the nitrite coming from the subnitrite, I shall sup
  pose them formed of Nitrous acid                     0-887 gr.

       I passed into the solution     of  these  five grammes a stream of
  carbonic acid, and I separated from it 2.20 gr. of oxide : there
  remained therefore in the liquor 1 .80 gr. of base and 0.887 of
  acid : this report gives for 100,
                        Acid                       S3.02
                        Base                       66.98
       In this experiment the salt had been dissolved in nine decilitres
  of water. In another I put the same salt in powder in three de
   cilitres of water, and obtained by the carbonic acid 2.21 gr.
   of base.     (I had made this experiment with a view to ascertain
   if the quantity of water had any influence on the quantity of
   oxide precipitated.)       A third and fourth experiment gave me
   2.20 gr. and 2.23. They concur therefore perfectly in proving
   that the carbonic acid separates more base from the nitrite pre
   pared with the acid nitrate of lead and the metal than from
   that obtained from the subnitrite.
       42. The solution precipitated by the carbonic acid evaporated,
   gave off nitrous acid, and deposited upon cooling yellowish white
   scales : the mother-water         of these scales, concentrated, gave
   small white needles ; and the mother-water of these needles,
   spontaneously evaporated, yellow crystals resembling by their
  form the acid nitrate of lead. Now as the nitrite coming from
   the subnitrite only gives, when we decompose it by the carbonic
   acid, yellow nitrite and nitrous acid, and not white salt, we must
   conclude that the nitrite prepared by M. Proust's process differs
   from it in its composition.
        43. I examined in the first place the white needles, and after
    having crystallized      them several times I found them similar
       * The proportion of the base had been determined hy experiment, and the
    water and the acid had been calculated fK>m the analysis of the nitrite

                                                                            to

  to the nitrate of lead * ; for they did not colour water ; they
  did not give out nitrous acid when boiled in nitric acid :
  they did not give nitrite or subnitrite when boiled in water with
  oxide of lead; they were reduced by the carbonic acid into car
 bonate and into acid nitrate of lead.
     44. The yellowish white scales rcdissolved in boiling water
 gave yellow leaves, and a mother-water not highly coloured,
 which gave white needles of nitrate of lead mixed with a little
 nitrite. The yellow leaves still retained some nitrate.         It was
 evident that these scales were a combination of nitrite and ni
 trate of lead.
     45. The yellow crystals resembling in form the acid nitrate
 of lead, redissolved in boiling water, deposited small needles and
 small leaves of nitrate of lead ; the mother-water          which re
 mained was acid and slightly coloured.           The composition of
 these crystals is analogous therefore to that of the scales, but they
 differ in so far as they contain more nitrate : it is not impro
 bable that they contain acid nitrate : the nitrate of lead which
 they yield when dissolved in boiling water does not contradict
 this idea ; for, if it be true that the acid nitrate of lead when
 boiled with the nitrite decomposes         it,
                                            and passes to the state of
 nitrate, this     not a sufficient reason for thinking that this de

                                      a
 would contain oxide of lead with an excess of nitrous and nitric
 acid.
    46. The decomposition of the scales and of the yellowish
 crystals effected     bythe affinity of water, and the force of co
 hesion, led me to examine the action of the water on the nitrite
 of lead prepared      by M. Proust's process. On dissolving this
salt in boiling water,     obtained, 1st, yellow leafy crystals which
                            I
were deposited upon cooling           2dly, crystals slightly yellow
                                       ;                                 :
they were deposited         byconcentration    and cooling from the
mother-water of the former crystals          3dly, a slightly coloured

white grainy crystals.       On passing a stream of carbonic acid
into this mother- water,    I obtained plenty of nitrate from it.
    47.  I am  of opinion that these facts ought to leave no doubt
as to the compound nature of the nitrite of lead prepared after
M. Proust's method.         It   on this account, in the experiments

sible that it may be formed under certain circumstances ;   for we can con

                                      is
nitrate of lead, may,  by   combining with steam and oxygen, form nitric
acid,a   portion of which may be mixed with the nitrite, and decompose it.
                                                                     from

from the subnitrite.   This result naturally leads to this question:
Is there a term at which the acid nitrate of lead boiled over this
metal is converted into simple nitrite, so that by stopping the
operation at this term we may obtain pure nitrite ?          I do not
think that there are as yet a sufficient number of facts to resolve
this question definitively: but all my experiments have yielded
pure nitrite ; and I have observed besides, that when there was
an evident production of subuitrite, nitrate was still found in the
liquor.   Another fact                is,
                             that nitrites, prepared   different ope        in

a  current of carbonic acid into the solution of the subnitrite.
    5. The colour of the subnitrite more easily disappears than
that of the nitrite, for the former does not colour the water like
the latter.      The proof that non-colouring of the water                 the                 by

                         precipitating from its solution           part of its   a
oxide, the liquor becomes yellow.

tain a salt quite different from M. Proust's, insomuch as it
contains more lead. Now this opinion being admitted, it would
be .no longer possible to explain how M. Proust's yellow salt
could be converted by litharge into a salt the base of which was
less oxidated than his.
    9. The combinations of the oxide of lead with the nitrous acid
confirm the laws established by Richter, Gay-Lussac, Wollaston
and Berzelius : thus the quantity of base of the subnitrite 5s
double that of the nitrite.           The composition of the nitrite cor
responds with that of the nitrate of lead; and a remarkable re
sult, if it be not accidental, is, that the carbonic acid, by taking
from the nitrites a portion of ba«e, leaves in the liquor a quan
tity of oxide, which is to that of the nitrous acid in a proportion
which seems to correspond with that of the elements of the acid
nitrate.       But the cohesion of the nitrite and the expansive force
of the acid are sufficient to overcome the affinity of the nitrite for
an excess of its acid ; so that, by concentrating by heat the solu
tion of the nitrites when passed to the earbonic acid, we obtain
nitrite by cooling*.           It would be curious to ascertain          if,
                                                                        in the
 decompositions analogous to that of the nitrite, something similar
 does not take place in the proportion of the principle which has
become predominant.             .This would be the. means of ascertaining
if  the result which         Ihave observed   is  not accidental.       would
                                                                         It
be also interesting to ascertain       if  the alkalis, in acting on the acid
 nitrate of lead, do not produce        a   subilitrate corresponding to the
subnitrate.
     10.  I  have mentioned several facts      in   this memoir, which prove
that we obtain nitrites intermediary between the two combina
tions which   I      have described. May we regard these salts as so
many      different    kinds of nitrite, or as combinations, of the two
nitrites  ?     This    isprecisely what  I    cannot decide in      defmitive
                                                                     a
manner    :   I   shall therefore leave to my readers the liberty of
forming any opinion they may think most natural.
     11.  I   have not been able to obtain pure nitrite         by M. Proust's
process   :    for,    if

LXX \\\. New Outlines of Chemical                 Philosophy . By Ez. Walker,
                                     Esq. of Lynn, Norfolk,
                                      [Continued         from p. 285.]
                                       On    Light and Heat.
Sirs, .L/avojsier's    theory of combustion is founded on the
supposition, that in every ease oxygen combines with the burn
ing body, and that the weight of the product of every body after
combustion corresponds with the weight of the Body before
combustion, plus that of the oxygen consumed.
   But this theory is questionable, for no account is taken of
the light and heat generated in the process.       If a long mould
candle, which weighs two ounces troy, be lighted, and placed to
form an angle with the horizon of 60 degrees, it will be so per
fectly consumed as not to leave a single grain of ashes ; the
only product being pure water.
   I have observed in a former paper, that oxygen gas is com
posed of thermogen and water*, so that, when thermogen com
bines with the burning body, the base of the gas being incom
bustible becomes the product.
   Now, the important problem to be investigated           what be                 is,
comes of the two ounces of matter of the candle                 con            ?
                                                                                         Is
                                                                                         it
verted into light and heat, or        transmuted into pure water
                                                         is   it                                ?
Now, unless      can be demonstrated that tallow, oil, and wax
                              it
are transmutable into pure water, the theory of combustion of
M. Lavoisier falls to the ground.
   It well known that charged Leyden jar contains nothing
       is is
                                             a
that    either tangible, visible, or ponderable; but let     be dis                  it
charged through the air, or some other conducting substance,
and both light and heat will be generated      nor can either light    ;
or heat be produced, unless the two elements of combustion be
united to ponderable matter.       Consequently, light      a triple                is
compound of thermogen, photogcn, and combustible matter                                        ;
and heat      a compound of the same two elements united to
                        is
matter of the same kind, but differently modified.
   As light comes from the sun in seven seconds and         half,                   a          it,
therefore, passes over five miles in. about to^o7thf part of a
second of time.    A candle which weighs two ounces troy will
burn about ten hours, consequently         th part of     grain will     %

seen in a dark night, the air being clear, at the distance of five
miles, a sphere often miles in diameter, containing 523 cubic
miles, is filled with light in 5 0 1 0 0th part of a second.
    But as the heat of a candle cannot produce any sensible ef
fect at a greater distance than a few yards, we may suppose
that heat is specifically heavier than light. Oxygen gas is
heavier than hydrogen gas in the ratio of 15 to 1, because the
former contains more water than the latter.          Let     therefore,   it,
be supposed that the quantities of matter contained in light and
heat be in the ratio of       to 15, which appears to be considera
                                  1
bly within the bounds of probability, then a quantity of matter
of about ao'ootb* part of          grain may be so attenuated and

gen, as to fill a space =523 cubic miles in -.A_th part of                            a

   Hence we see that, although matter           passive and inert, yet,
                                                      is

is made to put on an infinite variety of new forms, without a

thus produced on the living functions of animals, and vegetables,
is a field of investigation that     almost boundless.

Ox    Gall deprived of its tendency to putridity, and its colouring
matter, so detrimental to all delicate colours,    prepared in the  is
following manner:
                                        Process.
     To pint of fresh ox gall, boiled and skimmed, put one ounce

of alum, finely powdered continue ;     on the fire until combined

1813, whence we have copied           it,
                                    with numerous certificates from our first
artists, all concurring in the valuable properties of the refined ox gall.
The lesser gold medal of the Society was voted to Mr. Tomkins for his
communication.
                                                                                   put

                  of the   Properties    of,   the refined Ox   Gall.              351
    put one ounce of common salt, and continue         on the fire until
                                                                it
    combined  ;  when cold, put      into another bottle, and cork

    moderately close.
       Gall, thus prepared, will keep perfectly free from putridity, or
    any offensive smell, for years.
       When the above preparations have stood in a room, of a mo
    derate temperature, for about three months, they will deposit a
    thick sediment, become clear, and fit for use m ordinary pur
    poses; but as they contain a large portion of yellow colouring
    matter, tingeing blue of a greenish hue, reds, brown, and sullying
    purples, they are unfit for general use in painting in water co
    lours.
                               Further Process.
       The before-mentioned preparations, after standing until become
.   perfectly clear, are to be decanted and combined in equal pro
    portions  ; a thick coagulum         instantly formed of the yellow
                                            is
    colouring matter, which precipitates, leaving           clear liquid,
                                                                     a
    namely, the colourless ox gall.
       N. B. After the combination of the two first preparations, the
    process may be assisted         by
                                   filtering the liquid through paper.
    Age   renders this preparation more brilliantly clear, and      it,       by     it
    seems to obtain an agreeable scent        nor has
                                                  ;     been observed to
                                                            it
    contract, at any time,        an unpleasant smell, or to lose its useful
    properties.
                                        Properties.
       The refined ox gall possesses all the valuable properties of ox
    gall, as applicable to painting in water colours, with the superior
    advantages of being deprived of all tendency to putridity, and of
    all colouring matters.
      It  combines with, and fixes, all water colours, as they are
    usually prepared, either        by
                                    being mixed with them, or washed

glazings of colours, over each other          thus producing depth of

    In short, the valuable properties this refined ox gallop assesses,
make     itequally applicable to historical, landscape, botanical,
and natural history painting, as well as to colouring prints in
general     and,

                    its readily combining with all the vehicles used
in the preparation of water colours, and having no colour in                              it
self,  itenables the artist to paint with ease on surfaces otherwise
unfavourable, at the same time rendering the colours more bright
and durable.
    Many other valuable properties will, no doubt, on trial, be
found in this preparation      and the result cannot fail to facilitate
                                      ;
and improve the art of painting in water colours             and, as the;

applicable to many other useful purposes.

     May 1813. By M. Paganel, Member           several learned of
     Societies*.
In   order to confine my subject within the bounds which cir
cumstances require,      shall rapidly run over the traits which
                                  I
characterize  all the nations  of antiquity, and which distinguish
them from those of Europe.         Passing afterwards from these
general considerations to the particular character of the Chinese,
it will be acknowledged that this ancient nation        not less di     is
stinct from those who occupy the opposite extremity of Asia,
than the latter are from the Hungarians and Germans.
   Institutions in general derive their chief force from local con
veniences; that     to say, from the concordance between those

 institutions and the climate : a truth the more evident with re
 spect to the Asiatic nations, whose moral character is derived
 among each of them from the. physical qualities of the zone
under which they are placed.            This is the reason why the set
 tlement of the Turks in Europe, and the translation of the seat
 of empire to Constantinople, are regarded as a violation of
natural order, and as at variance with the principles and object
 of the Koran.
     Certain traits of character and usages common to all the peo
ple of Asia seem to indicate that all have a common origin.                  In
order to find any very striking difference between them, they
must be compared in the two extremities of this great portion of
the globe.       Among all, their manners are as ancient as the
societies themselves : as well as the governments, the latter have
an aspect nearly similar, and present the faithful expression of
the influence of climate.        Despotism is an incontestable effect
of this irresistible influence; and Mahomet, confounding the
precepts of religion with the rights of the throne, confiding the
duration of the empire to the human passions, formed out of the
confidants of his impostures the nucleus of an invincible army,
and of all the believers he made blind idolaters.              Mahometism
has lost nothing in Asia of its force and intolerance.
    But Asiatic despotism is variously modified, from the east to
the south.      In vain would you endeavour to render it sanguinary
in China, and paternal where the religion of Mahomet prevails*.
At the two extremities it would overcome all obstacles, and re
turn to its primitive state. Conquest or other circumstances
may compress the spring, but they can never break it.                    It de
rives its strength from the agreement of human institutions with
the moral character of men, their natural or factitious passions,
and with the means of satisfying them.
    In support of this opinion, I shall cite some celebrated facts.
If the first caliphs, tempering the spirit of conquest by the noble
    * I do not pretend to say that despotism is stripped of its essential
character in China.   There, as in the other Asiatic states, it is divided into
graduated tyrannies, each of which oppresses and is oppressed in its turn.
But in China, more than any where else, the sovereign watches over the
immediate depositaries of his authority or his confidence : there, more than
any where else, he occupies himself with his people, watches over their
subsistence, and protects them against the extortion of the governors, who
in China are more apt to elude the law and to defy all vigilance, on ac
count of the system of despotism weighing entirely upon them.              It is
                    I
true, therefore, as have said a little further on, that the despotism of the
Chinese emperors is active, paternal, and popular, as much as absolute
power can be. Some eminent writers have given' credit to very contrary
doctrines with respect to China.      The enthusiastic admiration of some,
and the contempt of others, for the Chinese, has equally impeded the in
vestigation of truth. I have endeavoured to steer a middle course between
 these two extremes.

      ft is possible that Asia may have been inhabited before every
 part of the globe.        But I am very far from considering it as the
  only cradle of the human race.          Tins opinion would imply that
  certain great questions had been resolved, which not only are
  not, but which probably never will be. For, if the human race
  is composed of races essentially different (an opinion more phi
  losophical and more generally adopted of late years), must not
  each of these races have had its first man*?
      What can never be contested          is,
                                             that nature has heaped           fa
  vours upon Asia its climate excludes numerous evils which
                      :
  everywhere else beset the paths of men.
      Shall venture to say that happiness
           I                                     is there more constant
  and more easy of attainment, because human knowledge                there
                                                                       is
  confined to a limited sphere, because Providence has refused to
  Asia in general the passions which are allied to the splendid
  gift of talents, and even genius itself?       This  isnot the place to
  inquire wherefore this sublime faculty of the human understand
  ing is   indigenous in the tejnperate zones.        It sufficient for our

contrary, the human mind exhibits no different phases; that the
moral order is there uniform and constant, maxims and usages
invariable ; and finally the laws, religion, and government there
triumph over the irruptions of barbarians, war, proselytism, and
even time itself.
    Let us now apply these general principles to the empire of
China, which more than any other Asiatic state exhibits the
happy results of local assimilations, that is to say, of the accord
ance of institutions and climate, and we shall perhaps succeed
in resolving the historical problem now under consideration.
    We may, without going too far, suppose that the civil and
religious institutions of China were very ancient, even when
they began to write the history of that c6untry ; and the history
of China, according to M. de Guignes, goes back to the year 2958
before our vulgar aera.         Confucius, who lived several centuries
before the reign of Augustus, developed and inculcated the pre
cepts of pure morality : but he certainly was not the first who
 instructed princes and subjects in their duties : the Chinese an
 nals go back more than 5000 years ; and probably at that epoch
 the science of morals and agriculture had attained in this vast
 empire a kind of perfection.
     It is here important to remark the anteriority of the Chinese
 over the rest of the world in governing and in feeding mankind,
 as well as the limits of their knowledge in the arts of imagina
 tion, and in the sciences which bespeak all the vigour of intellect
  and all the fire of genius.,
     In order to be five thousand years ago what they are at pre
 sent, the Chinese had only to collect the lessons of experience,
  always more forward in a paternal government, and under a sky
  whose serenity and mildness inspired the desire of pleasure ; ex
  perience more certain under a paternal government protected by
  patriarchal manners, and which a fertile soil exempts from the dan
  gers which an inconstant temperature occasions in other regions*.
     Every thing which human ingenuity can Invent and execute
  for procuring easy enjoyments to limited desires has been ef
  fected by the Chinese ; but they will never quit the track which
  has been marked out for them by nature.             Their affections re
  tain them in some measure near instinct : they trace its pro
  gress, and it directs in turn their industry: this is not the case
  with the bee and the beaver.          But the former stop, like these
  animal architects, at limits which they will never exceed.
   Ought we to ccmplain that the inventive arts have exhausted
  their patience when they have scarcely seized upon the first
     * The government has not yet succeeded, and perhaps never will suc
   ceed, in establishing a just balance between the subsistences and the im
   mense population of the empire.

 356        Memoir upon the Causes         of the lojig Duration
  rules, and the infinite domain of genius is for ever closed against
  them ? Ah ! by how many advantages is this magnificent, pri
  vilege compensated among these nations who are deprived of it !
  The Chinese are born for a life of indifference and tranquillity.
  If perfection in the arts, extent and depth in the sciences, are
  withheld from them, they are also ignorant of the revolutions
  and catastrophes of Europe.          No ambitious views interrupt the
  stream of their enjoyments.         They belong to the soil, like the
  plant which feeds them: they never experience the torments of
  curiosity; and with respect to them, their caste is that of the
  human race, and China the universe.
      In China in general the epochs of life are feebly marked by
  the advancement and decrease of intellect : and if we descend
  to the lower classes, we shudder at beholding immense genera
  tions confusedly pressing upon each other, and continually dis
  appearing in a fixed state of inveterate infancy.         For this rea
  son the vices of the multitude in China exhibit fickleness and
  imbecility, and for this reason also they abstain from the per
  petration of those crimes which sully the annals of so many other
   nations.
      Let us compare this condition of the Chinese with that of th«
  people who were formidable by the glory of their arms, and
. celebrated by the more solid conquests of their genius ; and we
  shall find on one hand a long series of happiness without noise,
  and on the other, some brilliant epochs purchased by centuries of
  calamity and crime ; we shall find also (a problem which it
  would be difficult to solve) that man is happy wherever the
  laws reward the useful arts, and that warlike or highly cultivated
  nations ate so much the more removed from happiness, as, they
  are greedy of glory or renown.             We can easily reckon the
  happy days of ancient Rome, but we cannot eount the days of
  sorrow and ignominy by which she expiated the conquest of
  the world.
      The civilization of nations is slow, gradual, and frequently in
  terrupted by a diversity of circumstances.           We may therefore
  reasonably suppose that the civilization of the Chinese goes
  back to an sera far anterior to the reign of Fohi.         In his time
  they were subject to the same usages, the same laws, and the
  same form of government.           Here we may observe that several
  things  seem   to have   been   established  among this people to se
  parate them    from  all  other  nations  : their language is a parti
  cular instance.    To reproach the Chinese with the imperfection
  of their language, is to be ignorant of the spirit and object of
 their institutions.    An uniform system of education, a compli
  cated etiquette, superstitious ceremonies, a life of effeminate in
  dolence for the fair sex, painful for the poor, sumptuous for the

                            of the  Chinese Empire.                         357
   rich, voluptuou* for both sexes ; every thing in China is sub
  ject to a law of nature, because nature herself is there uniform,
   constant and absolute in her wishes, and leaves nothing to man
   but the wish to preserve his life and to enjoy it.              But what
   has preserved China, and will always, from every innovation
  contrary to the spirit of the government, its usages and laws, is
   the place which it occupies at the further extremity of the globe.
      Thus for a long series of ages has moral and physical order
  been reciprocally reflected and protected in this vast empire.
  Thus    has the social accordance of human institutions from gene
  ration to generation, made the necessity of a paternal govern
  ment more apparent ; and all the parts of the empire are so
  happily combined, that they present to the eye and to the mind
  nothing but unitv of movement, thought and desires.
      The Chinese fully enjoyed all the benefits of their government
  until the time when the Tartars made themselves known to
  them by their sudden inroads.               'They then experienced the
  scourge of war, and all the evils which it brings in its train ; but
  they were still for a long time ignorant of the military art.
  Enervated by a long enjoyment of peace, past events left but
  few traces on the memory, and they occupied themselves but
. little with the future.       As invasions however became more fre
  quent, they quitted for a moment this state of listlessness ; but
  they proved by their defensive means, how easy it was to subju
  gate them, and when vanquished, how impossible it was for their
  conquerors to avoid submitting themselves to the laws of the
  empire.
      The climate therefore has prescribed to China its govern
  ment, usages and manners.            But institutions dictated by nature
  ought to be consolidated from the instant of their birth, and to
  be perpetuated without contradiction.                Rarely have wicked
  princes disgraced the throne of China.            The Chinese, like other
  nations, may groan under the abuse* of power, but they never
  hate power itself.       The strength of the state consists in the in
  variable accordance between the wants of man and the action
  of the government — it is to be found in the harmony which
  reigns among all the parts of this vast edifice.                And what
  ought not to be the authority of a system of legislation, which
  without tyranny is nevertheless despotic, and has regulated for
  five thousand years the destinies of an immense population * ?
      If the lust of conquest had not united under one chief the
  Tartars adjoining this vast and pacific empire, no revolution

would have to this day chequered its history, and a conqueror
would never have been seated on the throne.
      The Manchou Tartars several times ravaged the provinces,
before carrying their inroads into the heart of the empire. The
 government did not oppose numerous armies to the enemy, but
 constructed the Great Wall : a feeble rampart against valour
 and cupidity; and a memorable monument, according to Vol
 taire, of the love of peace..       The Chinese never dreamt that the
 facility with which they might be conquered inflamed the desires
 of their invaders, and that the hands employed in raising this
 useless     barrier  would   have been sufficient to immolate every
  Tartar at the frontiers of the empire:        so true is it that the ha
  bitudes    induced  by  the  gentler passions have expelled from the
 breasts of this people the turbulent workings of hatred and re
 venge.
      One thing is certain, that the emperors of China have raised
  militias or formed regular troops for the purposes of defence only.
  History does not reproach them with a single aggression*.             With
  the interests of states, of .which the European cabinets have
  formed a distinct science, they were unacquainted.               Their po
  licy was confmed to the maintenance of internal tranquillity, the
  banishment of every new opinion, and of every doctrine con
  trary to the laws of the empire.         They were insulated from the
  rest of the world, convinced by dire experience, that under the
  veil of commercial speculations, Europeans concealed dangerous
  projects.     Nevertheless, by constancy and importunity, the latter
   secures the privilege of trading with certain points of the em
  pire, but under restrictions and conditions so humiliating, that
  the love of money only can induce men to submit to them.
       The Chinese rather tolerate than desire the presence of
   strangers : every where authority is exerted to keep them in awe,
   and no where are they received with hospitality.
       From this primary cause arising from climate of the long
   duration of the Chinese government, other secondary causes
   flow, whose action not less constant fortifies that which is ex
   ercised by the climate.
        The paternal regime is indigenous in China, as well as ab
   solute power : this regime is sacred with respect to the prince,
   and this power is revered by his subjects as a law of nature.            It
   is there that the justice of the head of the state, incessantly en-
       * The emperors had frequently, and particularly those of the primitive
   dynasties, troubles to appease and rebel vassals to keep in submission. A
    kind of feudal hierarchy was the principle of these intestine wars. The
   supreme power was successively concentrated, and it is now and will be
   long an object of adoration with the Chinese people, as the source and the
    guarantee of the easy happiness for which nature destines them.
                                                                 ,  lightened

lightened by a long hierarchy of authorities, circulates equally
among all ranks*.       It is there that the citizens of all classes,
chained to the chief of the state by an immutable order of things,
obey him implicitly as children do their father;       Thousands of
centuries have elapsed, and the national character has experiencd
no sensible alteration.      Its constancy is that of the climate.
This beautiful feature, which embraces all institutions and all
interests, commands so much the more admiration and respect,
that the most ferocious conqueror has always bowed his head,
and loweredjhis spear, when he contemplated it.                 t
    The Chinese government recompenses useful labours and vir
tuous actions by the highest dignities.     This noble and rare jus.,
tiee is the principle of reciprocal confidence between the prince
and his subjects, and consequently one of the causes of the du
ration of the empire and the government.
    Some philosophers have deplored the lot of the Chinese, go
verned by a despotic power; but these critics do not see that the
real despot is the climate.     They do not see that this despotism
is justified by a constant and paternal beneficence ; that nature
prescribes to it at the same time duties and limits ; and that the
history of the empire, written from day to day under the eyes of
the prince, by incorruptible magistrates, incessantly presents the
faithful picture of his life and the judgement of posterity.
    The Chinese are also reproached with the vilest cruelty, and
the barbarous custom of arresting by infanticide the too rapid
progress of population.
   In condemning such usages let me be permitted to observe, that
the severity of punishments in China is a necessary consequence
of despotism, as despotism is in its turn a consequence of the in
fluence of the climate ; and that is moderated perhaps too much
by the power of getting rid of                    it,   by
                                          paying contributions gra
duated according to the magnitude of the crime and the wealth
of the criminal.
   As to the exposure of new-born infants,       has been tolerated
                                                                 it
only under circumstances which compromised the safety of the
state:  ithas never been expressly permitted:        would be even    it
punished,    the fathers, whose extreme poverty dictate"! such bar
             if
barous sacrifices, did not elude the vigilance of the magistrates.
   Let us not judge the Chinese according to our learned opi
nions and refined abstractions     the former keep within bounds,
                                              :

      In the privileged regions where the human mind              is developed
in force, in penetration, in extent, and where the imagination is
inflamed by that creative fire which is called genius, man, by a
fatal compensation, wanders in the wildest paths of error, and
precipitates himself into the most humiliating excesses.                    It is
there that in one and the same head are united a strong wit and
 a timid soul, boldness of thought and humble credulity: it is
 there that man is to himself an inexplicable phenomenon of
 oppositions and contrasts ; it is there that Bossuet armed him
 self with the most profound dialectics to combat mere chimeras,
 that Pascal fixed the language extended the domains of science,
 and dug for himself a hell ; — and it is there that the genius of
 Newton fell from the throne of the universe, repenting that he
 was seated there.         It is in short upon this theatre of Europe,
 where Nature has so often crowned the sage who has surprised
 her at work, and the artist who knows how to imitate her, — upon
 this theatre covered with the trophies of genius, that genius too
 often creates false doctrines for ardent heads, and wanders far
 from the object of civil and religious sociability.
       This balance of good and evil, which genius produces, is un
 known, and will always be, in Southern Asia.                   The supersti
  tions   of the  first ages  are there  at present civilized, and, if I may
  be allowed       the expression,     identified   with   the manners         and
  usages.      China is peopled with fantastic beings, with good and
  evil genii, because there must be in all places where men exist,
  fables and bonzes ; and the bonzes must have riches and power *.
       The Chinese have also their golden age, their deluge, and their
  Bacchus ; they have revelations, mysteries, and prophets ; but
  these errors are only the playthings of an infant people : super
  intended by the government, respected by learning itself, in China
  thev kindle no civil wars, nor priestly quarrels.              The word in
  tolerance is no more in their language than is the idea expressed
      * The constant serenity of their atmosphere invited     the first people of
   India, those of' Chaldea and Egypt, to observe the stars    and their relation
   to the earth. But these very people, whom frequent catastrophes in the
   infancy of the world inspired with terror, soon interrogated the heavens
   instead of observing them.     The chiefs of the nations could at their plea
   sure make the gods speak, and the priests arrogated to themselves an ex
   clusive and mysterious science.    But latterly astronomy has banished from
   its noble domains the vain formulas of astrology.         Among all civilized
   nations the celestial phenomena are explained by the laws of nature.
   Among the Chinese alone, the art of reading the destiny of men in the
   heavens, retains its empire. Their intelligence refuses to keep pace with
    the progressive improvement of the human mind.         The government has
    collected some fruits from the missionaries, Lut these fruits have not spread

by it in their minds.         When in the heart of their peaceful em
pire the Jesuits and the Dominicans accused each other of heresy •
and impiety, the Chinese did not see two parties animated with
a false zeal for the new religion ; but these monks appeared to
them as dangerous fools, or political agitators from whom the
state must be freed. Such men, in fact, would have long braved ,
the influence of the climate and every other influence.                   The
Jesuits wrought with         a profound   and   crafty policy,   nattered  the
confident credulity of the prince, and humanely twisted the divine
word to accommodate it to the prejudices of a people who were
 slaves to their habitudes.       The Dominicans, energetic preachers,
as if they still pursued from town to town, and from province to
 province, the heretics, armed themselves with all the arguments
 of the schools, proclaimed a holy war, and resolved upon the
 overthrow of China, rather than suffer the smallest departure
 from the doctrine which they were sent to propagate *.
      The cause of the line of conduct pursued by the Chinese
 government on this occasion was the natural moderation of the
 minds of the people.         Neither the interests of earth nor of heaven
 could inflame them to enthusiasm, and far less to religious fana
 ticism ; a blind passion which absorbs every other sentiment,
 which courts darkness, which combats peace as well as light,
 and becomes more insatiate the more its appetites are fed.                The
  dreadful reign of fanaticism has covered with ruins the states
  which are embellished by the arts and sciences, which thus have
  had to fight their way against intolerance and envy.
       Fanaticism has made Europe for several centuries, and even
  since the revival of letters, the theatre of the most sanguinary
  wars, and of the most scandalous impieties. Extending its ravages
  with its doctrines, it has deluged a new hemisphere in the blood
  of its inhabitants.        In China, on the contrary, the unity of
  thoughts and desires, the consequence of a limited intelligence,
  perpetuates, without any obstacle, union, peace, and happiness.
  And why ? Because there reigns an admirable intelligence be
  tween nature and the social institutions ; because good sense \p
   the wit of the Chinese, and common utility the object of their
   industry; because the serenity of the air stifles «verv germ of cu
   riosity, ambition, and heroism ; because, in short, every thing
   there is stationary, both men and things, so that the government
   of Chma appears seated on the throne of Time.
      * It results from
                        ray opinion as to the influence' of climate and the in
   telligence of the Chinese, that they would have, derived but feeble advan
  tages from the settlement of our learned missionaries in their empire.' But
   it is presumable that the people of Europe would have derived great bene
   fits both with respect to the arts and commerce as well as with respect to
                                   '
   the natural sciences.

 362 Memoir upon the long Duration         of the Chinese Empire.
    If the fables which charm the vulgar in China could have filled
 their brains with fanaticism ; if the reason of the Chinese had
 been so far deranged as to pretend that the worship of the
bonzes is the only one which is agreeable to the divinity, and
 that the Father of mankind has chosen the emperor of China
 to convert all the world, or to cut their throats ; Asia would
 have been burnt many centuries before fanaticism carried fire
 and sword to the innocent cities of the Incas.        Ere the Euro
peans were in political existence, the Chinese had discovered the
composition of gunpowder, which we have converted into a
weapon of death ; whereas in China it is only used to give eclat
and solemnity to public rejoicings.
   It is equally well ascertained that the Chinese invented printing
many centuries before Germany attributed the honour of this dis
covery to herself, and that they confmed the use of it to trans
mit from age to age the lives of the sovereigns, and the annals of
the empire.
   Printing, on the contrary, was scarcely known in Europe, than
it opened all the schools to the most frivolous disputes. Down
to the 17th century it was less serviceable to letters than to the
propagation of lies and errors.
 > Thus all the secondary causes of the duration of the govern
ment of China bring us back to the primary cause of this sin
gular phenomenon, the influence of climate.           This influence,
which equally affects the moral and physical powers, marks limits
to the latter, which the Chinese neither have the power nor the
wish to exceed.       Their minds are constantly directed to what
is useful, and there remain fixed : experience is their guide,
good sense their companion, and they never desire a better con
dition. They can conceive none preferable to their mild state
of servitude.     Of all our opinions, that which would astonish
them most, even their learned men, is our opinion as to the dig
nity of man, his honour, and liberty.          With sound ways of
thinking,   the Chinese  therefore never experience violent passions;
their tastes, wants, and institutions    bear the impression of uni
formity, and of a succession of ages, which the authentic history
of the empire has not been able fully to describe.
   India presents a far different spectacle to the traveller, who
cannot take one step in this ancient and primitive country with
out recognising the fatal effects of the revolutions which it has
undergone since the people of Europe began to dispute for it as
their prey. A single people now holds it in the most complete
subjection.     A merchant born on the banks of the Thames im
poses tributes on the Indian princes ; and their thrones have
been levelled perhaps by a tradesman, who does not know how
to manage any thing but a counting-house.

    Influence    of atmospheric Moisture            on an electric Column.   363
.  In this rich portion of the globe, the inhabitants of which were
civilized and learned when Europe could scarcely boast of a few
market towns, traditions are lost, recollections effaced, and we
can only grope our way through heaps of ruins.         Afld whence
comes this difference in the destiny of India and China ?       The
one country has been able to insulate itself and to maintain its
independence ; while the other, on all sides accessible to naviga
tors and to Asiatic conquerors, has only changed masters since
the days of Alexander, and striven without effect against the
tyranny and cupidity of its conquerors.
    It results from all that I have said, that the climate of China
has given birth to its institutions, and its geographical situation
 to its independence ; that the influence of the climate is the pri
 mary cause ; its isolation the preserving principle of its manners,
 laws, usages ; and that we ought to refer to their combined ef
 fects the duration of the empire, and the longevity of its institu
 tions, of which it offers the only example.

    Sjrs, — Although the experiments described iu my former
    communication* fully demonstrated the influence of atmospheric
    moisture on the action of an electric column ; yet, as the actual
    passage of the electric fluid over its exterior surface from the
    zinc extremity of the column to its opposite, was rather inferred
    from    those experiments than directly proved by them, I must

    contact with the surface of the glass tube near to the positive
    extremity of the column, was left in that position for about two
    minutes  ;   the leaves of the electrometer attained in that time

 trometer being withdrawn, the leaves still retained their diver

    Exp. 3. — The electrometer was placed in contact with the
 glass tube near to the negative extremity of the column.              The
 results were precisely   the same    as in the two preceding experi
 ments, except that in this the divergence of the leaves was less
than in those.
    Exp. 4. — The electrometer was now put in contact with the
waxed end of the glass tube next to the brass mounting at the
positive extremity of the column.         In a few seconds the leaves
just separated with positive electricity, but the electrometer be
 ing withdrawn, they closed. As the leaves were thus found to
be only infiuentially affected,the electrometer was replaced in its
position ; and after the space of a few minutes the leaves di
verged something more than          f  of an inch : the electrometer
being   withdrawn,  the  leaves  remained     positively electrified.
            —
    Exp. 5. The electricity of the waxed end of the tube next
to the brass mounting at the negative extremity of the column
was next ascertained.      The leaves. at first were only infiuentially
affected'; but after the contact had been continued for several
minutes, they remained positively electrified.
    Exp. 6. — The negative extremity of the column was now in
sulated as well as the positive.      The same* places of the column
were examined as before, and the results were similar to the
preceding ; the only difference being that the divergence of the
leaves was much less than in the former instances.
    Exp. 7. — The column was now taken and exposed to the
fire for about three minutes, in order to dissipate all the moisture
from its surface ; it was then placed as in Experiment 1 . and
the electrometer applied to the different points in the manner
already described.      The kind Of electricity found at each point
was as before positive ; and now in no instance was any electri
city communicated to the leaves, which diverged only while the
electrometer was in contact with the column ; their divergence
was very small.    l anjj gentlemen,

             R.  Singer still maintains that I have fallen into
error, in my experiments on inducted electricity,           and has ad
vanced three statements to prove it*.
                     * Phil. Mag. vol. xliii.
                                              p. 20.
                                                                       The

                           On 'Electricity.                           365
    The first consists of a reprint of a paragraph from one of his
former papers *, which contains nothing but Mr. Singer's po
sitive assertions.   Mr. S. then adds, " these are facts, which
the constant repetition of such experiments professionally en
ables me to state with confidence."
    But philosophical statements must be demonstrated, either
mathematically, physically, or experimentally, ere they can be
 received as facts. For, as the bare word of Newton would never
be taken on a philosophical subject without a demonstration,
 consequently the' assertions of Mr. S. cannot be admitted on
any other terms.
    Secondly, Mr. Singer says,
                                  " the statement in the preceding
paragraph may be verified in a few minutes by any one suffi
ciently acquainted with the practice of electricity to make the
experiments with due accuracy; and             I
                                           believe it not only ad
duces a fact in proof of Mr, Walker's error, but offers the re
quisite information to show him its cause."
    But the word belief is very objectionable, although it is the
foundation on which Mr. S. builds his statement.       The geome
tricians have not suffered this word to stain their pages once in
2000 years : and the experimental philosophers have, long ago,
blotted it out of all their demonstrations.
    Had Mr. S. understood the true meaning of this word, he
would riot have used it in the sense he has done.      He has ad
vanced it as a sound argument against my experiments ; but will
he admit it as an argument against himself ? Let us try the ex
periment.     If any one should say he believed that Mr. S. is a
very superficial reasoner, it is ten to one that Mr. S. would ad
mit the word belief, in this case, as a demonstration of the
weakness of mental faculties.      And if he will not admit this
word as an argument against himself, he ought not to have used
it against my experiments.
   And thirdly, Mr. S. observes, <c independent of this circum
stance, it is amusing to find an individual so confident of the
infallibility of his own observations, as to consider them suffi
cient to subvert the experience of Canton, Franklin, Wilke,
oEpinus, Cavallo, Stanhope, and Robison.
   Whether Mr. S. intended this last statement as a specimen of
his wit, or of his reasoning, I know not.        But as Mr. S. will
not, I presume, be offended at my mentioning the name of a
great astronomer on the same page with his own, let         there
                                                                it,
fore, be supposed that Mr. Singer had 'lived in the days of Co
pernicus — Mr. Singer might then have said, that "        was very
                                                           it

his own observations, as to consider them sufficient" to prove

      1st. Separate the canvass from the pannel, or straining
 frame, and lay it on a smooth table, with the painting down
 wards, and nail it securely.
       2d. Take a piece of tin foil, larger than the canvass, place it
 on a verv smooth table, and make the tin foil as smooth as possi
 ble with your hand.         Then melt some Salisbury glue, in the same
 manner as for cabinet-makers' use.
       3d. Warm the tinfoil before the fire, and lay it again on the
 table, then wash it over with the glue, and place it on the back
 of the canvass, secured as above, as quick as possible ; smooth it
  perfectly with the hand, and let it remain in a warm room to dry.
       4th. To repair the cracks of the canvass, in an old or! painting,
  lay it on a very smooth table, the subject downwards ; then, with,
  a brush or fine linen, cover the canvass with some melted white
  wax, and, with a warm flat smoothing iron, rub over the wax,
  and press it hard, which will draw the colours up to the canvass.
       5th. To varnish the painting, clean the picture well, take some
  white wax, and spirits of turpentine, with a small quantity of
  linseed oil and sugar of lead ; melt them over the fire, dip a fine
  linen rag therein, with which wash your painting ; then, with a
  fine linen rag, rub over the varnish till it begins to be pclished ;
  let it remain till next day, and then rub it over with a fine waxed
   cloth, and afterwards with a soft linen cloth, using them alter
  nately, by which means the painting will receive a very fine po
   lish.
       By the    above means, the cracks and small holes in old paintings
  mav be closed and repaired, and a coat of tin foil may be after-
  Vards glued on the back of the canvass, as above mentioned.
        A foot square^ of the tin foil costs about sixpence ; when
   wanted of a larger size it will cost considerably more in propor-
   tiorjh.    It may be procured in sheets of three or four feet if wanted.

                                                  Dublin, May 17, 1814.
                                             occurred very lately in the
laboratory of the Dublin Society, having excited no small degree
pf interest in this city, I am induced to transmit you a brief
detail, in hopes it may prove both interesting and useful to many
of your readers, convinced that every communication               tending
towards the enlargement of our knowledge in this regard may
ultimately produce the most beneficial effects.
      When a mixture of carbonate of lime and zinc, or iron filings,
 is exposed to an intense heat, the peculiar gaseous substance
 named carbonic oxide is disengaged, which has been stated to
 bear the same relation to carbonic acid that nitrous gas does to
 nitric acid. But agreeably to the striking observations of Mr.
  Higgins, professor of chemistry to .the Dublin Society, in his
  work recently published, wherein his claim to the discovery of
  the atomic system is unequivocally established, it would appear
  that, in the combination of oxygen with different bases, it is the
  atom of oxygen only that is found multiplied, as is beautifully
  exemplified in all the metallic oxides, acids, and gases.        An ap
  parent anomaly has been noticed with respect to nitrous oxide,
  which the experiments of Mr. Higgins on the composition of
  nitrous gas tend to obviate, and sanction a comparison of the
  proportions of carbon and oxygen in carbonic oxide with those
  of azote and oxygen in nitrous oxide, rather than the atomic
   coincidence of carbonic oxide and nitrous gas.         Carbonic oxide
  was discovered and described by Mr. Cruickshank in 1801 ; it is
   highly combustible, burning with a fine blue flame, but is utterly
   incapable of supporting animal life.
       The diversified experiments of Sir H. Davy on the respiration
   of nitrous oxide and some other gases, so interestingly described
   in his scientific researches in 1800, in a great measure dissipated
   the general apprehensions of fatality resulting from the inhala
   tion of compound gases, and satisfactorily demonstrated that
   many of the aerial fluids, before considered as destructive to vi
   tality, might be breathed with perfect safety.
       Desirous of witnessing the progressive effects of carbonic oxide
    when freely respired, with a view to comparative analogy in re
    ference to nitrous oxide, I was tempted a few days ago to inhale
    a portion of it as copiously as possible. The consequence had
    Very nearly proved fatal to me. A considerable quantity of the
    gas having been care'fully prepared by Mr. S. Wharmby, the very
                                                                 ingenious

   3C8 Experiment on Respiration width had nearly proved          fatal.
  ingenious and able assistant to Mr. Professor Higgins, a series of
  experiments on its respiration were proposed. Mr. Wharmby
  first noticed some points of resemblance it bore to the nitrous
   oxide, particularly the singularly sweetish taste, and, having made
   two or three inspirations, was seized with a degree of convulsive
   tremor and giddiness that nearly overpowered sensibilitv.       These
   violent effects were but transient, though considerable languor,
   head-ache, and debility, remained for many hours afterwards.
  Anxious to pursue the experiment still further, I next made
  three or four hearty inspirations of the gas, having first exhausted
  my lungs of common air as completely as possible. The effects
  were an inconceivably sudden deprivation of sense and volition.
   I fell supine and motionless on the floor, and continued in a state
   of total insensibility for nearly half an hour, apparently lifeless,
  pulsation being nearly extinct. Several medical gentlemen being
  present, various means were employed for my restoration, with
   out success ; when the introduction of oxygen gas by com
  pression into the lungs was suggested, the effects of which may
  be fairly contrasted with those of the carbonic oxide. A very ra
  pid return of animation ensued, though accompanied by convul
  sive agitations, excessive head-ache, and quick irregular pulsation,
  and, for some time after mental recovery, total blindness, ex
  treme sickness and vertigo, with alternations of heat and shiver
  ing cold, were painfully experienced. These unfavourable spasms
  were succeeded by an unconquerable propensity to sleep, which,
  as might be expected, was broken and feverish.           An emetic of
  tartarised antimony finally removed these alarming symptoms,
. and the only unpleasant effects felt on the ensuing day were those
  occasioned by the fall.
      1 very much regret that the confusion arising from the idea of
  my death, so disturbed the arrangement that no accurate deter
  mination could afterwards be made, either of the quantity of gas
  respired, or the change it underwent in the process; and the ex
  periment is rather too hazardous for repetition.         Nevertheless,
  the extraordinary efficacy of oxygen gas in cases of suspended
  animation produced by carbonic acid, choke damps, and other
  suffocating gases, is fairly deducible, and, I conceive, cannot be
  too forcibly recommended to the faculty, in such instances,.           I
  therefore sincerely hope that the results of this experiment may
  be of practical utility in those cases, which are so frequently occur
  ring, and are often so awfully fatal ; it being the decided opinion of
  the professional gentlemen present on this occasion, that the free
  use of the oxygen gas was solely instrumental in restoring me to life.
      Mr. Higgins himself had nearly once fallen a victim to a similar
  experiment with sulphuretted hydrogen, the effects of which,
                                                                    after

 LXXX.      Case  of  Retention   of Urine     successfully   treated  by

     of London Truss Society for the Relief of the ruptured

     Poor, &c. &c.
'Sirs, — John Jones,       aged 67, a brass turner by trade, a stout
 muscular man, his general health extremely good, with the ex
 ception of an ulcerated leg for the last twenty years, and during the
 last eight or ten hydrocele on one side and hernia on the other.
 For the last twelve months also he has experienced some diffi
 culty in voiding his urine, which came away in small quantities
 at a time, and with frequent calls.          On July 7, 1813, after a
 hearty dinner he sat an hour or two in the open air, during which
 time he was attacked by violent pain in the abdomen, with
 purging. These symptoms continued all night, and his urine
 came away in drops without anv effort.         On the 8th he was ad
 mitted a patient of the Finsbury Dispensary. — The abdomen was
 hard, swelled, and painful ; and there was a considerable degree
 of fever attended with thirst : the purging also continued.          The
Jeg,   which  had been  much   inflamed   for the last  three  months, is
 now better.     An anodyne fomentation and some powdered rhu
 barb were prescribed for him by the physician who visited him
 till the 13th ; and during the interval aperient fomentations, &c.
 were resorted to with a view to relieve the complaint in the
 bowels and general disorder of the constitution.           On the 13th
 Mr. Taunton was requested to see him, on account of the stilli-
 cidium urinae which had existed from the beginning of the attack..
 He found him with quick weak pulse, brown tongue, violent pain
 in the region of the bladder, which was distended, forming a
 tumour reaching above the umbilicus : the urine was dribbling
 away involuntarily.     The catheter was introduced, but could
 not be passed beyond the neck of the bladder.              The smallest
 gum catheters were also tried without effect. Continuata foment.
     14th. The bladder reaches still higher up : the catheter again
 attempted, but in vain; other symptoms the same.                   Punc
 turing above the pubis was determined on, and consented to
 by the patient.    Upon going to perform the operation at three
  o'clock, it was found that a considerable quantity of urine had
 come away involuntarily and almost in a stream, and the patient

  would not now consent to the operation.           Nor was it urged, as
   the bladder was greatly reduced in size.         The tongue was stilf
  brown, and the other bad symptoms continued.                    15th. The
  patient   was   nearly  in   the  same   state :  stillicidium    constant.
   16th. The tumour formed by the bladder is more prominent and
  circumscribed ; reaches about two inches above the umbilicus ;
  in other respects the same : — pain decreased. The operation
  was now performed, and between two and three quarts of urine
  were taken away ; it was not grumous$ nor materially altered
  from that of a healthy person.         During the operation the pulse
  fell, but soon regained its strength. A long elastic catheter was
  left in the wound, and properly secured.         A cordial mixture was
 prescribed.     In the evening the bougie used as a stilette was
  withdrawn, and the urine evacuated: no pain on pressure on the ab
 domen, which was soft, and the tongue clean.              18th. The urine
  escapes by the side  of  the  catheter, but is not effused into the cel
 lular membrane ; adhesive inflammation was visible round the
 wound. The urine flows involuntarily, but he feels easy. He took
 broth yesterday : the tongue was clean, the pulse was stronger
 and slower.     19th and 20th. A slight blush of inflammation im
 mediately around the wound : no pain experienced on pressure.
 21st. Has felt pain in the night, seemingly from a temporary ob
 struction to the flow of urine, which was soon evacuated, and the
 pain went off. 22d. The catheter escaped during the night ; but
 the urine flows freely from the orifice, and he continues to gain
 strength.    From this period to August 28th convalescent.              The
 passage of a small bougie has been attempted two or three times
 without suecess.     The patient complains of considerable pain in
the urethra, which prevents his sleeping without opiates ; and he
 takes a grain of opium every night. He walks out, and his spirits
are better. September 10th. The quantity of urine discharged by
the urethra has sensibly increased, until it all comes away by that
channel.      The opening had closed a few days before, but it broke
out when straining at stool ; he does not know whether any urine
escaped or'not, but nothing comes from it at present. f 7th. Much
in the same state ; complains of soreness where the puncture was
made, and a little matter oozes from it ; a considerable quantity
of urine came through on the 13th and 14th.                 From this time
he gradually recovered, and was discharged cured the beginning
of November, since which he has not had any return of the com
plaint.

     viixe,  the French Circumnavigator.         By M. Delambre,
     Secretary to the French Institute*.
 Louis      Antony jde Bougainville was born at Paris on the
  1 1th of November, 1729. He was the son of a notary at Paris, and
 descended from an ancient family in Picardy.
     A celebrated navigator, a general officer, member of the Aca
 demy of Sciences, of the Institute, and of the Board of Longitude,
 were so many titles which he owed to his own merit, and which
 were .the recompense of a long series of illustrious actions.
     While at college he was distinguished by an ardent desire for
 knowledge.     His professor one day was explaining the phases of
 the moon, and its various positions : in order to impress his ideas
 oh the memory of his auditors, he quoted two Latin verses to
 them.     Young Bougainville was bold enough to consider them
 as of an inferior kind ; and being challenged to make better, he
 answered almost instantly by four verses more accurate, more in
 structive, and more poetical, than the distich which he had cri
 ticised.
     On leaving college he was admitted an advocate in the Par-,
 liament, by desire of his father ; but in order to indulge his own
inclination he inrolled himself in the musqueteers. Chance made
him a neighbour to Clairaut and d'Alembert, and he attached
himself warmly to these two geometricians ; he visited them
often, profited by their conversation and writings, and at the age
of 25 he produced the first part of his Integral Calculus, to serve
as a continuation of De I' HSpital' s Infinitesimals. With that can
dour which was always ohe of the most striking traits in his cha
racter, he declared in his preface, that nothing in the whole work
was his own, but the arrangement which he had endeavoured to
give it. The committee of the Academy, however, attested that by
explaining the methods of the various geometricians, he had made
them his own by the clearness and intelligence with which he
elucidated them.     In addition to this flattering testimony he
found also another recompense in the certainty of being useful
to young geometricians, who were greatly in want of guides to
enable them to penetrate into this hitherto obscure branch of the
mathematical science.
    In 1755 he was made a major, and visited London as secre
tary of the embassy, where he was elected a fellow of the Royal
Society.     Next year he followed General Montcalm to Canada,
with the title of captain of dragoons. And as a proof that so
many and various functions did not make him neglect the sciences;
                                                               before

372                 Some Particulars      of the Life of
before he embarked for America he put to press the second part
of his Integral Calculus, having requested Bezout to read the
proof sheets in his absence.
     Immediately on his arrival in America he marched at the head
of    a detachment amidst ice and snow, and through almost im
penetrable forests, to the extremity of Lake Sacrament, where he
 burnt an English flotilla under the guns of the fort which pro
tected it.
     In 1758 a detachment of 5000 French troops was pursued se
veral d ivs by an army of 24,000 English.           Bougainville inspired
 his fellow soldiers with resolution to wait for the enemy : they
hastily fortified their position in less than 24 hours, and com
 pelled the English to fall back with a loss of 6000 men.           Bou
 gainville was wounded on this occasion in the head by a musket
 ball. The French governor despaired, however, of saving the
 colony, if he did not receive reinforcements from home.            Bou
 gainville was sent to France to solicit them, and he returned with
 the rank of colonel and the cross of St. Louis, granted before the
 usual time in consequence of his brilliant services.           Montcalm
 placed him at the head of the grenadiers and volunteers, to cover
 the retreat of the army which was forced to fall back on Que
 bec.     He performed this important service with his usual intre
 pidity and skill. The death of the general hastened the loss of
 the colony ; and Bougainville returned to France.           He then fol
 lowed M. Choiseul      de  Staiuville into Germany, where he again
 signalized himself, and his bravery was rewarded with the gift of
 two pieces of brass cannon.         The peace deprived him of further
 opportunities of distinguishing himself as a soldier, but it did not
 lessen his activity.     We have seen him as a geometrician, a war
 rior, and a negotiator.        We shall now view him as the founder
 of   a colony.
     His various visits to America had made him acquainted with
 the merchants and ship-owners of St. Maloes.              A vessel which
 left that ,port at the commencement of last century had anchored
 on the south-east shores of a group of islands visited by the En
 glish, who had called them at first Virginia and Hawkins's Islands,
 but now the Falkland Islands.         The favourable situation of these
 islands gave rise to the idea of forming an establishment there.
 The French court took up the idea in 1763, and Bougainville
 offered to commence it at his own expense.               In concert with
 two    of  his relatives  he fitted  out  two  ships at St. Maloes, and
 embarked some families, with       whom    he reached the islands called
 the Malouines on the 3d of April 1764. They were inhabited; but
 no violence and no injustice attended his occupation of them.

                                                                           .

                                                                       but

         Count Bougainville, the French Circumnavigator.           373
hut no wood for fuel or erecting houses was to be procured.
 Rose bushes and excellent rich grass were found in abundance.
The foundations of a fort were laid, and the walls were raised of
earth.     Bougainville set the example, and all the colonists took
part in their erection : in the centre of the fort an obelisk was
raised,, and the hemistich " Tibl serviat ultima Thule" was in
scribed under a portrait of the French king : another inscription
exhibited the line in Horace, " Covamur temies grandia."
When these first labours were over, Bougainville returned to
France, leaving the government of the infant colony to one of
his relations.    Next year he returned with a supply of provisions
and new inhabitants.        An excursion to the Straits of Magellan
procured    him  wood   for the purposes of building, and ten thou
sand young forest-and fruit-trees. An alliance was concluded with
the Patagonians ; most kinds of the grain cultivated in Europe were
naturalized, and cultivated with success : the multiplication of
the cattle was a matter of certainty, and the number of the in
habitants rapidly increased from 80 to 150. But these acquisi
tions did not satisfy the active mind of the founder.        They had
alarmed the Spaniards, however, and complaints had been made
by them to the French government.           Bougainville was finally
ordered to deliver up his possession, and the court of Spain agreed
to pay him for his works, and to refund his expenditure.          As a
further consolation, the court of France appointed him to make
a voyage round the world.        The command of the frigate la Bou-
deuse was given him, and the store-ship Etoile was ordered to
join him. The naturalist Commercon and the astronomer Ve«
ron were embarked with him, at his request, to examine the new
 methods of fmding the longitude.
     It was on the third of May 1765 that Bougainville surren
 dered to the Spaniards the colony, which had been scarcely two
years in existence, and of which he foresaw the speedy destruc
 tion : he regretted in particular the loss of an observatory which
 he wished to build there, and which from its position of 51° south
 latitude must have been an useful addition to the great observa
 tories of Europe.     While preparing to quit the island he saw a
 comet for several days, which had ceased to be visible in Europe.
 It was the second comet of 1766 ; and Pingre, who has care
 fully collected all the observations made of it at the Isle of France,
 seems to have been ignorant that it was mentioned in Bougain
 ville's Voyage round the World.
     Since his projects were overthrown his island became of a se
 condary interest to him : all his thoughts were turned to the
 brilliant expedition which he was about to undertake ; but the
 store-ship which was to join him with provisions not having ar
 rived, he thought that some obstacle must have occurred, to pre-

 vent her making the MaIouin.es, and he proceeded to Monte Vi
 deo in quest of her.    He resolved to take a range which could
 not be less than 800 leagues, and which was in fact 1200; for
 he must necessarily return and pass almost within sight of the
  Malouines, in order to penetrate into the Pacific Ocean through
 the Straits of Magellan.     Scarcely had he arrived at Buenos
 Ayres  when   he witnessed the  seizure of the Jesuits of Paraguay.
  He speaks like a man tree from prejudice, and impartially re
 lates every thing which can be urged in favour of the order ; nor
 does he withhold the reproaches which it merits.
    Seven months after his departure he found himself not far
 from the Malouines, opposite Cape Virgins at the entrance of
 Magellan's Straits. Here, by solar and lunar distances observed,
 he again determined the longitude, and ascertained the situation
 of the ship.
    The passage of the straits was dangerous : thick fogs and im-
 petuous winds compelled them to bring-to, and to take sound
 ings incessantly, and the current frequently forced them further
 back than they had advanced.        The fires kindled by the Pata-
 gonians assisted our navigators in making the land.      They were
 well received by the natives, and Bougainville always retained a
grateful sense of their kindness.     This interview impressed him
with a better opinion of their dispositions than he had formerly
entertained. .Here his discoveries commenced. The names given
to the islands, bays, and straits in these latitudes are so many
monuments of the exertions of the French for the advancement
of science : but an unpropitious sky rendered almost useless the
labours of the astronomer Veron, in the island which was called
UObservatoire.
    Storms   accompanied our voyagers until they left the straits.
This passage, which Bougainville estimates at 132 leagues, oc
cupied 52 days of a laborious navigation, which however did not
affect the health of the crew, for on entering the Pacific Ocean
no person was on the sick list.         The navigation then became
easier and more interesting : discoveries were made daily.         To
some of these Bougainville gave names, and of this description
are the Quatre Facardins and the Boudoir.           He perceived the
latter island two days before reaching Ta'iti, (Otaheite).      The
necessity for coming to an anchor was then felt, and it would
have been difficult to have found a more hospitable shore.
    The anchorage, however, was unsafe, for it cost them six an
chors in nine days.
    What contributed greatly to the interest of this visit was the
resolution of a young Otaneitean to come to Europe .with our
voyagers.     He was named Aotourou; but was better known as
Poulaveri, being his pronunciation of the name of his friend Bou
                                                           gainville.

   gainville. This young man amused them much during the voyage:
    it was remarked that he gave names in his own language to the
   most brilliant of the stars, and he had made several voyages to
   the neighbouring islands, the positions of which and the manners
   of the inhabitants he described as well as he could. Aotourou
   remained eleven months at Paris.        The desire to see him was
   great, and his patron neglected no means of making his stay in
   France agreeable.      Aotourou repaid these attentions with the
   warmest gratitude, and by leaving a collection of anecdotes,
   which would have been always read with much pleasure if M. de
   Bougainville had introduced them into the account of his voyage.
   Nothing was omitted to secure his return to his native island in
   a respectable manner. The most costly presents were made him,
   and a sum of 36,000 livres was given him by Bougainville out of his
   own pocket. He was received with great attention at the Isle of
   France ; and Capt. Marion, who was to convey him to Otaheite,
   also took the most particular care of him. He died of the small
   pox, however, during the voyage. The same fate had befallen
  two other islanders who left Otaheite with an English captain,
  eight months before Bougainville.
      After leaving this island, the voyage for a long time presented
  nothing interesting.      The dangers which they met with alone
  interrupted the monotony of their nautical observations ; and the
  most dreadful of all evils, famine, stared them in the face.     The
  rations were reduced, the route was changed, and they renounced
  all attempts at discovering a passage which was long suspected
  to exist.    The glory of this discovery was reserved for Captain
  Cook, who fell in with it most fortunately when his vessel was
  on the point of bemg lost.       A similar danger awaited Bougain
  ville, if the want of provisions had not compelled him to abandon
  the project.     They escaped at length ; a cape received the name
 of Cape Deliverance, but the scurvy now began to commit ra
 vages among the crew.         Fortunately a passage was found through
'the Papon Isles, and they entered the sea of Molucca.          Bourou
 presented a most delicious anchorage, where, notwithstanding
 strict orders to exclude every foreign vessel, the resident per
 mitted them to rest after so many fatigues.          Aotourou, trans
 ported    with  joy at the  sight  of so many objects, asked if Paris
 was as fine as Bourou ; but his admiration was soon checked at
 the sight of the numerous diseased inhabitants contained in Ba-
 tavia, to which he gave the appellation of Enoua mati — Land
 which kills.
      From Batavia the ships proceeded to the Isle of France, from
 thence to the Cape of Good Hope, and subsequently to St. Ma-
 loes, where they arrived on the 16th of March 1769, after a

men out of more than 200.
    This expedition justly placed Bougainville in the rank of the
greatest seamen of his day, and yet it was in some .measure hit
apprenticeship only.     The account which he gave of it was read
with avidity, and afterwards translated by Mr. Foster; for in a se
cond edition, which he published in 1/72, he answers some re
marks of his translator.     His style is simple and natural : he
 there exhibits  his character, his intrepidity, his contempt for
danger, and his penchant for pleasantry ; his goodness of heart,
 and the gaiety with which he contrived always to enforce subor
 dination, and yet to provide for the enjoyments of his crew as
much as for their health.* >
    It has been truly observed, that the geographical charts and
 determinations, with the exception of the latitudes, are the weakest
parts of the work.    But it is fair also to remark that he made a
 voyage of discovery, and not one of mere recomioissance ; that
 dreadful weather rendered all his astronomical attempts useless ;
 that the science of the longitude was in its infancy ; that the
 tables of the moon were not yet brought to the point of perfec
 tion at which they now are ; that navigators then had none of
 the assistance which is lavished upon them at present ; that they
 were still unacquainted with calculations; and that Bougainville.
 was the first Frenchman who took an astronomer with him to
 profit by his observations.
    Upon his return, France was at peace. A wandering and
 agitated life had blunted his taste for the mathematics, and he
 gave himself up to enjoyments which the bustle of his early life
 had not permitted him to share.        His celeBVity and his elegant
 manner procured him admission into the. higher circles ; but his
 active mind was again employed in the service of his country
 when France declared for America.         Under Admirals Lamothe
 Piquet, D'Estaing, and De Grasse, he successively commanded
 the French ships Bien-airnS, Languedoc, Guerrier, and Augnste.
 At the request of D'Estaing he was appointed chef d'escadre,
 and the same year he received the rank of field marshal.          He
 commanded the van at the memorable battle of the Chesapeake
 in 1781, and beat off the English van, obtaining the honourable
 testimony of Count de Grasse to his having contributed more
 than any other person to the victory.       On the disastrous 1 2th
 of April, when the commander in chief was reproached with
 being more occupied with the safety of his own ship than with
 the squadron, and the squadron with not supporting their com
 mander in chief, Bougainville, who commanded the rear guard,
 did all that could be expected of him : by a bold manoeuvre he
                                                                saved

         Coiitit Bougainville, the Frtnch Circamnavigalor.       377
saved the Northumberland; and although the Auguste which lie
commanded was one of the most roughly handled of the whole
 fleet, he collected and conducted to Saint Eustatia the remains
of the shattered squadron.
     The peace which secured the independence of America re
stored M. de Bougainville to that leisure which is so necessary
for the pursuit of the sciences. The Academy conferred upon him
the title of honorary member.        M. Lagrange, whose vote he
asked, observed : " To you it was that I was indebted for being
received into the Academy, since your works opened to me the
career which I pursued."
     About this period he conceived the project of tracing the icy re
gions of the north, and penetrating to the pole.      A distinguished
 astronomer offered to accompany him, and the route was sketched.
 The French ministry however did not accede to his terms, and
 the Royal Society of London asked him for his plans.              He
 transmitted them immediately, pointing out the route which he
 would take. Captain Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave, preferred
 another, one also of Bougainville's suggesting, but he could pro-
 ceed no further than 80°.
     When a spirit of insubordination broke out in the French
 navy, and in the Brest fleet in particular, M. de Bougainville, by
 his reputation, his courage and his firmness, mixed with the most
 amiable qualities, seemed to be the only man capable of recalling
 the seamen to their duty. But his exertions were unavailing; the
 flames of jacobinism had spread too far, and he retired from the
 service in disgust.    In 1791 his name was put upon the list of
 vice-admirals.     This high distinction redoubled his attachment
 to a prince who was abandoned by all. From the massacres of
  1792 .he escaped as if by miracle, and took refuge on his estate
 in Normandy, where he found his two pieces of camion the only
 jecompense which he had received for 40 years service.
     On the restoration of order he was appointed to the Board of
 Longitude; but whether he did not think matters sufficiently settled
  or the care which it was necessary to take of his fortune prohibited
 lam from leaving his estate, he sent in his resignation, and was
 succeeded by Count Fleurien, who afterwards resigned in favour
 of M. de Borda.      When the Institute was formed, M. de Bou
 gainville   was  nominated    to a seat at the Board of Navigation
  and Geography. As President of the Class of Sciences, it was his
 duty to deliver to the emperor the reports of that department,
  and he acquitted himself with great dignity.
      As a senator his pecuniary circumstances were made perfectly
 jeasj ; but although old" age was coming on he possessed all the
  fire and vivacity of youth.    He was still desirous of partaking in
 some hazardous maritime enterprise ; and when his friends men
                                                                tioned

 tioned his age, he replied that Nestor was not altogether useless
 in an army which boasted such heroes as Achilles, Ajax, and
 Diomede.      Although his temperance and sobriety were great,
 and we had hoped to have him long among us, he died on the
 31st of August 1811, after a sharp illness of ten days.
    He had frequently spoken to me of his intention to intrust all
 his memoirs and journals to my care.         This promise prevented
 me  in some    measure  from  presenting myself before him when he
 was in danger, and I have lost much by this reserve.            Let us
 hope that some more adequate person will profit by the possession
 of his valuable materials.
    He was an excellent father and a warm friend.           Incessantly
 occupied    with  the  interests of science,  he seized every oppor
tunity of being useful to it. Frank and loyal in his disposition,
lie rose in life without intrigue, and conducted himself so as to de
serve the esteem of all parties.     He left three sons equally distin
 guished with their father for zeal in the service of their country.

             ome time ago the public attention was called (through
the medium of your Journal) to some errors which had appeared
in one of the Nautical Almanacs ; and it was hoped that the
observations then made would have induced the editor of that
truly valuable work to have taken the requisite precautions to
prevent the recurrence of any similar complaint.          It is indeed
with much regret that I now write to you, with a view of point
ing out some very striking errors which appear on opening the
Nautical Almanac for 1816, and which ought to be corrected
as soon as possible ; because a discovery of this kind very na
turally excites a suspicion that other parts of the work may be
equally inaccurate ; the truth or falsehood of which I have not
time to investigate at present.
    To return, however, to the subject above alluded to : — In the
Introduction to the Nautical Almanac for 1816, you will find
that Septuagesima Sunday, Shrove Sunday, Midlent Sunday,
Palm Sunday, Easter Sunday, Low Sunday, Rogation Sunday,
Whit Sunday, Trinity Sunday, and Advent Sunday, are all re
presented as happening on a Friday : thus, Easter day (which
really falls on Sunday April 14) is said to fall on Friday, March
29 ; Ash Wednesday is said to fall on a Monday ; and Holy
Thursday on a Tuesday ! ! !
    The Chronological Cycles likewise are all wrong : the Domini

     How far the other parts of the work may be correct or not, I
 have not time at present to ascertain : but as even these errors
 ought to be corrected as soon as possible, and as I do not know

An Account of Baths,        and of a Madeira House at Bristol : with
     a Drawing and Description of a Pulmomeler ; and Cases
     showing its Utility in ascertaining the Slate of the Lungs in
     Diseases of the Chest.      By Edward Kentish, M. D. Phy
     sician to the Bristol Dispensary and       to  St. Peter's Hospital.
     London.     Longman and Co.
The       author of the above treatise has had the merit of being
the first in this country to commence an establishment, which has
long been recommended by medical writers, for the relief of vale
tudinarians*.       His Madeira House at Bristol presents most of
the comforts which have been repeatedly suggested as attainable
in our climate, without subjecting persons of delicate or infirm
habits to the expense and risk of a distant voyage.
     The first care of Dr. Kentish was to provide a suite of apart
ments for baths, which promise to be of great service under the
superintendence of a judicious medical attendant. We shall give
the description of this part of the establishment in his own words:
     "  The entrance into the baths is by folding doors, by a plain
unornamented portico, which opens opposite to the east end of
the cathedral, — a large open area, very commodious for the ac
cess to the baths either by carriages, chairs, or on foot.               The
situation is extremely convenient, easily accessible to the inha
bitants of Bristol, and to the visitors of the Hotwells and Clifton,
who may have occasion to use the baths.
    * Dr. Adams, the celebrated author of the work on Morbid Poisons,
first suggested the idea of an establishment of this kind in a letter written
while at Madeira, and inserted in the Medical Journal. Dr. Pearson (to
whom Dr. Kentish pays a well-merited compliment) subsequently exerted
himself to introduce similar improvements in our domestic oeconomv.
                                                                      " The

   "  The large room, in which the baths are placed, is thirty feet
long, by twenty feet wide ; the cirling is fifteen feet high ; and
the whole is lighted by a dome light from above.
   " From the entrance at the portico, a few gentle and easy
steps conduct into the servants' lobby, through which you pass
into the bath room ; this is divided by partitions, twelve feet high,
into four small chambers, the remaining area forming a sort of
waiting room, — large, well lighted, and provided with seats and
a table, where the bathers may amuse themselves with a book
until the bath is prepared ; or, after the use of the bath, remain
in a middle temperature previously to exposing themselves to the
air.
   "   In two corners of the room thereare large reservoirs ; they are
 placed close up to the cieling,   and are inclosed by partitions ;
 they contain each about four hundred gallons, the one of hot, and
 the other of cold water, which is conducted by pipes into each
 of the bath rooms, terminating in the baths, which are made of
 copper, and japanned in such a manner as to imitate the verd
 antique marble.     Fimm each of the baths there is a waste pipe,
 which carries off the water when done with in the bath ; these
unite into one common pipe, which cpnveys it through the water-
 closets of the house.   Thus the bather sees the water drawn fresh
 from the reservoirs for his own use, and may see it run to waste
 if he chooses. By these means the impossibility of having a bath
 which has been used is complete.      Adjoining one of the warm
 baths there is a shower bath containing twelve gallons, which is
 charged with hot or cold water at the wish of the patient.    Into
 this bath also are conveyed the hot or cold douches.
     " The warm water reservoir is provided with a false bottom,
 about two inches from the real one ; between these two bottoms
 a current of strong steam is thrown by the means of a small
 boiler placed in a room below the bath room ; the water above
 the false bottom absorbs the heat of the vapour, condenses it
 into water, which falls back into the boiler, where it again re
 ceives a proportion of heat, and carries it back to the false bot
 tom.    Ey this process the water becomes heated in the reser
voir to about 150 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer ; it pro
 bably' might be carried higher.   This is as high as I have had   it,
 and   is much more than an adequate heat for any purpose of
bathing. The main steam pipe which passes from the boiler to
•the reservoir, goes through the vapour bath room, from whence
 the steam  is drawn in any manner which may be required      ;   it   is
 made to pass in any direction, and may be impregnated with
 anj substances that might be desired. The various vapour
 douches, jets, and other modes of locally applying this power to
 different parts of the body, are so arranged as to be under the

guidance of the assistant.         This combination of local with the
general use of the vapour bath, is capable of producing effects,
which nothing less than having been a witness to them myself
could have induced me to believe.
    " In case the warm reservoir should have been too freely
used, and the temperature should not be found equal to the re
quired degree, each warm bath is provided with the means of
being heated separately.        One has a double bottom, between
which steam is conveyed, which imparts its heat to the water,
and may be thus raised to any temperature.              The other warm
baths are provided with a steam pipe, which descends to the
bottom of the bath, and steam is thrown into the water, on the
same principle as Count Rumford fitted up an apparatus for
Mr. Gott of Leeds.
    " The manner of heating water according to this mode of
the Count's, is attended with several inconveniences.               The
steam going into cold water, is suddenly robbed of its heat, be
comes condensed, and forms a vacuum ; according to the quan
tity condensed, a corresponding report is produced. If the pipe is
of three or four inches diameter, the report would be equal to the
report of a musket or pistol. Another material inconvenience is
the great vibration caused by these reiterated concussions, which in
a short time would destroy the integrity of any machinery.           To
overcome these objections, I have consulted many artists and en
gineers, and have been at much trouble and expense in a variety
of experiments.       The means I have found the most effectual to
overcome the      difficulties  just enumerated, is to have a small
copper pipe of three quarters of an inch diameter, conveyed
round three sides of the bottom of the bath ; this pipe is to be
perforated by an infinite number of small holes, not larger than
 the perforations made in the top of a copper watering pot ; the
perforations should commence in the pipe five or six inches after
it has reached the bottom of the bath, and continue to the en
tire end ; by this means the small bubbles of steam, passing
through these small apertures, are condensed with little noise and
 very trifling violence.      This is a very good mode of heating
water, and very applicable to the heating of baths.          The double
bottom,    in many instances,     is better, particularly where the ma
 terial would be injured by an addition of water : for the steam,
 which is thrown in by the steam pipe, is condensed into water,
 and adds considerably to the quantity of fluid in the vessel thus
 heated.     This is not the case with the false bottom, as the wa
 ter does not communicate with the bath, but is condensed and
 cpllected, being pure distilled water ; which is applicable to a
 variety of useful purposes, for saline solutions, required in mak
 ing artificial mineral waters.. From this account may be col
                                                                  lected

lected the various combinations of power in applying heat or
cold which are concentrated in this establishment.        Had I stop
ped here, the arrangement would have been incomplete.             Mo
dern chemistry enables us not only to decompose and recompose
water itself, which was regarded as a simple element, but also
to analyse, and form, by artificial combinations, compounds si
milar in every respect to the natural medicated springs.            As
this island, at all times, is wanting in some of the most powerful
mineral waters which are only found upon the continent, and at
present even the rich of our island cannot benefit from their use,
 I trust that I am doing an acceptable service to the public, when
I enable them to receive all the beneficial effects, without the
trouble or expense of a sea voyage, and a tedious journey amongst
strangers in a foreign land."
    After a concise description of the most celebrated baths on
the continent, Dr. Kentish proceeds to show the analogies be
tween the physiology of plants and animals, and treats of the ef
fects of climate on animal and vegetable life.     This leads him to
another part of his plans for the amelioration of the condition
of the infirm, viz. the Madeira House, of which he gives the
following description    :
    "  I adhere to this term in my description,    as it has been an
nounced to the public in the Prospectus republished in the
first part of this Essay.     The term Conservatory might be ap
plied to it with more propriety.       The intention is to have the
power,    in a building  or house,  of regulating the temperature in
each apartment.       As it might be wished to have a temperature
much above that of Madeira, the term is therefore not strictly
appropriate.     The use of fires to warm houses, as* well as to
answer the purposes of cooking, bears date from the earliest
times.     Wood was for many ages the chief fuel. When coal
was first introduced, it had many prejudices to combat before it
was admitted into general use. The manner in which our house?
were warmed for several centuries was perfectly devoid of all
sound principles of philosophy : it was not until the latter part
of the last century that philosophy deigned to apply its princi
ples to the useful purposes of life.     Society owes more to Count
Rumford,     for his investigations respecting the application of fuel
to all useful purposes, than to any other.       Not only are we in
debted to him for what he has done, but infinitely more so for
what he has caused others to do, by having given a direction to
genius to employ itself upon the practically useful.      Several me
thods have been devised for warming buildings :         — the Russian
and German stoves ; flues, after the manner of hot-houses ; iron
pipes heated by steam ; stone bottles filled with hot water ;
keeping cows in the room, &c. &c.            These methods may an

has served the purposes of respiration and combustion must have
a   free egress, and fresh-charged          atmospheric air be freely ad

from the bottom to the top of the building               from this pipe cur

the top of the house, in pipes, to all the various parts below its
level, following the laws of specific gravity.             As heated air has
specific levity     with  regard   to  the  atmospheric air,       we have     if          a

in the windows or through the door, causing cold currents of
air, playing upon the persons in the room between these crevices
and the fire.       In this new mode of giving warm air to a room,

is, to get an equal distribution       of heat*      In a room, on a coltl
winter's day, when the thermometer in the shade stood at 28, I
 had as good a fire as the Bath stove, or grate of the room, would
.enable me to have ; I then took a thermometer, and plaeed it
 in different parts of the room— in all the corners of the room
 where it was not under the direct influence of the fire, it stood at
 45 degrees ; I then brought it into the direct rays of the fire,
 and carried it to within a few inches of the bars, when I found it
 rise to 1 80.   From this experiment we see to what a great range
 of temperature we are exposed, when we imagine ourselves so
 situated as to be free from the influence of the external air : on
 the contrary, in my study, there is not a variation of 5 degrees
 in any part of the room, except when you approach very near to.

The author takes for granted that a healthy man with a well
formed chest is able to throw out and take in at one inspiration
between eight and nine pints of air.    The breathing capacity of

pint to four or five. We give the doctor's description of the

operations, is liable to mistake, as the vessel the air is passed
under should be sufficiently large to i.eceive the whole of the air
at once; otherwise it would require two or three operations,
which would render it more doubtful.         As some healthy subjects
inspire above a gallon of air, the jar should hold five quarts at
least, and this is above the rate of common recipients : besides,
it requires some practice' and dexterity to convey gaseous fluids
from one vessel to another, and it is also a most unpleasant ope
ration. These objections induced me to try other means.              I
then had a tin apparatus, made upon the principle of the pneu
matic bellows, as described in Mr. Watts's pneumatic apparatus.
The difficulty of having this so nicely balanced as to give the ex
act proportion, obliged me to make further efforts, for the fric

unto six quarts.      The trough is filled with water up to number
four, so that two quarts of water stand in the bottom of the jar
 when it is ready for use ; at the upper part of the jar a tube
 passes, in which is fixed a stop cork ; about two inches above
the cork the tube turns at a right angle, and is carried horizon

 April 28.  J. HE conclusion of Dr. Brewster's paper on Mother
of Pearl was read. The author considers the optical phaeno
mena of mother of pearl very different from those of all other
bodies:  in some of his experiments the thickness of the pearl
plates did not produce any change on the phaenomena, in others

 some    difference appeared : the polarization of light by mother
 of pearl   is different from that of the bodies which he had before
 examined : he found it impossible to give wax, cement, &c. ex
 actly the same powers as Iceland spar, although they receive the
 impression from mother of pearl, so as to produce similar optical
 phaenomena.         It appears that the particular luminous structure
 of mother of pearl is such, that, however finely it may be polished,
 it still retains the power, of reflecting highly coloured image*,
 and that if a piece be merely cut it reflects only one image, but
 if polished two are seen. These facts are ascribed to the pecu
 liar stria? of this substance, which are very fine, yet may in some
.specimens be seen with the naked eye ; in others there are above
 3000 of them in an inch.
     May 5.      Capt. Cater furnished a long paper, containing a
 description    of  a new instrument for dividing mathematical in
 struments,    which     he considers an improvement of Troughton's ;
 he acknowledged that he was anticipated in the principles of his
 improvement, but alleged that it was never before reduced to
 practice.     A brief description of this instrument would not be
 intelligible without a plate : to it he applies three microscopes,
 one of which is fixed and two are moveable, antf suggests modes
  of correcting the errors of observation, and preventing the mi
  croscopes from coming in contact with each other.
. > May 12.        Dr. B. Heyne read a paper to the Society, relating
 the process by which the Hindoos oxidate silver for medical
 purposes.      The secret was communicated to him by an ancient
  and learned Hindoo, by whom it is esteemed of great value ; he
  afterwards repeated the process himself.       A rupee which weighs
 three drachms was hammered into a plate three inches broad ;
  it was then immersed in the milk of plants, chiefly of the eu-
 pliorbia genus. The plate was heated, and plunged into this fluid
  above twenty times, when it acquired only a dark-gray colour ;
  it was afterwards placed between the leaves of plants, and re
  peatedlv heated to a degree l>elow smelting, and each time
  plunged.into the milk of plants or cow-dung, till the plate was
 finally oxidated, so that it could be squeezed to powder between
  the fingers ; and in this state it is given as a sovereign remedy in
  most diseases.        Dr. H. found that water produced the same
  effect in facilitating the oxidation, as the milk of plants or cow-
  dung.     As he could find no information in chemical works re
  specting the particular properties of the milk of plants, he was
  induced to make some experiments on that from several species
  of euphorbia. In some the juice is aptly called mijk, like the
  caoutchouc or elastic gum ; in others it is colourless or thin, and
  inspissates when exposed to the air ; others again emit a deep-
  celoured fluid, which assumes a gummy or resinous character.

 In all   these different kinds    Dr. H. found traces of ammonia and
 azote  ;   and hence he concludes with Sprengel, that the narcotic
principle     is owing to azote, which is probably combined with
ammonia.
    May 19. A letter to the President from Dr. Brewster was
read, mentioning his observations on the effects which heated
glass produces on light.         Dr. B. being engaged in various ex
periments of this nature, noticed the effect which wax melted be
tween two plates of glass had on light, and was thence induced to
experiment on the glass properly heated.               For this purpose he
adopted      those  pieces  of  glass  called  Prince  Rupert's drops ; he
ground      them   with perpendicular     and  parallel faces, and also at
right angles ; but he uniformly found that they either wholly or
partially depolarized light, and that he could not transmit
through them a ray of pulverized light without its undergoing
some modification.
    Mr. Herschel laid before' the Society a mathematical paper
on Analysis : it was divided into four sections ; but being en
tirely algebraical, it was of a nature not adopted for public ready
 ing.
    Captain Cater furnished an account of his additional experi
ments on the comparative powers of the Cassegrainian and Gre
gorian telescopes.         His object was to discover if some error
might not have crept into his former experiments, and whether
he was not deceived by some optical delusion, which occasion
ally misleads young and sanguine observers.               F6r this purpose
he caused different persons to examine the appearances : some
of them knew nothing of the subject of his inquiry, yet all of
them concurred in the same observation.               Nevertheless he ad
mits the great liability to errors in such experiments, and cor
rects many of the observations by calculation.               He made a va
riety  of   experiments    with  the  reflectors, which   in general tended
to prove the superiority of the Cassegrainian over the Gregorian
telescope.
    May 26. Sir Everard Home, bart. gave an historical sketch
of the nature and effects of the different injuries of the brain,
with a view to embody facts so that inquirers and observers might
more easily direct their researches.          Sir Everard did not profess
to state any new discovery, but merely to relate some cases which
had occurred in his own practice: he divided his paper into sec
tions, each of which describes an injury of the brain, with its
physical and mental effects. The first was pressure; and if this be
either too great or too little, tne consequence is violent head
aches, vomiting, &c.           He next considered the effects of water,
and related some cases where six beer pints were contained in
the brain without dettioying the vital functions, or the mind. In
                                     Bb2                              other

other cases, a few ounces occasioned delirium, paralysis, and
death.    Sir Everard made several sections of the different kinds
of ulceration of the brain, and detailed minutely their corporeal
and mental effects. He also noticed that the cerebellum might
be wounded without the patient knowing it; that part of it might
be extravasated without danger, but that any wound in the pia
mater was extremely painful.
    The Society then adjourned to the 9th of June.

   Dec. 1, 1813. A paper "On the crystallographical Method
of Hatiy," by Dr. J. O. Reardon, was read.
   In this paper a concise statement of the theory of the learned
Abbe was given, and also of the principal arguments brought for
ward in its support. The objections that have been offered to the
system by various philosophers, as well as the replies of the Abbe,
were then noticed : and a number of observations were made on
the validity of the former, and the adequacy of the' latter.
   March 23, 1814. A paper "On an extensive Bed of Mag-
nesian Limestone, found in the vicinity of Dublin," by S. Witter,
Esq. was read.
   An account of the analysis and of some peculiar circumstances
attending the calcination of the stone, was first given. 36 per
cent. of carbonate of magnesia were found in combination with
51 of carbonate of lime; the remaining portion being made up
by silex, oxides of iron, and manganese.      After some geological
observations, the paper concluded with some remarks on the ap
plication of the mineral to the purposes of practical husbandry.
   The same gentleman likewise read a series of observations,
with an account of some experiments relating to the formation
and properties of iodine.    In allusion to the question of its ele
mentary nature, he referred to some striking similarities in certain
well known compounds.

                         [Continaed from p. 313.]'
    "  The height of the walls of Pompeii may give some idea of
the labours which their complete excavation requires, and which
 is now prosecuting with great vigour.         A ditch has been ex
 cavated   twelve  feet broad.    For the space of about eight toises
 the walls are completely uncovered, and persons may now walk
upon the pavement of the ancient street leading from. Pompeii
to Nola.     The other parts still remain buried. The workmen
are already 500 toises from the gate at which they set out, and
 have cleared nearly one third of the circumference of the city.
Proceeding along the great street, they have uncovered the upper
part of the portico of the Grand Theatre. The point of the wall
to which it adjoins is not far from the .Amphitheatre.            This
building, although formerly partly uncovered,        was again  buried
under rubbish because it did not present any object of sufficient
importance for a museum, or to arrest curiosity.            In conse
 quence of this bad system, many houses jn Pompeii were again
covered with the ashes from which they had emerged. At the
present moment however, and for many years back, if the excar
vations did not produce any thing interesting, the workmen have
not desisted.     They now consider every thing as new monu
ments added to those which they already possess.         Besides, it is
well known that all the tablatures, statues, and medals belong
ing to a cabinet, have not the same valtte when taken separately,
but will become doubly precious when the collection is made
 complete.
    " The   excavations around the walls of the city have not sus
pended those in other quarters.         One of the most interesting
discoveries was made on the 21st of November 1812.             During
 the preceding week the workmen had been occupied in clearing
the great street leading to the Temple of Isis, and which traverses
 the whole of the city in a straight line.         They suddenly met
with another street opening into the great" street, and at the
joining of the two streets discovered the capitals of several co
lumns which seemed to have composed the portico of a theatre.
The excavations were then directed towards the house known by
 the name of La Caza del General Championne.t, and two in
 scriptions scarcely legible were discovered, but appearing rather
insignificant.    When working about ten feet from the extremity
 of the street,   where    the rubbish consisted alternately of earth,

                                 Pompeii.                           391
   and ashes, and there appearing to be no probability of finding
  any interesting object, they were about to leave off, when they
  unexpectedly found a human skeleton and several bones, some
  medals of bronze and silver and one of gold, and finally a large
  heap of medals that were collected with great care.       They were
  for the most part, particularly those of bronze and silver, fused
  into each other, and it was difficult to distinguish the inscriptions
  on account of the patina with which they were covered.          They
  were medals of Domitian and other emperors, of the smallest
  size, very common, but well preserved ; 316 in silver, and 42 in
  bronze.    But what attracted most attention was eight beautiful
  medals of gold newly struck, wrapt up in several folds of linen,
  which seemed to have been injured by humidity and the infection
  from the human bodies.       However, the texture was so good that
 these stripes could hardly be torn.      This may be considered as
  one of the greatest curiosities which Pompeii ever afforded.
     " The skeleton just mentioned was found among the ashes
  about ten feet above -the level of the street. This is a proof of
 the rapiditv with which the city was overwhelmed, /as it is pro
 bable that this individual was endeavouring to save himself by
 flight.   It will also make it evident that Pompeii was buried by
 one 'single and not by repeated eruptions, as some writers are
 disposed to insinuate.
     "  On the same day that this skeleton was discovered near the
 Theatre, several others were found in the streets. A mother
 flying with part of her family. consisting of two young girls and
 an infant, the skeleton of which was still clinging to the breast
 of the mother : all hopes seem to have' left them ; trying still to
 breathe amid the burning ashes, and clinging to the walls of the
 portico, they appear to have sunk under the effects of fatigue and
 grief: the lava had buried them in the same grave, and their
 bones were mixed with each other as if they were embracing at
 the last moment of their existence.      Three gold rings and ear-
 pendents adorned with pearls, found near them, bespoke their
'riches and rank in society ; one of the rings was in the form of
 a serpent in many folds.      On another ring, which from its size
 must have belonged to a young girl, a garnet was fixed on which
 a thunderbolt was engraved.        The ear-rings resembled those of
 the same age which are to be seen in the Cabinet of Antiquities
 at Paris ; two of the pearls were in good preservation ; the others
 have suffered considerably.
     "A   great quantity of marbles, adorned with forms of animals
 elegantly modelled, were found amassed at the foot of a part of
 the walls of the house where these skeletons were found, as if
 destined to ornament it.      It seems to have been a house of the
 most elegant architecture, and decorated with excellent pictures,
                                B b 1                             which

which for the sake of antiquarians have been permitted to re
main for the present.       One picture represented the figure of
Peace, upon a red ground, holding an olive branch in the right
hand and in the left a cornucopia : she is winged, and repre
sented flying to diffuse her blessings over the world : a light
transparent habit covers her body from the girdle downwards :
on the whole, this is one of the best specimens qf the style of
painting of the aera in which it was executed.
     "Among the antique objects found in the inside of this house?
a large bronze plate was found with a double bottom, which
must have served to keep the victuals hot.           It resembled a sir
milar utensil now in use, and which is occasionally filled with
warm water : the difference between the ancient and modern
utensil seems to be, that in the former the article to be kept
hot was deposited between two thin vessels containing hot
water.
     te                                          of glass vases found,
        There were also    a great number
from three to six inches deep, in the form ot cups, and some
drinking cups of singular appearance.          They were adorned so as
to represent  various figures, of  the different  colours of silver, gold,
opal, sapphire, and emeralds : time has given them a brilliancy
which modern artists will in vain attempt to imitate.           The glass
which has been found at Pompeii is generally well wrought: the.
forms of the various utensils are different, but they are all regular
and elegant : the bottles, caraffs, and other small vessels used in
domestic affairs, are very round, and present no veins or flaws.
 They' are mostly of coloured glass. Their utensils of white glass
are by no means so beautiful as those of modern Europe.
   ,
     "  The same house has also produced many pieces of very cu

     M. Baptist Lendi, of St. Gall, has invented a new hygrometer,

butes   to the ornament of a room, but likewise predicts every
possible change of weather 12 or 14 hours before it occurs.     As
soon as the metal is suspended in the bottle with water, it be
gins to increase in bulk, and in 10 or 12 days forms an admi
rable pyramid, which resembles polished brass ; and it under
goes several changes, till it has attained its full dimensions. In
rainy weather this pyramid is constantly covered with pearly
drops of water ; in case of thunder or hail, it will change to the
finest red, and throw out rays : in case of wind or fog, it will
appear dull and spotted ; and previously to snow it will look
,quite muddy.     If placed in a moderate temperature, it will re
quire  no other trouble  than to pour out a common tumbler full of
water, and to put in the same quantity of fresh.       For the first
few days it must not be shaken.
             PROGRESS OF VACCINATION                  IN THE EAST.
             Extract of   a   Letter from Bagdad, dated       the 24th   of August.
  " Jean de    Murat of Constantinople,    and at present a merchant
in Bagdad,    has had the good fortune to introduce     vaccination on
the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates.       Animated by a desire to
be useful to his fellow- creatures in a country where small-pox,
if it be not always iriortal, leaves frightful mutilations and defor
mities, had long exerted himself to make the practice of vacci
nation general in this city,      His humane endeavours were long'
fruitless, in consequence of the prejudices inseparable from igno
rant ininds. An accident also happened which strengthened these
prejudices.    The British resident eleven years ago attempted                        it,
and failecj.    Seconded by Dr. Short, Mr. Jones, the English
surgeon, having obtained vaccine matter from Dr. Carro and
Lord Elgin, vaccinated two poor children, whom he procured
more by means of money than in consequence of any assurances
pfsuccess. The vaccine took in the arms of both. Mr. Jones, how
ever, not having been careful in the choice of these two infants,
one which was in good health recovered well, but the other,
which had been long sickly, died          few days after being vacci
                                                a
nated.     This accident frightened every body and Mr. Jones has
                                                          ;
never since been able to procure any other subject for his experi
ments.     The idea of vaccination was therefore abandoned.
    " In the mean time, Jean de Murat sent repeatedly to Constant
tinople for matter, but all his efforts to introduce        for several
                                                                     it
years were in vain.     In 1810, however, having         child born to
                                                                 a
him, he obtained an opportunity of exhibiting in his own family
the excellence of this preventive of small-pox. He procured vac
 cine matter from Aleppo, and inoculated his new-born infant.
                                                                                 The

 The   success   answered his expectations, and produced the effect
 desired on  the  minds of several Christians who had been witnesses
to the operation : they immediately brought their children to be
vaccinated, and their example was followed by all the other
 Christians. The Turks and the Arabs have since been converted,
notwithstanding their religious prejudices, to a firm belief of its
utility.   Upwards.of ninety-six of the children of the latter were
inoculated in the course of the year 1813; and, among others,
those of the Mufti, and the Defterdar Davoud Effendi, brother-
in-law to the Pacha of Bagdad, who has conferred upon Jean de
 Murat a public testimony of his approbation.
    " Not contented with his success at Bagdad, the same benevo
lent Turk is endeavouring to propagate vaccination in Mesopo
tamia and Armenia.       He has sent missionaries to Moussoul and
 Erivan, furnished with instructions written in Arabic and Arme
nian, having previously taught them to perform the operation."
    M. Buchclz has recently analysed     a new bitumen found     in the
environs of Halle in Saxony, which      he  thinks strongly resembles
the resino-asphaltum described by Mr. Hatch'ett some years ago
in the Philosophical Transactions. According to M..Bucholz,
that which is found at Halle is composed of two resins, one of
which is very soluble in alcohol, and approaches to the vegetable
resins, forming 91 parts of the bitumen ; while the other, which
forms nine parts, has some analogy to amber.
    The following are a few of the most characteristic marks of
this substance : It is found in balls the size of an apple, en
veloped in gray crystallized gypsum : in colour it is brownish,
or pale vellow : fracture glossy, and very brittle : it does not
become soft under the fingers ; it even does not melt so easily
as other resins, but while melting it exhales an agreeable smell,
something like that of animal resm and styrax.            M. Bucholz
remarks that, as Mr. Hatchett could dissolve only 55 parts of
the bitumen examined by him, while the former dissolved 91,
it is extremely probable that this difference was occasioned by
 Mri Hatchett's using common alcohol.
  . The nine grains     which were insoluble in alcohol were dis-.
solved, but with much difficulty, in boiling oil.       It was fusible
in a strong heat, and gave out the smell of common resin.
    The 91 parts above mentioned, when separated from the al
coholic solution, were dissolved by ether, and formed a brown
ish tincture, while ether of a specific gravity of 0'710, rectified
over muriate of lime, made scarcely any impression.         Oil of tur
pentine and rectified petroleum have little or no effect upon this
resin.    Caustic potash dissolved in two parts of water does not
dissolve this resin ; but when the lixivium is decanted, the resi
                                                                    due

   The Russian Government has made considerable progress to
wards opening a communication with the northern regions of
America by the way of Siberia. The Tschuktsches, a nation
inhabiting the north-east part of Siberia, having been continu
ally in a state of war with the Kourakes, who inhabit the shores
of the sea of Ochotks, the latter threw themselves under the
protection of Russia.      The prudent measures adopted by the
Russian Commissary Banner succeeded in inducing the Tschu-
ktsches to make peace with the Kourakes, and to come every
year into the circle of Nischnekolyma to exchange their furs for
iron, tobacco, and other goods.     This traffic was carried oh for
several years ; and finally they submitted themselves to the Rus
sian government in form.       On the 9th of March 1813 they
sent a deputation of 70 persons to fort Angora, on the great
river Anui : these deputies took the oath of fidelity to the Em
peror of Russia, and many of them were baptized according to
the rites. of the Greek church.       The chiefs have engaged a
fox's skin for every individual baptized, in name of tribute. The
trade with these new subjects of the Russian empire has since
become brisker than ever ; and there is every reason to believe
that the Russians will speedily, by advancing over-land to
Behring's straits, open a communication with the people of
America who inhabit these coasts, and who can supply abundance
of teeth of sea-horses and furs of great value.
   the new French Government has resumed the digging of the
grand canal of Ourcq, in the vicinity of Paris. The works had
been suspended for several years in consequence of the late un
happy state of France.
   The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &c. in France,
held its grand anniversary meeting at Paris on the 11th of the
present month.      M. Degeraud commenced the business of the
day by reading an interesting biographical notice of the late
Joseph Montgolfier, the aeronaut.
   Among the novelties which were exhibited, and which had
been honoured by the Society's approbation, were some beautiful
specimens of varnished metal fabricated by M. Deharme : various
kinds of fire.arms on a new construction : some pieces of em
broidered velvet of superior elegance : shawls of an extraordi
nary breadth (two ells and a halt) : various modifications of Ar-
gand's lamp : platina utensils and instruments : and porcelain

 months of June and July, and is performed by means of an in-        .

 the worm ; and these parts of different worms are, as it were,

 worm opposed to it.        The young ones are at first perceived in
 the white organs which are placed forward on both sides of the
 stomach, and then glide between the intestines and the exterior
 muscles, until they reach a reservoir situated in the thick part of
 the tail, where they are easily seen full of animation.   M. Mon-

 both of animals and of plants.

    f  This fine day brought numerous insects, particularly many of the
  coleopterous kind.    Many of these suddenly make their first appearance
 and are numerous on one day. Swallows are not common here yet.

  LXXXVI.       Supplement           to       the Memoir        on the Nitrates      and
               Nitrites of Lead,                By M. Chevreul*.
 Since    the publication of my Memoir on the Combinations of
  Lead with the nitric and nitrous Acids f, there have appeared
  in the Annales de Chimie two memoirs on the same subject by
  M. BerzeliitSj being the conclusion of his experiments upon the
 determinate proportions in which the elements of inorganic
 nature exist.    I purpose in the present supplement to compare
 our results, in order that a judgement maybe formed of the dif
 ferences between those of each.
     M. Berzelius has described by the name of subnitrate at the
 minimum the salt which I have called nitrate of lead : he ob
 tained it by putting into the solution of octohedral nitrate a
 quantity of ammonia insufficient to saturate its acid : I pre
 pared it by boiliug the octohedral nitrate over litharge.   Our
 analyses differ but very little, as may be seen:
                                                   Berzelius.      Chevreul.

            Oxide                     80.50     .. 80.14
They agree in proving that this salt contains twice as much base
as the octohedral nitrate.
   According to the observation which I have made of the cor
respondence' between the composition of the subnitrite of lead
at the minimum | with the subnitrate at the minimum §, and
from the consideration that the carbonic acid when passed into
the solution of subnitrite separated from it such a quantity
of base, that what remained in it was to the acid in a propor
tion which appeared to correspond with the composition of the
octohedral nitrate       suspected that there must be
                        ||,I                               subnitrate     a
corresponding    with the subnitrite of lead at the maximum       and          ;
I  have even said that     would be interesting to inquire
                               it                                 the          if
alkalis  inacting, upon the nitrate of lead would   not  produce it.

    +See the two preceding numbers of this Magazine.
    XFor the same reason that M. Berzelius has called the foregoing nitrate
of lead, subnitrate at the minimum, he has called the subnitrite at the mini
mum, the salt which   I  have called nitrite; and subnitrite at the maximum,
that whichI   have called subnitrite.       shall adopt this nomenclature, in
                                               I

  § Adopting    the   analysis of the          nitric   and nitrous acids of M. Gay-
Lussac.
     I
    ||  have said "appeared to correspond," because there      a difference of
                                                                     is
2'78 between the result of the experiment and that of the calculation: but
this difference may be owing to there remaining in the solution of the sub
nitrite precipitated  bythe carbonic acid, an excess of this acid which may
concur in retaining a portion of base.            If
                                            this be the case, the quantity of
oxide remaining in the liquor    augmented.

4 02                Supplement        to the    Memoir on
This presumption     has been verified by M. Berzelius ; but the
analysis which he made of this salt does not correspond exactly
with the composition of the subnitrite at the maximum. Ac
cording to this' chemist, the subnitrate at the maximum contains :
                   Acid                        9.81
                   Base                       90.19
He thinks that it contains more than four times as much base as
the octohedral nitrate.      If,
                               according to my analysis of the sub-
nitrate of lead at the minimum, we admit that          only contains  it
four times as much, we shall have the following proportions:
              Acid                     10.96        100  .   .
              Oxide                   89.04    .. 812
and for the proportions of the subnitrite.at the maximum                              :
                    Acid                ,     9.80
                    Oxide                    90 20
and    Ifound  by  experiment the composition of this last salt to
be:                  Acid                               9.90
                     Oxide                             90.10
   M. Berzelius and    I have seen that when we boiled the octo
 hedral  nitrate of lead with  lead, there was not formed any ni
 trate at the minimum of oxidation, but a combination of nitrous
 acid and of oxide of lead       that according to the duration of
                                  ;
 the ebullition, and the quantity of lead employed, we obtained
 two different subnitrites.    We have seen besides, that a portion
 of the acid was reduced into nitrous gas. The agreement which
 subsists between these observations does not admit of there
 being any doubt on the subject.        The same agreement seems
 to subsist between our analyses of the subnitrites    for the sub -        ;
 nitrite at the minimum       formed

    M. Berzelius did not find any water        the subnitrite at the
                                                      in

temperature of 100° (centigrade}, as well as to the rays of the
sun, I obtained water from it which I heated in an elbngated tube.
    M. Berzelius says that this salt crystallizes in small scales of
a  brick-coloured   red : that which I have described was in needles .
of a flesh colour; and what led me to think that the salt of
M. Berzelius was not so well saturated with base as mine, was,
that I obtained crystals similar to those which he has described,
when the solution of octohedral nitrate had not been long enough
boiled over the lead : besides, in my experiment, 1 00 parts of
octohedral nitrate dissolved 134-5 of lead, whereas in that of
M. Berzelius they only dissolved 1165 : and finally, I obtained
to the very last needles of flesh colour from the solution of ni
trate boiled over lead, whereas M. Berzelius obtained subnitrite
at the minimum with his subnitrite at the maximum.
    M. Berzelius prepared the subnitrite at the minimum by
M. Proust's process ; but, according to mine, the salt thus pre
pared is not a pure nitrite : it contains nitrate of lead.     I think
that my experiments ought to leave        no  doubt on the subject :
for (a) when we dissolve this salt in water, we obtain subnitrate
at the minimum ; (b) when we treat its solution by the carbonic
 acid, we separate from it a part of the oxide, and by evaporating
the liquor we obtain, 1st, scales of a yellowish white, formed
of subnitrite and subnitrate at the minimum ; 2d, white needles
 of subnitrate at the minimum; 3d, yellow crystals, resembling
in form the octohedral nitrate of lead.           When we decom

 yellow crystals of subnitrite at the minimum*, which being re-
 dissolved in water yield ouly yellow scales of subnitrite at the

404                Supplement to the Memoir on
 the subnitrite at the minimum of M. Proust, decomposed by the
carbonic acid.      M. Berzelius in treating them with water ob
tained subnitrate from them.         He thinks that this last is formed
 during   the operation;   but   what   I have reported above seems to
contradict this opinion.       These crystals, according to this che
 mist, give 0.70 of residue when we distil them.               I have said
that they may be formed of acid nitrate and of nitrite: the re
sult of M. Berzelius supports this conjecture.            If there exists a
neutral nitrite, we ought to find it in the solution of pure sub-
 nitrite at the minimum passed over carbonic acid and left to
 itself.   See the note to No. 37 in my memoir.
     M. Berzelius says that the white pellicle which is formed by
 the contact of the air in the solution of the subnitrates is sub-
 nitrate : I regard it as being produced by the combination of
 the carbonic, acid of the air with the oxide of lead.          I found my
 opinion upon    the  subnitrite  at the   minimum,     when   dissolved  in
 water, not giving any     white   pellicle when it is in     contact   with
 pure oxygen gas, and when it is disturbed by a single atom of
 carbonic acid : I do not pretend, in short, that the carbonate of
 lead which .is precipitated is not mixed with a little subnitrate :
 I have not made any experiment to enable me to ascertain the
contrary.
     M. Berzelius, having seen that the subnitrite at the minimum
 left 0.S0 of base when it was distilled, and that the greatest
 part of the acid disengaged was condensed in the water of cry
stallization in the state of fuming nitric acid, endeavoured to
determine, according to the laws which he had discovered, the
relation of the water to the acid.         He determined this ratio on
the hypothesis that azote is a simple body, and also that it is a
compound of oxygen and ammonium.                On the first hypothesis,
 the subnitrite at the minimum ought to be formed :
                      Acid                     18.13

                      Water                      I'b7
    But according    to M. Berzelius, this result     is inadmissible, be
cause    the water is in too' small quantity to enable it to con
dense the greater part of the acid to the liquid state, and this
quantity does not agree with the law of the water of crystal
lization of salts. According to the second hypothesis, the sub
nitrite ought to be formed:
                     Acid                        13.6
                     Oxide                       800
                     Water                         6.4
    M. Berzelius admits this result, because it agrees with the
laws which he has established: thus the base contains 5*72
oxygen, water 5.88, and the nitrous acid twice as much.
                                                                     I have

                   the   Nitrates and Nitrites of Lead.              405
   I have    spoken in my memoir of the difficulty of determining
the water of the subnitrite at the minimum, because the acid
begins to he disengaged from it at a temperature of 100° centi
grade: in order to attain this, I heated on a sand-bath at a
gentle heat some subnitrite at the minimum, until no more di
minution of weight took place.            The salt when thus heated
*till retained some water. As it may be objected with reason
that a portion of acid may have been volatilized, I made a test,
by distilling the subnitrite with its water in a small glass retort
communicating with a tube filled with muriate of lime : the re
sult of this experiment confirmed the former; only the propor
tion of base was a little stronger.      It would be needless to detail
this experiment; but, as M. Berzelius is of a different opinion,
 I shall describe it minutely.
    I put 100 parts of pure subnitrite at the minimum which con
tained 80 of base into a very small glass retort blown with a
lamp.     A tube 14 millimetres in diameter, curved, communi
cated witl) the retort bv one of its extremities, and bv the other
to a bent tube filled with calcined muriate of lime.            The ex
tremities of this tube by which the gases were extricated were
inserted into mercury.       The weight of the whole apparatus was
determined with a very nice balance.            I put the retort on a
wire grating supported by bricks, and placed under it a spirit
lamp : when the retort was heated, I surrounded it with burning
coals : a little water was extricated, nitrous acid gas in great
quantity, which soon filled the whole apparatus, and a part of
which escaped.       When the operation was terminated, and when
all the liquid which moistened the sides of the retort had passed
into the intermediary tube, I stopped the operation : I closed
this tube, and that containing the muriate of lime with stoppers
previously weighed ; 1 introduced          a tube into the retort, and
blew into   it, in order to drive away the nitrous vapour    :  without
this, the  latter would  have  been  absorbed   when  the oxide  of lead
was cooled.
    When the retort was weighed,        Ipassed joseph paper into the
neck, in order to take up the water which might be ther#.             I
weighed     it again, and found that        ithad not perceptibly    di
minished in weight: there remained in the retort 82'5 of oxide,
while the same salt decomposed in           acrucible had given 80.  I
ascribe this difference to      portion of the acid not having been
                                a
disengaged        by
                  heat   ;or, in spite of the precaution which   I   had
observed of blowing into the retort, a portion of the vapour had
already entered into combination.          The intermediary tube con
tained 4-6 parts of water, and the tube with the muriate of lime
O'o, which makes for 100 parts of subnitrite at the minimum
3*1 of water.      But this water was saturated with nitrous acid,

                                        c                            and

406          On the Nitrates and Nitrites      of Lead.
and the tubes which had been weighed full of air, made it full
of nitrous acid gas : hence the subnitrite at the minimum can
 not contain 6'4 of pure water, as M. Berzelius says.              I have
 said that this result confirmed that of my analysis ; for, accord
                                                             •
 ing to the latter, there must have been more than 2 26 of water
 in 100 of subnitrite at the minimum: now we can easily con
 ceive that the latter had been able to absorb nearly its weight
 of nitrous and nitric acid.      I shall now detail another method of
 determining the water of crystallization of the subnitrite at the
 minimum, and it is entitled to the more confidence as I shall
 deduce it from experiments described in my memoir.
      When we pass into a solution at the maximum a stream of
  carbonic acid, we precipitate from it such a portion of oxide
 that the portion which is not precipitated is to the acid in the
 relation of 72'48 to 27'52: this ratio seems constant; for I
 have shown that the quantity of water in which the subnitrite
  was dissolved had no sensible influence on the result.          The de
  composition     is  stopped by  the  presence  of  an excess of  nitrous
  acid : now the subnitrite at the minimum being partly decom
  posed by the carbonic acid, it is evident that the two decompo
  sitions ought to expose a quantity of nitrous acid, which ought
  to be to the oxide not precipitated in the same ratio.              This
  being  the  case,    we may  know  the  quantity  of  acid contained   in
  the  subnitrite    at the minimum,   if we have   determined   the, pro
  portion of the elements of the subnitrite at the maximum, and
  the quantity of the base of the subnitrite at the minimum.          Now
  M. Berzelius and I are agreed as to these quantities: we admit
  80 as the base in the subnitrite at the minimum : several ex
  periments which I made on the decomposition of the subnitritu
  at the minimum proved to me that the carbonic acid separated
  from five grammes of this salt 1 '74 gr. oxide, of which there re
  mained in the liquor 2.26 of base: now when we establish this
  proportion, 72'48 : 27.52 : : 2.26 : f, we shall have 0.858 of ni
  trous acid contained in five gr. of subnitrite at the minimum.
  Now if we subtract from 5 gr. 4 gr. of base and 0.858 of acid,
  there will remain 0.142 for the water of crystallization, or for
   100            Acid .             17'16 . 17.67 .. 100

                  Water              2.84    .
      According to the first determination, I had admitted a little
  more than 2.26 of water.         If we now calculate the proportion
  of base contained in the subnitrite at the maximum, supposing
  that it is double that of the subnitrite at the minimum, we shall
  have 90'2 instead of 90*1, which I found by experience.

              eing much struck with the notices of the numerous
and remarkable errors in the Nautical Almanac for the year
1816, mentioned in your last number (193), on immediately
turning to the work, I found that all those errors, though
really existing, are not to be found in the several months in the
body of the work, but are all contained in what may be consi
dered the 2d page after the preface, titled Principal Articles,
&c. where are found not only all the said errors mentioned by
Criticus, but many others also, which he has passed over in
his haste ; for I find that all the twelve Ember days, mentioned
in the said page of the Almanac, are every one of them
wrong. Thus,
What are said to be Feb. 1 9, 2 1 , 22, ought to be March 6, 8, 9 ;
      and instead of May 20, 22, 23, ought to be June 5, 7, 8 j
      and instead of Sept. 16, 18, 19, ought to be Sept. 18,20,21 ;
      and instead of Dec. 16, 18, 19, ought to be Dec. 18, 20, 21.
    It then occurred that possibly similar errors might exist in
some of the other year's Almanacs ; and accordingly, in turning
                                                      '
over that for 1815, many errors soon appeared.          Thus, in the
column of Holidays, &c. in the month of May, page 49, there
are two, viz.
       Oxford Term ends on the 11th, instead of the 13th day;
and Oxford Term begins on the 24th, instead of the 20th.
    Again, in the like column of June, page 61, we find
       Trinity Term begins on the 3d, which was on May 24.
        Trinity Term ends on the 21st, instead of the 14th.
   On the 5th day, in 8 days 2d return, for in 15 days 3d return.
   On the 12th day, for 15 days 3d ret. read 3 weeks 4th return.
    Again, in July, page 73, in the like column, all the numbers
of the Sundays are wrong, being all 1 too many; so that instead
 of 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, should be the 5th, 6th, 7th,
 8th, and 9th.
    The same mistake happens in the month of August, where
 the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th Sundays should be the 10th, 11th,
  12th, 13th.
    Under the article Other Phenomena, in the last column of
 the first page of every month, many things, particularly the
 Occupations, are omitted, which it was usual formerly to insert.
 There are several other smaller omissions in different places, be
 sides one of more remarkable import entirely omitted; viz. the^
 Transit of the planet Mercury over the Sun, which will take
 place on the 12th of November that year.
     Such discoveries as these naturally create a suspicion as to

        tained by the reciprocal Action of Sulphur and Charcoal.
        By M. Cluzf.l*. Read before the Institute.
          1796, M. Lampadius having had occasion to distil iron py-
    rites with charcoal, in order to extract more sulphur than by
    the common process, obtained a liquor to which he gave the
    name of alcohol of sulphur, and which he regarded as being
    formed of sulphur and hydrogen.           Messrs. Clement and Des-
    ormes some years afterwards obtained the same liquor by passing
    sulphur into a porcelain tube made red hot through charcoal
    previously calcined: they submitted it to a great number of ex
    periments, which induced them to regard it as carburetted sul..
    phur ; they thought that this liquor resulted from the combina
    tion of one-third in weight of charcoal and two-thirds sulphur :
    they admit of no hydrogen.         Subsequently, M. Amadee Ber-
    thollet, in a very excellent paper inserted in the first volume of
    the Memoires d'ArcueU, has communicated a series of re
    searches on this same liquor, which led him to conclude that it
    did not contain an atom of charcoal, and that it resulted from
    the union of sulphur and hydrogen in variable proportions, but
    always, with respect to hydrogen, less considerable than in the
    sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and stronger than in the hydroge-
   nated sulphur obtained from the hydrogenated sulphurets by
    M. Berthollet's process. M. Vauquelin at the same time made
   inquiries into those bodies, which led him to consider them also
   as hydrogenated sulphur.
       Struck with the variety of opinions of chemists           so eminent,
* and whose observations
                                 merit  so much     confidence, I thought
   that this liquor must be variable in its composition, and that
   probably some circumstances had hitherto escaped the authors
   to whom    J have, alluded.    I thought that it would be interesting
   for science   to  undertake    once   more some fresh inquiries re
   specting this singular liquor.         Circumstances       prevented me
   from carrying my labours so far as I could have wished, al
 though I made a great number of experiments ; but I am of
   opinion that the facts which I have had occasion to observe will
   be agreeable to the class.

       by the reciprocal  Action  of Sulphur      and Charcoal.    409
   My first care was to procure a sufficient quantity of this li
quor.    The process of Messrs. Clement and Desormes requiring
the use of porcelain tubes, and consequently an expensive ap
paratus, I endeavoured to procure a sulphuret which should
easily give out its sulphur, and I thought that none would better
serve, the purpose than the sulphuret of iron at the maximum :
viz. iron pyrites.    M. Lampadius only succeeded 'once in Ob
taining it by this process, but the cause must have been owing
to something which I proposed to discover.
   Operation I.     I took one kilogramme of pyrites from the
Pas-de-Calais, clean and pure, and 500 grammes of common
charcoal, light, brilliant and sonorous.       These two substances,
when reduced to a very fine powder and passed through a hair .
sieve, were perfectly mixed, and introduced into a stone retort.
To the neck of the latter was fitted a lengthening tube entering
a bell-glass with three necks [tubulures) : one of them entered
a very dry flask, and the other a bell-glass with two tubulures to
which was adapted a tube thrice curved, the extremity of which
entered into an earthen pot full of water.           The whole being
perfectly well luted with fat luting, and the first joint covered
with linen smeared with white of eggs and lime, a fire was
kindled under the retort, which was made red-hot, and towards
the end of the operation the dome of the furnace was sur
mounted by a funnel or vent.     At first, ..before the retort became
red, there was extricated a small quantity of a diaphanous li
quid which had all the appearance of water.          Afterwards there
came over a considerable quantity of gas. Several flasks of it
were collected at various stages of the operation, care being
taken always to use the same water contained in the earthen
ware jar, in order to fill the flasks.        This extrication of gas
lasted during the whole of the operation.         The two bell-glasses
were covered with cloths, which were wetted with cold water
from time to time.      The liquor, which was at first diaphanous,
became milky in about an hour. After four or five hours of
heat carried the length of actual incandescence, the disengage
ment of the gas having stopped, and nothing more passing over
into the receiver, the operation was stopped, the earthen jar
removed, the extremity of the tube well dried with josepli pa
per, the aperture was well closed with fat luting to prevent the
access of air, and after the apparatus was cooled the matter*
which it contained were examined.
   Three products were obtained by this operation :
   1 . Gases in a very great quantity,    whicli were ascertained to
be a mixture of sulphuretted hydrogen, part soluble and*part
insoluble in water, oxycarburetted hydrogen, carbonic acid and
azote, in proportions variable according to the stage of the ope
ration,                                                           2, A

  410 New Inquiries into        the Nature of the Liquor obtained
      2. A milky liquid, weighing 43'5 grammes, apparently water
  saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen and mixed with precipi
  tated sulphur, probably from the reaction of a small quantity of
  sulphurous acid on a portion of sulphuretted hydrogen.
      3. A very slight layer of a solid, flexible, Iamellous reddish
  matter, having a slight smell of hydrogenated sulphur, and lining
  the inside of the two bell-glasses.
      Operation II.      The substance remaining in the retort, which
  had been carefully closed, was withdrawn : immediately upon
  taking away the lengthening tube, one kilogramme was added
  of the same sulphuret of iron pulverized and well dried in a
  melting-pot. It was mixed perfectly and very speedily, in order
  that the matter might be as little as possible in contact with
  the air. The mixture was introduced into a retort, the ap
  paratus above described was adapted, and the operation con
  ducted in the same way.
      Much less gas was set free : several flasks were collected at
  various stages of the operation, always using the same water.
  These gases were, as in the first operation, a mixture of sulphu
  retted hydrogen, carbonic acid, oxycarburetted hydrogen and
  azote in variable proportions.        There was remarked, as in the
  first operatjon, a liquor at first diaphanous, afterwards milky, and
  then slightly citron-coloured. The operation was stopped in
  four or five hours, and the apparatus dismounted.           In the flask
  there were 304 grammes of a liquor composed of two layers :
  the upper was slightly yellow, the under slightly citron. .
      The lengthening tube contained a much thicker coating of
  reddish brown matter, flexible, Iamellous, and slightly elastic.
      Operation III.     There was added as above 1 kilogramme of
  the same sulphuret of iron pulverized and dried, but only one
  half of the residue of the preceding operation, and the operation
  was conducted in the same way.            The same phaenomena were
  observed,, but the gas was less considerable; and it was suffo
  cating, having the smell of sulphureous acid at the same time
  with that of sulphuretted hydrogen. This smell had not been re
  marked in the first two operations, and we were far from ex
  pecting it.     M. Proust, however, in his experiments upon the
  metallic sulphurets* had remarked a similar circumstance.            We
'
  shall see a little further on, under what circumstances these two
  gases may be in contact without being decomposed.             The water
  in the earthen jar, which in the first two operations had remained
  nearly transparent, was milky on this occasion.
      Operation IV.      Two kilogrammes of the same sulphuret of
  iro*were added      to  the half of the residue of the preceding ope
  ration.   7 2 '5 grammes of liquor formed like the former were

obtained.        The lengthening tube contained a greater quantity
of reddish-brown matter.
     Operation V. To the residue from the preceding operation was
added 1.500 kilogramme of the same substance.                  8.3 grammes
of a milky liquor resulted from this operation.
     Examination of the ethereated liquor*. Overlooking the pro
ducts of the first and fifth operations, which were merely water
saturated, the former with sulphuretted hydrogen, and the latter
with sulphurous acid, 1 collected the liquors of the second, third,
and fourth operations, which seemed to be identically the same.
They were introduced under distilled water into a small glass re
tort, the beak of which entered into the neck of a tubulated
matrass filled with distilled water up to the bottom of the neck,
so as to make the gasified matter arrive immediately into the
water, without the latter being able to reascend into the retort.
 To the tubulure of the matrass was fitted a tube for collecting
 the gases.       The whole being closely luted, heat was applied, and
 120 grammes of a limpid and volatile colourless liquor were ob
 tained.       Its specific gravity was obtained by filling a bottle
 with a ground stopper, which weighed, the temperature being
 20°, 100.357 grammes; when full of distilled water, 167-712
 grammes ; and when full of the liquor, 185.423 : hence it weighed
  1.263.      Its taste was acrid and caustic; smell fetid, very pun
 gent, and not at all resembling that of sulphuretted hydrogen :
 it is in short a smell per se.
     Its elasticity (tension) is very great : it was found, as will be
  afterwards seen, from 0.3 184 metre to 0.7527 metre of pressure,
 and 22° 5' of temperature.
       It is not very soluble in water, but very soluble in alcohol.
  This solution when poured into the water rendered it milky, like
  the volatile oils and resins precipitated by water from their al
  coholic solutions.       M. Vauquelin thought that this precipitate
  was sulphur in a very minute state of division          f ; but I have as
  certained it to be the liquor itself, apparently not altered, and
  abandoned by the alcohol, which unites in preference with
  the water.        This liquor being in a state of extreme division,
  and being but slightly soluble in water, affects its transparency,
   and gives it a milky appearance, analogous in fact to that pro
   duced by sulphur slightly hydrogenated, precipitated from the
   sulphuretted hydrosulphurets by an acid: but this cannot from
   the nature of things be sulphur.         When we pour this alcoholic
   solution into a great quantity of water, the turbidness which is
   at first formed disappears entirely, on account of the solubility of
      * Thus   I denominate the liquor obtained from pyrites calcined with
   charcoal, or directly from sulphur and charcoal when exposed to a high
   temperature.            f Annates de Chimie, tome lxi. p. 15 1.

412     New Inquiries into the Nature of the Liquor obtained
the liquor: if it were sulphur, this could not take place.         Be
sides, when we do not use too much water, we see the milky li
quid gradually become transparent, and drops of liquor are col
lected at the bottom of the vessel ; they have the same appear
ance, the same transparency, volatility, taste, and in short the
same properties in every respect above enumerated.
    Liquid sulphurous acid effects no change in it : two grammes
of liquor kept in contact for about two months, and frequently
agitated with 60 grammes of concentrated sulphuric acid, exhi
bited no alteration.
    The sulphurous acid gas causes no kind of alteration, as we
may bs assured by placing some in contact with azotic gas sa
turated with liquor.
    It burns without leaving any charry residue. Four grammei
were burnt in a porcelain saucer : no traces of charcoal were
 discovered, but merely a little sulphur.      The flame was white,
violet at the extremity, and shaded now and then with red : it
gave out a very strong smell of sulphurous acid.
    When it was volatilized out of the contact of the air, it left
 (although it was absolutely colourless and limpid) a small black
residue which might be taken for charcoal, hut in such a
small quantity that it would be difficult to decide upon it : there
are only some distinct traces of" it when we act upon 17
grammes.
    The water of the matrass of the apparatus above described
for the rectification of this liquor was colourless, diaphanous,
and had a peculiar smell which seemed to be that of the ethere-
ated liquor very dilute, and not that of sulphuretted hydrogen :
it was water, holding in solution a very small quantity of li
quor.     The water contained in the retort was transparent, and
had the same smell, but was slightly citron-coloured. At the
bottom of the           was a yellow, friable and crystalline matter,
                 report
which seemed to be nothing but sulphur.             There was 15.3
grammes.
    M. Amadee Berthollet inferred the presence of hydrogen in
this liquor from very strong analogies.      1 denionstrated this fact
in an incontestable manner by isolating the hydrogen by means
of a body which seizes upon the sttlphur-r-iron or copper for in
stance — and the latter in preference, because it does not possess
the property of combining with the carbon, which I hoped to iso
late at the same time, if the liquor contained any. The fol
lowing is the apparatus I used :
    I took 20*13 grammes of very fine copper wire, and introduced
it coiled up into a glass tube luted externally. This tube passed
through a furnace.      To one of the extremities was fitted a small
glass retort containing ten grammes of ethereated liquor: to
                                                                  th«

      ly   the reciprocal   Action of Sulphur and Charcoal.     413
the other extremity was fitted a very small lengthening tube
communicating with a very small tubulated matrass, furnished
with a tube for collecting the gases, the extremity of which was
inserted into water.      The whole apparatus had previously been
most carefully dried ; and the whole being perfectly luted, the
retort was heated a little to drive off all the air contained in the
retort and in the tube. The luted tube was then gradually heated :
scarcely had it become red, when there was a considerable explosion.
The matrass and lengthening tube were driven a great distance,
and broken to atoms. The tube appearing to be untouched, there
was substituted, after every thing was cooled, another lengthening
 tube, and another small matrass fitted with a tube to collect the
gases.    The whole being well luted, the retort was heated
longer  than  at first, on the idea that the explosion was owing
to a small quantity of air which remained in the apparatus : the
luted tube was made red hot, and the retort slightly heated.
 No gas was emitted. All the liquor having disappeared, the heat
was gradually slackened, and I sealed hermetically with fat
luting the extremity of the bent tube, after having dried it well
 with bibulous matter to prevent the admission of water.
    Next day the apparatus was taken to pieces : the tube was
in part fused, but there was no fissure in it. When broken,
 there was found among the broken glass the copper, which was
 very brittle, and covered with a black, brilliant, light matter
 having the appearance of charcoal.        It weighed 22.15 gr.: it
 had therefore augmented in weight 2.02 grammes : there was
besides a little matter disseminated and incrusted in the melted
 glass.   There were found in the matrass two or three grammes
 of a pink liquor of an acid taste, and so volatile that a few drops
only could be collected.      There remained in the retort a small
 black, solid residue, adhering strongly to the side of the retort,
 and in so small a quantity that it was impossible to examine it.
    Since no gas was extricated during tins operation, if the liquor
 subjected to the experiment contained hydrogen, it must have
 been found in the new red-coloured liquor, which would account
 extremely well for its volatility, since the copper seems to have
 taken from it sulphur, and to have isolated from it a portion of
 charcoal.    To ascertain this, I made the following experiment:
    The copper, which had become brittle, and covered with a
 blackish charry matter, was bruised in an agate mortar: the
 pieces of copper which were still ductile were separated from     it,
 and about one part of pure crystallized nitre was added to      it:
 the whole being pulverized and mixed,    it  was projected from the
 burning charcoal, and far from the furnace, into        a    red-hot
  Hessian crucible very clean.    The deflagration was very prompt.
 Afterwards we treated with distilled water, filtered speedily, and
                                                        precipitated.

precipitated the liquor by lime water in a long and narrow
bottle.   There was an abundant and flaky precipitate.             The
bottle was corked and luted, and next day the water was de
canted.     The precipitate was in a heap, and adhering to the
bottom   of  the bottle : it was filled with mercury, and turned up
side down in the trough; acetic acid was introduced, diluted with
about an equal part of water.        A brisk effervescence took place.
The gas disengaged was passed into a smaller bottle, and it was
several times passed from one bottle to another through water, in
order to wash         it,
                    and free    from the little acetic acid with which
                                 it
it might   have  been   mixed.    This gas was without any sensible
smell:    itextinguished combustion, reddened turnsole tincture,
and precipitated lime water.            was not very soluble in water,
                                         It
but nevertheless entirely absorbable            byit  was carbonic acid.
                                                       :   it
There was charcoal, therefore, in the ethereated liquor.            We
cannot suppose that this carbonic acid was owing to carbon
foreign to the liquor: every precaution had been taken to re
move every cause of error.        In short, we shall see other proofs
of this in the course of this paper. The liquor from which the
carbonic acid had been precipitated              by
                                               the lime water was pre
cipitated       by
               the water of barytes.      The precipitate formed was
sulphate of barytes.
    The blackish matter found             the tube after the operation
                                          in
was therefore sulphuret of copper mixed with charcoal.               At
least it   isnot probable that these three bodies are united        and     :
if we may be permitted to refer          to the appearance, we might
                                          it
 even affirm that the carbon was deposited on the surface of the
sulphuret of copper, which seemed really to have been strewed
with it.

experiments on the action of the electric column, communicated

           by
tention  to  the essentials of accurate experimental inquiry   has          it
frequently afforded me pleasure to observe.
      will be seen that these experiments render the conclusion

drawn      by
            Mr. Howldy, from the ingenious experiments related
at page 241, vol. xliii. of your Magazine, rather exceptionable                    ;

present an answer to the question proposed in this paper by

   By Francis Ronalds, Esq.                Communicated        by Mr. Singer.
                                                Hammersmith, June 10, 1814.
    Very    soon after    I had constructed a pendulum apparatus si
milar in principle to that of M. De Luc described in vol. xxvii.
page 161 of Nicholson's Journal, and had observed the variety
of its action, I suspended an hygrometer and a thermometer near
it, by which I found that when the latter rose but one degree,
a difference of four to five vibrations in five minutes took place,
whilst no such effect occurred if the former advanced two or
three degrees towards dryness unaccompanied by a correspond
ing rise of the thermometer.              It was therefore evident that heat
is the principal cause of the variable action of the electric co
 lumn.
     The following experiments were made with a gold-leaf elec
trometer, in order that they might be repeated and varied by
any one who may not be inclined to construct the pendulum ap
 paratus of M. De Luc's contrivance, or provide himself with one.
     The negative end of a column consisting of 1000 groups of
 zinc and gold paper, inclosed in a glass tube with interposed
 discs of paper as improved by Mr. Singer, was screwed upon one
 side of a brass tripod, an electrometer on another side, and an
 hygrometer and thermometer on the third side.                       A glass dish
 was placed      under   the  tripod,     and  the  whole   apparatus arranged
 upon the plate of an air pump.
     An observation was generally made every five minutes. In
 the 3d Experiment the mean of several observations is set down
  instead of each, for the sake of brevity.               The first columns give
  the time ; the 2d, the degree of the hygrometer ; the 3d, that
 of the thermometer i and the 4th gives the number of strikings
  per minute of the gold leaves.

Experiments on       the Dariable Action of the Electric Column. 417
    Experiment 1 . Was destined to try whether at equal degree*
Of heat and moisture in the open air an uniform action prevailed,
and the result shows that it was very nearly so.
    Experiment 2. Shows that the same uniformity continued
in the receiver, which was not air-tight.
    Experiment 3. Shows that when the air of the receiver was
gradually heated from 53 to 70, and by this means the hygro
meter made to advance 9 \ degrees towards dryness, the electro
meter increased its strikings progressively from 3.75 to 17 times
per minute.
    Experiment 4. Proves that the column had not undergone
a permanent change by Experiment 3.
     Experiment 5 . Shows that when the air of the receiver was
dried by means of sulphuric acid from 37 to 6|, giving for the
whole diminution of moisture 30|. degrees, no increased inten
sity took place.
    Experiment 6. Proves that the column had not been per
manently affected by the last Experiment.
     Experiment 7. Shows that when the the air was moistened,
56 degrees, the intensity was diminished from 4{ strikings per
minute to a divergence of          inch.
     It would be unnecessary and tedious to detail some other
 Experiments which were made with a different view, but which
 conspired with the above to indicate that heat is the principal
 cause of the phaenomenon, and that a moist atmosphere pro
duces exactly the same effect on the glass tube of the column
 that it does on the insulators in all other electrical experiments.
     It now therefore seems a matter of some interest to resolve
several queries relative to the mode in which heat acts: for in
 stance, Does it promote the electromotive powers of the metals ?
 Does it produce the effect by giving motion to the combined mois
 ture of the interposed disks of paper ? or by rendering those disks
more or less conducting ? Is there any analogy between the column
 and the tourmalin ? The justly celebrated inventor of this modifi
 cation of the Voltaic pile, having first observed that equal degrees
 of heat and moisture were not accompanied at different times
 with a corresponding intensity of action, conceived that this dif
 ference was occasioned by changes in the electrical state of the
 ambient air, for which reason he gave it the name of Aerial
 Electroscope, and I think the evidence of our present experience
 preponderates in favour of the conjecture.
     Beccaria, Read, and others have shown that the state of
 moisture of the higher regions of the atmosphere is intimately
 connected with that of its electricity : a height of only six or
 eight feet above the surface of the earth is even sometimes suffi
  cient for collecting powerful electric signs in an open situation.
      V©1. 43. No. 194. June 1814,              D  i           I have

 418 Experiments on the variable Action         of the Electric Column,
   I have by means of a long wire insulated on Mr. Singer's plan,
  when a copious dew was falling, collected pungent sparks when
  the height of the wire did not exceed five feet above the surface
  of the earth in any part of it; Hence it is concluded, that we
  cannot measure the electricity of the higher strata of the atmo
  sphere until that of the lower, which may be excited by the eva
  poration or condensation of moisture, or by position, has been
  first measured. Now, if this electricity of the lower strata could
 be proved to exist, in a very small degree in closer situations,
  there would be no reason why it should not influence the column.
      Mr. Read has in my opinion done much towards this, by the
  aid of the doublcr.
      The signs which the doubler produced were certainly strongly
 analogous to those of his rod, and there are several other ex
 periments which appear to me to prove that what is called the
 Adhesive Electricity of such-like instruments is occasionally no
 other than that of the ambient air, which their peculiar structure
 is calculated to collect and display.
      P. S. — Since writing the above, I have shown the tables to
 Mr. Singer, and was glad to find that he not only coincided in
 the conclusions drawn from them, but also in the idea that the
 electric state of the ambient air may be sufficiently powerful to
 influence the column : but I wished to ascertain the effect of heat
 upon a column not inclosed in a tube, as it might be objected,
that the air immediately in contact with the pile I used, and the
inner surface, was not dried by the acid, although the hygrome-
tric equilibrium might have been varied by heat. I therefore
borrowed from Mr. Singer a pile consisting of 800 groups of
zinc, silver, and paper supported between three pillars of glass
covered with sealing-wax, and placed it in a very large receiver,
together with an hygrometer, thermometer, and electrometer :
the receiver was now placed over mercury.
     The divergence of the gold-leaves was estimated as nearly as
I could guess by the eye, and the following results were obtained :

    There are several circumstances deserving ohservation in these
 experiments, but one in particular; viz. that on the 5th of June,
 when the air had been dried by a loilg continued action of the
 alkali, the power of the column was not increased by a rise of
temperature in its usual d«gree.            Possibly the disks of paper
 had been also deprived of a part of the moisture which appears
necessary to the action of the column.
    XC.     Description of an efficacious Temporary Rudder.
         By Captain John Pbat, of Bloomsbury Square*.
 Sir, — 1 beg      to submit, through you, for the consideration of
 the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and
 Commerce, a sketch of a temporary rudder, invented and used
 by me on board of the ship Cornwall under my command, ou
my voyage from this country to Jamaica, in January 181                     lj
which ship was engaged by the Transport Board for the con
veyance of 14 officers, 200 privates, 7 women, and 4 children,
to Barbadoes.
    In lat. 44° 0* long. 19° 30' on my passage out, I encountered
a very severe gale of wind with a heavy sea, which carried away
my rudder, and the rudder braces on the stern-post: I was,
   * From Transactions                                            ArU,$c. for
                        of the Society for the Encouragement    of
1813. — The gold medal of tlie Society     was voted to Capt. Peat for this
useful invention.
                                    D d  2                         therefore.

420         Description      of an   efficacious Temporary Rudder.
 therefore, under the necessity of fixing a temporary one from
 the best materials 1 had then on board.      Oh reference to a plan
 of Pakenham's temporary rudder, I found it impracticable to fix
 a rudder constructed on his plan, on account of the heavy sea
 to which we were exposed.         It was therefore absolutely neces
 sary, for the preservation of the lives intrusted to my care, that
 I should set about the construction of a rudder, which could be
 brought to act in a heavy sea, or under any circumstances what
 ever.    This, I am happy to say, I accomplished, after a pro
 gressive improvement of fifteen days, and found this machine,
 when substantially fixed, to act in every point .with the same
 effect as the regular rudder.    One of the great advantages of the
  rudder invented by me          is,
                              that     can be shipped and unshipped
                                              it
  at pleasure with the greatest facility, and under any circum
 stances.
    At my request,       survey was held upon this rudder
                             a                                    the by
 principal officers of His Majesty's yard, and all the old masters
,of the ships lying at Barbadoes who were unanimous in their
                                              ;
  opinion that the same was a better rudder than could be pro
  cured at that island; and recommended my proceeding with
  the ship in that state to Jamaica, which       had no hesitation in
                                                             I
doing.
  I   have had the honour to submit n sketch   of this temporary
rudder to the Honourable the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House,
who were pleased to speak in high terms of the invention, and
have subscribed for twenty copies of the above-mentioned en
graving for their use.
                                              I   am, sir,
                             Your most obedient humble servant,

   Sih, — Being requested                by
                              Captain Peat to confirm and state
the particulars of what     know respecting his invention of a
                                     1
temporary rudder, that he had made on board the ship Corn
wall, then commanded             by
                           him, when on a voyage from England
to Jamaica       :
  I  lament that  am not in London, where
                         I                    have some papers   I
whereby    could give dates of particular occurrences, which
             I                                                             I
stated fully in the Barbadoes newspapers on our arrival there.
However,     Irecollect that    was on the night of the 3d of Ja
                                       it
nuary  1811   that  the ship parted with her rudder, when    blew    it
a perfect hurricane, and which continued, without any abate
ment, the succeeding day and night. When the storm subsided,
                                                                     Captain

                                                                              .
          Description   of an    efficacious Temporary    Rudder.       421
Captain Peat devised a plan of making a rudder, with a spare
fore-top-sail yard fixed over the stern, and by means of blocks
reefed on each side, it served as a kind of paddle.       The first
trial was not a sxiccessful one, for want of a sufficient weight to
keep the paddle Under water ; but which was soon remedied,
for I think that it was on the 10th of January the ship an
swered the helm, and we proceeded on our voyage, every day
discovering some new improvements ; inasmuch that on or about
the 16th he fixed his helm to the wheel, and we proceeded the
rest of the voyage without any interruption, unless it was by
negligence of the man who steered.
 ~ So confident was I of the safety and
                                         utility of this new inven
tion, that on my arrival at Barbadoes I proceeded in her to
Jamaica, when I might have gone in other conveyances, a di
stance of 1000 miles.
   At Barbadoes, the master-attendant of the king's yard pro
ceeded to sea in the Cornwall, by directions of Admiral Laforey,
for the purpose of forming an opinion of the new rudder.         On,
his return to'Carlisle Bay, he declared that he would have no
hesitation to sail to the Pacific Ocean with the rudder.    He took            <
a drawing of   it,which the Admiral was to send to the Admiralty
Board.
   This new discovery    cannot toy much praise, as being the
                             I
means of once preserving my life     and the fatigue and labour
                                         ;
which Captain Peat endured in accomplishing this machine;
                                                                          by
had nearly cost him his,

anxiety and exertions.     Captain Peat can derive any benefit
from the British Government for his discovery, and of which              I
have bore testimony,   will add to his merits,

this country to Barbaddes in January 1811, to which place he
was conveying 235 of His Majesty's troops :
     We consider that it would be doing Captain Peat a great deal
of injustice, were we not to give him every credit due for so valu
able and simple an invention, the efficacy of which has been
proved by the distance run in so short a time, and the docu
 ments we have in our possession, with the information received
 from many experienced nautical men of great respectability, who'
 were aboard at the time, and had an opportunity of witnessing
 the great ease with which the vessel was steered on the different
 points of sailing under all sail, and from the high terms with
 which it has been spoken of in this country by nautical men of
 the greatest experience and respectability, it cannot fail of being
 of great utility to the public ; and we consider that great praise
 is due to Captain Peat for his perseverance and daily improve
  ment in substantially fitting the machine, from the idea which
 first suggested the construction of it.
     We have the honour to inclose a letter received from Mr. Lock-
  wood, of His Majesty's Naval Yard, Barbadoes, accompanied
  with a sketch from that gentleman on the subject.
                    We have the honour to be, sir,
                                Your obedient humble servants,

  To C. Taylor,       M.D.   Sec.
      Gentlemen,~I have           the honour to forward a sketch of the
  temporary rudder, by      which    Captain Peat governed the Cornwall
  to this island.
      The apparent ease with which the ship reached this anchor
  age, the direct course she made under a press of sail, even stud
  ding-sails, and the account of its action, led me to investigate
  the circumstance minutely, and enable me to speak very confi
  dently of its properties ; and, in order that you may have yet
  more information than I have time to write, I inclose the sketch
  with a Barbadoes paper. It was my first intention to send the
  plan to Mr. Robert Blachford, Chartseller, Minories, for imme
   diate impression, and to propose giving him a right or title to
  the plan, by sending me 200 copies.            Captain Peat suggested
   the idea of my sending it to you. .
      1 therefore,    gentlemen, beg your acceptance of my humble
   labour ; my sole wish was to render it public for the good of
   society, as in my opinion it not only supersedes Pakenham's
   Tudder, which stands in such high repute, but every attempt of
   that nature hitherto made, and reflects the highest credit on
                                                                Captain

To Messrs. Thomson and Co.
Opinions   of Officers in His Majesty's Royal Navy,           respecting
                Captain Peat's Temporary Rudder.
   Captain Losack, of H. M. R. N., thinks that the simplicity of
Captain Peat's temporary rudder is its great qualification, a»d
never saw any thing so good under every circumstance ; that it
can be shipped in cases where Captain Pakenham'scannot ; that
few merchant-ships have spare caps ; that every merchant-ship
has the materials to form Captain Peat's rudder ; that Captain
Peat's method is much superior to that which was adopted by
Mr. Nicholson, described in his " Treatise on Practical Sea
manship," and as used by him for the Grafton and Elizabeth.
   It appears to Captain Losack, that with Captain Peat's rudder
a ship will tack, but not with the rudder described by Mr. Ni
cholson ; which is a matter of great consequence.
   Captain  Hanwell, of H. M. R. N., is of opinion, that Captain
Peat's  invention can be executed by any merchant-ship,               and
readily shipped in any weather ; that Captain Pakenham's rud
der cannot be so shipped ; that he has no doubt of a ship tack
ing with Captain Peat's temporary rudder.            He adds, that he
agrees generally with Captain      Losack   in the  observations    made
by him.                                  .
   Captain Jackson, of H. M. R. N., thinks Captain Peat's tem
porary rudder has much superiority over every other invention
for the purpose that he is acquainted with ; that it possesses
great simplicity, and that ships of all descriptions have the means
of constructing it.
   That in cases of heavy    sea and bad weather, he is of opinion
that it may be more easily applied than Captain Pakenham's
rudder, but he thinks Captain Pakenham's rudder superior when
once applied.
   That Captain Peat's rudder appears to him more generally
applicable to merchant-vessels and small ships of war than to
ships of the line ; that he cannot judge with precision of its
power, from not having seen it in practice, but he believes it can
tack in all common cases.

 occasions when the ship is going less than eight knots ; but this
 additional weight, consisting of shot sewed up in canvass, is to
 assist in keeping the whole of the machine in the water, when
 going more than eight knots ; and when going less, to be hauled
 up by the line v.
     Tl>e mode of operation in this machine will appear evident
 from the above description : the steering wheel F, being turned
 either way, acts to bring in the fall of one of the guys a, and
 give out the other, producing an inclination of the rudder, as in
 fig. 2, so as to put the ship about as expeditiously as a common
  rudder ; and upon the same principle, viz. that of making a re
 sistance to the ship's motion, on either side of her keel, at plea
  sure.    The ship Cornwall, in which the contrivance was first
  tried, had her wheel fitted close to the rudder-head, and she
  steered with a short tiller abaft the rudder.    In ships fitted in
  the common manner, the tackles would lead to their wheels in
  a similar way ; the only alteration from the figure being, that
  the wheel is placed much further forward on the deck, and
  the leading blocks ss} are of course placed opposite to it.

chine acted with great effect, the ship carrying royals and all
studding.sails night and day, and for several hours together going.
 10 and 10} knots ; during which time she required less wheel
than with the common rudder, and at no time did the temporary
rudder require to make an angle of more than 10 degrees, either
in the act of wearing or tacking.
   This simple and truly ingenious method of governing a vessel
in distress, I recommend earnestly to the notice of all persons
subject to casualties, that may require an expedient of this kind ;
and although temporary rudders are no new subject, yet the one
here delineated is unquestionably the best ever held to public
view.    Little more need belaid in its praise, than the concur
rent opinions of seven professional men (whom 1 know to possess
clear judgement) that the rudder was superior to any that could
be made at this island, and they had no hesitation in recom
mending Captain John Peat to proceed on his voyage to Jamaica,
without anv alteration in it whatever ; and I can venture to as-
sert, without hesitation, that the machine in question not only
supersedes Pakenham's rudder, which stands in such high repute,
hut every attempt of that nature hitherto made, and reflects the
highest credit on Captain Peat for his progressive improvement
upon the rude idea which first presented itself.
   The circumstances favourable to the machine are, first, its
being composed of such materials as vessels of any description
are possessed of ; secondly, the simplicity of its compositioa
superseding the absolute necessity of a carpenter ; thirdly, that
it may be constructed and put in action, even in a gale of wind,
in two, or at most three hours.        Its properties are, 1st, that
it can be shipped at pJeasure without delay, and with very little
trouble ; 2d, that it cannot, by any shock or violence, be ren
dered unfit or useless ; 3d, that the guy tackle fall, being brought
to the wheel, requires only the same force to steer as the com
mon rudder ; that the ship is under complete command, as will
appear by the ship's log-book, in all the following cases :
   " Gale of wind, heavy sea, wind quarterly."
   "  Light winds, heavy swell."
   "  Fresh wind, spanker, main -sail and all sail, on a wind, off
the wind."
   "  Staying and wearing."
   The sole object of this, my humble labour, being to promote,
in however small a degree, the good of the nautical world ; I
cannot in justice drop the subject without suggesting what, in
my opinion, would be, with little additional trouble, a very great
improvement.       The body of dead water occasioned by the flat
open part   x,  of the planks at the end of the yard, tends to im

XCI.      Report  of ike Progress of the Sciences in    France in 1813-
                      By J. C. Delametherie*.
                          ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY.
On the influence which the temperature          of  the  air exercises in
               the chemical phcenomena      of respiration.
Respiration         has been latterly regarded as a kind of com
 bustion, viz. that of the carbon and hydrogen contained in the
venous blood. '. The oxygen absorbed by this combustion forms
 carbonic acid and water.
     It has been endeavoured to ascertain the quantity of atmo
spheric air which a man of a middling stature inspires at each
 inspiration, and expires at each expiration. It has been sup
  posed that it was from 20 to 30 and even 40 cubic inches ; but
  I have shown that this supposition is not correct. A man of a
  middling stature inspires only a few inches of atmospheric air.
  Now the atmospheric air contains only about one fifth oxygen,
  or 0'21.
     In the act of respiration a very small portion of this oxide
  inspired is combined with carbon, and forms carbonic acid.
      Another portion of this oxygen is combined with a portion of
  inflammable gas, and there is a production or disengagement of
  water.     But the greater part of this light portion of oxygen is
   not combined, and it is found in the air expired mixed with car
   bonic acid.
      But Delaroche, like myself, has discovered that there is a pro
   duction of azote.
      He made a great number of experiments in order to deter
   mine the influence which the temperature of the air exercises in
   the chemical phaenomenon of respiration. He placed at different
   temperatures animals in manometres or glass vessels with large
   apertures, hermetically closed by copper plates and screws.            If
   we compare, he says, the results of the experiments made on
   one and the same animal placed in the same circumstances and
   at different temperatures, we shall see that almost in all the
   experiments upon the cold-blooded animals, the quantity of
   oxygen absorbed was a little greater when the temperature was
   low than when it was high.

                                                                        The

428       Report  of the Progress of the  Sciences in France.
    The difference between the quantities of carbonic acid formed
at different temperatures is still less considerable.
    In all cases there is less carbonic acid produced than oxygen
absorbed.    I  concluded, he says, with M. Berthollet, that there
was a production of azote.
    In an experiment made upon a hare, the manometre con
tained 07900 azote, 0 2100 oxygen.
    After the experiment, the azote was 0'7991, the oxygen
0'1516, and the carbonic acid 0-0416.
   "There was therefore a production of 0-0091 of azote, and
0-054 of oxygen absorbed.         I had remarked the same pheno
mena, and I have      observed  in my Essay upon pure Air, that in
the air expired there was always a production of a portion of
impure air, the azote of the new nomenclature.
    Spallanzani has proved that a contrary effect takes place in
the cold-blooded animals.       My experiments, says M. Delaroche,
prove also that heat augments in a Most remarkable manner the
activity of respiration in these animals.      The quantity of oxv-
gen absorbed by frogs exposed to a heat of 27° has been in one
experiment double, and in the other quadruple, to what it was
when the external temperature did not exceed six or seven de
grees.
                             ANIMAL HEAT.
    Respiration being regarded as a kind of combustion, it has
been considered as the principal cause of the heat of animals ;
but I have shown that too much stress has been laid on this
cause.
     1 . a. We find that a man of middling stature only takes in
 at every inspiration a few cubic inches of atmospheric air. Now
atmospheric air contains but little more than one-fifth of oxy
gen, or 0-21.                                       ;
     b. There is   but a small quantity of  this oxygen combined in
 respiration, certainly less than a cubic inch.
     2. a. A man who sleeps tranquilly takes cold, although he
 breathes quite at his ease.
     b. If he takes exercise, he acquires heat, and even perspires.
     c. An animal exposed to a severe cold may perish if it does
 not take exercise. If, on the contrary, it moves or carries bur
 dens, it preserves its life.
    d. Consequently the muscular motion has the greatest in
 fluence on animal heat.
     3. Oxygen gas contains very little heat ; therefore the small
 portion which is combined in the act of respiration has produced
Very little heat.
     I have concluded from these facts, that animal heat pro
                                                              ceeded

           Report  of the Progress  of the Sciences in Prance.       42$
  Ceeded    but in a very trifling degree from the calorie extri
  cated from the oxygen inspired.
     4. If animal heat proceeded from respiration, or from the
  combustion of the carbon in the act of respiration, the lungs
  ought to possess a greater degree of heat than the other parts
  of the system, as Brodie has asserted, which is not the fact.
  He thinks that animal heat is in a great measure under the. in
  fluence of the nervous system and of the brain.
     In the muscular movements the nervous system is in a state!
  of activity more or less considerable ; this is the reason that
  heat is produced in the animal body.
     5. The fermentation of the various animal liquors contri
  butes much to the heat of animals, for we know that every fer
  mentable substance contracts heat.        Now all the animal liquors
  are in a perpetual state of fermentation.
     6. There are continual combinations in the animal ceconomy
  which .give new products, such as the phosphoric, uric, sebic,
  acids, glutine, fibrine, &c. &c.     Now all these combinations are
  uniformly accompanied      with  an extrication   of caloric.
     7. The galvanic action is powerfully exerted among the va
  rious heterogeneous particles of the bodies of animals which fer
  ment.      This galvanism is very intense in the electric eel, &c.
  and contributes powerfully to animal heat.

                           MINERALOGY.
    Cordier has made some researches respecting the stone called
by some mineralogists water sapphire, and by some others blue
quartz. It is brought from India, and particularly from Ceylon.
 Its gravity is 2.580, which removes it from the sapphire.    Its
colour is blue at first sight ; but when we view it in a plane
perpendicular    to the direction which had shown the blue, its
colour is of a clear brown inclining to gray. This double colour
made M. Cordier suppose that this stone was a variety of the
dichroi'te.
                      —
    Of the Ligurite. This stone has been discovered by Viviani
in the mountains of Liguria near Genoa. This substance, which
I have not seen, appears to eeveral naturalists to be a variety
of Titanite.
   Of  the Chlorite in secondary strata. — It was once supposed
that chlorite existed only in primitive strata, but it has since
been found in secondary also.    It is met with in the vicinity of
 Paris. Risso has also observed it in the environs of Nice. Near
the castle of Nice, he says, there are regular beds of chloritous
marl with belemnites.     These facts show that minerals, which
have been thought peculiar to primitive strata, may be trans
ported into secondary.      Lambotin has found fluor also in the
environs of Paris ; but it is crystallized with calcareous spar,
which proves that it has been brought there and deposited.
   Of the Lherzolite. — I have given this name to a stone from
Lhers in the Pyrenees, where Le Lievre found it : it appears to
be a variety of smaragdite.
   Charpentier junior saw large beds of it in the same place.
He regards it as a variety of augite, but augite has not as yet
been found en masse. Vogel analysed       it,
                                          and found as follows    :

       Crystallography . — After noticing Dr. Wollaston's labours on
    the molecules of crystals, M. Delametherie proceeds — Werner            :
    told me during his last visit to Paris, that he thought the figure
    of the primitive molecules of matter was spherical.
       Preschtal adopted the same opinion.      Bodies, he says, do not
    crystallize  but when they  are in a liquid state.   Now every fact
    seems to prove that the molecules of liquids are spherical.
    Descartes had published the same opinion.          He said that the,
    molecules of his two first elements, fire and the luminous fluid,
    were spherical.
                                               GEOLOGY.
        This branch of science has been this year the subject of the                      la
     bours of    great number of scientific men.
                 a                                  Geology     equally         is

     there are problems in all the other natural sciences.
        Of primitive Earths. — The primitive earths form the major
    part of our globe.      The geologist cannot therefore study too
    "minutely those with which we are acquainted, such as granites,
     porphyries, gneiss, schists, amygdaloids, the metals, the anthra
    cites, &c.

 neralogists, the Thuringewald, and Braun Neergard has gktU
 us an account of their journey.          In similar researches we
 ought chiefly to mark out the chains of primitive earths whiefe
 traverse the surface of the globe.     I have distinguished for in
stance five great masses of primitive earths in France :
     1 . A portion of the Alps.
    2. The Cevennes.
    3. A portion of the Pyrenees*
    4. The mountains of Bretag^ie.
    5. The Vosges.
    Secondary Earths. — On this subject Risso has given a de*
vcription of the calcareous earths in the vicinity of Nice.        All
these secondary earths contain quantities more or less consi
derable, of fossils, i. e. traces of animals and vegetables.
    The knowledge of fossils may afford some notions as to the
formation of the strata of the,globe in latter times : this branch
of geology, therefore, is making rapid progress, as we are better
 acquainted with living animals and vegetables.        I have distin
guished    three  fossil orders :
    Marine fossils deposited at the bottom of the sea.
    Fresh-water fossils deposited in fresh water'.
    Land fossils deposited in the bowels of the earth, or buried hf
the fall of mountains, without having been touehed by water.
    We can also distinguish
    The fossils of organized beings which live in the ocean.
    The fossils of organized beings which live in fresh water.
    The fossils of organized beings which live on the continents.
                    FRESH-WATER STRATIFICATIONS.
    It cannot be doubted that there were strata formed in fresh
water lakes after the lowering of the level of the water of the
ocean, as I have proved in my Theory of the Earth, tome v.
p. 137.
    Lamanon long since recognised fresh-water shells in the strata
of the environs of Paris; which made him say that several of these
strata, and particularly the chalks, were formed in fresh-water
Lukes.     He has said the same of the clialks of Aix in Provence.
    Coupe has also given accurate descriptions of the soils in the
environs of Paris : he there recognised fresh-water shells.
    Cuvier and Brongniart have adopted the opinion of Lamanou
with respect to certain soils in the environs of Paris. They sup
pose that they have been formed in fresh water, because fresh.r.
water shells are there found. They found at Montmartre a cy-
cluslome of a llackish colour.
    Brongniart, Prevost, and Desmaret jun. also observed fresh
water shells in part of Auvergne.       Bendaut has also found lym-,
nece (fresh-water shells) near Vaucluse.       They have also been
                                                               found

           Report  of the Progress of the  Sciences in France.    433
found near Valence in Dauphiny; near Roanne, and Orleans; in
the plains of Ulm, and at Rome; in Silesia, and at Burgos in
Spam.
    The Isle of Sheppy at the mouth of the Thames has also
presented some fresh-water shells.        Faujas has also seen them
on the banks of the Rhine, near Mentz, and at Frankfort on
the Maine.
    Risso has made us acquainted with, the shells which are found
in the environs of Nice.
    "  The waves," he observes, u acting continually on the rock,
detach these marine petrifactions, polish them, mix them with
the sea shells of the present day, and the remains of the terres
trial mollusc* carried along by the pluvial waters : — the whole
form new deposits, which will perhaps be enigmatical subjects of
meditation for future generations.
    Most of these naturalists have said that the soils in which
these fresh- water shells are found had always been formed in
these fresh waters, and they call them soils of fresh-water for
mation.
    It cannot be denied that there have been strata formed in
fresh water after the retreat of the sea.       We see them formed
every day in lakes of fresh water ; but we cannot say that all the
soils in which fossil fresh-water shells are found . have always
been formed in fresh water. For we hav-e seen in these very soils,
 as at Montmartre, shells which are not sea shells, bones of qua
drupeds of terra Jirma, &c. ; the latter evidently washed by cur
rents of water.        The fresh-water shells must also have been
brought there by the waters, as observed by Risso at Nice.          In
fact,   it  cannot  be doubted that the fresh  water which daily flows
into the sea, carries with it the remains of animals and vegeta
bles of terra firma, and the remains of animals and vegetables
which live in fresh water.        Thus the waters of the Seine may
carry to Havre planorbes, lymnee, bulimi, from the fresh water
 of the environs of Paris.
    The greatest part of these shells is broken, as observed at
Grignon, but some are preserved perfectly entire.
                          FOSSIL QUADRUPEDS.
    We have had a great number of observations on the fossils of
the mammiferous and oviparous quadrupeds. Cuvier has brought
 them all under view in one work, and added his own obser
 vations.
    He has spoken of 78 fossil quadrupeds, as well viviparous as.
•viparous.
    Twelve are analogous, he says, to living animals ; these are,
    1 . A kind of hippopotamus.
   .2. The stag.

     9. The wolf.
    10. The dog.
    11. The horse.
    12. The sheep.
    Sixteen or eighteen other    species of fossils appear to be ana
 logous to existing genera, but not tq existing species : these are^
    The elephant.
    The rhinoceros.
    The tapir.
    The small hippopotamus.
    The bear.
    The jacuar.
    The hare.
    The fox.
    The crocodile.
    The turtle, &c. &c.
    Finally, 48 other fossil species do not appear analogous either
 to existing species or existing genera   :  these are,
    The megalonix.
    The megatherium.
    Five  species  of mastodonta.
    Ten species of paleotherium.
    Five species of anoplotherium.          .«
    A  petrodactyl.
    Some authors have spoken of fossil remains of apes. Swe-
 denborg says that the bones of the sapajon have been found in
 copper-mines at Menungen; butCuvier thinks that these bones
 rather belonged to the bat genus.
    Fossil bones of the human species have also been spoken of.
 Cuvier thinks that these bones are not human bones.
    Fossil Birds. — There are fossil birds.       I have stated in my
 Theory of the Earth, that I have seen them in the chalks of
 Montmartre. Doubts have been raised improperly on this sub
ject, for soon afterwards I saw several'.       But we do not know
of any others.
    Fossil Fishes. — In the great number of fossil fishes which have
 been observed in several places, as at Mount Bolca, several have
been recognised similar to those of the present day.
    Fossil Shells. — Fossil shells have been observed from the high
 est antiquity.    The priest* of Egypt spoke of them to Herodo
                                                                   tus.

           Report of the  Progress  of the  Sciences in France.    435
 tus.    Pythagoras had seen them, according to Ovid.          But oui
 knowledge in this respect has made great progress latterly.
     Lamarck and Defiance have made us well acquainted with
 those in the environs of Paris.      Cuvier, Brognard, Faujas, and
 Brard, have laboured in the same field with success.
     We distinguish three orders of fossil shells, viz. sea shells,
 fluviatile, and terrestrial.
     The sea shells are the most numerous.        In the depot of Gri-
 gnon alone, nearly 600 species are found, the species or genera
 of which exist at present in different seas, far asunder.
     Most of the same species are to be found at Courtagnon near
 Rheims, according to Lamarck.
    Fluviatile and terrestrial shells are less numerous.    Daudebert
 Ferrusac counts 83 known species : 2 1 helices and bulimi ;
 I vertigo ; 24 lymnee; 10 planorbi ; 1 physis; 5 cyclostomes ;
 I I paludines ; 1 potanidis ; 3 melanopsides ; 3 melanies ; 2
shells approaching to the bulimus glans ; 1 neritine.         Twenty-
five of these species, he adds, have their analogous species in
the same soil.      Eight have their analogous species now existing
in the Indies and America. Fifty have no analogies, so far as has
been hitherto discovered.
     Of Crustaceous and Fossil Insects. — At Maestricht as well as
at other places crustaceous fossil insects have been discovered,
and every naturalist is acquainted with the insects in amber.
     Of Fossil Madrepores. — All these productions in the fossil
state are very abundant.
    Of Fos'pil Vegetables. — Fossil vegetables are extremely abun
dant, since they enter into the composition of the immense
quantity of coal and peat moss with which the earth abounds..
    We also find great quantities of fossil and petrified wood, &c.
Some of these productions seem never to have been removed
from the place where they are found, such as the forest of Palm-
trees observed by Audenrieth on the banks of the Neekar, and
the forest observed by La Fruglaie on the sea-coast near Mor-
laix.
    But the greater number appear to have been carried          to di
stances more or less considerable.
    a. Generally we only find separate portions of the skeletons
of animals, such as the teeth, thigh bones, and never the en
tire organized beings.
    I. We find collected in the same depfit, marine, fluvial, and
terrestrial fossils.
    c. Fossils have their analogous fossils in countries far distant
from each other.
    The above facts therefore indicate that these fossils have been
carried

take place in lakes ; ff by the currents of rivers ; g. by catastro
 phes which have happened on the surface of the globe.
           CATASTROPHES ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE.
     Geologists, proceeding/upon the various facts exhibited by
 the theory of the earth, conclude, with the priests of Memphis
 and all subsequent philosophers,        that various catastrophes,
 more or less considerable, have happened on the earth's sur-.
 face.    Some even suppose that there have been general cata
 strophes.
     In my Theory of the Earth I have cited the following causes
 as likely to have produced these particular catastrophes : viz.
     1 . Particular Inundations. — a. Abundant rains     which have
 swoln the streams of the Nile, the Niger, and the Menau.
 I. Overflowings of lakes, of which history makes mention in
 abundance : such were the deluges of Ogyges, Deucalion, Pro
 metheus, &c. c. Violent winds have produced great inundations
  in Holland, by swelling the sea, as in 1218 and 1646.
     These sea waters have remained a more or less considerable
  time on peat mosses and other strata formed in fresh water, and'
  deposited fossil shells.     Poiret observed near Soissons peat
  mosses containing fluvial shells, covered with strata containing
  sea shells, cerites, venuses, and oysters.
     d. Explosions of subterraneous fires throw up part of the sea,
  and cause particular inundations.
     e. The fall of some mountains has produced some local in
  undations.
     2. Earthquakes have occasioned many singular catastrophes
  on the surface of the globe ; but these have been confined to
  certain countries only.    That of Lisbon in 1/55 shook some
  countries very distant ; but its effects were far from producing a
  general catastrophe.
     The dreadful explosions of the enormous volcanoes of Mexico
  and Peru produce only limited catastrophes.
     3. The passage of a comet close to the earth has also been
  regarded as a cause which must have produced a great cata
  strophe on the surface of the globe, by swelling the waters of
  the ocean ; but all astronomers arc now agreed that this hypo
  thesis has no probable foundation,
     4. But there is another cause which ought to produce, after
  some centuries, great changes on our globe : this is the increase
  of its mass, which I have proved ought to take place.        I have
  said, in my Theory of the Earth, that " a great part of the
  secondary strata is formed of the remains of organized beings :
  such are the bitumens which form immense and very deep strata,
                                                                 fossil

          Report   of the Progress of the    Sciences in France.    437
 fossil plants, shells which form the major part of a great num
 ber of stones, fossil bones, several saline substances of these
 stratifications."
    The mass of the terrestrial globe augmenting, ought to pro
 duce changes in its relations with the other planetary bodies :
 their mutual attractions will change. The sun, on the other
 hand, perhaps loses part of its mass. It appears clear to the,
 therefore, that after some centuries great changes will take place
 upon our globe.        This was the doctrine of the ancient philoso
 phers.     Ovid   makes Pythagoras say in his Metamorphoses,
 book xv.
           Nihil equidem durare diu  sub imagine eadem
           Crediderira.
    Lucretius has also said, book v.
           .         ;         multosque per annos
         Sustentata ruct moles et machina muudi.
    But of what nature will these changes be ? We are not in
 possession of a sufficient number of facts to be able to predict
 their nature.
    As to the hypothesis of De Luo, who has advanced that the
 existence of the human species is posterior to that of other spe
cies, it appears to me to be defective.        We do not find, he says,
"Fossil human skeletons.       To this I answer :
    1. We find only about 12 species of known quadrupeds, and
from 16 to 18 genera.          Are we to conclude that none of the
other species and genera existed at the epoch in question ?
    But, it is added, the human species is now-a-days so multi
plied. — It is easy to answer that the human species was not, afc
<U+2666>hat period, so numerous as it has been since large societies have
been formed.
    3. Lastly, we know that the bones of the largest animals
 which die in the fields, in the woods, &c. are speedily decom
 posed if they are exposed to the air.        We do not find in our fo»
 rests any bones of our modern boars, stags, and wolves3 nor in
Africa any bones of the elephant or rhinoceros.
    4. Those which are fossil have been preserved, therefore, by
being enveloped soon after the death of the animal in earth or
 sand.     This event must have taken place under extraordinary
 and unexpected circumstances.           Thus we meet with very few
fossils of quadrupeds, fishes, birds, and vegetables, in compa
rison with the immense quantity which has existed.
    It is otherwise with fossil shells : they are very abundant.
 Nevertheless this quantity is Very small when compared with
those which have existed ; and we ought to consider well, that
we find in some places immense heaps of shells of various coun-
                                    E e3                          tries,

438       Report  of the Progress of the   Sciences in France.
tries, with fossils of quadrupeds, whales, &c. : they seem to have
been heaped together by local circumstances.
    Fossil vegetables are also very abundant.        All the species of
vegetables    and  animals  now   in existence   may not have com
menced their existence at the same epoch and in the same coun
tries : thus the animals of the continents have begun to exist
long before the sea animals ; but nothing shows that the human
species begaii to exist after the ape and monkey species, &c.
     Epochs At which Fossils have been deposited. — It is difficult
to assign these epochs; but it may be asserted in general, that
    a. The fossils which are found in calcareous, gypseous, schis
tous, or bituminous stones, were deposited when these stones
 were formed, and consequently are the most ancient of fossils.
     b. Ravines (breches)    having been formed subsequently to
 stones, the fossils of ravines are therefore posterior to those of
 stones.
     c. Coal and peat moss are also posterior to secondary stones.
 The fossils which exist in coal and peat moss are therefore also
 posterior to those of stones,
     d. Alluvial strata are also posterior to the above ; consequently
 the fossils contained in these soils are in general more modern.
     e. Caverns have never been discovered until after the sea had
 retired.    The troglodyte animals could only have retired thither
 at very recent periods, and left their remains there.        Fossils of
 sea animals have never been found there.
      Volcanoes. — The city of Caraccas in South America has been
 destroyed by an earthquake, and various parts of Europe have
 experienced similar visitations ; but they were not so violent, nor
 attended with any new phenomena.            There has also been an
 eruption of volcanic substances from the sea near the Azores.
  Earthquakes may be occasioned by volcanic eruptions : the gases
  which are emitted from inflamed substances pass through the
  chinks of the strata with rapidity, and produce shocks more or
  less violent.   But other earthquakes, such as those which take
  place without any appearance of volcanic eruptions, seem to be
  occasioned by the galvanic action of different heterogeneous'
  particles of the globe, particularly metallic substances.
      In order to measure the intensity of earthquakes, an instru
  ment called the Elkysrnometer has been invented.             This in
  strument makes oscillations when it is shaken. We estimate the
  intensity of subterranean commotions by the size and number
  of the oscillations of the instrument.

formation from a people of still greater antiquity.              He supposes
them to have been the Hindoos. But it appears more probable
to me that it was the Tartars and Chinese. The latter were ac
quainted long before any other nation, with printing, the mari
ners' compass, gunpowder, the use of silk, and astronomy.
     The knowledge of the mariners' compass announces that (they
were great navigators, and consequently they must have/ had
•an extensive knowledge of geography.               Their astronomical ac
quirements gave        them   the  means    of ascertaining longitudes and
 latitudes.      The desire for travelling is now general, and learned
travellers daily extend our ideographical knowledge.               Morier has
given us some geographical details respecting Persia, Armenia,
 and Asia minor.          Kimmel has published his Journey to Mount
 Caucasus.        Mawe has made us better acquainted with the Bra
 zils, and given us some interesting details on the mineralogy of
 those countries, their diamond and gold mines, &c.

 It ought      to be proportioned to the size of the flame to which

 least.     2. A small glass tube or cylinder, the end of which is
  to be softened in order to fix the fragment to it. 3. A small bit
  of cyanite, according to Saussure's method.                 4. Charcoal of
 good quality, particularly poplar and elm, flattened on one side,
  and with a small hole in it in which to place the fragment.              We
  may   eover   this piece  of charcoal    with another   piece ;  and in  this
  case a passage must be made for the flame, which ought to fall
  on the fragment contained in the hole.               5. We may compose
  a stud for support with charcoal dust pounded in mucilage of gum
  tragacanth.        We must form of this paste purallelopipedons,
  and dry them slowly.          6. We may use a small spoon of gold or
  silver, but above all of platina, the end of which is fixed in a
  pipe or in a wooden handle, to preserve the fingers from being

  appearance.     The current of air should be so directed as to
  make the flame act upon the fragment at an angle of 45 degrees.

 various tints which they assume on becoming red, from the
 faint red to the white.
    Phosphorescence, when it takes place, presents also various
 colours, whieh change sometimes, as we see in the apatite and
 fluor spar.     We may remark also the colour assumed by the
 flame itself : the sulphate of strontian, for instance, gives to
 the blue part of the flame a reddish tinge.
    As to changes in the mineral, these may take place without
 any alteration in its form, such as the change or loss of colour.
 The surface may become deeper^ either in whole or in part, as
 is the case with pyrites.
    The yellow oxide of iron becomes totally red, the flowers of
 cobalt blue, &c. There is also a change of colour, or loss of
 lustre, in white mica, lamellated gypsum, &c. There is a change
 in the refrangent property, when the molecules of a fragment
 which was diaphanous separate, from the loss of the water of
 crystallization, or the enlargement of their interstices, which fre
 quently gives an opportunity of discovering the texture of various
 substances, such as ponderous spar, &c. There is also a change
 of consistence : it increases, as in potter's clay, and diminishes in
 others, such as lime, which the action of heat renders porous.
 Various odours and tastes are also developed by heat ; and there
 may be an alteration of form without change of substance, by
 the liquefaction of the water of crystallization, of alum, bo

  by the disengagement of the fluoric gas.
     General swelling. — When the mineral increases in volume by
 the formation of a multitude of small bubbles, which give it
  the appearance of a froth ; is this to be ascribed to a disengage

 6ay which.      This fact is remarkable in the meionite, the lepi-

or some of them, are combined with oxygen, hence result the
following phenomena :

combustible particles, without flame or smoke, like the an
thracite.
   Inflammation. — Rapid combustion with flame, like coal.
   Dissipation in smoke. —Volatilization of the combustible parts,
with visible smoke, which is condensed, and adheres to the cold
bodies, like coal, native antimony, &c.
   Calcination. — Conversion of a mineral into a metallic oxide
in an earthy form : this change may be complete, or only on the
surface.
    Vitrification.

   Carbonization. — Conversion of a mineral into charry matter,

as in the kohleblende,   at the beginning of the experiment, or in
the whole mass, as in the braun kohle.
   Reduction is effected by taking away the oxygen from an acid,
or other mineralizer, like the carbonate of lead, tin ore, cinna
bar, &c.
   We ought also to observe the circumstances of the other
phenomena which are presented during the course of the ex

periment    :  that is to say, whether they are easy and rapid, or
ilow and difficult,     and simple or compound : they are simple,
when one phaenomenon only is presented, as in the fusion of
compact feldspar ; compound, when several are manifested ;
and the latter may be simultaneous, like the smell, flame, smoke,
and carbonization of coal ; or successive, like the divis'on, swells
ing, and fusion of borax.
    The change undergone by a mineral may be strong or feeble,
as the greater or smaller part of it is attacked.       Universal or
partial : universal, when it attacks all the particles of a mineral,
Jike native antimony, which is totally converted into smoke; and
partial, when it affects only certain particles, as in antimonial
silver, when the antimony is reduced to smoke, while the silver
remains fixed.
    The way in which minerals act is various, according to the
 methods employed.
    When the assay is made with additions, we must consider
the nature of the substance added in order to facilitate the fu
sion of the mineral. Among the fluxes, some operate the reduc
 tion and others the oxidation of the metal, as nitre.
    The fluxes employed are used either dry, by mixing them
 with the mineral after reducing both into powder, or by melt
 ing the mixture and forming a paste, which is exposed to the
 action of the flame.       Before employing fluxes, it is proper to
 take the water of crystallization from such as contain it.
    The fluxes most in use are, 1. Minium, for earthy substances.
 2. Fluor Spar, which is a very good flux for gypsum, with
 which it forms an enamel. 3. Gypsum is reciprocally an ex
 cellent flux for fluor spar.     4. Borax, which is often employed
 indiscriminately for earthy and metallic substances, and which
 frequently acts as a reductive flux : but before employing it we
 ought to take care to reduce it to glass. 5. Nitrated Borax, i. e.
 the superabundant soda of which is saturated with nitric acid i
 this is one of the best fluxes, particularly for metalliferous sub
 stances.     6. Carbonate of Soda, which is advantageously em
 ployed   with   siliceous substances. 7. Carbonate of Potash.     8.
 Microcosmic Salt, which is very efficacious.      9. Glass of Phos
 phorus, i. e. the phosphoric acid reduced to the vitreous state,
  10. Nitre, which is an excellent assay for inflammable sub
 stances, and a powerful flux for metallic substances.
     With the exception of nitre and borax, we may employ the
  various fluxes on all kinds of studs ; but with those which pos..
  sess the property of detonating with charcoal we must use the
  small platina spoon.
     The reductive fluxes are those which take up the oxygen from
 minerals, or which prevent it from combining with them.
                                                                 The

   The charcoal which serves for the stud fulfils this object : but
in order to increase the effect, it must be reduced to powder, and
mixed with the mineral, before submitting it to the blowpipe.
   Oil   is also a very good reductive when  applied to the mineral
in powder. In the assays with additional substances we observe
the way in which the mineral acts with the flux, if it is fusible, or
resists fusion.   If fusible, we must notice, 1st, if it be tranquil
ly ; 2d, if it be with the disengagement of gas, as in the fusion
of gray manganese with borax ; 3d, if it be in the form of
froth.
   We observe what is the time necessary for the fusion, and whe
ther it be quickly or slowly performed ; the colour of the flux ;
and whether it be permanent or fugacious.
   The colour may also change when we hold the mineral in va
rious parts of the flame : for instance, the glass of borax, with
a slight addition of manganese, is a violet-blue colour while we
hold it in the oxidating part of the flame, and it loses this coloui
when we make it pass into the reductive part.
   We observe, also, if a mineral has the property of being re
duced, and> whether its reduction be complete or incomplete, as
in the red ore of copper when treated with borax. Detona
tion is another phaenomenon in the combustion of inflammable
bodies, which must be observed.
   The products of assays may be :
   1 . A glass : i. e. a transparent or translucid body with a
glossy or shelly fracture. We must observe if it be compact, ho
neycombed, or frothy, as in the obsidian and pechstein, or clean
and transparent, coloured or colourless.
   2. An enamel : i. e. an opaque body with a fracture like
wax, and the same observations with the above must be made.
   3.    A
         scrrria : i. e. a body generally opaque, or at most trans-
lucid, with a surface honeycombed : we observe if its fracture
be dull, vitreous, or metallic, and its colour black or brown, &c.
We observe if it possesses any polarity, like that of chlorite,
some micas, &c.
   4. Afr'ute : i. e. a body the fracture of which presents vi
treous particles, and others not vitreous.
   5.    A
         regulus : i. e. a metallic globule.
   6. An ochre, or earthy substance containing a metallic ox
ide : we observe its colour.
   7. A coke, a charry and cellular residue of coal, having
much consistence after the combustion of its bituminous part.
   8. A charcoal, a black, light, friable substance composed of
hydrogen and oxydulated carbon.
   9. Ashes, an earthy, pulverulent, alkaline substance contain
ing molecules of metallic oxides ; that  is, the residue of the com

    10. Flowers.     A very fine pulverulent deposit, produced by
the volatilization of certain substances, and which are attached
to the stud, or to some cold body placed above. This deposited
matter is sometimes a soot, as in coal, sometimes sulphur, and         .
sometimes a metallic oxide : this last is of . various colours : that
of antimony and arsenic is white, and that of lead is yellow.
The colour is permanent, as in the flowers of antimony ; or va
riable according to the temperature of the oxide, as we see in
the oxide of bismuth, which is yellow so long as it is exposed,
to the flame of the blowpipe, and white as soon as it cools.
    Lastly, we ought to observe the changes which the products
»f the experiments undergo some time after they are terminated,
as in the enamel produced by the fusion of barytes, which spreads
into small fragments a few hours after fusion.
XCII1. On     the Phenomenon of Arsenic and other Bodies whiten
    ing Copper    Plates  with their Vapour.      By L. V. Brugna-
    TELLI*.
When        concrete arsenic is thrown upon burning charcoal it
 emits a white vapour, which may be condensed in a white crust
on a plate of copper held over it. This has been considered as
 an exclusive characteristic of arsenic, and the most convenient
 practical mode of discovering its presence.       An occasion offered
 of submitting this generally received opinion to the test of ex
 perience, by examining the matter contained in the stomach of
 a young child which was subject to worms and accustomed to
 take calomel (mereurius dulcis). The concrete matter existing in
 the fluids of the stomach, being carefully separated, was found
 insoluble in water, and, when placed on burning charcoal, rose
 in a white vapour which whitened the surface of a plate held
over it.    Here there was no suspicion of arsenic, particularly as
 it was insoluble in water, and instantly recognised by other ex
 periments to be calomel.       This mercurial preparation, therefore,
 whitens a plate of metal precisely like arsenic.       Experimenting
 on several other bodies which produce this effect, I found that
 the vapour of phosphorus during combustion, that of,oxymuriate
 of ammonia placed over burning charcoal, and the vapours from
 corrosive sublimate treated in the same manner, all whitened
 plates of copper ; the white spots appear to the eye almost iden
 tical ; at the moment they cannot be distinguished one from
 another,. and may lead the most experienced observer into error.
 It is necessary, however, to observe, that the white spots made

 green in the course of a few days, and that those produced by
 the vapour of phosphorus endure a very short time till they be
 come brown with the air, and are entirely dissipated.           If the
 white spot produced by the vapour of corrosive sublimate be
 •incovered, and the white crust entirely rubbed on the plate, the
 latter then unites in whitening its surface with the original
 sublimate {mercurio repristinalo) : the same phaenomenon takes
 place with the <crust formed by the vapour of calomel. Hence we
 have an easy means of discovering the matter which forms a
 white crust on the surface of copper or brass plates, indepen
 dent of arsenic.

                               few  days ago, seen the Astronomer
 Royal's    most excellent Catalogue of north polar distances of 84
 principal fixed stars, and„noticing a curious coincidence in the
 polar distance of a polaris, as determined with the new mural
 circle made by Mr. E. Troughton, and that of the same star
 as determined by myself with a transit circle of 24 inches dia
 meter only, made by the same great mechanist ; I am induced
.to request yonr publication of the whole of my observations and
 their respective computations, with a view to encourage more
 attention to the use of transit circles of nearly the same dimen
 sions : for I am inclined to believe that they ought to be ap-
 pretiated more than they generally are. They require, as in
 the large instruments, particular precision in their adjustments,
 prior to any observation, which ought to be taken with great
 care, calmness, and peifect ease.         An excellent opportunity,
 too, is now afforded for comparison of observations with those
 in the Catalogue before intimated, for deciding upon their accu
 racy.     And if we take the expense of such small instruments
 into account, we shall find, that it is not to be mentioned, when
 compared with the enormous one of the large mural or transit
 circles, which is far beyond the reach of very many ingenious
 astronomical amateurs, of limited incomes, though, they may
 have it in their power to purchase the smaller ones.         Besides,
 it is my opinion, that the improvement of instruments is not ex
 actly in the direct ratio of their magnitude.

 XCVI. Description of       a Sofa invented by Mr. Samuel James,
    Surgeon, Hoddesdon,       Herts, for the Use of Persons confined
    to Bed by Fractures or other Causes.
 Professional       men have long regretted the want of a machine
 to assist the practitioner in the proper treatment of afflicted
 persons, who, from fractures or other causes, may be'confined
 to their beds, without any power of locomotion, or any substi
 tute for it.
    Among the numerous improvements of the present age, the
 public will be highly gratified to learn that this useful desidera
 tum has been at length accomplished by Mr. S. James, Surgeon,       t
 of Hoddesdon, Herts. After numerous trials, this is found to be
 the most complete machine ever invented for the relief of man
 kind j combining the ease of a bed with a mechanical substitute
 for locomotion.

    machine invented by this gentleman for fractures of the legs and
    thighs appeared in the Encyclopcedia Britannka, which is still
    highly approved of by the faculty in general.
       Attestations to the great utility of the present invention have

 A    Treatise on the supposed   hereditary Properties of Diseases,
     containing Remarks    on the unfounded   Terrors and ill judged
    Cautions consequent on such erroneous Opinions; with Notes
    illustrative of the Subject, particularly in Madness and
    Scrofula.    By Joseph Adams, M.D. F.L.S. of         the London
     College of Physicians, &c.
This      inquiry is equally novel and important. Hitherto one
class of philosophers has shrunk from it with a kind of supersti
 tious awe, while another has been deterred from ever spending
a thought on the subject, by the vulgar disgusting manner in
which it has been viewed by some foreign writers.          Yet there
is perhaps no physical inquiry more intimately allied with mo
rality, of which all persons consider themselves competent
judges.      Many of the diseases called hereditary are rather the
result of similarity in moral and physical education . of imitative
habits, than of any physical organization. Others depend on
local climate, disparity of age, intemperance either in regimen
 or exercise, or erroneous theories.      To ascertain the constitu
 tional from the accidentally transmitted diseases, Dr. Adams
 makes the necessary distinctions between a family and an here
 ditary peculiarity of constitution, the former being confined to
 a single generation, to brothers and sisters of the same parents,
 while the latter is traced from generation to generation.     " Dis
 eases either appear at birth, and are called congenital or connate,
 or they arise afterwards : the first only can with propriety be
 called hereditary or family diseases : all others should be consi
 dered as hereditary or family susceptibilities to certain diseases.
 The degrees of susceptibility should be distinguished by appro
 priate terms.    If the family or hereditary susceptibility is such
 that the disease, though not existing at birth, is afterwards in
 duced without any external causes, or by causes which cannot be
 distinguished from the functions of the (economy, such a state
 may be called a disposition to the disease. But if the suscepti
 bility, though greater than is remarked in other families, is so
 far less than a disposition as always to require the operation of
 some external cause to induce the disease ; this minor suscepti
 bility may be called a predisposition to the disease. Connate or
 congenital diseases are more commonly family than hereditary ;
 some of them, being mortal, as connate hydrocephalus, cannot
 be transmitted; other connate peculiarities are more properly
 organic privations or imperfections, as connate deafness or con
 nate cataract.    Dispositions are found in some families to dis

                    Notices respecting New Books.                         455
eases which are connate in others : hydrocephalus, which is con
nate in some families, in others occurs to several brothers and
sisters in succession as they arrive at' a certain age.      The dis
position  to blindness and deafness   is often hereditary, though the
connate privation of these senses is generally confined to a single
generation.    When the disposition is hereditary, the children are
born with perfect organs, but usually about the age of puberty
their vision declines. Predispositions also are found in some
families, and dispositions in others, to diseases of the same or
gans, and called by the same name, as pulmonary consumption.
In some families, a number of brothers and sisters fall into con
sumption on arriving at a certain age : this may strictly be called
a family disposition to the disease, inasmuch as it is confined to
a single generation, and as we can discover no external cause to
excite it. Another kind of consumption, and the most common
in cold climates, is hereditary ; but only in predisposition, al
ways requiring the influence of climate to induce             it,
                                                           and conse
quently always to be prevented, and often relieved, by avoiding
the exciting cause.     Gout and madness are,     by  almost universal
consent, deemed hereditary   ;   yet,     we admit the general im
                                         if
plication as to their immediate causes, both these diseases, and
particularly the former, should be considered as only hereditary
in predisposition."
    Dr. A. illustrates these accurate distinctions
                                                       a by
                                                        well authenti
cated cases, which must contribute to diffuse            more correct
knowledge of such diseases into the language of popular con
versation, as well as tend to remove erroneous prejudices, and
many serious obstacles to social happiness.       From his extensive
medical practice, however, and his acute observation, we ex
pected a   curious section on family cutaneous diseases, which, in
an age when external appearance           isone of the most general
studies, could not fail to interest great numbers of his fashionable
readers.      The remarks on elephantiasis occasionally digress
 from principles to persons. The author's concluding summary,
 indeed,is  worthy of his talents and medical skill.     The result         is,
    "That connate diseases or privations are not hereditary; that
dispositions to certain diseases are more commonly family than
 hereditary  ; that the diseases arising from them usually show
themselves at certain ages  ;   if early in life, that we have little
 chance of preventing or curing them, but that such of the chil
 dren as escape that age, are as safe as the descendants from
 other families.     That hereditary predispositions to the most
 prevalent diseases are brought into action either                  by
                                                               climate,
 which destroys at an early age those who would be the means
 of transmitting such predispositions to posterity, or              by
                                                              such ex
 ternal causes as may often be prevented.          That whenever an

hereditary or family susceptibility to any disease is suspected,
 the changes in the constitution induced by gestation, parturition,
and the more advanced climacterics, should be particularly aX.r
tended to.      That if the human race, like other animals, has a
 constant disposition to restore itself from every irregularity, the
 divine law, which forbids any sexual intercourse between near
relations, seems sufficient to correct every peculiarity unconnected
 with climate.       That if an hereditary disposition is generated
 by climate, it must progressively increase from the constant oper
 ration of such combined causes.            That no remedy, therefore,
 can be sufficient, but the prevention of propagation as soon as
 the disposition becomes hereditary, and that such provision is
 made by the diseased action itself.         That as far as our inquiries
 into these irregularities have hitherto extended, sufficient provi^
 sion is made for correcting them by the influence of climate, by
 the interdiction of marriage between near relations, and by the
 effects which the irregularities themselves induce.         That all in
  terference,   therefore,   with  the  dulates  rf  nature,  beyond the
  expression of    revealed  will,  appears unnecessary.     Finally, that
  to lessen anxiety, as well as from a regard to the moral principle,
 family peculiarities, instead of being carefully concealed, should
  be accurately traced and faithfully recorded, with a delicacy
 suited to the subject, and with a discrimination adapted to the
 only purpose for which such registers can be useful."
      The practical wisdom und good sense of these conclusions '
  must be obvious to every reader.          Dr. A. .in the notes has also
  some judicious remarks on goitre, which he considers a family
  disease. An instance tending to confirm this opinion may be
 given.     In a valley near Guadir, in Granada, goitres appear : in
  an adjoining one watered by'the same river, and subject to the
   same winds, no traces of them are found.           The family descent
   of calculous diseases might also be traced ; but Dr. A. who has
   so well begun the inquiry, under the enlightened auspices of the
   worthy President of the Royal Society, will doubtless pursue it.

      June   9 and 16. A long and interesting     paper, by Sir Humphry
   Davy,     was read, detailing this philosopher's experiments in Italy,
   on the combinations       of iodine with the alkalis, potassium, so
   dium, hydrogen, &c.
        June 23. Another paper by Sir H. Davy, sent from Rome,
   was read, containing an account of his experiments on diamonds
   and carbonaceous matter, performed at Florence and Rome with
    burning lenses.     Sir H. having conjectured in his third Bakerian
   Lecture that the diamond owes its peculiar characters to a small
    portion of oxygen, availed himself of an opportunity while at
    Florence to*operate on this substance with a very powerful lens
    and the concentrated rays of the sun, instead of the Voltaic pile.
    He made a variety of experiments on the combustion of small
    diamonds laid in a platina cup and placed in a glass globe,
    through which the solar rays were made to pass and burn the
    diamonds ; but in none of them was there any oxygen evolved :
    whence he was induced to abandon the idea of oxygen forming
    any part of the diamond.        He next directed his attention to as
    certain whether, according to the opinion of Guyton Morveau,
  . hydrogen     or water might not exist in diamond ; but the result
    was similar, no trace of either appearing.       Moisture, indeed, in
    his first experiments was discovered ; but it was entirely owing
    to an imperfection in the apparatus, which was afterwards re
    medied.      Charcoal was then submitted to similar experiments,
    and emitted some hydrogen.         Hence Sir H. concludes that dia
    mond is perfectly pure carbon, and that its hardness and trans
    parency are derived from its crystallization, and not from the
    admixture of any other elementary body.
         Sir H. has examined six different species of sea-weed son the
     coast of the Mediterranean, without finding any iodine in them,
     except some very slight traces. He also suggested some improved
     methods of detecting this singular substance ; and described a
     number of its combinations and appearances with muriatic and
     other acids, as well as with hydrogen and the gases.
         Smithson Tenant, Esq. furnished a paper giving a description
     of a cheap and easy method of preparing potassium in consider

     methods hitherto adopted to prepare this metal, stated his own,
     which consists in an improvement of Gay-Lussac's application of
     a gun-barrel.     Instead of having a peculiar furnace and different
     gun-barrels, he merely takes two iron tubes, one considerably
•    wider than the other: the wide one is filled with iron filings and
                                                                  potash,

  serted a smaller tube perfectly air-tight, and destined to collect
  and retain the potassium.         The apparatus thus adjusted, the
  wide tube is placed in a furnace, smith's forge, or any powerful
  fire, when the potassium is sublimed, rises into the small tube,
   and is there collected pure and fit for use.
        Dr. Kidd communicated to the Society a short paper on the
   Formation of Nitre on the Walls of the Laboratory in Oxford.
   The walls are composed of a calcareous stone containing some
   shells, and the nitre forms on its surface in the greatest quan
   tities where the walls are below the surface of the ground.        It
   appears that the atmosphere assists       its formation,   as Dr. K.
   placed a glass over a part of the wall which yielded the nitre in
   greatest abundance, when the rapidity of its production wasi
   greatly impaired.      The nitre produced is tolerably pure.    '
        Sir Everard Home, Bart. read a paper containing a descrip
   tion of some fossil bones found in Dorsetshire, and now in Mr,
    Bullock's museum.
        Sir E. has examined these fossil bones with great attention,
   but without being able perfectly to satisfy himself to what par
    ticular species of animal they have belonged.        The teeth he at
    first conjectured might be those of the crocodile, but on more
    mature examination he discovered that they could not possibly
    belong to that animal ; the same uncertainty exists respecting
    the jaws and skull, which he determined not to be those of the
    shark genus.     The non-existence of the elephant, hippopotamus,
    &c. in this country he considered as no argument why some of
    the bones found in Dorsetshire should not have belonged to
    those animals ; but the depressions which the bones have ex
    perienced, rendered it impossible for him to say positively to
    what species of animal they had belonged.         Sir E.'s paper was
    illustrated by drawings of the different fossil bones alluded to.

        In our analysis for 1811, it has been seen how by accelerating
(   evaporation in vacuo, and by the presence of a strongly ab
    sorbent body, Mr. Leslie of Edinburgh succeeded in freezing
    water at, all times of the year.     An apparatus which he subse
    quently invented has been exhibited to the Class by M. Pictet;
     and our colleague M. Gay-Lussac, in repeating the experiment,
    recalled a well-known fact connected with the same subject,
     namely, that cold is produced in certain machines from which
                                                                      we

*e   allow condensed air to escape : he has also proved that at
all times of the year it is sufficient that the air should be c n-
densed in a two-fold degree, in order to obtain ice, and he
thinks that we may procure it easily in warm countries by con
densing the air by means of a fall of water.
   We may, by employing bodies more evaporable than water,
attain degrees of cold truly astonishing, and freeze not only
quicksilver but the purest alcohol.          M. Configliacchi of Pavia
has frozen mercury by the evaporation of water alone.            It was
thought that this pressure of the air, the influence of which is
so powerful in retarding the evaporation of liquids, also retarded
the solution of salts, or, what comes to the same thing, accele
rated their crystallization when they were dissolved ; and in fact
a saturated solution of Glauber salts, or sulphate of soda, which
preserves its fluidity when it is cooled in vacuo, also crystallizes
when we admit air to it. But M. Gay-Lussac says that this does not
happen to all salts indiscriminately ; and even with respect to the
sulphate of soda, the phaenomenon is not occasioned by the cir
cumstance      alleged.    When we intercept the contact of the
air, by   a stratum   of oil for instance, the crystallization is re
tarded as when we suppress its pressure by making a vacuum ;
whereas, on the contrary, the pressure of a column of mercury
in no respect accelerates this crystallization.       A solution which
passes   through   mercury,  from  which    the air has been driven by
ebullition, does not crystallize, and if it passes through common
mercury it coagulates instantly. Agitation, the introduction of
a small crystal, and many other causes, produce the crystalliza
tion, whatever be the degree of pressure. Thus M. Gay-Lussac
concludes, that it is not by its pressure that the air diminishes
the dissolving power of water.        He affirms also, that it is not
by absorbing    air that water  loses  this power ; but he thinks that
it is a phaenomenon more or less analogous to that of pure wa
ter, which, as is well known, remains fluid at some degrees below
its real freezing point, when we prevent it from being shaken ;
but it freezes the instant we give it the least shake.
    The most evident source of heat in the world is the sun's
rays. But it has been long remarked that these rays divided by
the prism do not all give an equal heat ; and M. Herschel, the
celebrated astronomer, ascertained some vears since that their
power of heating went on augmenting from the violet to the
red : he even ascertained that outside of the spectrum there
were rays which, without being luminous, possessed a heating
property more powerful than that of the red rays.               Messrs.
Ritter, Beckmann, and Wollaston announced soon afterwards
that the power of the luminous rays to produce certain chemical
                                                                changes

 changes is distributed in an inverse ratio, and is exercised parti
 cularly in the. violet ray, and beyond this ray.
     M. Berard, a young chemist of Montpelier, who repeated with
 much precision both sets of experiments, ascertained their ex
 actitude in several respects: he «ven found that the chemical
 power of light diminishes in proportion as we approach the
 middle of the spectrum, and that it vanishes beyond it. But ac
 cording to him, it is at the extremity of the red ray that the
 maximum of the heating power resides, and outside of the spec
 trum it diminishes.      M. Berard has also ascertained that these
 properties belong to the light reflected by ice, and to that which
 has been divided by the Iceland spar, as well as to the direct
 light.
     Decisive results have not yet been obtained on the power of
 magnetizing iron, ascribed to the violet-coloured rays by M. Mo-
 riehini, an ingenious Italian chemist.         Although the magnetic
 needles exposed to these rays wore apparently affected under
 certain circumstances, they exhibited no signs whatever in others,
 without our being able hitherto to account for this difference ;
 for, in both cases, all other causes known to produce polarity had
 been carefully removed.       It is true that the summer of 1813 had
 not favoured this kind of inquiry, on account of the unsettled
 weather.
    Of all the phaenomena which heat presents, the dilatation
 which it produces in bodies is that of which the laws admit of
 being expressed most naturally by mathematical formulae ; and
 the knowledge of these laws, which forms an essential part of
physics, is also very important in a host of chemical experi
ments.      M. Biot has been considerably occupied'with this sub
ject ; and taking the dilatation of mercury as a term of compari
son, he finds that the real dilatation of other liquids may always
be obtained by the sum of this dilatation, of its square, and of its
cube ; multiplying each of these three terms by a particular co
 efficient, which we must determine for every liquid, but which
being once determined remains the same at all degrees.          As the
substance of the thermometer which contains the liquid under
examination dilates also, the apparent « dilatation is different
from the true : nevertheless, M. Biot demonstrates that it takes
place according to a similar law.        He calculates afterwards, ac
cording to the experiments of M. De Luc, the coefficients adapt
ed for eight of the liquids whose laws it is most necessary to
know; and shows that, these coefficients once obtained, its for
mula gives the dilatation of each degree equally well with the
experiment.      Lastlv, he has made the application to the com
bined dilatations of the vase and of the liquid, and has shown
                                                                   that

that we may separate the effects which belong to the liquid and
to its envelope, and appreciate their influence with sufficient ac
curacy to recover by calculation alone all the results observed ;
eo that calculators mav in future dispense, in an infmite number
of cases, with immediate observation, and we may introduce
with confidence its data into the elements of phaenomena.              This
is an advantage of the more consequence, as these kinds of re
searches are extremely delicate ; and if we do not pay the great
est attention to them, a multitude of trifling causes will disturb
the observer.                .....          .
    A dispute has long existed among chemists, as to the precise
moment at which alcohol was formed in wine. The greater num
ber formerly thought that alcohol, or spirits of wine, was an essen
tial product of fermentation; but M. Fabroni has maintained a
contrary opinion.       According to him, it is only accidentally, and
when it excites too much heat, that fermentation engenders alco
 hol ; but in co'mmon wines, the alcohol is produced merely by
 the heat applied for their distillation ; and the chief proof which
 he gives of this          is,
                        that we cannot extract         from these wines by

 potash, although     the   latter  exposes    the slightest particle of          al
 cohol which we introduce on purpose.              M. Gay-Lussac has ad
 hered to the old opinion,                 by
                                       showing that potash also demon-
 states the alcohol which          natural to wine, when we previously

 which  is far inferior to that of the. common fermentation.             M.
 Gay-Lussac, to avoid all adulteration, made the wine himself
 upon which he imide his experiments, and found alcohol in                as     it
 well as in the other kinds.        He has also shown that we may ob
 tain the pure alcohol of Richter by employing quicklime, or ra

462                         Stained Glass.
for 1812 will    be found the description of a micrometer of rock
crystal, which I presented to the Institute, not only for taking
the diameters of the sun and moon, but also intended to be used
In difficult' problems in naval tactics and geodosy.      Not being
fully satisfied  of the degree of precision which  I obtained in the
measurement of the sun, I became desirous of destroying, in the
two solar images, the aberration occasioned by the unequal re-
frangibility of the rays which traverse crystallized substances in
which we develop the effects of double refraction : for this rea
son I renounced the idea of becoming a candidate for the Pe-
tersburgh medal.
-   " I owe it to my colleague Arago, to acknowledge that from
him I first learnt, that the old pieces of stained glass in our
churches possessed the astonishing property of transmitting ho
mogeneous rays only when they were painted with the oxide of
copper.      These pieces of stained glass are either of a beautiful
red or bright green ; for according as the painting is more ox
less fired (cuile) the oxide assumes these colours ; although they
are very different ; and it was by using glass of a red colour that
 I finally attained the achromatism necessary for the precise
measurement of the sun's diameter.
    " The Memoirs of the old Academy of Sciences prove that
 M. Monge was the first to make the observation, and subse
quently M. Hassenfratz affirms that he made the same remark
on painted glass which was stained of a green colour by the
oxide of copper.      This second remark will prove very useful to
 me,   if it  produces the same effect with glass painted red, by
means of the same oxide ; and I beseech Messrs. Vauquelin and
 Thenard to assist me in my new inquiries. It is with a piece
 of glass painted red with the oxide of copper, that I obtain at
this instant two images of the sun perfectly well defined, and
henceforward I have the means of increasing at pleasure the
 effect of double refraction.    Artists who are employed to cut
prisms of this substance, in order to procure heliometers for
 astronomers, ought to proceed in the following manner.        They
will select very pure and fmely crystallized specimens.          The
 cube will not give in the direction of the axis any sign of double
 refraction ; but this cube when cut transversely to the axis will
give two prisms, which will have attained the maximum of
 double refraction.     A second cube similar to the first, but cut
 in an opposite direction, will produce an effect similar to the
first, with this very remarkable difference, that by putting them
 close together in opposite directions the effect of the double
 refraction will be doubled : in this way we shall procure, with
 these two cubes, two new cubes producing a quadruple refrac
tion. Thus, by multiplying the cubes, we shall increase at plea
                                                                sure,

      "We are indebted to the late M. Malus for an entirely new
process for discovering in substances, whatever may be the al
teration from their primitive form, their axis of crystallization.
 The instrument which he contrived for this purpose is so in
 genious, that it ought to be engraved on his tomb, like the cy
 linder inserted within the sphere, which enabled Cicero to dis
 cover the tomb of Archimedes in Sicily.     It is best for the mea
surement of the sun, which we know to be about 32 minutes, to
 employ in my heliometer three or four cubes, shaped as I have
 described, in order that this micrometer may be very close to
 the focus of the eye-glass, without altering in a sensible manner
  the goodness of the object-glass, and its dimensions not exceed
  ing that of the diameter of the eye-glass. The importance to
  astronomy of the precise measurement of the diameter of the
  sun made me desirous that my colleague Arago should verify
   the heliometers which I sent to the Royal Observatory.        This
   eminent astronomer has already verified, by numerous observa
   tions, the diameter of the principal planets by the microscope,
  on which the heliometer which I have now described is abso

  earthquake was perceived at Oleron, in the South of France.
  «*
     Never," says an eyewitness, " in the memory of the oldest in
                                                                 habitants

habitants    was any former shock so violent or of so long durti.1
tion. It appeared that an eruption followed .by a thick and
black smoke burst from the mountain of Louvie, three leagues'
from Oleron.       Some large rocks were detached from the moun
tain,  and   their fall killed five cows and demolished a house. The
second shock was so violent that several houses at Gand, on the
road to Pace, were destroyed.          Here a great number of chim
neys were thrown down, and terror filled every breast.              The
churches were in an instant crowded with the flying inhabitants,
 and a young girl was crushed to death in the attempt to gain
an asylum."
    A similar shock was perceived at Marmand on the same day
 and at the same hour.        It was from west to east, and was pre
 ceded by a clap of thunder in the west, accompanied by large
black clouds.      The shock lasted two seconds.
    Some travellers recently arrived from Wallachia have brought
 an account of a terrible calamity which has befallen the inhabi
tants of Oybestein.        This district, one of the most populous in
 the country, was situated in the neighbourhood of several lofty
 mountains ; some of these were cultivated to their summits, and
 the sides were covered with the dwellings of the natives ; the
 base of the highest, however, is supposed to have been,sapped
 by the long rains.      On the night of the 20th of April, while the
inhabitants, unsuspicious of such a calamity, were buried in re
 pose, the peak called the Devil's Neck descended with a noise
 resembling an earthquake, and overwhelmed in its progress
 houses, forests, and innumerable cattle.          The concussion was
 so frightful, that the inhabitants of the adjacent villages started
 from their beds, and were seen running naked from their habi
tations to seek safety in the plains.          The extent of this ca
 lamity   had  not been   ascertained;    but it was supposed that 400
 persons   had  been  buried  beneath  the  ponderous fragments, which
 extended and covered a mile of ground.            The general distress
 was much increased by the groans which were heard issuing
 from the ruins four days after the avalanche.
    M. Sergei, the celebrated Swedish sculptor,           died lately at
 Stockholm at the       age  of 74.     He   had  resided nearly twenty
 years at Rome, and was a member of the Academy of Painting
 and Sculpture at Paris, and of the French Institute.          His prin
 cipal works are the groupe of Psyche and Love, and that of Mars
 and Venus, the monument erected to Descartes in one of the
 churches at Stockholm, and the statue of Gustavus III placed
 near the palace.       M. .Sergei has left several pupils behind him,
 one of whom (M. Bystroem) has obtained a pension to enable
                                                                     him

Gustavus purchased the Endymion, one of the chefs d'ceuvre of
antiquity at Rome, and which how forms the chief ornament of
the Stockholm museum.
   M. Le Gallois, of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, has
lately made some interesting inquiries on the principle of life,
and particularly oh the motion of the heart as connected
with it. He was led hy an adventitious circumstance to consi
der how long the young of rabbits can live without respiring,
immediately after their separation from the mother, before the
natural period of utero-gestation terminates.              He found the
time to be variable, and greater in proportion to its proximity
to the termination of pregnancy.           He then attempted to dis
cover,    how  long  these  animals   can  live  after decapitation ; and
found this to be also variable according to the age of the ani
mal : but he likewise observed, that it is always precisely equal
to the time during which the animal resists suffocation, or take*
in dying by asphyxia.          M. Le Gallois thence concluded, that
 decapitation only destroys animals by suffocating them; that           is,
 by  impeding the respiration necessary to their existence.
    The analogy being once assumed, required to be proved by
 direct experiments.       There was, besides, this difference between
 the effects of simple asphyxia and decapitation; viz. the animal*
 under asphyxia made vain efforts to breathe, whilst in that
 decapitated, all the motions of respiration were destroyed.           It
 became requisite to discover the cause of this difference.              To
 resolve the first question, M. Le Galltiis endeavoured to supply
 the material of respiration in. the decapitated animal,        by   inflat
 ing the thorax, after having tied the arteries this experiment
                                                     :
 succeeded.      Sensation and voluntary motion were seen to return
 with inflation;   they were of various duration in different rabbits,
 but even in the youngest continued for several hours.
     Asit   was thus proved that the destruction of the brain oc
 casioned death    by  the interruption of respiration,   it   became ne
 cessary to inquire whether the principle of the motion resided
 in this viscus generally, or was confined to one of its parts           ?
 For this purpose, our experimentalist opened the cranium of             a
 young rabbit, and removed the brain            by    successive portions,
 cutting it   horizontally,  from  before,  backwards.      He found that
 all  the  cerebrum   could  be  thus  removed, and the whole of the
 cerebellum, and even part of the medulla oblongata, without
 interrupting respiration   ;     but this function suddenly ceased
 .when the origin of the eighth pair of nerves was included in
 the slice cut from the medulla oblongata.        It    therefore became
 evident,   that the  principle  of  motion    in  the  respiratory organs

  proceeds from this point : in fact, respiration is no longer per
  formed when these nerves only are divided, without injury to
  other parts, and the animal dies from asphyxia, accompanied by
  some peculiarities which M. Le Gallois has noticed.
       We are told that the total removal of the medulla oblongata
  in a rabbit, decapitated and revived, instantly kills it. If the
  same operation be performed on one which has not been sa cir
  cumstanced, and in which the brain is perfect, it dies, although
  not in the same manner ; the trunk of the body is instantly
  deprived of life ; but the head continues to live a short time,
  and is proved by a gaping (baillement) indicative of efforts made
  by the animal to carry on the function of respiration.
       If a rabbit be divided transversely into two equal portions,
  each of these continues to live separately during a certain time,
  which is shorter or longer according to the age of the animal %
  and longer the younger it is. Each of these parts feels and acts
  by itself : and they also die separately as soon as their respective
  portions of spinal marrow are destroyed.          From this view of
  the subject, it is evident there are two centres of vitality, or
  rather two sources of distinct sensations.      The life of the whole
  trunk depends on the spinal marrow, and the life of each por
  tion of the trunk on the portion of spinal marrow which gives
  off nerves to it : besides, it so completely and entirely depends
• on this cause, that after the heart, liver, intestines, and internal
  organs of the animal have been removed, it continues to survive
  as long as the portion of spinal marrow which animates it is
  left entire.
       Since it is not possible to remove the whole of the head of a
   warm-blooded animal, and leave the medulla oblongata in con
   tinuity with the spinal marrow, without dividing many> con
  siderable blood-vessels, the loss of blood from which greatly
   lowers vitality, experiments were made 'on some cold-blooded
   animals, such as salamanders.       The wound caused by decapi
   tation cicatrised, and they continued to exist until life was ex
   hausted by simple want of nutrition.
       These united experiments prove that the maintenance of
   life in any part of an animal essentially depends on two circum
  stances ; one of which is the integrity of that portion of the
   spinal marrow corresponding with the part ; the other, the
   continuance of the circulation of arterial blood in this part, an
   effect produced by respiration : it follows then, that any portion
   of an animal can be made to exist separately (isolement) so long
   as both these conditions can be fulfilled.
       M. Le Gallois supposes that the brain wills and regulates all
   the animal motions, but the movements themselves depend on
   the influence of the spinal marrow.      A cold-blooded animal, for
                                                               example,

  example, lives for some days, and moves its limbs after the
  brain is removed ; but its movements are useless, and those of
  the feet in contrary directions, so that, if it takes one step for
  ward, the next is perhaps made baekward.           He imagines that
  the spinal marrow is acted upon by the brain, in the same man
  ner as the muscles are acted upon by the spinal marrow.
     The results of M. Le Gallois' physiological labours were sub
  mitted, by the National Institute, to Messrs. Humboldt, Halle,
  and Percy, by whom a particular examination of the facts was
  made.    The Doctor repeated all the experiments in their pre
  sence with complete success ; and their report is highly credita
 ble to the talents of the ingenious author.       The subject is one
 of great <interest : and we should be glad to see it investigated
  on this side of the Channel.
             ABSENCE OP MAGNESIA IN HUMAN BONES.
    According to the latest experiments made on human bones,
 by Hildebrandt, the analysis of Fourcroy and Vauquelin is con
 firmed, that they do not contain any oxyphosphate of magnesia,
 as maintained by Berzelius in his Animal Chemistry.
    A nervous   fever prevails at Basle, in Switzerland, which at
 tacks young persons, and has assumed a character of malignity.
 In four or five days the patient expires, and the disease has hi
 therto proved fatal in every instance.                               »
    In May last the plague raged violently       at Smyrna,   Odessa,
 and  in several islands of the Archipelago.     It had also made its
appearance at Constantinople,      but not to such an extent.
    The university of Wilna, in the Russian empire, has resumed
its former rank among the learned institutions in Europe, and a
veterinary school has been added to its other lectureships. The
number of students is from 6 to 700 annually.
    The universities of Halle and Berlin have been restored to
their former rank under the auspices of the King of Prussia.
The Saxon students have preferred visiting the latter school,
where 49 professors are to give lectures in the course of the
summer.
    The celebrated Dr. Sparzheim, the colleague of Dr. Gall,
being now in London, purposes to give a Course of Lectures on
the Physiology of the Brain, at his Rooms, No. 11, Rathbone-

Lectures are to begin on the 11th of July.

Meteorological Observations         made at Clapton     from the  Qth t»
                         the 9.0th  of June 1814.
    Since the date of my last observations I have not kept regular
accounts of the weather till the 9th of June : the weather in the
interval was chiefly cold, the prevailing winds easterly, and a
great deal of cloudiness.
    June 9. — Easterly wind ; clear sky, and hot in the sun, with
 cirrus, &c.
    June   10. — Clear and cloudy by intervals;      air warmer.
    Jane   1 1 . — Fair day ; various   clouds.    Easterly wind, and  a
breeze.
    June 12. — Cloudiness and rain in the morning; fair after
noon.      Wind southward.
    June   13. — Much warmer, with gentle showers.
    June 14. — Very hot day. Thermometer 84° in the shade?
 much cirrus, cumulostratus, and that dense white feature of
 cirrocumulus which precedes storms.            I predicted from it the
 storms of next morning.          SW. and variable.
    June 15. — Early this morning a thunder shower ; warm day'
 after the rain, with light gales from south, and cumuli, &c.
    June 16. — Warm but showery; various clouds, as in such
 weather.
    June 17. — Fair, warm day; various clouds and showers. SW.
    June 18. — Warm and gentle showers. Southerly.
     June 19. — Rainy morning ; fair evening.
     June 20. — Fair, but a great deal of cloud, and rather cooler
 than yesterday.
     The weather for the last ten days has been mild, pleasant and
 wholesome, with showers at intervals, which have contributed
 much to complete the vegetation this backward spring.               The
 Monkshood Poppy ( Papaver orientate) and the Tragopoga po-
 lyfolium et pratense, came into flower later than usual. The
 clouds have been such as usually accompany summer showers ;
 a continual tendency to cumulostratus           and nimbus, with cirro-
 cumulus, cirrus and cirrc.stratus of the common sort in the fine
 intervals.
