                                   Prefatory Remarks.
BY Edinburgh,
       the permission of the Council of the Royal Society of
                   the following series of communications are
republished, which, having been read to the meetings of that
body at various periods during the sessions of 1849–50 and
 1850–51, were first printed in the First and Second Parts of
the Twentieth Volume of their Transactions.
   These investigations may be considered under a twofold
aspect,    either as determining the theoretical and practical re
sults, so far as heat and expansive power are concerned, of the
law of the mutual convertibility of physical powers, or as deve
loping the consequences of an hypothesis respecting the consti
tution of matter, called that of Molecular Vortices, whereby that
law, as respects heat and elasticity, is made a particular case of
the mechanical principle of the conservation of vis viva.
   The law of the mutual convertibility of physical powers has
long been a subject of abstract speculation, and may appear to
some minds in the light of a necessary truth.             As we cannot,
however, expect it to be generally received as such,           practical its
demonstration must                be
                             considered      having been effected
                                                       as                              by

riments of De la Roche and Bérard. The result thus obtained
was 695 feet of fall per degree of Fahrenheit, being about one
tenth part less than Joule's equivalent.  But shortly afterwards
Mr. Joule’s latest and most accurate series of experiments were
published, the mutual agreement of which made it evident that
his determination of the value of one degree of Fahrenheit's
scale in liquid water, viz. 772 feet of fall, is correct to about
slºdth of           its

necessary         to a
              render the subsequent investigation intelligible.
   The fundamental suppositions are the following:—
   First,--That each atom      matter consists    of nucleus,    cen                   ofa                        or

   Suppositions similar    this have been brought forward
                                              to                                                                            by

group of vortices, of small size as compared with the bulk of an
atom, and of various diameters, may permanently coexist, whether
side by side,             or end to end, in the atomic atmospheres of one
substance, or             of various          substances mixed.
   First, The mean elasticity must vary continuously; which in
volves the condition, that at the surface of contact of two vor
tices of different substances, side by side, or end to end, the
respective densities at each point of contact must be inversely
proportional to the coefficients of elasticity. Hence the specific
gravities of the atmospheric parts of all substances, under pre
cisely similar circumstances as to heat and molecular forces (a con
dition realized in perfect gases at the same pressure and tempe
rature), are inversely proportional to the coefficients of atmospheric
elasticity. Therefore let A represent the mass of the atmosphere
of one atom of any substance, b         coefficient             its

motion, is independent of the diameter. The divisorg (the force
of gravity) is introduced, on the supposition of the density p
being measured by weight.
    Supposing the atmosphere of an atom to be divided into con
centric spherical layers, it may be shown that the effect of the
coexistence of a great number of small vortices in one of those
layers whose radius is r, and mean density p, is to give it a cen
trifugal force, expressed by

   1. The quantity of heat in a given mass of matter, according
to the hypothesis of molecular vortices, as well as every other
hypothesis which ascribes the phaenomena of heat to motion, is
measured by the mechanical power to which that motion is
equivalent, that being a quantity the total amount of which in a
given system of bodies cannot be altered by their mutual actions,
although         its
              distribution and form may       altered.  This   be

     reumatic odour.      In this respect they pretty closely resemble
     Paraguay tea, the leaves and twigs of the Ilea paraguayensis,
     which is subjected to a somewhat similar process. The coffee
    leaves when digested with boiling water yielded a deep brown
     infusion, which in taste and odour closely resembled an infusion
     of a mixture of coffee and tea. On the addition of milk and
    sugar, it formed a very tolerable beverage; and as the roasted
    coffee-leaf can be imported into Europe for rather less than two
    pence per pound, the poorer classes of society are likely to find
    it a very useful substitute for tea and coffee. Should a more
    moderate temperature be employed in drying the coffee-leaf,                                            I

IV.     On Xanthoryline, a new Crystalline principle from Japanese
     Pepper, the fruit of the Xanthoxylum piperitum of DeCan

A FEW        months ago                 I
                             received from my friend Daniel Han
        bury, Jun., Esq., a small quantity of a very singular fruit
from Japan, known in commerce as Japanese pepper.        Mr. Han
bury likewise kindly furnished me with the subjoined botanical
account of the tree from which it is obtained.
    “Japanese pepper is the produce of Zanthoaylum piperitum,
DeCand. (Fagara piperita, Linn.), a tree of Japan of the natural
order Rutaceae, figured and described by Kaempfer in 1712t.
   “It consists of roundish sessile capsules of the size of a pep
percorn, which appear to have been normally four in number,
situated at the extremity of a peduncle, though but one or two
are usually fully developed.    The capsules, which are externally
reddish-brown, have their outer covering beset with numerous
prominent tubercles enclosing an acrid liquid to which the pepper
          of its
owes      pungent flavour.     The seeds are black, shining, and
devoid    pungency;    from dehiscence      the capsules, they are of
generally wanting     the  sample
                             in     which we have examined.
     “The     flavour    of   Japanese             pepper     is   aromatic      and agreeable,
with  a pungency not unlike that            pellitory (Radir pyrethri).

30                      Mr. G. Boole's Solution of a Question in
matical Journal in the month of November 1851.       This may
justify my offering a few remarks upon the subject.        -
   The problem as considered by Mr. Cayley is thus stated.
   Given the probability a that a cause A will act, and the pro
bability p that A acting the effect will happen; also the proba
bility 8 that a cause B will act, and the probability q that B
acting the effect will happen: required the total probability of
the effect, supposed impossible in the absence of both the causes.
The solution given by Mr. Cayley is as follows. Let X be the
probability that the cause A acting will act efficaciously, u the
probability that the cause B acting will act efficaciously.  Then
                                   p=X-F (1–X)08                 .    .       .        .   .        .       .    (1)

which determines A, u, and the total probability u of the effect-
will be given by           -

     Mr. Cayley                 that this leads to a correct result when
                            shows
a=1.           He     further remarks,  that the problem presents no dif
ficulty.
     I
     think it to be one of the peculiar difficulties of the theory of
probabilities, that               its
                         difficulties sometimes are not seen. The
solution       problem

it may       erroneous solution. The problem which Mr. Cay
             be     an
ley has considered seems                     to  good illustration                                                   of

one root, of the above equation satisfying the conditions described.
The conditions of a possible experience are, that each of the
three quantities in (7) exceeds each of the two in (6).
   The above solution may readily be verified in the case con
sidered by Mr. Cayley, and in the three cases discussed in this

    3rd. Upon the nature of the errors which are most to be
 apprehended in the solution of questions in the theory of pro
 babilities,       I
               will only remark that they are not usually mathe
 matical, in the ordinary sense of that term, but arise from the
 necessity of employing a logic of a peculiarly subtle or highly
complex character. When the data are the probabilities of                                         in
 dependent simple events, the method of procedure is sufficiently
 easy; but if those data relate to events occurring in combina
tions, or connected by causal relations, the principles which
suffice for the former case become either inadequate or inappli
cable.     Laplace has to some extent investigated the additional
new principles (derivable from the prior definitions and axioms
of the science) of which it is then necessary to take account.
But    allthese aids carry       but       us

                            [With   a    Plate.]
To the
    the     sense of touch as a thermoscope in experiments on
           conduction of heat succeeded the expedient of Ingen
housz, which consisted in coating rods of the substances to be
examined with wax, bringing one end into connexion with a
source of heat and observing the distance to which the wax
melted on the surface.   Exact numerical results were, however,
wanting until Despretz took up the subject nearly thirty years
ago.     In his experiments the bodies examined were reduced
to the shape of prismatic bars; in each bar, and at equal di
stances apart, cavities were hollowed out for the reception of
mercury, into which dipped the bulbs of a number of sensitive
thermometers.        One end of the bar was heated by a lamp with
a constant    flame,  and the heating was suffered to continue until
the temperature of the bar became constant.              This of course
 took place when the amount of heat received by any cross section
 of the bar from the section immediately preceding, was equal to
the quantity imparted to the following section and lost by radia
 tion in the same time.       The thermometers under these circum
 stances formed a series decreasing in height from the hottest end
 of the bar onwards.      From the temperatures thus observed, it is
 possible,  by   means of Fourier’s formula, to calculate the con
 ductive power of the bar for heat.     In these experiments, however,
 the breach of continuity caused by the introduction of the cavi
 ties and their contents must have exerted a disturbing influ
  ence.   In the subsequent experiments of Langberg this difficulty
 was avoided by the application of a thermo-electric            element,
 which was caused to press against the heated bar; the tempe
  rature being estimated from the deflection which it produced
  upon a suitable galvanometer.       A little reflection, however, will
  suggest various expedients by which the accuracy of the mode
  of observation introduced by Langberg may be increased; and
  this appears to have led to the recent resumption of the subject
  by MM. Wiedemann and Franz, whose careful experiments con
  stitute the matter of the present report.
      In an inquiry of this nature it is necessary that the exterior
   conductivity, as it is called, should be the same in             all
                                                                the sub
   stances examined.     Despretz secured this          by
                                                      coating         all

those metals which conducted heat most perfectly were also the
best conductors of electricity*.  We here transcribe a table,

   Whatever the quality may be upon which calorific conduction
depends, the above table renders it exceedingly probable that
the same quality influences in a similar manner the transmission
of electricity; for the divergences of the numbers expressing
the conductivity for heat from those expressing the conductivity
for electricity are not greater than the divergences of the latter
alone, exhibited by the results of the different observers.

   Systems     of this form are of frequent occurrence in analysis,
and it is only on account of their extreme simplicity that they
have not been expressly remarked.                For instance, in the theory
of  elliptic  functions,   if n be the     parameter,     and
                                                 0)=–º

then a, &, y form a group of the species in question.                   So in the
theory of quadratic forms, if
                             2(a, b, c)=(c,          b, a)
                             Á(a,  b,   c)=(a,   -b, c)
                             y(a, b,    c)=(c,   -b, a);
although, indeed, in this case (treating forms which are pro
perly equivalent as identical) we have a=8, and therefore y=l,
in which point of view the group is simply a group of two symbols
 1, a<U+017F>a”= 1).

    Again, in the theory of matrices, if denote the operation of
inversion, and trfhat of transposition, (I do not stop to explain
the terms as the example may be passed over), we may write
                      &= 1,     8–tr,        y= I. tri-trl.
I proceed     to the  case  of a group of six symbols,

querel's recent paper     that  M. Becquerel, sen. has used it as a
means    of adventitiously heating      a spiral placed in another
flame.
   Two platinum wires of 6 inches long and ºth of an inch dia
meter have their ends formed into coils of ºth of an inch long and
wide; these wires are attached to copper wires insulated by glass
stands, and having their further extremities connected with a
galvanometer.     My galvanometer is by Ruhmkorf; the wire is
not as  long  as those now constructed, being only 544 feet, but
I  have magnetized the needles so as to render them highly
astatic; they take four minutes to make one oscillation.
   An additional binding screw is connected with the wire at 54
feet, so that I can ascertain by the same instrument the effect
of a slighter resistance.
   When the flame of a spirit-lamp is urged by the blowpipe,
one of the above-mentioned coils is placed in the full yellow flame
just beyond the apex of the blue cone, and the other near the
orifice of the brass jet, or at what may be called the root of the
flame, just above the base of the blue come, the distance between
the two coils being 24 inches.      The coil in the full flame is at a
white heat brilliantly incandescent, the coil near the orifice or at
the commencement of the flame is cherry-red. The galvano
meter is deflected to an average of 6°, the coil near the orifice or
at the root of the flame being positive, or related to the further
coil as zinc to platinum in the voltaic trough. On reversing the
position of the wires, the galvanometer is deflected 6° in the
opposite direction.
   This current is not due to thermo-electricity excited in the
wires at the point of junction of the platinum and copper, for it
is unaltered in direction by a powerful thermo-current excited
in these by heating the points of junction by another spirit
lamp.
   By making this thermo-current aid or counteract the flame
current, a slight difference in degree is perceptible in the deflec
tion according as the point of junction of the one or other wire
is heated, but no difference in direction.
   The flame-current, moreover, scarcely affects the short wired
galvanometer, while the thermo-current of copper and platinum
whirls the needle to 90°.
   It is not a thermo-electric current arising from the unequal
heating of the two coils, for it is in the same direction when the
further coil is removed from the full flame so as to be less heated
than the coil at the root of the flame.       It is also different in
direction from the thermo-current produced by unequally heating
the coils in similar parts of the flame, or the current described
by M. Buff, and to which he ascribes the electricity of flame.

The flame-current proper in my experiments                                    is opposed           to,   and
conquers the thermo-current.

further coil, the deflection lessens, but still preserves    direction                      its

    “This anatomical demonstration of the ganglia and nerves of the

It further indicates the real source of the action of the heart as an
entire organ, from the commencement to the termination of life;

a  lunar day, having two easterly maxima nearly at opposite points
of the hour-circle, and two westerly maxima also at nearly two op
posite points of the hour-circle.      The extreme elongations are not
at   precisely opposite points  of the hour-circle at any of the three
stations, nor have the amounts of the two elongations which take
place in the same direction always precisely the same value; but
the slight inequalities in these respects are within the limits which
might be ascribed to accidental variations, and might therefore dis
appear with longer continued observations.         It is otherwise, how
ever, in the author's opinion, with the disparity between the amounts
of easterly and westerly extreme elongations which presents itself at
each of the three stations. At Hobarton and St. Helena the westerly
elongations have the larger values, at Toronto the easterly (the north
end of the magnet being referred to in all cases).
   The times at which the extreme elongations in the two directions
take place are not the same at the three stations, and are as follows:–
At Toronto the easterly extremes take place about the hours of 0
and 12, being the hours of the upper and lower culminations;           at
St. Helena the westerly extremes about two hours before the culmi
nations; and at Hobarton about two hours after the culminations.
At Toronto the westerly extremes take place about the hours of 6
and 18; at St. Helena and Hobarton the easterly extremes respect
ively two hours before and two hours after the same hours of 6 and
18.     The extreme inequality, or the amount of lunar variation
measured from one extreme elongation to the other, is about 28" of
arc at Toronto, 20" at Hobarton, and 11" at St. Helena.              The
resolved    portion of the terrestrial magnetic  force which acts in the
horizontal direction, and is opposed to any disturbing influence, is
approximately 3:54 at Toronto, 4.51 at Hobarton, and 5'57 at St.
Helena.

    The writer of the paper now proceeds to describe the most re
 markable and important gland of the human oeconomy, namely, the
 sanguiferous.
    The jejunum and ileum constitute the secreting element of this
 organ.      The ileo-caecal valve or verminiferous appendage is the ex
 cretory duct in a rudimentary state.            The colon, though enormously
 developed in a longitudinal direction, must be regarded as the re
 ceptacle ; the sigmoid flexure folded upon itself like the letter S (as
 in the cervix of the gall-bladder) is the cervix of the colon recep
 tacle; the rectum or the efferent duct completes the system.
    The function of this system is not fully known ; the tract is lined
with mucous membrane and glandulae for the secretion of air and
other products of the blood. It can scarcely be denied that the in
testinal tube, in        its
                          structure and form and arrangement             the ele               of

though it had been very much the practice of foreign governments
to take an active part in encouraging the pursuit of science, and with
decided success, here the smallest effort in that direction was looked
upon by some as an experiment little harmonizing with our institu
tions, our feelings, perhaps our prejudices, and only to be followed
by failure and disappointment. It was feared that because occasion
ally there had been some difficulty in employing effectively the small
fund which had been bequeathed to us, that therefore there would
be increased difficulty in employing a larger fund; and this no doubt
would have happened if there had been restrictions limiting the
application of the larger fund to certain specific objects, or if the
field of discovery had been of limited extent: the reverse however
was the case.        Your Council were not embarrassed by any unwise
restrictions, and in science there is room for every one.                   It is one
of the deductions of economic science that labour creates a demand
for labour; in fact, that where a community is industrious, and
labour accumulates and becomes capital, that there the people will be
fully employed: the same is true in the inductive sciences, and it
is true universally; there no modifying causes interfere to diminish
the force, or limit the application of the great principle, and we see
 strikingly that as facts accumulate, and facts are the capital of
inductive science, fresh employment is everywhere provided for
those who are willing to work.               Take any one of the inductive
sciences as an example, and we at once see how this                        Take for         is.

Hopkins in the important experiments which he has been carrying
on in conjunction with Mr. Fairbairn and Mr. Joule.                         You no

laws of the phenomena as to the temperature and pressure of the
confined gas, will also soon be determined.
   Carbonic acid gas has been found to give a depression four and
a half times as great as atmospheric air, while it passes through
the porous plug with greater facility than atmospheric air; equal
volumes requiring pressures of 1 and 1:05 respectively in order to
be transmitted in equal times. Certain heating effects of air rushing
through a single orifice have been observed, which will probably
lead to a further development of the mechanical theory of the tem
perature of elastic fluids in rapid motion.
   The examination of the sedimentary deposits in the Nile valley,
mentioned at the last Anniversary, is still going on. Mr. Horner
states, that by the munificent aid of His Highness Abbas Pacha, the
Viceroy of Egypt, a series of operations have been carried on at
Heliopolis, and at another station thirteen miles above Cairo, which
have led to interesting results.     A pit has been sunk to the depth of
24 feet below the       pedestal of the colossal statue of Ramses the
Second, who reigned, according to the chronology of Bunsen, about
1400 years before Christ, and borings have been continued by which
cylinders of soil have been extracted at an additional depth of 48
feet.    A series of thirty-two pits has been sunk across the valley in
a line between the Libyan and Arabian deserts, occupying a line of
about five miles, passing through the site of the statue alluded to ;
and it is proposed to sink a similar line of pits next year about twenty
miles lower down the river, passing through the site of the obelisk
of Heliopolis.      Above sixty persons were employed in the operations
at Memphis.      The plan, as proposed by Mr. Horner, was, through the
intervention of the Hon. Charles Augustus Murray, Her Majesty's
late Consul-General in Egypt, submitted to the Viceroy, and met with
the most ready acceptance.        He gave directions to his government
that  every   assistance should be afforded for carrying on the proposed
researches; he appointed an able engineer officer high in his service,
M. Hekekyan Bey, to conduct them, and ordered that the whole'
expense should be defrayed by his government.           Such enlightened
liberality on the part of His Highness Abbas Pacha justly entitles
him to the gratitude of all cultivators of science.
   The other researches alluded to on the last occasion are proceeding
satisfactorily, but there is nothing which seems to call for especial
notice at present; I will therefore at once proceed to give some
account of the steps which have been taken by your Council for the
advancement of science in another direction.
   In the history of individual sciences we perceive there have been
always successive periods of activity and repose. In Astronomy, for
many years we have had a period of activity.         Physical Astronomy
has achieved     perhapsits  greatest  triumph  within the last few years
in  the   discoveryof   Neptune;    and the   discovery
                                                      of    the numerous

 obtained, by which the powers of analysis may be brought to bear
 upon the laws which govern these mysterious systems.
     In the northern catalogue of Nebulae, and the same observation
 no doubt applies to the southern also, there are vast numbers much
 too faint to be sketched, or measured, with any prospect of advan
 tage; the most powerful instruments we possess, showing in them
 nothing of an organized structure, but merely a confused mass of
 nebulosity of varying brightness.         The number of nebulae in the
 northern hemisphere, in which details are well brought out,
 is not very large, and even in these, a great proportion of the
 measurements are necessarily rough, and wanting in that precision
 by which the motion of certain double stars was so soon detected.
 It is evident therefore that to obtain a true knowledge of the forms
 of the nebular systems, our sketches must be as numerous as possi
 ble; and to obtain evidence of motion with rough measures, our
 measures should be very numerous also ; but the northern hemi
 sphere presents but a very limited list of suitable objects, therefore
 it is desirable to take in the southern hemisphere also.
     I have thus, I believe, in part at least, explained the views of
 those who felt anxious that the southern hemisphere should be exa
 mined with a telescope of great power : the first attempt to give
practical effect to their wishes was at the meeting of the British
 Association held at Birmingham in 1849.
    The President of the Association was on that occasion directed to
apply to Government to send a telescope of great power, in charge
of an experienced observer, to the southern hemisphere.                  That
application was unsuccessful; the Government, while they acknow
ledged the importance of the proposed object, declined to proceed, from
an apprehension of difficulties, through which they did not then see
their way clearly. At a subsequent meeting of the British Association,
the matter was again discussed, and a Committee was appointed, to
take such measures as they considered best calculated to effect the
object. The Committee, in the first instance, laid the whole matter
before your Council, and the Council, approving of the suggestion,
appointed a Committee to consider the subject in detail.
    It was necessary before the Government could be applied to with
a reasonable prospect of success, that a specific plan should be in
readiness, complete in all           its
                                   details: the size      the instrument, its

optical principle, its mounting, and its site.
    With the view     of obtaining the best information, the Committee
consulted several eminent men, conversant with the management                     of
large instruments.       The first question proposed was, whether the

   In military engineering too, as well as in naval architecture,
has not science been sometimes on the side of our adversaries 2 and
have we not in consequence suffered severely 2 But let me not be
mistaken.     I do not contend that science can in a moment increase
our success in the arts, upon which the greatness of this country de
pends.    If we were to say to the mathematician, give us the best
lines for a ship suited to a given purpose, however profound his ma
thematical knowledge might be, he would fail; practice must be com
bined, but in due subordination with theory. It is where in a nation
science is cultivated profoundly by a large class of persons, and cir
cumstances exist tending to direct it to practice, that some men will
always be found, gifted with the faculty of applying it in whatever
way the interests of the country may require.
   Popular science, however, will not do: it has     uses, subordinate            its

 numerous, and your Council have had no difficulty, though acting
 under a heavy responsibility, in pointing out to you the required
 number of persons in every way worthy of the Fellowship.
     So far the present system of election appears to me to have worked
 extremely well. The Fellowship is sought for as a high honour, and
 here, as at the Universities, the claims of the respective candidates are
 tested by responsible persons.
     In this, the Royal Society differs from every other Society; and
I   think upon the preservation of that distinction, the welfare, the
 position, perhaps the existence of our Society depends. For 150
 years the Royal Society stood alone; unaided it bore the whole
 labour of wielding the power of Association, in the cause of pro
 gressing science. Recently other Societies were formed to meet more
 fully the wants of individual sciences; not as rivals to the Royal

 but fully admitting                 its
                              pre-eminence.
     These Societies have rendered important services; much has been
 effected through their means which otherwise would not have been
 attempted.       Science has been carried out              them           by
                                                                         the utmost         in

soda being very soluble, have been carried off by the water; that the
protoxide of iron has been converted into peroxide and accumulated

XII.  On the Results of a series of Experiments on the Decom
  position of Water by the Galvanic Battery, with a view to obtain
  a constant and brilliant Lime light. By the Rev. N. J. CALLAN,
  Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Roman Catholic College,
  Maynoothº.
Soº         after
       and before
                    I had discovered
                        I
                                 the nitric acid cast-iron battery,
                     had completed the large one which I made
for the College,    I
                    began to make experiments on the decompo
sition of water with a view to obtain a lime light which might
answer for lighthouses.             I
                            soon succeeded in obtaining a steady
and brilliant light.   In a paper on our new galvanic battery,
dated   April 6, 1848, and published in the London Philosophical
Magazine of the following July, I stated that                     “I
                                                         got the lime
light by igniting mixed gases as they were produced by the
decomposition of water and throwing the flame on lime.”                               I
believe I  was the first who obtained a constant lime light by
means of the galvanic battery.      My experiments were frequently
interrupted on account of the state of my health. They were
at one time suspended for more than two years, and several
times for five or six months. The same cause which obliged me
to interrupt them now compels me to bring them to a close
before  I could complete           all
                               the experiments     intended

These   experiments   have led     the following results:—First,
                                          to                                         a

76                 The Rev. Dr. Callan’s Experiments on the
used,   I have  put a strip of vulcanized India-rubber across the
hole through which the gases enter into each of the iron vessels.
The strip of vulcanized India-rubber acts as a valve, which
opens inwards and admits the gases into the vessel; and when
pressed outwards by the expansive force of the exploded gases,
it closes the hole and prevents the escape of any part of the water
into the gas bag or voltameter.        Hence it is evident that in our
apparatus dangerous explosions cannot happen, either because
the water may be gradually ejected from the iron vessel through
the jet or back into the gas bag, or because the flame might
ascend through a continued series of bubbles of the mixed gases.
The size of the iron vessels should be in proportion to the quan
tities of mixed gases inflamed, and to the length of time the
flame is kept up.      Should a person wish to continue the lime
light for a very long time, he would do well to have two pairs of
vessels and change them every hour or half-hour, or examine
occasionally whether the water was carried away by the stream
of the gases.            I
                     have several times tried the large vessel alone
without any accident, although the gases above the water occa
 sionally exploded when they were not pressed through the jet
 with sufficient force.      I believe that this vessel may be used
alone without danger; but I would recommend in                   cases the             all                *

the hole in the brass screwed into the top iron plate.              By means
 of four -inch bolts of      iron,  which   pass  through    the top and bot
tom iron plates, the top plate is screwed down on the India-rubber
collar. The wire is then wedged against the side of the hole in
the piece of brass, and the brass cap is screwed on. The board
between the bottom of the vessel and under iron plate, and the
 India-rubber collar between the top and upper iron plate, insu
 late both plates from the iron vessel.          The outside of the vessel
 is connected with one end of the         battery,   and the top or bottom
 plate with the other.        Thus the two electrodes are connected
 with opposite ends of the battery; and if acidulated water, or
 water containing any of the alkalies, be poured into the vessel,
 it will be decomposed by the voltaic current. If a stopcock to
 which a jet is attached be screwed to the top plate, the gases
 will rush through the jet and may be ignited without the small
 est danger, for the explosion of the gases contained within can
 never burst a vessel of such strength.                                 I
                                                          have had frequent
 explosions without producing any injurious effect, though the
 vessel was sometimes nearly half-filled with the mixed gases,
 Before discarding the glass vessel, I began to use sheet iron                                         in

                                       found that when the intensity of
 the battery exceeded that of three or four cells, the power of the
 battery was soon exhausted; hence in using a battery of eighty
 cells, I was obliged to arrange them in twenty rows, each con
 taining four cells, and to connect                         all
                                               the end zinc plates                            so

of platina or cast iron, into a porous cell containing nitrosul
phuric acid.     Each of the three acted far more powerfully than
the lead  plate.  The plate coated with the alloy containing the
largest proportion of lead acted better than the one whose coat
ing contained least lead, but not so well as the plate on which
sulphur was burnt.     This last plate produced a galvanic current
very nearly equal to that of a platina or cast-iron plate.   after                             I
wards put into concentrated nitric acid a piece of the tin which
was coated with the alloy of lead and tin, and with sulphur, a
piece    of one of the alloys of lead and tin and a piece of lead, and
left them in the acid for about twenty hours. On taking them
                               I
out of the acid, found that a good deal of the lead had been
dissolved, but the piece of coated tin and the alloy were merely
blackened on the surface.        From the results of these experi
ments, it is evident that tin plates, coated with an alloy of lead
and tin, in which the proportion of tin is small, are more passive
in nitric acid, less oxidable, and consequently better suited for
the electrodes of a voltameter than lead plates.       The tin plates
are stronger and more elastic than leaden ones, and therefore are
not so easily brought into contact with each other.            It was in
last March or April that                          I
                               discovered that tin plates, coated with
an alloy of lead and tin, are less oxidable than lead.        Since that

passing from one end of the battery to the other but through the
interposed plates and fluid.         In each plate there should be a small
hole near the bottom, that the cells may always remain nearly
filled with the fluid. The fluid should never rise above the
upper edge of the electrodes, otherwise a great part of the gal
vanic current would be transmitted by it from one terminal plate
to the other without passing through the interposed plates or
fluid.     The number of cells formed by the interposed plates
 should be about one-fourth of the number of cells in the battery.
 Thus for a battery of 12 cast-iron cells, there should be 3 cells
 or 2 plates between the two terminal plates.                 For a battery of
 100 cast-iron cells in      series,  there   may   be 25   decomposing     cells
 or 24 interposed plates.         A battery of 100 cells has twenty-five
times the intensity of a battery of 4 cells, therefore the current
 from it will overcome twenty-five times as much resistance as
 the current from 4 cells, and will pass through 25 decomposing
 cells successively as freely as a current from a battery of 4 cells
 will pass through a single decomposing cell. If the current
 from a battery of a hundred well insulated cells be sent through
 25 decomposing cells, and afterwards through the coil of a gal
 vanometer, which coil is made of thick copper wire, it will be
 found that the deflection of the needle will be equal to that
 which will be produced by a current from a battery of 4 cells
 passing through one decomposing cell and through the coil of
 the same galvanometer.            Hence there is as much of the mixed
  gases produced in each of the 25 decomposing cells as in the
  single cell through which the current from the battery of 4 cells
 passed, that      is,twenty-five times            much         as
                                                               the mixed gases of

minute as they issue from the jet, and are confined in the vol
tameter for the remaining fifty-five seconds, the flame will, when
thrown on lime, give a light twelve times as large as one a quarter
of an inch in diameter, or nearly seven-eighths of an inch in
diameter.          If
                 the breadth of the hole in the key of the stopcock
be ºrth of the circumference of the key, and if the key make a
revolution in every two minutes, the stopcock, because it is
opened twice in each complete revolution of the key, will be
opened once in every minute for five seconds, and will be closed
for fifty-five seconds.     Now by clockwork it is very easy to
make the key of the stopcock perform a revolution once in
every two minutes, and consequently to produce a lime light
seven-eighths of an inch in diameter for five seconds in every
minute. It is easy to make the motion of the key and the ratio
 of the diameter of the hole to the circumference of the key such
that the stopcock will be opened once in two minutes for ten
 seconds, and will be closed for a minute and fifty seconds.      In
 order to light the gases whenever the stopcock is opened, it is
 necessary to have a small flame of gas or of a candle always at
 the nozzle of the jet.    A lime light of seven-eighths of an inch
in diameter would be seen at a far greater distance, particularly
in foggy weather and in snow-storms, than the light of a lamp;
 and is therefore of the utmost importance in lighthouses. Had
 there been such a light in the Bayley Lighthouse, the Victoria

 much more    easily managed    than the coke light.   The former
 requires battery a     only four large plates; the latter depends
                                   of
  onthe intensity    the current, and requires
                                  of             battery      least                      a                 of      at

 changed more frequently than the lime; and there is more reason
 to fear that the coke light will fail on account of the destruction
 of the positive coke point, than that the lime light will go out
 on account of the wearing of the lime.      For the coke light, the
 zinc plates should not contain more than 8 square inches of sur
 face.    If they be larger, the positive coke point will be rapidly
 destroyed, without a proportional increase of light.
    The sixth result is a new mode of exhibiting the dissolving
 views by means of the lime light. In the common apparatus for
 showing the dissolving views, the apertures of the lanterns are
 gradually opened and gradually closed, in order to make the
 figures come gradually into view and gradually disappear.                By
 using the mixed gases, the apertures may be left always open,
 and the figure in either lantern may be gradually brought out
 on the screen, and may be made to fade away by degrees; for
 by opening very slowly the stopcock through which the gases
 pass to the jet, the light in the lanterns may be made to increase
 very slowly till it has acquired                     its
                                         full intensity, and consequently
 the image thrown           the screen will become gradually brighter
                                      on
 till attains
         it                its

                                                   very slowly closing the
 stopcock, the light, and consequently the image, will gradually
 fade away. By exhibiting the dissolving views               this way, there      in
 is   agreat saving        the mixed  of gases;   for the  light   shines out

90                  The Rev. Dr. Callan's Eaperiments on the
meter, than it was when 4 or 5 cells were employed.          Hence it
appears, that, for want of sufficient intensity, a sensible portion
of the electric current produced by 3 cast-iron cells passes through
a solution of carbonate of soda without producing decomposition;
and therefore in decomposing water, 3 cells cannot be used with
advantage. On one occasion the current was sent from 3, 4 and
6 cells, through a solution of sulphate of soda mixed with some
carbonate of soda.     The quantity of the mixed gases was very
nearly in proportion to the number of cells and to the sines of the
angle of deviation shown by the sine galvanometer.        The sine of
deviation  appeared  to be a little less, in proportion  to the quan
tity of the gases produced, with 4 than with 3 or 6 cells. In
this case, the sulphate of soda, as well as the water, was decom
posed; for when the flame of the gases was thrown on lime, the
bright white light produced by the oxyhydrogen flame was sur
rounded by another dim light of a purple hue. With the solu
tion of carbonate of soda alone, the quantity of the gases pro
duced by 4, 5, or 6 cells appeared proportional to the number of
cells and to the sines of deviation.       Hence, cast-iron batteries
of 4, 5, or 6 cells will be equally effective in producing decom
position. But a battery of 4 cells will work as long and a half
with                           of 6 cells, and as long and a quarter
           a given charge as one
as one of        5;
                because in these batteries the quantity of electricity
constantly flowing through each cell is proportional to the num
ber of cells.     Hence in preparing a battery for decomposing
water,       all
            the cells should     arranged       be

           Decomposition        of Water       by the Galvanic Battery.                  91
the ratio  of the quantity of water decomposed to the quantity of
electricity passing through it is diminished; and consequently
that Mr. Faraday’s law of definite electro-chemical decomposition
does not hold for powerful currents, which differ much in their
intensity.    In my last experiments I perceived a defect in the
magnetic needle employed, and therefore do not feel myself
warranted in drawing a positive conclusion.      Besides, I am sure
that my experiments were not made with as much accuracy as
Mr. Faraday's were ; but they incline me to believe that the
decomposing power of strong currents decreases when their                                in
tensity increases.         I
                      am inclined to believe that there is a certain
intensity above and below which there is a loss of decomposing
power; and that, in a cast-iron battery, it is the intensity of
4 cells in one series.   I am inclined to think that, when the in
tensity is greater than that, some of the electricity passes through
water without meeting the resistance or reaction necessary for
decomposition; and that the greater the intensity the greater
the quantity which passes without the required resistance.  The
current from a battery of 12 cast-iron cells does not meet with
much resistance in passing through a solution of carbonate of
soda.    For when the current was sent, without passing through
the fluid, through the coil of the tangent galvanometer, it pro
duced a deflection of 69°; and when sent first through the fluid
and then through the coil, the needle was deflected to 68°.
When a current was sent from 60 cells, first through the fluid
and then through a pair of coke points, the deflection was the
same as when it passed through the coke points without passing
through the fluid.    Hence a current from a battery of 60 cells
appears to meet with as little resistance in passing through a
fluid as in passing through a wire. Hence a current of very high
intensity experiences little or no resistance or reaction from the
fluid, and therefore can produce little effect on                   it.

one series, the current were sent directly through the coil        the              of
galvanometer.       Subsequent experiments proved that my con
jecture was well founded.       When                12
                                           cells were arranged     two              in
rows      six each, and the current from both was sent through
          of                                                                              a

 92                      The Rev. Dr. Callan's Eaperiments on the
  flection of 67° was produced in the needle of the tangent galva
 nometer. When the current was sent from the same 12 cells
  acting in one series through the coil alone, the deflection was
 only 64°. Hence more electricity passed from the two rows of
 six each through the fluid, than from 12 cells through the wire.
  Now it is well known, that when a current of electricity passes
 from one end of a battery to the other through a conductor in
 which it meets no resistance, the same quantity will pass in a
 given time between the ends of the battery, whether it consist of
 a single pair, or of a hundred or of a thousand circles, or of any
 number whatever.             Hence more electricity will pass in any time
 through a solution of carbonate of soda from 12 cells arranged
 in two rows of six each, than will pass in the same time through
 a wire or fluid from a thousand, or any number of cells of the
 same size. Therefore whether Mr. Faraday’s law hold for power
 ful currents of great intensity, or whether the conclusion drawn
 from my experiments be just, 12 cells, arranged in two rows of
 six each, will produce more decomposition in a given time than
 will be produced by a thousand, or any number of cells acting
 in one series.                 I
                          have found, in the same way, that 8 cells, in
 two rows of four each, will produce as much, or nearly as much,
 of the mixed gases in a given time as any number acting in one
 series.     Hence, with the common voltameter, a battery of 500
 cast-iron cells, arranged in rows of four, will produce more than
fifty times as much of the mixed gases as it will produce when
 all  the cells are arranged                     in
                                       one series.     Besides, when the cells
 are arranged              in
                         rows       four,    the battery
                                                of         with given charge             a
 will act about twice           long       as
                                           when      act  as       all
                                                              one series; for   in                        in
the latter case about twice              much    electricity
                                                      as      passes constantly
through each cell                the  former,
                                      as   in    and  consequently      the power

                           is                           soon.     Hence, as    the                   on

the deflection was a little less than that which was produced by
the current from 3 cells when it passed through one decom
posing cell and the coil. The difference arose from the imper
fect insulation of the cast-iron cells.  But when the current was
sent from the same 12 cells through 4 decomposing cells, and
then through the helix of an electro-magnet by which a small
magnetic machine was driven, the speed of the machine was
considerably greater than when the current from 3 cells passed
through one decomposing cell, and then through the coil of the
electro-magnet. The wire coiled on the electro-magnet         was
about 50 feet long and one-eighth of an inch thick. The coil of
the galvanometer is about 7 feet long and three-eighths of an
inch in diameter.    The resistance in the latter was insensible
compared with the resistance in the former.
   The ratio which the acting surface of each electrode should
bear to that of the zinc in each circle may be found by putting
a pair of large plates into a glazed vessel, and connecting them
with the opposite ends of a battery of 4 cast-iron cells in each
of which the zinc plate is small, so that the current will pass
through the coil of a galvanometer.            If a solution of carbonate
of soda be then gradually poured into the glazed vessel until the
needle ceases to recede from the magnetic meridian, that                                                       is,

time.        I
           have found that when the battery is not very powerful,
the brilliant light comes only from the positive coke point. For,
if a coke point and a copper point be used instead of two coke
points, and if the coke point be connected with the positive end
of the battery, the light is as brilliant as if two coke points were
employed. But if the coke point be connected with the negative,
and the copper point with the positive end, the light will be
worthless.             I
                 forgot to make this experiment when       had occa                         I
sion to use a   very powerful battery.       may mention here that     I
with 60 cast-iron cells in which the zinc plates were 2 inches
by 4,    Iwas able to fuse and deflagrate a round piece of steel
# inch diameter.      Although                      I
                                   made a far greater number of
experiments on the lime light than on the coke light,        am not                               I
able to state positively the size of the battery, which, by decom
posing water, would produce a lime light equal in illuminating
power to that of a pair of coke points ignited by a battery of
40 cast-iron cells in which the zinc plates are 2 inches by 4.
I can only say that              I
                         think it probable that a battery twice, or
very nearly twice the size, would be required.       With regard to
the length of time the two batteries would work with a given
charge,      I
          am equally uncertain.    In decomposing water,        the                                    all
cells must    arrangedbe   rows   four each,

    6,  I  coated about two-thirds of the inside of a Berlin glass
beaker of 4 inches depth by 2 inches width with tin-foil, leaving
about 1:5 of an inch of the upper portion uncoated.           On the
E.      of the air-pump    I placed a glass plate, and on it the glass
  eaker, covering the whole with an open-mouth glass receiver,
on which was placed a brass plate having a thick wire passing
through      collars of leather; the portion of this wire within the
receiver was enclosed in an open glass tube.          One end of the
secondary coil was attached to the wire and the other to the
plate of the air-pump.        As the vacuum improves, the effect is
truly surprising; at first a faint, clear, blue light appears to
proceed from the lower part of the beaker to the plate; this gra
dually becomes brighter, until by slow degrees it rises, increasing .
in brilliancy until it arrives at that part which is opposite or on
a line with the inner coating; the whole being intensely illumi
nated, a discharge then commences from the inside of the beaker
to the plate of the pump in minute but diffused streams of blue
light; continuing the exhaustion, at last a discharge takes place
in the form of an undivided continuous stream overlapping the
vessel, as if the electric fluid was itself a material body running
over. When first witnessed, it appears at the moment impossible
to divest the mind of such a conclusion.
    7. If the position of the beakers is reversed by placing the
open part on the plate of the air-pump, and the upper wire is
either in contact or within an inch of the outside of the vessel,
streams of blue lambent flame appear to pour down the sides to
the plate, while a continuous discharge takes place from the
inside coating.
    8. A thin piece of talc or very thin glass coated on one side with
tin-foil, and the other having a figure as a star, cross letters, &c.,
also of tin-foil, produces a very beautiful experiment.    The larger
coating is attached to one end of the coil; the wire of the other
is then by means of a glºss rod brought into contact with the
figure of the star, cross, &c., which is immediately illuminated in
the most brilliant manner, and the well-known odour of ozone, as
from the electrical machine, is perceptible to an unusual degree.
    9. When the air in a glass tube 4 feet 2 inches long and
2 inches in diameter, similar to those used for the aurora expe
riments, is exhausted, the discharge takes place, illuminating
 the entire tube.
    I  will not occupy your valuable space with any further detail
 of experiments made by myself with this really beautiful instru
 ment, the construction of which reflects so much credit on the
ingenuity and talent of M. Ruhmkorff.

                 Mr. F. C. Calvert        on the Adulteration            of Oils.             101
kaolins, which are merely decomposed granitic rocks, undergo in
the alkali losses much greater than those of granitic rocks.
    Other conditions being the same, the action of alkalies on
rocks increases with the amount of silica, with the absence of
crystalline structure and of hyaline quartz.       On this account,
vitreous rocks which contain little or no quartz, as retinite, obsi
dian, trachyte, are very strongly affected by alkalies.
   When instead of alkalies we use alkaline carbonates, some
rocks, especially the vitreous, are still acted upon, but much less
energetically than by the caustic alkalies.
   The readiness with which alkalies, and even alkaline car
bonates, act upon rocks, shows how cautiously they should be
used for the separation of the free and directly soluble silica that
may be mechanically mixed in a rock, as particularly in the
kaolins and the finer clays.
     I
     may remark, that, for instance, in obsidian the silica dis
solved is not free, but in the state of soluble silicate; more
over, in retinite the silica is not in the state of opal, as is sup
                                                                                               is all
posed, but in that of soluble hydrosilicate.        Generally in
vitreous    porphyritic rocks, hydrous
                 or                          anhydrous, the silica

   The most difficult part of my researches has been to procure
oils the purity of which                           I
                            could depend on, and to arrive at this
object      I
          was obliged in many cases to obtain samples from their
sources of production on the Continent; and even then I took
the precaution of ascertaining their degree of purity by applying
to them the various tests which      shall describe further on.     I
                      I
                                                                                                                 by or is,
   The reason    why     employed   so many reagents          that the
adulterations which commercial interests may have              dictate,
are numerous; and that the reactions presented                 organic
substances, and especially oils, are exceedingly delicate.      would                                                I
strongly recommend that samples          pure          tested  compa      of              oil    be
ratively with those suspected      being adulterated, and never

   The colorations here described are very marked, and can be
employed with advantage to discover several well-known cases of
adulteration; for instance, if 10 per cent. of sesame, or French
nut, exists in olive; as for poppy with the same oil, the tinge
produced not being so intense as the preceding ones, so small
an adulteration cannot be detected with certainty; and admitting
any doubt remained in the mind of the operator as to whether
                             by oil
the adulterating      was sesame, French nut,         poppy,     wouldor                he

    Calculations have been made to determine the ratio y from
the velocity of sound; but as many of them involve erroneous
values of the coefficient of elasticity E, the experiments have to
be reduced anew.
    The following calculation is founded on an experiment quoted
by Poisson on the velocity of sound in atmospheric air, the
values of E, m, and A being taken from the experiments of
 M. Regnault.
                     a=340.89 metres per second.
      g=9m'80896.              h–0m:76.                T=15°9 Centigrade.
                     E=0.003665;              *A = 10513.
Consequently, for atmospheric               air,
                                     y=1401.
 •  The results of a reduction, according to correct data, of the
experiments of Dulong upon the velocity of sound in atmospheric
air, oxygen, and hydrogen, are as follows:—
                Atmospheric air . . . . y= 1.410
                Oxygen          . .    .     .     .     .   .    1'426
                Hydrogen           .   .      .    .     .   .    1426 .
    Thus it appears, that for the simple substances, oxygen and
hydrogen, the ratio N is the same, while for atmospheric air it
is somewhat smaller”.

Mr. W.        J.      M. Rankine           on the Mechanical Action                                    of      Heat.      115
  (12.) The ordinary mode of expressing the specific heats of
gases is to state their ratios to that of an equal volume of atmo
spheric air at the same pressure and temperature.
  When                     a very small fraction, specific                                                     of unity of
                # is                                                                            heats
          of a perfect gas are given by the equations

That is to say, the specific heat of unity of volume at constant
volume is inversely proportional to the fraction by which the
ratio of the two specific heats exceeds unity; a conclusion already
deduced from experiment by Dulong.
   The following is a comparison of the ratios of the apparent
specific heats under constant pressure, of unity of volume of
oxygen and hydrogen respectively, to that of atmospheric air, as
deduced from equation (24), with those determined experimen
tally by De la Roche and Bérard.

  SECTION     III.-Of the       Latent and Total Heat   of Evaporation,
                            especially for Water.
   (17.) The latent heat of evaporation of a given substance at a
given temperature, is the amount of heat which disappears in
transforming unity of weight of the substance from the liquid
state, to that of vapour of the maximum density for the given
temperature, being consumed in producing an increase of volume,
and an unknown change of molecular arrangement.
   It is obvious that if the vapour thus produced is reconverted
into the liquid state at the same temperature, the heat given out
during the liquefaction must be equal to that consumed during
the evaporation; for as the sum of the expansive and compress
ive powers, and of those dependent on molecular arrangement
during the whole process, is equal to zero, so must the sum of
the quantities of heat absorbed and evolved.
   The heat of liquefaction, at a given temperature, is therefore
equal to that of evaporation, with the sign reversed.
   (18.) If to the latent heat of evaporation at a given tempera
ture is added the quantity of heat necessary to raise unity of
weight of the liquid from a certain fixed temperature (usually
that of melting ice) to the temperature at which the evaporation
takes place, the result is called the total heat of evaporation from
the fixed temperature chosen.
   According to the theory of Carnot, this quantity is called the
constituent heat of vapour; and it is conceived, that if liquid at
the temperature of melting ice be raised to any temperature and
evaporated, and finally brought in the state of vapour to a certain
given temperature, the whole heat expended will be equal to the
constituent heat corresponding to that given temperature, and
will be the same, whatsoever may have been the intermediate
changes of volume, or the temperature of actual evaporation.
   According to the mechanical theory of heat, on the other hand,
the quantity of heat expended must vary with the intermediate
circumstances; for otherwise no power could be gained by the
alternate evaporation and liquefaction of a fluid at different
temperatures.
   (19.) The law of the latent and total heat of evaporation is
immediately deducible from the principle of the constancy of the
total vis viva in the two forms of heat and expansive power, when
the body has returned to          its
                                  primitive density and temperature,
as already laid down        in
                            article     7.

into contact with the parts of the plant whose electric deport
ment was to be ascertained, the wires were connected with a
galvanometer, and the action upon the needle of the instrument
was observed.      This procedure has, however, a source of error
connected with it from which the results of the observations
cannot be set free.     It is well known, although not sufficiently
attended to  by   investigators  of the electro-chemical school, that
platinum, in contact with different liquids, exhibits different de
 grees of electric excitation.     The sum or difference of these
 actions must of   necessity  change  the quantity, and perhaps also
 the quality of the original action due to the plant alone.      The
observations communicated    by Wartmann and Becquerel, even
though of themselves perfectly correct, could therefore give no
answer to the question, whether plants, in their natural condi
tion, and during their free growth, discharge electricity.
   To examine the electric deportment of a plant as it occurs in
nature, it is absolutely necessary to bring it into such relation
with the apparatus used in the experiments, that            natural              its
conditions shall        be

   Upon this idea the following arrangement       the apparatus          of                     is
founded. Two glass beakers were filled with   mercury       height               to  a
of half  an inch above the bottom, and then filled nearly       the                       to
rim with water. Platinum   wires, smelted into glass tubes, dipped
with their well-amalgamated ends, which projected for some
lines only beyond the glass tubes, into the mercury, their other
ends being connected with the helix            very delicate multiply

equilibrium was soon established again, either of itself, or by
the moderate moving of the liquid metal by a glass rod.
   To examine the electric condition of a plant, it was placed
between the two beakers in the place of the bibulous paper. At
the termination of the experiment the circuit was again closed
with the paper, in order to be assured that at the commencement
of a new experiment every foreign influence was effectually re
moved.
   In the first place, plants of the most varied kinds, having
their roots washed in flowing water, were examined.   The roots,
including the attached fibres, dipped into one of the beakers; a
portion of the uninjured leaves into the other. Having observed
the direction of the consequent deflection, the experiment was
interrupted, and, when the equilibrium had once more esta
blished itself, the position of the plant was reversed and the
experiment    repeated; that is to say, the roots were now caused
to  dip into the beaker, which in the former experiment con
tained the leaves; the current, so far as it was dependent on an
electric excitation due to the plant, must therefore in the latter
case be reversed in direction.
   The observed deflection sometimes amounted to a few degrees
merely, sometimes it was a large arc. The direction of the de
flection was however in              all
                             cases the same, and announced the
existence   of current which passed through the plant from the
                 a
root to the leaves.
   As the numerous plants experimented with were not         equally           all
sappy, nor did they possess equal lengths and thicknesses, they
did not present the same surface       contact    the water; great

degree,     I
           do not desire to have any remark of mine placed in a

they have a sufficient degree of probability to merit further inves
tigation.
   61. It would, then, seem that the epimetric e(w) is susceptible
of finite algebraic evaluation; and this for two reasons.
   62. First. The six quantities s are not independent, but are
functions of the five quantities w. They do not, therefore, con
stitute the roots of a general equation of the sixth degree, and,
being subject to the internal relation (l), their determination is
facilitated. (Wide Poinsot, loc. cit. sup.)

    IF it be required to introduce a certain quantity of air at a
       stated temperature higher than that of the atmosphere into
 a building, it might at first sight appear that the utmost occonomy
 would be attained if       the heat produced   all the combustion                        by                                of

tings took root treated by the new method as had rooted by the old.
The mortality in the open ground was increased by slugs having
eaten off above the soil some of the cuttings; those thus damaged
were examined after they had been in the ground a month, and it
was found that the collodion was quite as sound as when first ap
plied. It would therefore appear that the collodion seals the wound
of the cutting, and protects it from the fatal effects of damp, until
roots are prepared to force through the covering of gun-cotton.       It
is further stated, that the application of this solution has been found
to be exceedingly beneficial in the pruning of such plants as Euphor
bia speciosa, Impatiens latifolia, Impatiens latifolia-alba, Hoya bella,
Hoya imperialis, &c., the cut branches being prevented from bleeding.
   It is the author's intention next spring to follow out this experi
ment, in budding and grafting, as he considers that it will also be
useful in this branch of horticulture.
   Gutta-percha, dissolved in aether, was in some instances substi
tuted to heal the wounds caused by pruning; yet owing to this so
lution not drying as rapidly as collodion, the first, and sometimes
the second application was not sufficient,
   The effect of these solutions upon cut flowers was very marked.
Two branches were gathered as nearly alike as possible; to the
flower-stalks of the one, collodion was applied.          These flowers
were placed in vases filled with water; those coated over with
collodion began to fade in thirty-six hours, and many were quite
dead in three days; whilst the flowers merely placed in water in the
ordinary manner remained fresh and healthy,            Those that faded
soonest were Reseda odorata and Tropaolum majus, and those which
were least affected were Tagetes erecta and Senecio erubescens.

  case of more general theorems.
     Theorem A.—If the sum of the roots a, b, c, d-2n—1, and n be
  added to each of the less set, and subtracted from each of the greater,
  the increase in the sum of the squares of the new roots will be 2n.

                       the sum of the roots =2n+1, and n be added to
  each of the less set and subtracted from each of the greater, the
  diminution in the sum of the squares of the new roots will be 2n. In
     By means of these he shows—
     Theorem C.—If any four squares be assumed which compose an
 odd number, these may be diminished till four squares are attained
 the sum of whose roots will equal 1.

     By applying the first of these theorems to four roots, the sum of
 whose squares is an odd number, the author deduces, in a tabular
 form, the squares (four or less) which compose the odd numbers
 from 21 to 87; and remarks that there does not appear to be any
 limit to this mode of continuing to increase the sum of four squares
 by 2 each time.      As, however, although this may render it probable
 that every odd number is composed of four, three, or two squares, it
 falls very short of a mathematical proof, unless it can be shown that
 the series can be continued by some inherent property belonging to
 it,   he proceeds       examine the series,
                               to                    order                in

  Theorem D.—If any three terms of an arithmetical series, and
omitting the 4th term, the three following terms be arranged thus,

the sum     of the   squares    of    each set    of terms will be the            same.
  Theorem E.—If four numbers in arithmetical progression be placed
thus,                                  (t    ,         a + 2b,

ference shall be four times the arithmetic ratio, as a +7b–(a–b),

ON THE OCCURRENCE OF                  NICKEL AND COBALT IN SOME MINERAL
  SPRINGS, AND ON A METHOD                    FOR THEIR ISOLATION.   BY
  OSSIAN HENRY.
        AZADE   some time since stated that he had found in the
         chalybeate springs of Neyrac and      ochreous deposits, its

ment, the author has tested several chalybeate waters for nickel
and cobalt, and ascertained the presence     these two metals by of
the following process:–
   To large quantity            of

iron is completely converted into oxide and deposited. The deposit
of the spring itself may also be taken. These deposits are dissolved
in muriatic acid, and evaporated to a certain degree for the removal
of the glucina, titanium, sand and silica, when the solution generally
contains only alumina, lime, magnesia, iron, manganese, nickel and
cobalt.                                                       -
   To this solution carbonate of soda is again added until a precipi
tate is obtained, which is agitated in the air with a large quantity of
water.     It is then washed; and when it has become oxidized in the
air, it is brought into contact with water which has been saturated
with carbonic acid in an apparatus fitted for the purpose. This
dissolves only the carbonates of nickel and cobalt, upon which sul
phuretted hydrogen is passed through the solution, or hydrosul
phuret of sodium added to                 it.
   By this means the nickel and cobalt are separated, generally very
slowly,                      of

stalline compound, which is no doubt a hydrate of sulphuretted
hydrogen, must be produced when a small quantity of water is en
closed with hydrate free from acid; the water then combines with
the sulphuretted hydrogen under the pressure of the condensing
sulphuretted hydrogen (17 atmospheres). Under this pressure it is                          -
permanent at ordinary temperatures. If the tube be heated in water

IT terrestrial
       is known that  by the investigations of Gauss, observations on
                   magnetism have been raised from mere compari
sons to actual measurements, which in point of precision are
comparable to astronomical ones.         The system of measurement
here referred to has, however, been employed hitherto in obser
vations on the horizontal elements of the earth’s magnetism alone,
the horizontal intensity and declination.            It is true that these
horizontal elements form in themselves a complete system, from
which, as Gauss has shown, a complete determination of the
earth’s magnetism may be obtained without the aid of observa
tions on the inclination.      But it is also true that the attainment
of this end would be facilitated by means of observations on the
inclination, and hence the latter must not be disregarded.              At
present, however, such observations by no means possess that
classic character which those on the horizontal elements have
attained through the use of the magnetometer.                  The causes
of their deficiency in this respect are essentially two: First.
The action of the vertical magnetic force is not observed by
itself, but in combination with the action of gravity on our pon
derable needles.      A separation of the effects due to each of the
two forces is certainly possible, by demagnetizing the needle
and thus obtaining several combinations of the two; but the

154        Prof. Weber on the Application                              of Magnetic Induction
determination of the vertical magnetic force thus obtained can
never possess that degree of precision which a determination of
 the horizontal magnetic force now enjoys, inasmuch as the latter
is deduced from effects produced by this force alone, and unin
fluenced by any other forces.        Secondly. The magnetometric
arrangements, on which the possibility of accurate observation
depends, cannot be applied to instruments for measuring the
inclination, on account of the influence of friction which is inse
parable from such instruments; and as long as this exists, the
application of more accurate methods of observation would simply
lead to deceptive results.  These defects are so intimately con
nected with the conditions under which the action of the vertical
component of the earth’s magnetism on the magnetism of other
bodies must be observed, that they cannot possibly be avoided;
the most ingenious arrangement and combination of observations
may serve to diminish the prejudicial consequences of these de
fects, but never to remove them.                               -
   Soon after Faraday’s discovery of magnetic induction, Gauss
drew attention to the possibility of investigating the earth’s
magnetism by observing        action         its
                                          the electricity   bodies;
                                                                  on                           of
and, acting         on
                 this suggestion,  Weber,      1837, constructed         in
new instrument for measuring the magnetic inclination, which                                                  he a
named the “Induction-Inclinatorium+.”        This instrument was
completelyfree from the first                       of of the above-mentioned   defects,
that
      is

effects from those            of
                       the vertical  magnetic force.   The second
defect, however, was not removed; magnetometric arrangements
could not yet        be
                   combined with this instrument             obtain                    so    as    to
accurate results, hence this new method was          avail.                      of   no
     Atlength Weber has succeeded        removing this second defect

to give the signs, proceed from a galvanic battery; in the other they
are induced in the electric conductor by means of magnetic force.
Weber has constructed a telegraph of the latter kind, where
the earth’s magnetic force induces electric currents strong enough
to be used for giving signs. For such induction, either the
horizontal or the vertical component of the earth’s magnetism
may be used.        Let us suppose the telegraph to be a so-called
needle-telegraph     (such as are used in England), in which the
current gives the sign by passing through a helix and de
flecting a needle suspended in the same from the magnetic
meridian.     It is evident that, by an exact comparison of the
deflections, we may determine the ratio of the intensities of the
electric currents respectively induced by the vertical and hori
zontal component of the earth’s magnetic force; this ratio is
the tangent of the required inclination. In constructing such a
telegraph, therefore, it is necessary to obtain deflections of the
needle which are capable of accurate measurement, and at the
same time to exclude                   all
                             disturbing influences. For the former
purpose      it clear, that,

 circle, strikes                   on

once found they can be fixed there. This position is determined by
seeking the arc through which the induction coil must be moved,
so that the induced currents may annihilate one another.              The
position of the induction coil which corresponds to the middle
of this arc is the position of the brass pins at the moment when
they should strike the screws.        The two ends of the wire of the
inductor are led to the clamps p, p and there fastened.              From
these   clamps   the  connecting   wires  pass  over the  pulley  C to the
galvanometer.
   Fig. 3 is a section of the multiplication coil together with the
magnetic needle.       The circumference of the cylindrical surface
around which the wire is coiled is 1027.4 millims., its diameter
is aa =a'a', and its breadth aa' =225.6 millims. Around this
cylindrical surface two copper wires, covered first with spun wool
and then with gutta percha, were coiled side by side.            Each wire
is 992656 millims. long, and the mean sectional area of both
wires taken together is 8:1682 square millims.              Each of these
 wires forms 779      coils, arranged  in  twenty-five  strata.   The cir
 cumference of the last stratum is 1523.4 millims.
    In the middle of the coil the magnetic needle NS is sus
 pended on a prismatic bar, which can be moved along a cross
 bar bb and screwed fast to it.             Above the coil is another
 cross-bar, parallel to the lower one, and suspended from a fine
 wire; the two are connected at their extremities by two thin
 vertical connecting rods which pass outside the multiplication
 coil. To the upper cross-bar a mirror and torsion circle is affixed.
 Lastly, the space enclosed by the coil, in which the needle
 oscillates, is closed on both sides by covers, cccc.
    Fig. 4 is a vertical section of the galvanometer in the direction
 of the magnetic meridian. Here the direction of the upper
 cross-bar d, as well as that of the lower cross-bar b, is perpendi
 cular to the plane of the figure. Both are connected by thin
 vertical bars attached to their extremities before and behind the
 multiplier.      The mirror e is connected with the cross-bar d
 by means of a Y-formed hook, and above the mirror, similarly
 connected, is the torsion circle hung on a thin wire. The case
 which encloses d, e, and     f  projects a little both before and behind
 the    multiplier,  and on both sides reaches down to the covers
 ccce, fig. 3; so that the connected space occupied by d, e,f
 and the coil is completely enclosed, with the exception of an
 opening through which the thin suspending wire passes.                  A
 parallel plate of glass is placed in the side of this case immedi
 ately before the mirror, so that the image of the scale may be
 observed in the mirror by a telescope.          Lastly, the frame of the
 multiplier has a hexagonal form, and the undermost side of this
 hexagon rests upon a stone pedestal A.

   Fig. 5 is a ground plan of the building, showing the relative
situations of the inductor C, the galvanometer B, and the tele
scope and scale A.      The distance between the galvanometer
and inductor is so   great, that the influence of the galvanometer
needle on the inductor vanishes in comparison to that of the
earth’s magnetism.    The inductor stands on three foot-screws
a, b, c, which are used to give the axis of the inductor a perfectly
vertical or horizontal position, according as the horizontal or ver
tical component of the earth’s magnetic force is used for induction.
   It was so contrived, that during the observations the person
 at the telescope could            the inductorset    rotation     means     in                    by                 of

 galvanometer and inductor passed over the telescope-stand close

    For correct and convenient measurements                the inclination,          of
which          present interests us, Weber remarks that                                          all         dimen

Should the deviation of the needle be thus too great to be con
veniently measured by the scale, only half the amount of wire
(about 10 kilogrammes) need be employed for the inductor.
This diminution of the mass of the inductor would have another
advantage, the rotation of the inductor coil could be made with
greater ease.
             memoirs”. Weber has shown the application of the
      In former
induction stroke to delicate measurements, and has developed
the rules according to which the deviations of the magnetic
needle, produced by the induced electric currents, are multiplied
in the galvanometer, as well as subjected the observations
to mathematical calculation.    It is not necessary to repeat
these rules here; it will be sufficient to give the observations
made in accordance with them, from which it may be de
cided whether, in this instrument for the measurement of the
inclination, the necessary delicacy is combined with the intended
 simplification of labour, as it should be in order to be an essen
tial improvement upon the best known inclination instruments.

 162      Prof. Weber on the Application        of Magnetic Induction
    In  each  of these series it will be      seen   that the distance of
 elongation increases, not uniformly, but according to a known
 law; it approaches a certain limit, from which the damping
 power, or the decrementum logarithmicum, may be easily calcu
 lated.   Let  a represent    this limit, and log #the   decrementum    loga
rithmicum, then the distance of elongation No. n=4,            -a(1–6"),

    According to this formula, the decrementum logarithmicum
 calculated from the above observations is
                          logº =0.075,      nearly;
and    the approximate limit for the series           of observations A, F
 =2617; for       the series of observations B,      C, D, E=627.
    The following corrections must be applied to the above values
 of the distances of elongation:—
    1. The correction due to the influence of the oscillation          of the
needle at the commencement of the observations.
    If  + e be the elongation of the needle immediately preceding
the first induction stroke, then to the next following Te0 must
be added, to the second + e6°, to the third Te0°.                    For the
above observations, where e=0, this correction is unnecessary.
    2. According to the laws of catoptrics, the observed distances
of elongation are proportional to the tangents of double the
angles of deflection; they must be reduced to values propor
tional to the sines of half the angles of elongation, i. e. to the
deflecting forces.     For this purpose the horizontal distance from
the mirror to the scale must be known; in the present case this
distance    r-  3685 divisions of the scale.        If a be the observed
distance of an elongation, then its reduced value is
After this reduction,     a   determination of the tangent of the incli
nation may be obtained from each observation in the columns
B, C, D, E by dividing it by the mean of the observations in
the columns A, F. The following table shows the results:—

     This result agrees with    Hansteen's investigations on the
observations made at other      places in Europe, by showing that
the  yearly decrease of inclination in Göttingen has become less.

 zones of drift as they mantle round the nucleus of the Weald,                                               I
 have endeavoured to show, that exactly as we recede from the
 vicinity of the higher beds, their relics become correspondingly
 rare.   The rounded gravel of the eocene, except here and there
 a  stray pebble, as a general rule, disappears on the thoroughly
 denuded chalk downs.      Entire flint modules which abound there
 become rare, and are succeeded by angular and fragmentary in
 the greensand country.      Here, in my subcretaceous zone, we
 find large accumulations of flint, mixed up with fragmentary
 chert and sandstone, with now and then a chalk pebble or an
 eocene pebble,       entangled  all  deep drifts      disintegrated
                                                         in                            of

that country, and he will be satisfied that drift of the real diluvial
character is not wanting to this, the barest part of the Wealden.
    The presence of these detrital masses, and the absence of the
remains of the higher strata on these elevated ridges, ought to
be received as corroborative proof of the community of character,
and the one and indivisible nature of these drifts of denudation.
It   is to be remembered that thousands of feet of greensand,
chalk, and tertiary beds have been cast off from these elevated
ridges, and it is only wonderful that any fragments of their ruins
are still to be found in their vicinity.           I venture to reassert,
then, my conviction, that a large and comprehensive view of the
arrangement      of drift in concentric zones is agreeable to nature
and    fact, from the patches of eocene to be found on the Hamp
shire chalk down to the lowest beds of Hastings and Winchelsea;
with such exceptions only as tend to confirm the rule.
    Of the absence of the usual mammal bones in the Wealden
 zone of drift,  I infer but little, but that little is of the affirmative
character.      All the upper beds being removed, the greater the
chance that with them would be removed the remains of the
animals which died a natural death on the original surface of the
country, or of the surrounding countries, or which perished in
                                                                     -
the catastrophe we contemplate.
    Much remains to be said in reference to the local arrange
ments of drift ; the involved and tumultuous admixture of sands
and clays, the manufacture of brick-earths and loams on the
spot on which they are found, and the quasi stratified beds*
of sand and gravel, and of the boulder clays which have been
swept into the great synclinals on either side; but it is most
convenient to confine our attention at present to the central
and most simple, as well as the most illustrative part of our
subject.       Of the fossil or diluvial wood, and trunks of trees
in situ    amongst     the gravel beds of Surrey, below the chalk,
spoken of by Sir R. Murchison (on the authority of Mr. Austen)
in attestation of “a true terrestrial surface” after the commence
ment of the denuding aera,          I  cannot say that they do not exist;
       I
but have looked into many gravel-pits there, and in the cor
responding districts under the South Downs, and have never   I
seen any wood in drift which was not of the most modern de
       I
    * believe that many of these diluvial beds contain organic remains
derived from the latest tertiaries, broken up tempore denudationis.    Such
remains are supposed to be of pleiocene date, as assimilating to, or even
identical with, existing species.
    Specimens of this sort were shown to me by Mr. Mackie from the drift at
Folkstone, and it was from some such semi-stratified deposit near Bogmor,
 I suspect, that Lady Murchison took the shells spoken of by Sir Roderick.

     It remains that should say something more of the well
 known raised beach at Brighton, and of the parallel case at
  Sangatte, described by Mr. Prestwich.         I     have treated these,
       I
 and still consider them as       belonging  to the eocene aera, brought
 into view at these    places by  sea-section.     I cannot but entertain
 the same opinion till similar appearances are pointed out at the
 same level below the chalk, and within the areas of denudation on
 either side of the channel.      At the same time I am not prepared
 to insist that there were not intermissions in the operation of
 denuding forces; and that during some such lull these beaches
 may have been formed.            I
                                 have not said, as Sir Roderick seems
 to  think, that the denudation of the Weald was the work of one

 transient great act of elevation and flood; but of this am quite
 assured, that the first great upburst gave the character of these
 forces, as evinced by the arrangements of anticlinals, the fissures
 which determined the disposition of valleys, the watershed and
 drainage.       Ibelieve also there is evidence to prove a long-con
 tinued season of oscillation, and perhaps of unremitting violent
 aqueous erosion contemporaneous therewith. This was succeeded
 by a sudden, and not a gradual retirement of these angry waters,
 and the season of tranquillity which has continued up to this
 time.       I
            hope to be pardoned for insisting thus strongly on the
 unity of action, and the grandeur of proportions of these great
 changes, when it is considered that Buckland and some other of
our best authorities have held similar sentiments; and that in
working out the details of these and contemporaneous operations
in their entirety, we bring forward the best tests of the bold
generalizations of Elie de Beaumont.
    The season seems to be at hand when we shall find less diffi
culty in readmitting the agency of catastrophic action into the
elements of change.        The able expositor of the geological phae
nomena of Patagonia has said, that any sudden operation which
would account for the spread of the drift materials of that part
of South America would disturb the relations of half a hemi
sphere.     And why not ? Are we not on the eve of believing that
at no very remote period we were without any Gulf-stream, and
that   itsestablishment (and how could     it   be   otherwise than sud
denly established?) put      anend     the “glacial period,” and gave
                                      to

        MY   DEAR        MR. Stokes,
Phºssº noon a copy of
                           FISCHER       has put into my hands this after
                                 your interesting paper “On the Metallie
Reflexion exhibited by certain Non-metallic Bodies,” in which                           I
observe the following passage:–
   “In mentioning my own observations on safflower-red, Hera
pathite, &c., nothing is further from my wish than to neglect the
priority of those to whom priority belongs. M. Haidinger had
several years before discovered the phaenomenon of the reflexion
of differently coloured oppositely polarized pencils, which Sir
David Brewster shortly afterwards, and independently, discovered
in the case of chrysammate of potash.”
   My experiments were made in the end of 1842 and the begin
ning of 1843, with crystals of chrysammate of potash sent to me
on the 2nd of December 1842 by Mr. Schunck, along with
other seven new substances, aloetinate of potash, &c. Mr.Schunck
directed my attention to the green metallic lustre of the salt, and
to the redness of          its
                      solution, which   instantly examined.

    In the fifth and   eighth  columns respectively are given the
actual pressures and volumes corresponding to the logarithms in
the third and sixth columns, to five places of figures.
    In the ninth column are given the values of the quantity
denoted by PIV, in the formulae, which represents the mechanical
action of unity of weight of steam at full pressure, or before it
has begun to expand, in raising an equal weight.     Those values
are expressed in feet, being the products of the pressures in the
fifth column by the volumes in the eighth, and have been found
by multiplying the absolute temperature in Centigrade degrees
by 15348 feet. Intermediate terms in this column, for a given
pressure or a given volume, may be approximated to by the
method of differences, the constant difference for 5° Centigrade
being 767-4 feet; but it is more accurate to calculate them by
taking the product of the pressure and volume.

        HE          an abstract of which we are about to give, is
                 memoir,
        a posthumous one, and was presented to the Academy of
Paris by Arago.       Of the four paragraphs which the author
intended the memoir to contain, the first only was completed.
   When a liquid, such as water, issues through a cylindrical
efflux tube, it produces under certain circumstances musical tones
of great intensity and of a peculiar quality, somewhat analogous
to that of the human voice. The fact that this phaenomenon has
not been hitherto observed, arises from the peculiar circumstances
under which alone an efflux tube can occasion such tones; for it
is necessary, first, that                    its
                           length should not differ much from                                                              its
diameter; next, that the charges      heights    the issuing liquid
                                                                  to or

should bear     certain proportion
                      a                this diameter; and lastly,
that the diameter of the reservoir should not exceed certain                                             a
magnitude, dependent        the diameter     the efflux tube;

ticularly when the diameter of the efflux tube is pretty large in
relation to that of the tube which serves as reservoir; then,
again, under like conditions, these phaenomena do not rigorously
reproduce themselves in successive experiments; and lastly, they
are influenced by a number of small and almost inappreciable
circumstances, such as the more or less perfect polish of the
efflux tube, the purity of the liquid, the cleanness of the sides of
the reservoir, &c.
   The experiments of M. Savart, so far as recorded, are intended
to illustrate,

a  small cylindrical tube was soldered.       Every precaution was
taken that the  plate    contact with the liquid

    The general influence of the charge upon the number of vibra
tions can be easily rendered sensible by inclining the tube during
the efflux of the liquid.                     In this manner, by a gradual inclina
tion from a vertical to a nearly horizontal position, the tone fell
rapidly, whereas by raising it more towards the vertical, the
tone rose higher and higher; and, what is worthy of remark,
the differences in intensity were incomparably less now than when
the tube was fixed. The tone could be easily rendered constant
by inclining it gradually towards the vertical, according as the
level of the water fell.
                 2. Influence            of the      diameter         of Efflua, Tube.
    In a preceding memoir Savart demonstrated that when a
liquid issues through a circular orifice in a thin plate, pulsations
are produced whose number is proportional to the square root of
the charge, and inversely proportional to the diameter of the
orifice.
    It   has   just been shown that with short efflux tubes the number
of vibrations conforms to the first of these laws, and what follows
will prove that the second law is also fulfilled.
    The experiments were made with efflux tubes of various dia
meters, adapted successively                       to a tube 1.70 metre in height and
5 centimetres in diameter.                         From the following table it will be
seen that the numbers of vibrations may be considered inversely
proportional to the diameters of the efflux tubes.
                    -                                                             nnnn    nann   innin     min

    But here also it is evident that this law can be but an ap
proximation to the true nature of the phaenomenon, inasmuch as
the tone makes sudden changes, and rises always somewhat higher
after each maximum of intensity has been passed.

   The height          of
                    the efflux tube has            far greater influence    a                                           on
the  production           of
                        tones than                            on
                                             their nature when produced.
Thus, when the height                       of
                                  the efflux tube exceeds the double                                                    of
its diameter, the production              tones may     of  said         almost               be         to   be
impossible, slight rustling noises are alone heard, and they, too,

tones are  impossible.       Hence             evident that the necessary

these extremes the results seemed                   indicate, first, that the

are more and more feeble                   the                 the efflux tube
becomes greater                or
                          less than         diameter; and lastly, that the
tones acquire their greatest intensity when the height                 equal                                 is         to

established,    was evident that the number was greater when
                     it
the efflux tube was shorter, and     appeared probable that thisit
number was    inversely proportional    the height    the efflux           to                            of
tube.
      Byimmersing the tube about          centimetre deep       water, and
                                                                 1                                       in

intense tones, and this continued               the case until the height
                                                                     to     be

                          the diameter.        Indeed, tones continued
to    beproduced far beyond this limit, even when the height did
not exceed one-tenth       the diameter;
                                       of         short, was only when           in                it

                                         for Savart has shown that even
then the efflux takes place with        velocity periodically variable.

meters, the only effect of causing the efflux to take place in water
seemed to be a slight depression of tone, amounting to about
half a semitone, which circumstance may be easily explained when
we consider the greater resistance of the medium - which the jet
has to penetrate.
   On repeating the experiments with efflux tubes whose dia
meters exceeded their heights, it often happened that different
results were obtained.      At such times a depression and elevation
of the tone   through     an entire octave often occur.    Hence it
would appear that the threads of liquid no longer possess that
stability in direction and velocity which was observed with longer
efflux tubes.    On this account the only conclusion drawn by
Savart from this series of experiments          that when the efflux           is,
takes place       the same medium, state

   The experiments which verified the above remarks were made
with efflux tubes 2.15 millims. and 5.4 millims.      diameter.                                in

 height, which was fixed to the centre of the plane circular base
 of a large copper vessel whose height was 0.12 metre and dia
 meter 0.68 metre.        In both cases the tones produced were
 exactly the same as those corresponding to the same heights
 of charge when simple tubes alone were used.
    The same experiments were afterwards made with efflux tubes
 of larger diameter, the apparatus in other respects being unal
 tered; the agreement in tone between tubes of the same dia
 meter throughout and tubes fixed to a much larger vessel, was
 found no longer to exist.       This agreement is likewise destroyed
 when the   height  of the  glass  tube, in relation to that of the vessel
 placed above, is less considerable; which shows that the number
 of vibrations does not depend solely upon what takes place at
 the orifice itself, but that it depends partially, at least, on the
 motion of the liquid in the tube.        This motion must be modified
 considerably during the passage of a liquid from a vessel of a
 large to one of a small capacity; for at the place of transition a
 contraction takes place which must necessarily have some influ
ence on the velocity of the liquid in the smaller tube, so that the
effect will be the same as a diminution of the charge.
    Savart confirmed the above explanation by fixing a glass tube,
 with an efflux tube 4.65 millims. in diameter, to the copper vessel
 above described.     The total charge was 1.06 metre. When the
upper orifice of the glass tube was partially closed by placing a
 disc at the bottom of the copper vessel, a depression of tone took
place; at first this depression was inconsiderable, but it was much
increased when the disc covered      half the orifice.   This depression
was evidently caused by a diminution of the velocity with which
the liquid issued from the efflux tube.

To       electrify an insulated conductor (a Leyden phial, for
        stance, or any mass of metal resting on supports of glass)
in the ordinary way by means of an electrical machine, requires
the expenditure of work in turning the machine.            But inasmuch
as part, obviously by far the greater part, of the work done in
this operation goes to generate heat by means of friction, and of
the small residue some, it may be a considerable proportion, is

heat that would be generated by the expenditure                                               of the same
amount of work on mere friction.
   The same considerations are applicable to the magnetization
of a piece of steel; with this difference, that, according to the
hardness of the steel, the magnetization which it receives in the
nearest position will be more or less permanent; and if there be
any demagnetization after removal from the magnet, it will be
much less complete than in the case of soft iron, and that heat
will be necessarily generated both during the magnetization
which takes place during the gradual approach, and in the sub
sequent demagnetization.     Further, by putting together a num
ber of pieces of steel, each separately magnetized, a complete
magnet will be formed, of which the mechanical value will be
equal to the sum of the mechanical values of    parts, increased                   its

 196     On the Mechanical Values   of Distributions of Electricity, &c.
                      III. Electricity in motion.
    If an electric current be excited in a conductor, and then left
 without electromotive force, it retains energy to produce heat,
 light, and other kinds of mechanical effect, and it lasts with
 diminishing, or it may be with alternately diminishing and          in
 creasing strength, before it finally ceases and electrical equili
brium is established; as is amply demonstrated by the experi
ments of Faraday and Henry, on the spark which takes place
when a galvanic circuit is opened at any point, and by those of
Weber, Helmholtz, and others on the electro-magnetic effects of
varying currents. The object of the present communication is
to show how the mechanical value of all the effects that a current
in  a close circuit can produce after the electromotive force ceases
may be ascertained, by a determination founded on the known
laws of electro-dynamic induction, of the mechanical value of the
energy of a current of given strength circulating in a linear
conductor (a bent wire, for instance) of any form. To do this,
in the first place it may be remarked, that a current once
instituted in a conductor, will circulate in it with diminishing
strength after the electromotive force ceases, just as if the
electricity had inertia, and will diminish in strength according
to the same, or nearly the same, laws as a current of water or
other fluid once set in motion and left without moving force in
a pipe forming a closed circuit.      But according to Faraday, who
found that an electric circuit     consisting  of a wire doubled on
itself, with the two parts close together, gives no sensible spark
when suddenly opened compared to that given by an equal
length of wire bent into a coil, it appears that the effects of
ordinary inertia either do not exist for electricity in motion, or
are but small compared with those which, in a suitable arrange
ment, are produced by the “induction of the current upon itself.”
In the present state of science it is only these effects that can be
determined by a mathematical investigation; but the effects of
electrical inertia, should it be found to exist, will be taken into
account by adding a term of determinate form to the fully deter
mined result of the present investigation, which expresses the
mechanical value of a current in a linear conductor as far as it
depends on the induction of the current on itself.
    The general principle of the investigation is this; that if two
conductors, with a current sustained in each by a constant elec
tromotive force, be slowly moved towards one another, and there
be a certain gain   of work on the whole, by electro-dynamic force
operating during the motion, there will be twice as much work
as this spent by the electromotive forces (for instance, twice the

                            Prof. Faraday on Electric Induction.                                                        197
    equivalent of chemical action in the batteries, should the electro
    motive forces be chemical) over and above that which they would
    have had to spend in the same time, merely to keep up the cur
    rents, if the conductors had been at rest, because the electro
    dynamic induction produced by the motion will augment the
    currents; while on the other hand, if the motion be such as to
    require the eagenditure of work against electro-dynamic forces to
    produce       it,
                   there will      twice     be
                                              much work saved off the action
                                                             as

                                          currents being diminished during
    the motion.        Hence the aggregate mechanical value                the cur                       be of

    which   I  p ut forth sixteen years ago, respecting  the mutually

 198              Prof. Faraday   on  Electric Induction—
dependent nature of induction, conduction, and insulation (Ex
perimental Researches, 1318, &c.).           I am deeply indebted to
the   Company,     to the Gutta Percha     Works,   and to Mr. Latimer
Clarke, for the facts; and also for the opportunity both of seeing
and showing them well.
    Copper wire is perfectly covered with gutta percha at the
Company’s works, the metal and the covering being in every
part regular and concentric.        The covered wire is usually made
into half-mile lengths, the necessary junctions being effected by
twisting or binding, and ultimately soldering; after which the
place is covered with fine gutta percha, in such a manner as to
make the coating as perfect there as elsewhere: the perfection
of the whole operation is finally tried in the following striking
manner by Mr. Statham, the manager of the works. The half
mile coils are suspended from the sides of barges floating in a
canal, so that the coils are immersed in the water whilst the two
ends of each coil rise into the air: as many as 200 coils are thus
immersed at once; and when their ends are connected in series,
one great length of 100 miles of submerged wire is produced,
the two extremities of which can be brought into a room for
experiment.       An insulated voltaic battery of many pairs of zinc
and copper, with dilute sulphuric acid, has one end connected
with the earth, and the other, through a galvanometer, with
either end of the submerged wire. Passing by the first effect,
and continuing the contact, it is evident that the battery current
can take advantage of the whole accumulated conduction or
defective insulation in the 100 miles of gutta percha on the wire,
and that whatever portion of electricity passes through to the
water will be shown by the galvanometer.            Now the battery is
made one of     intensity,  in order to raise the character of the proof,
and the galvanometer employed is of considerable delicacy; yet
so high is the insulation, that the deflection is not more than
5°.    As another test of the perfect state of the wire, when the
two ends of the battery are connected with the two ends of the
wire, there is a powerful current of electricity shown by a much
coarser instrument; but when any one junction in the course of
the 100 miles is separated, the current is stopped, and the leak
or deficiency of insulation rendered as small as before.             The
perfection and condition of the wire may be judged of by these
facts.
    The 100 miles, by means of which I saw the phaenomena,
were thus good as to insulation.         The copper wire was ºth of
an inch in    diameter;    the covered wire was ºths; some was a
little less, being #nds in diameter; the gutta percha on the
metal may therefore be considered as 0°l of an inch in thickness,
100 miles of like covered wire in coils were heaped up on the

                Associated          cases        of Current               and Static Effects.                         199
floor of a dry warehouse and connected in one series, for com
parison with that under water.
    Consider now an insulated battery of 360 pairs of plates
 (4 x 3 inches) having one extremity to the earth; the water wire
with both            its
                   insulated ends        the room, and     in good earth dis              a
charge wire ready for the requisite communication: when the
free battery end was placed              contact with the water wire and
                                                       in
then removed, and afterwards              person touching the earth dis
charge touched also the wire,             received          he a
                                                       powerful shock. The       a
 shock was rather that                      of
                                   voltaic than  a        Leyden battery;    of   a                                    it
 occupied time, and                  by
                               quick tapping touches could               divided                            be

to   intervene between the charge and discharge                   the wire, the                of

                                                                      in                                               it

with in like manner, not the slightest signs of any of these effects
were produced.     There is reason, from principle, to believe that
an infinitesimal result is obtainable, but as compared to the water
wire the action was nothing.      Yet the wire was equally well and
better  insulated, and as   regarded  a constant current, it was an
equally good conductor. This point was ascertained by attach
ing the end of the water wire to one galvanometer, and the
end of the air wire to another like instrument; the two other
ends of the wires were fastened together, and to the earth con
tact; the two free galvanometer ends were fastened together,
and to the free pole of the battery: in this manner the current
was divided between the air and water wires, but the galvano
meters were affected to precisely the same amount.    To make
the result more certain, these instruments were changed one for
the other, but the deviations were still alike; so that the two
wires conducted with equal facility.
   The cause of the first results                                  is,

to the conditions of intensity and quantity which then come into
play; especially in the case of short or intermitting currents,
for then static and dynamic are continually passing into each
other.
    It has already been said, that the conducting power of the air
and water wires are alike for a constant current. This is in
perfect accordance with the principles and with the definite
character of the electric force, whether in the static, or current,
or transition state. When a voltaic current of a certain intensity
is sent into a long water.wire, connected at the further extremity
with the earth, part of the force is in the first instance occupied
in raising a lateral induction round the wire, ultimately equal in
intensity at the near end to the intensity of the battery stream,
and decreasing gradually to the earth end, where it becomes
nothing. Whilst this induction is rising, that within the wire
amongst         its
                particles     beneath what
                                    is           would otherwise be; but
                                                                it
as  soon    asthe first has attained its maximum state, then that                                             in
the wire becomes proportionate               the battery intensity, and
                                                        to
therefore equals that               in

 pens, so that it gave beautiful illustrations and records of facts
 like those stated: the pens are iron wires, under which a band
 of paper imbued with ferro-prussiate of potassa passes at a
regular rate by clock-work; and thus regular lines of prussian
blue are produced whenever a current is transmitted, and the
time of the current is recorded.     In the case to be described,
the three lines were side by side, and about 0.1 of an inch apart.
The pen m belonged to a circuit of only a few feet of wire and
a separate battery; it told whenever the contact key was put
down by the finger; the pen n was at the earth end of the long
air wire, and the pen o at the earth end of the long subterraneous
wire; and by arrangement, the key could be made to throw the
electricity of the chief battery into either of these wires, simul
taneously with the passage of the short circuit current through
pen m. When pens m and n were in action, the m record was
a regular line of equal thickness, showing by     length the actual           its
time during which the electricity flowed into the wires; and the
n record was       equally regular line, parallel
                         an                           and     equal                     to,            of

more yellow, but instead of the red tint a perfectly black one

the ultimate particles, is consequently much more difficult than
with crystals such as Mausite.     Here, notwithstanding the                                   di
chromatism, one body alone, peroxide of iron, suffices; for it is
sufficient to assume that the particles are so arranged, that when
a ray passes through the hexahedral prism from surface to sur
face, becoming thereby divided into two polarized perpendicular
to one another, it meets a greater number of material points or
particles with the vibrations of the ordinary ray perpendicular to
the axis, than with those of the extraordinary ray in the direction
of the axis.
   Hence the differences of tint, even the olive-green, which in
comparison with hyacinth-red appears still more green, present
no difficulty to this explanation.      They depend simply upon
greater or less absorption.    On this account, however, the colours
of  crystals  which contain   perovide  of iron in combination with
oxalic acid and alkalies appear                  all
                                         the more enigmatical; for
even when they are dichromatic, the most beautiful grass-green

in their original direction.   Thus performed, the experiment becomes
very simple and manageable, and the results, various as they are in
colour or depth of tint, are almost unfailingly elicited and often
curious or beautiful.
    Whilst the general result of viewing an illuminated object is the
production of a clearly-defined picture on the retina, appearing in
certain cases instantly, or more commonly, from 3 to 5 seconds after
the eyes are closed,—the nature or quality of the picture, with its
degree of endurance and changes, is found to present, under differ
ences in the circumstances, an almost endless variety.          Thus the
results, it was found, might be varied by differences in the time of
gazing on the object; by differences in the intensity of the external
light, and by the partial or total exclusion of the light of the room
from the eyelids; by alterations in the degree of compression of the
 eyelids; by the movement of the eyeballs during the time of obser
ving the picture; as also by variations in the normal state of the eyes
 on commencing the experiments.
    All these influencing circumstances had been made successively,
 or sometimes combinedly, the subjects of special investigation by the
 author; and ultimately, in most respects, he considered, so far as
 his own eyes might be deemed to yield general phaenomena, with
 satisfactory or conclusive results.     Various experiments had been
 made on the spectra derived from light reflected from opake objects
 in comparison with those elicited by light transmitted by transparent
 substances, both white and coloured; as also on the differences in
 the measure of endurance, the variety of their repetitions, and the
 phaenomena of their changes in colour, of the pictures photographed
 within the eye, under curiously modified conditions.
    The present communication, however, comprises only a part of
 these investigations, the first of the cases referred to at the outset,
 viz. inquiries respecting colourless pictures on the retina, derived
 from the viewing of objects under low or moderate degrees of light,
 or of pictures observed irrespective of chromatic effects.
     1. As to the effect of Time in the viewing of an illuminated object,
 on the nature and permanency of the picture produced, it was
 found that, in favourable states of the eyes, a mere momentary
 glance (such as of a window viewed from the back of a room) was
 sufficient for producing a distinct negative picture of the illuminated
 aperture, with the cross bars of the window-frame, which, under
 certain changes, could be seen ordinarily for about 20 seconds, and
 under strong light, sometimes for an interval of a minute or two of
 time, if not more.     But the impression from a continuous viewing
 of a window rather strongly illuminated, for a period of a minute,
 was very remarkable, the image remaining on the retina whilst the
 experimenter was breakfasting, and also engaged in writing, so as to
 be distinctly seen, on slightly closing the eyes, an hour afterwards,
 and, in another case which he particularly describes, after a lapse of
  80 minutes.
     2. Experiments on the effects of quantity or intensity of light, on
  the visual spectra derived from uncoloured objects, showed that
                                     Q2

220                                   Royal Society.
such spectra were yielded by extremely low degrees of illumination.
The light, for instance, of the moon or stars thrown on a white
linen blind, produced distinct negative pictures of the slightly illu
minated aperture.    Candlelight gave also negative pictures of white
and black  objects.   Low illumination from transmitted solar light
gave, in most cases, colourless pictures, appearing sometimes imme
diately on closing the eyes, as by a flash of light, or otherwise in 3
to 5 seconds in negative tints; these pictures, where the object had
been viewed for some seconds, were found to fade away and subse
quently reappear in less dark shades, sometimes with several such
changes.
   3. The changes in the optical spectra from the partial or entire
exclusion of light from the closed eyelids were found to be very
striking. No matter how this diminution or exclusion of light was
effected,—whether by the thickening of the eyelids by compression,
or turning the face away from the light, or interposing the hand
or other opake substance betwixt the eyes and the light, or covering
the face altogether,--the spectra assumed a new character as to light
and shadow, ordinarily, but not in all cases, complementary to the
tints originally observed. A total exclusion of the external light
still left the picture clear and distinct, with a continuance, after
occasional changes, little differing from that of other experi
ments.
    4. This measure of fixidity of the spectra impressed on the retina
 led the author to some curious results in obtaining duplicate or
 multiple pictures of the same object. Thus, by gazing at a window,
 successively at different fixed points previously determined on, he
 multiplied the cross bars so as to produce a picture of a window with
 twice or quadruple the number of panes. A white statuette, viewed
 at different points in succession, whilst strongly illuminated, enabled
 the author to obtain double pictures in black or gray, associated
 according to the relation of the points gazed              at,
                                                            unlimited variety.
                                                                  in
 Or viewing the statuette from two positions differing            distance,

 obtained images       of
                       different dimensions.       Double images, too, were
            by using the eyes separately; and also              lookingby                      an

 axes might diverge                          the statuette, thus beautifully

contemplated.
     5. Complete pictures were also obtained                by
                                                          the combination                      of
parts separately viewed, whilst various impressions, however incon
gruous, were combined into one picture.          Thus parts             of
                                                                 the statuette

resulting spectrum, however, were not always synchronous portions,
sometimes appearing and disappearing by separate or partial changes,
like the effect of the dissolving views of the magic lantern.
    6. Pictures, diagrams, printing, &c., were found, under due influ
ence of light, to yield cognizable and sometimes vivid impressions
on the retina.         Diagrams in black and white, or chequered surfaces
like that of a chess-board, gave very distinct pictures, always nega
tive, the squales coming successively into view, beginning with the
portion gazed at. The succession of changes, when the impression
was strong, in this experiment was not a little curious, the perfect
image of the chess-board after bursting into view, gradually fading
altogether away, and then reviving, in less strong tints, in a series
of repetitions.
    Another curious, though anticipated result, the author also de
scribes under this section,-the determination, by viewing the ocular
spectra, of portions of diagrams or elements in pictorial or typogra
phical surfaces, which had not been noticed in the act of gazing.
Thus, particularly on viewing a line of printed figures at a particular
point, without noticing those on either side, a considerable series,
right and left, were so plainly depicted on the visual organ as to be
easily known ; whilst, in like manner, a point in a line of a printed
placard being gazed at, the lines above and below came into view on
closing the eyes, and could frequently be read.
    Of certain general facts elicited by this first series of investigations,
the author notices, that in viewing impressions on the retina with
 closed eyes,           all
                       the pictures appear      occupy    position externally,
                                                                to           a
 similar      tothe effect when the objects are directly seen; that the
 spectra derived from moderate            strong degrees    transmitted light    of
 have prevalently the character
                                                        of or

 low degrees, most ordinarily,          opacity; that although many

    Inthis paper the growing importance          manganese since                                                its

are commonly mixed with those of iron, and though different methods
of separating them have been recommended, yet no very simple or
unobjectionable test for manganese seems to be known.                     Two
methods for    detecting   manganese     are recommended,      viz.-
    1. The pure hydrated fixed alkalies, potash and soda, and espe
cially potash. 2. Sulphur.
    With regard to the first method. Though the compound Cha
meleon mineral made by strongly heating nitre or potash and
peroxide of manganese together, has long been known, yet it
appears hitherto to have escaped observation, that potash seems
to be a more delicate test of manganese than any other known
substance.      The use of potash in this way is simple and easy;
it is  employed    in solution; equal weights of the alkali and water
form a fluid     well-adapted    for the purpose; different metals may
be used in the form of        slips   on which to make the experiments,
but a   preference   is given to silver foil, as it is less acted on by alka
lies than  platina,   and is more readily cleaned.        A slip of such foil,
about two or three inches in       length  and half an inch wide, answers
well.    Solids,  to be examined for      manganese,    are finely pulverized;
fluids  require  no preparation;     the smallest  portion  of either is mixed
with a drop or part of a drop of the alkali on the foil and heated by
a spirit-lamp (for many experiments a candle affords sufficient heat),
when on boiling the alkali to dryness and raising the heat, the cha
racteristic green manganate of potash will appear on the foil.             The
delicacy of the alkali as a test thus applied, will be obvious on using
the most minute portions of manganese ores in fine powder, and the
author's son, Dr. E. W. Davy, readily detected manganese in a
single drop of a solution containing one grain of solid sulphate in
ten thousand grains of water. The presence of other oxides do not
appear to impair the efficacy of this test.             A strong solution of
hydrate of soda in water, used in a similar manner, affords an ex
cellent test for manganese, little inferior in delicacy to potash, but
the latter is shown to be preferable.
    Carbonate of soda has long been regarded as one of the most
 delicate tests of manganese, especially if aided by a little nitrate or
chlorate of potash, but that carbonate is much inferior as a test for
manganese to potash or soda, requiring a far higher temperature to
form the manganate of soda, and the aid of oxidizing substances,
 as nitre and chlorate of potash, which are quite unnecessary with
 those alkalies.     Borax, too, in point of delicacy is not to be com
 pared with the fixed alkalies as a test for manganese.
    The author is of opinion that the fixed alkalies in solution and
 silver foil will form a valuable addition to the agents employed
 by the mineralogist and chemist in the examination of minerals,
ores, &c.
   2. Sulphur.—If a little flowers of sulphur be mixed with about         on
own bulk      the common peroxide
             of                          manganese, and exposed
                                         of                               a its

the sulphuret.    On treating the mass with water and filtering the
fluid, a solution of sulphate of manganese will be obtained which
will yield a white precipitate with the ferrocyanide of potassium,
without a trace of iron.
    Similar experiments may be made with any manganese ores, or
with substances known or suspected to contain manganese. The
i.
quantity of materials operated on may be increased or diminished at
pleasure; but if increased, the heat should be continued a little
longer, to decompose any remaining sulphuret, and thus add to the
           of sulphate formed.      In the same way manganese was
  etected in some minerals in which it was known to exist, and in
others in which it had not been previously found; likewise in soils
and subsoils, in the ashes of coal and peat, in a number of pigments,
and also in the ashes of different fabrics partially dyed brown by
manganese.
    Sulphate of manganese is formed, with sulphuret, when sulphurous
acid gas is made by heating a mixture of peroxide of manganese and
flowers of sulphur, even in close vessels. The sulphate may also be
more readily obtained, in quantity, by simply boiling a solution of
common green vitriol in water for about a quarter of an hour or
upwards, in contact with an excess of sesquioxide of manganese in
fine powder, till the solution affords a white precipitate with ferro
cyanide of potassium.
   Chloride of manganese may also be formed in a similar manner by
boiling an aqueous solution of protochloride of iron with an excess
of sesquioxide of manganese, or it may be made with greater facility
by dissolving this oxide in the common muriatic acid of commerce,
taking care that the oxide be present in excess.
   The brown sesquioxide of manganese may be made, not only by
means of sulphur, but more readily and better by mixing the com
mon peroxide with about one-third of its weight of peat mould, saw
dust or starch, and exposure to a red heat in an open crucible with
occasional stirring for about a quarter of an hour, or until the oxide
acquires a uniform brown colour.
   The sulphate and chloride of manganese being extensively used
in dyeing, calico-printing and other arts, and in making the com
pounds of manganese, the simple means stated of forming those
salts, free from iron (it is presumed), are material improvements on
the circuitous methods hitherto adopted.

Contact of Bodies having different Temperatures.         By John Tyn
dall,  Esq., Ph.D., F.R.S.,   Professor of Natural Philosophy, Royal
 Institution.
    In the year 1805, M. Schwartz, an inspector of one of the smelt

ing-works of Saxony, placed          a cup-shaped mass of hot silver upon a
  cold  anvil, and was     surprised  to find that musical tones proceeded
  from the mass.       In the autumn of the same year, Professor Gilbert
  of Berlin visited the smelting-works and repeated the experiment.
  He observed that the sounds were accompanied by a quivering of
  the hot silver; and that when the vibrations ceased, the sound
 ceased also.      Professor Gilbert merely stated the facts, and made
 no   attempt   to explain them.
     In the  year   1829, Mr. Arthur Trevelyan, being engaged in spread
 ing pitch with a hot plastering-iron, and once observing that the
 iron was too hot for his purpose, he laid it slantingly against a block
  of lead which chanced to be at hand; a shrill note, which he com

 proceeded from the mass, and on nearer inspection he observed that
 the heated iron was in a state of vibration.              He was induced by
 Dr. Reid of Edinburgh to pursue the subject, and the results of his
 numerous experiments were subsequently printed in the Transac
 tions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
     On the 1st of April, 1831, these singular sounds and vibrations
 formed the subject of a Friday evening lecture by Professor Faraday,
 at the Royal Institution.        Professor Faraday expanded and further
 established the explanation of the sounds given by Mr. Trevelyan
 and Sir John Leslie.        He referred them to the tapping of the hot
 mass against the cold one underneath                             it,

    He had already made some experiments, ignorant that the subject
had been further treated              by
                                   Seebeck, until informed           the fact           of              by
Professor Magnus                of
                             Berlin.    On reading Seebeck's interesting
paper,     hefound that many              of
                                     the results which       was his intention  it

which remained untouched was, however, of sufficient interest to
induce him to prosecute his original intention.
    The general laws of Professor Forbes were submitted in succession
to an experimental examination.            The first of these laws affirms
that “the vibrations never take       place  between substances of the same
nature.”      This the lecturer found to be generally the case when the
hot rocker rested upon a block, or on the edge of a thick plate of the
same metal; but the case was quite altered when a thin plate of
metal was used. Thus, a copper rocker laid upon the edge of a
penny-piece did not vibrate permanently; but when the coin was
beaten out by a hammer, so as to present a thin, sharp edge, con
stant vibrations were obtained.         A silver rocker resting on the edge
of a half-crown refused to vibrate permanently, but on the edge of
a sixpence continuous vibrations were obtained.              An iron rocker on
the edge of a dinner knife gave continuous vibrations.              A flat brass
rocker placed upon the points of two common brass pins, and having
its handle suitably supported, gave distinct vibrations.                In these
experiments the plates and pins were fixed in a vice, and it was
found that the thinner the plate within                limits      rigidity, the
                                                                   its          of
more certain and         striking  was the effect. Vibrations were thus
obtained with iron on iron, copper on copper, brass                            on
                                                                  brass, zinc on
zinc, silver        on
                   silver, tin on tin. The list might             extended, butbe
the cases cited are sufficient        show that the proposition above cited

 law    isuntenable.
    The third general law states, that “The vibrations take place

226                                            Royal Institution.
with an intensity proportional (within certain limits) to the difference
of the conducting powers of the metals for heat, the metal having
the least conducting power being necessarily the coldest.”                 The
evidence adduced against the first law appears to destroy this one
also; for if the intensity of the vibrations be proportional to the
difference of the conducting powers, then where there is no such
difference there ought to be no vibrations.           But it has been proved
in half a dozen cases, that vibrations occur between different pieces
of the same metal. The condition stated by Professor Forbes was,
however, reversed.        Silver stands at the head of conductors; a strip
of the metal was fixed in a vice, and hot rockers of brass, copper,
and iron were successively laid upon its edge: distinct vibrations
were obtained with all of them. Vibrations were also obtained with
a brass rocker which rested on the edge of a half-sovereign.             These
and other experiments show that it is not necessary that the worst
conductor should be the cold metal, as affirmed in the third general
law above quoted. Among the metals, antimony and bismuth were
found perfectly inert by Professor Forbes; the lecturer, however,
had obtained musical tones from both of these substances.
    The superiority of lead as a cold block, Professor Faraday, as
already stated, referred to                         its
                                     high expansibility, combined with                                                 its
deficient conducting power.           Against this notion, which          con                             he
siders      to  “an obvious oversight,” Professor Forbes contends

great extent avoided by reducing the metallic masses to thin laminae;

the theory supported by Professor Faraday appear, when duly con
sidered, to be converted into strong corroborative proofs of the cor

        GENTLEMEN,                            February 24, 1854.
ENººp           are two specimens of sheet copper, one coated with
      metallic aluminium and the other with silicium, by electro
deposition process; and if the following simple statement of the
manner in which they were obtained is worthy of a place in your
Magazine, I shall be happy to have it published.
   To obtain the aluminium, I boiled an excess of dry hydrate of
alumina in hydrochloric acid for one hour, then poured off the clear
liquid, and added to it about one-sixth          of its volume of water; in
this mixture I placed an earthen porous vessel containing one mea
sure of sulphuric acid to twelve measures of water, with a piece of
amalgamated zinc plate in                    it.

     To obtain the deposit of silicium, I dissolved monosilicate of pot
ash (formed by fusing together 1 part of silica with 24 parts of car
bonate of potash) in water, in the proportion of 40 grs. to 1 oz.
measure of water, proceeding in like manner as with the alumina
solutions, the process being hastened by interposing one pair of small
Smee's battery in the circuit.   With a very slow and feeble action
of the battery, the colour of the deposited metal was much whiter
than that of the aluminium, closely approximating to that of silver;
its other properties I have not yet had time to examine.

    In some researches upon crystallization which the author has
 pursued for several years, he has been led to study the absorption
 of light which takes place in coloured crystals, and the polychroism
 which accompanies             it.

dually become degraded on either side of their common limit.
   The dark tufts interrupted by the luminous spot are also fringed
towards the point with a little yellow and blue ; this coloration is
entirely local, and manifestly arises from the dispersion of the optical

chloride of aluminium.               Heated to redness in hydrochloric                      acid gas
it furnishes dry volatile chloride of aluminium.
   It will be readily understood what important                           uses such a metal,
which is white and unalterable like silver, which does not blacken
in the air, is fusible, malleable, ductile and tenacious, and has in
addition the singular property of being lighter than glass, may be
turned to if it can be obtained readily.     This I have every reason
to believe will prove to be the case, for the chloride of aluminium is
decomposed with remarkable ease by the common metals at an ele
vated temperature; and a reaction of this kind, which I am attempt
ing to carry out on a large scale, will solve this question in a prac
tical point of view.—Comptes Rendus, February 6, 1854.

XXXV.     On the Composition and Metamorphoses of some Sedi
   mentary Rocks.     By T. S. HUNT, of the Geological Commission
   of Canada”.
IN forthe1851–52,
           Report of Progress of the Geological Survey of Canada
                     I have described a peculiar metamorphosis of
a portion of the Lower Silurian shales at St. Nicolas, on the
south side of the St. Lawrence, near Quebec.        The rocks there
exposed have been minutely described by Mr. Logan; they
belong to that division of the formation which is known as the
Hudson River group, and consist of beds of greenish, quartzose
sandstones, from one to three feet in thickness, interstratified
with thin layers of greenish, bluish, or reddish shales.        The
colours of these are probably connected with different states of
oxidation of the iron which they contain. The green colour is
sometimes seen in small oblong rounded patches in the red shale,
and when in a mass of the latter a layer of from half an inch to
an inch of somewhat calcareous matter occurs, it is bounded
above and below by a portion of green slate, sometimes no more
than a quarter of an inch in thickness.         In one section near
Pointe Lévy, the green colour was seen following down a rift in
the red slates across the stratification, and spreading irregularly
on either side.   Such modes of occurrence seem to indicate a
deoxidation of the red slates by imbedded or infiltrating organic
matters.
   Mr. Logan had observed that an intrusion of trappean rocks
at St. Nicolas has altered the shales, and converted them into a
material resembling serpentine; and       as  his researches in the
                    *  Communicated  by the Author.
   Phil. Mag. S. 4. Vol. 7. No. 45. April 1854,              R

234       Mr. T. S. Hunt      on the Composition and Metamorphoses
Eastern Townships have shown that the serpentines of that
metamorphic region belong to Lower Silurian strata, of which
these rocks at St. Nicolas are the stratigraphical equivalent, it
was hoped that a chemical examination of them, and a compa
rison between the altered and unaltered shales, would throw
some light upon the nature of that widely-spread metamorphism,
and upon the origin of serpentine.    The results obtained were
different from what was expected, but are not, however, without
interest.
   In the immediate vicinity of the intrusive rock thin layers of
the shale are changed into a greenish translucent material, which
is sometimes an inch in thickness. The surfaces of the sand
stone in contact with the shale seem to have undergone a similar
change, or at least to be covered with a film of the green trans
lucent mineral, and they often exhibit a concretionary or mammil
lated surface.  In one instance the thickening of a stratum of
shale forms a mass several inches in diameter, which is earthy
and opake within, but upon the surface next to the overlying
rock assumes the serpentime-like character alluded to; and in a
continuation of the layer, where it becomes thinner, the trans
formation is complete.    In the interstratified sandstones, which
are sometimes conglomerate, masses of the same green mineral
are   found; and it was also observed filling fissures in fragments
of   bright red, and much indurated shale, which had fallen
      a
from a high part of the cliff.
   This green mineral is found by chemical analysis to be distinct
from serpentine, and is essentially a hydrous silicate of alumina,
protoxide of iron and potash, with small portions of soda, lime
and magnesia.     Its greater density serves also to distinguish it
from serpentine.     It occurs in schistose masses with a granular

236    Mr. T. S. Hunt          on the Composition and Metamorphoses
of iron from 3 to 4. These specimens also contained, besides
minute quantities of lime and magnesia, from 10:5 to 11.5 per
cent. of alkalies in which the soda varied from a trace to 3.6 per
cent.   Other specimens afforded 8 to 12 per cent. of lime, 7 to
8 of magnesia, and from 4 to 6 per cent. of potash, with traces
of soda; the proportions of silica, water, and oxide of iron being
the same*.
   According to Prof. Shepard, this material is often associated
with the deposits of specular iron ore in the crystalline limestones
and felspathic rocks, which in northern New York underlay the
Lower Silurian strata, and are by Dr. Emmons of the New York
Geological Survey, regarded, the limestones and iron included,
as hypogene rocks. The researches of Mr. Logan upon the ex
tension of these rocks into Canada, where they are very widely
spread, have, however, shown them to be undoubtedly altered
sedimentary deposits, leading us to infer in both cases a similar
origin for these hydrous alkaline silicates.
   The large amount of alkalies in the schists of St. Nicolas is
worthy of notice, because the small quantity remaining in kaolin
and some other clays seems to have given rise to an idea that
such sedimentary rocks are generally deficient in alkaline ingre
dients. Another red slate from the Etchmin river, belonging
to the same strata as the last, afforded the following analytical
results:—

   Although more siliceous, it resembles that of St. Nicolas in
the large proportion of alkalies and the predominance of potash.
A glance at the first analyses will show that that slate under
igneous action might produce a large amount of a potash felspar
like orthoclase, together with an alumino-ferruginous augite; it

   The post-pliocene clays of the St. Lawrence valley also con
tain a large proportion of alkalies; they are sometimes calcareous,
and afford, besides carbonates of these bases, a considerable
amount of lime and magnesia as silicates.      The following results
were obtained with a reddish-fawn coloured clay from the Rivière
à la Graisse, Rigaud; it is impalpable, and remains a long time
suspended in water.     It yields to heated hydrochlorie acid 1295
per cent. of alumina and peroxide of iron, 397 of lime and 192
of magnesia; the amount of carbonic acid evolved is a little more
than is required to form a carbonate with the lime thus obtained.

On the Power and CEconomy of Single-acting Eapansive Steam
  engines, being a Supplement to the Fourth Section of a Paper
  ‘On the Mechanical Action of Heatº.”
(34.)         objects of this supplementary paper are twofold:
        THEfirst, to compare the results of the formulae and
tables relative to the power of the steam-engine, which have been
deduced from the    dynamical theory of heat, with those of expe
riments on the actual duty of a large Cornish engine at various
rates of expansion; and secondly, to investigate and explain the
method of determining the rate of expansion, and, consequently,
the dimensions and proportions of a Cornish engine, which,
with a given maximum pressure of steam in the cylinder at a
given velocity, shall perform a given amount of work at the least
possible pecuniary cost, taking into account the expense of fuel,
and the interest of the capital required for the construction of
the engine.
   This problem is solved with the aid of the tables already
printed, by drawing two straight lines on a diagram annexed to
this paper (Plate III.).
   The merit of first proposing the question of the oeconomy of
expansive engines in this definite shape belongs,    believe, to the             I
Artizan Club, who have offered premiums for      solution; having        its
done     (to use their own words) “with

their studies and experience.”        The 5th     April      the latestof             is
day fixed      by
              them for   receiving  papers;  and    this communica          as

registered, Mr. Wicksteed gives a table showing the weight of
steam consumed per stroke for each of the five rates of expan
sion.    I shall now compute the weight of steam per stroke
theoretically, and compare the results.
   Throughout these calculations I shall uniformly use the foot
as the unit of length, the avoirdupois pound as that of weight,
and the hour as that of time. Pressures are consequently ex
pressed in pounds per square foot for the purpose of calculation;
although in the table of experiments       have reduced them to               I
pounds      square inch, as being the more familiar denomination.

       The heat transformed into power, as given in the fifth column,
    has been reduced to Centigrade degrees in liquid water, by                                          di
    viding the duty of a pound of steam by Mr. Joule’s equivalent,
    1389.6 feet per Centigrade degree.
       In these examples, founded on the calculated and observed
    duty of Mr. Wicksteed's engine during experiment F, the actual
    ratio is less than half the maximum.    This waste of heat is to
    be ascribed to the  following causes:—
       First. The expenditure of heat in raising the feed-water to
    the temperature of evaporation.
       Secondly. The initial pressure in the cylinder is but 1898 lbs.
    on the square inch, while that in the boiler is 45.7.
       Thirdly. The expansive working of the steam, instead of being
    continued down to 30° Centigrade, the temperature of the con
    denser, stops at a much higher temperature, 74°66. This is
    the most important cause of loss of power.

individual homogeneous colours we have a mathematically deter
minable standard, which is furnished most perfectly by the
duration of vibration corresponding to each colour; even in
ordinary speech, this difference has been very suitably distin
guished by the expression tint.             Thus, in a homogeneous
colour we can distinguish both                 intensity and      its

the continuous change of the duration of vibration determining
this tint; with this difference, that the impression of colour of
the extreme violet will continuously unite itself to that of the
extreme red.     In point of fact, the transition from violet to red
through purple is just as continuous to the eye as that between
any two other colours, although the limit has not yet been fixed
by observation at which the same impression of colour is repro
duced by a different duration of vibration.           will call the trans                      I

the negative transition.     According to this, any coloured light
 A  may  continuously   pass into another coloured light B in three
different ways; namely, by the colour continuously assuming                                                                    all

the indigo extends from the middle of the space between the lines
F and G almost to the line G, so that any indigo which lies
between these limits furnishes white with any yellow which lies
near the position above described.   Comparison with the New
tonian theory of compound colours is rendered difficult by the
fact, that the names of the colours as employed by various
observers have not always the same sense, of which one may be
very readily convinced by comparing the descriptions of the
colours lying between the lines of Fraunhofer given in different
handbooks and memoirs.      Newton exactly describes the position
of the limits between every two of his colours as they appeared
in the spectrum    of his prism; he also determined the mean
refractive and dispersive indices of his prism ; so that   the ele                          all
ments exist for determining the position                        of

mixture of red with the other colours, we shall always readily

when red predominates, passes over through orange into red;
and when green prevails, passes through yellowish-green               green.             to
In   the same manner, red, with         violet, indigo, and   sky-blue,  fur
nishes the intermediate tones              colour, which, according

                                                a
predominates, passes into rose-colour and carmine.               Thus, from

       MY DEAR FRIEND,                                        March 7, 1854.
                                                    I
                                         have ever succeeded in produ
You          question, “whether
         cing induction currents in other liquids than mercury or
melted metals, as, for instance, in acid or saline solutions?” has
led me to make a few experiments on the subject; for though                                           I
believed in the possibility of such currents,           had never obtained I
affirmative results:            I
                           have now    procured   them,    and send you a
description of the method pursued. A powerful electro-magnet
of the horse-shoe form was associated with a Grove’s battery of
twenty pairs of plates.       The poles of the magnet were upwards,
their flat end faces   being   in the same horizontal plane; they are
 3.5 inches square and above 6 inches apart.              A cylindrical bar
of soft iron, 8 inches long and 1:7 in diameter, was employed
as a keeper or submagnet: the cylindrical form was adopted,
first, because it best allowed of the formation of a fluid helix
around it; and next, because when placed on the poles of the
magnet, and the battery connexions made and broken, the mag
net and also the keeper rises and falls through much larger
variations of power, and far more rapidly than when a square or
flat-faced keeper is employed; for the latter, if massive, has, as
you know, the power of sustaining the magnetic conditions of
the magnet in a very great degree when the battery connexion
is broken. A fluid helix was formed round this keeper, having
 12 convolutions and a total length of 7 feet; the fluid was only
0.25 of an inch in diameter, the object being to obtain a certain
 amount of intensity in the current by making the inductive
                              parts   allthat great length, rather than

pied the interval          inches, and two lengths
                           of   6                                inches each

formed conductors between the fluid helix and the galvanometer:
the whole was attached to a wooden frame so as to protect the
helix from pressure or derangement when moved to and fro.
The quantity of fluid contained in the helix was about 3 cubic
inches in the length of 7 feet. The galvanometer was of copper
wire, ºth of an inch in diameter and 164 feet in length, occu
pying 310 convolutions; it was 18 feet from the magnet, and
connected with the helix by thick wires dipping into cups of
mercury.      It was in the same horizontal plane with the magnetic
poles, and very little affected by direct action from the latter.
   A solution formed by mixing onevolume of strong sulphuric acid
and three of water was introduced into the helix tube, the iron
keeper placed on the helix, and the whole adjusted on the magnetic
poles in such a position, that the ends of the copper connectors in
the tube were above the iron cylinder or keeper, and were advanced
so far over it as to reach the perpendicular plane passing through
its axis:      this position the lines

were crossed they again occurred, giving reverse actions at the
galvanometer.     Further proof that they were due to currents
induced in the fluid helix was obtained by arranging one turn of
a copper wire round the iron core or keeper in the same direction
as that of the fluid helix, and using one pair of plates to excite
the magnet; the induced current caused in the copper wire was
much stronger than that obtained with the fluid, but it was
always in the same direction.

introduced and allowed to remain in it a while, which being

   So consider the excitement of induction currents in liquids
not metallic as proved; and as far as can judge, they are pro  I
portionate in strength to the conducting power of the body in
which they are generated.    In the dilute sulphuric acid they
were of course stronger than they appeared by the deflection to
be, because they had first to overcome the contrary deflection
which the direct action of the magnet was able to produce; the
sum of the two deflections,    in fact, expressed the force of the
induced current. Whether the conduction by virtue of which
they occur is electrolytic in character or conduction proper I can
not say. The present phaenomena do not aid to settle that ques
tion, because the induced current may exist by either the one
or the other process.             I
                           believe that conduction proper exists,

    The Rev. W. Day of Hobart Town, in a journal kept by him
 at Upolu, one of the Navigators’ Islands, describes a hurricane
which occurred there on the 15th of December 1842. The wind
 set in from N.E., and got round to S.E. by S. This order of
 veering implies progression to the south of east. At 8 P.M. on
 the 16th of December, the hurricane reached H.M.S. Favourite
 in 21° S. 204° E., and lasted during the 17th and 18th. When
off Mangaia on the 17th, the Favourite lost sails, boats, and one
 man.   The wind shifted from N.E. to E.N.E. and to S. by W.,
so that the cyclone was now moving towards the south-east.     In
the Nautical Magazine, p. 425, volume for 1845, is given an
extract from the log of the Favourite; and Captain Stokes has
added many particu-                  Upolu.                Mangaia.

iscalled “the great hurricane”     Raratonga. On the 16th   at                                             of

270           Mr. T. Dobson     on the Storm-tracks   of
   In the log of the missionary brig ‘John
Williams,”    I find a notice of a hurricane
which veered from N. to W. and then to
S.W. in Jan. 1845, the vessel being thirty
miles E.N.E. of Raratonga. The motion is
still to the south-eastward.   (Track C.)
   In Wilkes's Narrative of the American
Exploring Expedition, vol. v. p. 19, is an
account of a violent hurricane at Upolu on the 16th of December,
1840, in which the wind shifted from N.E. to S.W., and the
motion wasconsequently
to the S.E. The storm
reached the Island of
Tutuilah, S.E. of Upolu,
on the next day (17th),
the wind changing from
N.W. to S.W. On the
1st   of December a   ty
phoon had raged near the Laughlin Islands in 9° S. and 154° E.,
but   Ipossess no account of the changes of wind. (Track D on
chart.)
   The Raratonga hurricane, described by Williams in his ‘Mis
sionary Enterprize,” which also devastated the Navigators’
Islands, was undoubtedly one of the class of which the track
has just been determined.    At Raratonga the wind veered from
eastward towards the west, and was therefore moving towards
the south.
   Lieut. Wilkes describes a hurricane at the Feejee Islands
which lasted from the 22nd to the 25th of
February 1840. It came on from N.E. and
veered to N. and then to N.W., gradually
hauling to the southward.  The motion was
therefore to the south-eastward.
   At midnight, on the 28th, the missionary
brig “Camden,’Captain Morgan, was in 31°S.
174° 7' E., sailing eastward.    During the
29th the hurricane passed over her, veering
from S.E. to S.W. The centre therefore lay
to the eastward of the ship, and was moving
towards the south.
   Lieut. Wilkes, at p. 381, vol.     ii.   of
                                             his
‘Narrative,’ has shown that the calm central
area  of  ahurricane passed across the Bay       of
Islands, New Zealand,      onthe 1st of  March, and that the cyclone
was moving    in  asouth-west direction.   This likewise confirmed

    It is obvious that the curvature of the storm-tracks of the
South Pacific Ocean is of the same kind as that of the east coast
of Australia; and the storm-tracks of the South Indian Ocean
have likewise the same kind of curvature as the west coast of
Australia.      This relation holds equally in the case of the West
Indian     cyclones,  and the coasts which they traverse.           These
observations     may  probably contain the germ of a law of pro
gressive motion of cyclones more general than that of their initial
westerly progression.

 tended for the purpose of illustrating the motion of cylindro
 conical projectiles, and of showing that the axis of a rotating body
 is fixed only under the condition that it is perfectly free, being,
 on the contrary, quite mobile when it is prevented from moving
 in one direction.
     I  have had this apparatus constructed in a modified form,
 which renders it more convenient for experiment, and at the
 same time alterations are introduced which render it possible to
 observe with this instrument the various remarkable phaenomena
 exhibited by rotating bodies more completely than has hitherto
 been attainable.
     The new construction is represented in figs. 1 and 2, Plate IV.
 AB and CD are two brass discs with thick edges, 3-8 inches in
 diameter, which having their axes ab and cd placed between points
 in the stirrups ab<U+017F>y and cdhk, are easily moveable. The stirrups
 are attached to the bar mn, which is held fast in the collar os by
 the screw e, and with this collar is free to move round the hori
 zontal axis qr between two points, q and r, attached to the forked
 piece pgr.      The forked piece is carried by the axis vu, which
 is pointed underneath. The entire apparatus, therefore, rests
 upon the point at w, and hence is free to move round a vertical,
 as also round a horizontal axis.
     In order to check the one or the other of these motions, the
 piece of brass pu is so attached at p to the forked piece pgr, that

sufficient to destroy the equilibrium, destroys it also when the
discs are in motion.   From this it follows, which might also be
inferred from other   grounds,  that the distance of the rotating
mass from the vertical axis has no effect, or at least a remarkably
small one, on the rotation of the apparatus.
   As it appears convenient to distinguish this apparatus by a
name, and inasmuch as it may be used for a great number of
experiments on rotation, I would propose for it the name of
polytropium or polytrope.

         DEAR SIR,                                                  March 18, 1854.
                                   by which, in your last lecture, the
THEexistence
      successful method
              of a space between          water in the spheroidal state
and the   containing    vessel was   proved  by the complete interrup
tion that space offered to the passage of a galvanic current, has
induced me to devise a few experiments on the subject.
     I
     have to describe in the present communication, in the first
place, some experiments                 I
                                 have just performed         the purpose  of for
of obtaining decisive evidence                    of

in the second place,            to
                            offer   few suggestions
                                              a              the probableas   to
causes       of
           the phaenomena under consideration.
  It   was found           by
                         Boutigny, that        into clean, red-hot pla
                                                         if         a

                                                    the acid and alkaline
liquids will roll about, repelling one another violently. This,
though        interesting example
              an                                     of
                                            the suspension       chemical           of
affinity, does not prove the existence            space between the pla
                                                          of  a
tinum vessel and the spheroids.
   The first experiment         have
                                  I       mention was this:—I took
                                                   to                                           a
copper basin, three inches          diameter and rather more than half
                                            in
 an inch deep, polished               its
                                concave surface, and covered        with                 it     a
thin film         of
                 silver          by
                             the galvanic process.      The plated basin
was now brought               very high temperature, and while thus
                             to
heated,    few drops
             a                slightly alkaline solution
                                ofa a                          sulphide        of               of
sodium were     poured   into           it.
                                    These   drops  instantly assumed the
spheroidal form and rolled about, making, however,                mark               no         or
track upon the silver. The source                        of
                                              heat was now withdrawn:
the temperature was soon        far reduced that the liquid exhibited

These experiments must of course be recommenced whenever
any union of the liquids employed has taken place.      The cork
spoken of above should have two perforations, one to admit the
funnel-tube, and the other to allow the escape of air.
   Is the employment of a volatile substance essential to the pro
duction of these phaenomena?       I imagined that this question
might be answered by the following experiment.     A dish of pla
tinum   might  be heated strongly, and a drop of melted lead then
placed upon it; now if the production of vapour from the sub
stances employed were essential to the formation of the sphe
roidal state, the lead should at once dissolve and perforate the
platinum;          if,
                 however, the spheroidal state occurs when two
non-volatile substances are employed, the platinum vessel should
not    be

282   On two new Theorems relating to the Moon's Orbit.

                                    - –4– 2P '
which proves Theorem        II.
  The third of the foregoing equations gives by a direct process
the known value of the motion of the apse to the first approxi
mation. The periodic time is found to be the same as that in
an elliptic orbit whose mean distance is a, the force tending to
                                2
the focus being      2(1-3.)         at the unit of distance, which is
otherwise known to be true.
  The numerical value of
                                    #     for the moon is 0.0529, and the
known eccentricity of her orbit is 0.0548. The difference 0-0019
is not more than might be expected from the degree of approxi
mation embraced by the analysis.      For Jupiter's four satellites
the values of
                wº are 0.00029,0.00058,0001168,              and 0.002724.
Respecting the eccentricities of their orbits, observation shows
that those of the first and second are too small to be sensible,
and that those of the third and fourth are only just sensible.
The eccentricities of the orbits of the other satellites of the solar
system are known with too little precision to admit of compa
rison with the theory, excepting that of Titan’s orbit, which is
stated to be 0.0293.    But in this instance the large inclination
of the orbit to the plane of Saturn's orbit forbids making a com
parison.
   The following considerations appear to me sufficient to prove
that the eccentricity of the moon’s orbit must be a function of
the disturbing force.     A straight line being drawn from the
earth’s centre in any direction in the plane of the moon’s orbit,
the radius-vector at the instants the moon passes this line in
successive revolutions has different values.      The fluctuations of
value, which, as is known, do not exist in the elliptic theory,
depend on the disturbing force in such a manner that the func
tion by which they are expressed would vanish if the disturbing
force were indefinitely small. The total fluctuations, in the case
of a uniform apsidal motion, are the same in           all
                                                       directions, and
take  place   about the same mean       distance;  and the difference
between the extreme values           of
                                     the radius-vector      any given
                                                              in
direction is equal     the difference
                      to                  the two apsidal distances,

and therefore proportional         the eccentricity.

     Inopposition to these views, it will perhaps be urged that a
satellite might be projected in such a manner that the eccentri
city of the orbit it begins to describe would be different from
that given by the above theorem.          But without mathematical
proof, which is altogether wanting, it cannot be asserted that
the orbit would retain that eccentricity under the influence of a
disturbing force, or that there would be a mean motion either
of the radius-vector or of the apse. If such were the case, there
would seem to be no reason for the failure of the method of inte
gration which was applied in the first instance to the equation (C).
In      all
        probability, the motion      the case supposed would notin
settle down        permanent state till the eccentricity
                          to   a                           the orbit                                     of
had reached the value which accords with the theorem.

     In addition to this, may say that in “waggon boilers,” a
 shape than which none can be more unsafe, but which is now for
 tunately much less in use than in former years, bulging bumps
 are very often observed, which are certainly due to the pressure
 of the steam in the boiler upon the iron plates of the bottom,
 when by extravagant      or incautious firing they have been made
 red-hot.    Frequently,   however, instead of bulgings or bumps
 being thus produced, a disruption of the boiler takes place,
 attended with more or less fatal consequences. . Many such
 accidents have thus happened at Manchester, and      -
                                                        particularly
on    Monday   mornings.
    The following occurrence, related to me by my friend Mr. A.
 M. Perkins as having taken place in his presence in a boiler of a
peculiar construction in which steam was generated by means of
his hot-water pipes, is also well worth mentioning, as think I
we may gather from it a correct explanation of the facts under
consideration; and the rough sketch below, which represents a
 cross section of the boiler, will perhaps explain the matter better
than    I could do by writing.
    The boiler had the dimen
sions indicated, and was 8
feet   in length; it was filled
with water     to about     A  as
                                  A
                                               --
usual, the safety-valve had an
area of 4 inches.     From such
a boiler the whole of the water
was     completely   driven off
through the valve by vio
lent priming; that is to say,
steam was generated so fast
by a hot water pipe in the                 ==
limb B, that it completely
lifted up the water and vio
lently squirted it out of the
boiler, as just related.       In
such a case, the water being
                                         i
heated by pipes, and not by
contact with the heated sur
faces of the boiler, no other
mischief could result than
that of priming:       but   sup
pose, on the contrary, such a
boiler to have been heated in

the usual manner; there is no doubt that the steam generated
in the limb B would, by lifting the superincumbent water,
have soon permitted that part of the boiler to become red-hot,
and thus have produced the curious phaenomenon revived and
studied by Boutigny d’Evreux, and named by him a fourth or
spheroidal condition of matter, but to which, so far as refers to
water, the late Jacob Perkins had, to my certain knowledge,
called the attention of engineers and of savants more than
twenty-five years ago (in fact, as far back as 1824).
   Allow me to relate also the curious experiment of a distin
guished civil engineer, Mr. Alexander Gordon, made several years
ago, as related to me by Mr. A. M. Perkins.
AB is a cylinder provided with four try-cocks, A
1, 2, 3, 4; water being introduced into the                   1
cylinder and heated therein, the cocks on being
successively turned gave the following results;
namely, steam issuing from 1, 2, 3, and water
from 4; but after urging the fire, the above
order was found to be completely reversed;
that is to say, cock No. 1 emitted water, and                 3
cocks Nos. 2, 3, 4 steam.
   These facts, in my humble judgement, ap-                  4.
pear to me to prove in a decided manner,
   1. That the heating of surfaces previous to            IB
the introduction of water is not necessary to
produce the spheroidal state.
   2. That many boiler explosions may be referable to that                                 con
dition.

  A   paper was read, entitled    “On     the Geometrical Representation
of the Expansive Action of Heat, and the Theory of Thermo-dynamic
Engines.” By W. J. Macquorn Rankine, F.R.S.S.L. & E. &c.
   The author remarks, that if abscissae be measured from an origin
of rectangular coordinates, representing the volumes assumed by an
elastic substance, and if ordinates, at right angles to those abscissae,
be taken to denote the corresponding expansive pressures exerted by
the substance, then any succession of changes of pressure and volume
may be represented geometrically by the coordinates of a curve. If
such a curve have two extremities, the area included between the curve
and the ordinates let fall from its extremities will represent (when
positive) the expansive power given out by the substance during the
process represented by the curve. Should the curve be closed, return
ing into itself, so as to denote a cycle of periodical changes of pressure
and volume, then will the area, enclosed within the curve, represent
(when positive) the expansive power given out during one cycle of
changes. This area is positive when increase of volume takes place
on the whole at greater pressures than diminution of volume. The
area of such a closed curve represents also (when positive) the me
chanical equivalent of the heat which permanently disappears, or is
converted into expansive power, during a cycle of changes, for were
it not so, the sum of energy in the universe would be changed,
which is impossible.
   As the principles of the expansive action of heat are capable of
being presented to the mind more clearly by the aid of diagrams of
 energy than by means of words and symbols alone, such diagrams
 are applied, in the present paper, partly to the illustration and de
 monstration of propositions previously proved by other means, but
 chiefly to the solution of new questions, especially those relating to
 the theory of thermo-dynamic engines.
    Throughout the whole of this paper, quantities of heat are ex
 pressed, not by units of temperature in an unit of weight of water,
 but by equivalent quantities of mechanical power, stated in foot
 pounds according to the ratio established by Mr. Joule's experiments
 on friction (Phil. Trans. 1850), that is to say, 772 foot-pounds per
 degree of Fahrenheit, or 1389-6 foot-pounds per Centigrade degree,
 applied to one pound of liquid water at atmospheric temperatures.
    A curve described on a diagram of energy, such that its ordinates
 represent the pressures of a homogeneous substance corresponding
 to various volumes of an unit of weight, while the total sensible or
 actual heat (Q) present in an unit of weight of the substance, is
 maintained at a constant value (QI), may be called the Isothermal
                                      -
 Curve of Q, for the given substance. Its equation is

heat,   its
          actual heat will diminish during the expansion, and              its
pressure will diminish more rapidly than     would  it        do

Curve of no Transmission of Heat.   For every such curve a certain
function of pressure, volume and actual heat, called a Thermo-dy
namic Function (F), has a constant value (FA) proper to the parti
cular curve under consideration; whose equation is therefore
                                                         F=F,.
   A curve whose coordinates represent the relation between pressure
and volume when the substance is absolutely destitute of heat, may
be called the Curve of Absolute Cold.    It is at once an isothermal
curve and a curve of no transmission, and is an asymptote to all the
other curves of both those kinds, which approach it indefinitely as
the substance expands without limit.                            -
   The whole theory of the expansive action of heat is comprehended
in the geometrical properties and mutual relations of those two
classes of curves; and                       all
                           those properties and relations are the con
sequences     and are virtually expressed

   The second section relates       the theory      the expansive action

heat proper to the isothermal curves, by the difference between the
two thermo-dynamic functions proper to the curves of no transmis
sion, being represented by an expression of this form,
                          (Q1-Q.). (F, -F.).
While the area of a figure bounded above by the isothermal curve
of Q, and laterally by the indefinitely-extended curves of no trans
mission corresponding to the thermo-dynamic functions FA, Fe, is
represented by                Q,(F,-FA).
   The area of a diagram of energy of any figure is calculated by
conceiving it to be divided, by a network of isothermal curves and
curves of no transmission, into an indefinite number of stripes or
quadrilaterals, finding the area of each and adding them by summa
tion or integration.    By the aid of these principles various problems
are solved.
   In the third section the same principles are applied to determine
the efficiency of thermo-dynamic engines worked by the expansion
and contraction of permanent gases without and with the aid of
economisers or regenerators.      The efficiency of a thermo-dynamic
engine is the proportion of the whole heat communicated to the
working substance which is converted into motive power.              -
   The maximum theoretical efficiency of a thermo-dynamic engine
working between the limits of actual heat Q, and Q, whether with
out a regenerator or with a perfect regenerator, is expressed by the
fraction                         Qi —Q,
                                    Qi
   A   theoretically perfect regenerator does not increase the maxi
mum efficiency between given limits of actual heat, but merely
enables that efficiency to be attained with a smaller extent of expan
sion, and consequently with a smaller engine.
   The fourth section treats of the relation between actual heat and
temperature, which must be known before the propositions of the
preceding sections can be applied to actual substances. Existing
experimental data are not yet adequate to the exact determination of
this relation; but it is considered they are sufficient to show that a
relation deduced by the author from the Hypothesis of Molecular
Vortices (see Philosophical Magazine for December 1851, p. 510), is
at least near enough to the truth for all purposes connected with the
computation of the efficiency of thermo-dynamic engines. This re
lation is expressed by the formula
                                Q=#(T+To),
where T is temperature, measured from the melting-point of ice;
To, the height of the melting-point of ice above the point of total
privation of heat; and #, the mechanical value of the real specific
heat of the substance. According to computations made in 1852
by the author from experiments by Messrs. Thomson and Joule,

     The fourth section concludes with a system of  formulae, illustrated
by numerical examples, for computing the power and efficiency of
air-engines.
   In the fifth section, the principles of the preceding sections are
applied to aggregates consisting of heterogeneous substances, or of
the same substance in different conditions, especially the aggregate
of a liquid and its vapour; and the results are applied to the nume
rical computation of the theoretical efficiency of steam-engines.

  A  far more complete and instructive apparatus was invented by
 Bohnenberger, and described       Gilbert's Annalen (vol.
                                                        in          60).                                lx.   p.            It

 is also explained in some German elementary works.        Attention has
been more recently drawn to the subject by a highly interesting
paper of Professor Magnus of Berlin (Verhandlungen der Königl.
Preuss. Akad. 1852, translated in Taylor's Foreign Scientific Me
moirs, N. S. part 3, p. 210), in which some remarkable applications
of this apparatus are given; he also describes it (with a figure), and
observes that the execution of it requires great delicacy and correct
ness of workmanship.        Copies of this instrument have indeed been
made in this country (one of which was exhibited through the kind
ness of Professor Wheatstone); but of these the author believes no
description has ever appeared in English works, and they are cer
tainly very little known, notwithstanding their manifest value to
every lecturer: the essential parts are a sphere capable of rotating
about an axis whose extremities rest in opposite points of a hoop
which can turn on pivots horizontally, within another hoop turning
on pivots about a vertical line.                  r
    In fact, the author of the present communication has long felt the
want of such an apparatus for lecture illustration; and before he
was aware of the existence of any of those just alluded to, had con
structed one in a different form, and which is found to answer fully
the purposes of illustration for which it is designed, without any nice
workmanship or complex machinery.           (See Astronomical Society's
Notices, vol. xiii. pp. 221–248.)
    Its object, like that of the instrument last mentioned, is to exhibit
experimentally the actual composition of rotations about two different
awes impressed      at once on the same body.
   The essential parts are merely a bar capable of rotating freely
about one end of an axis (and loaded at         extremities keep        its                          to         up
the rotation), while the axis itself can turn about  point   length                 a               in   its
 near the end carrying the bar, upon               horizontal axis, capable
                                                                  a                                             of

axis   is a weight which more than counterpoises the upper part.

case in rotatory motion; when a body is rotating about an aris, and
any cause tends to make it rotate about another aris, it will not rotate
about either, but about a new aris intermediate to the two.   Thus the
result of compounding the two rotations will be, that the axis (car
rying with it the rotating body) will simply take a new position, or will
move in a direction determined by the nature of the impressed motions.
   Professor Magnus, in the very able but rather prolix and obscurely
written memoir before referred to, speaks (p. 223) of the conse
quences of such a law as evinced in the resulting rotations, but
without any distinct or explicit statement of the essential theorem of
the composition of rotatory motion.      He gives, however, some sin

    Thus it would follow, that this extraordinary instance of savage
invention, which long ago puzzled inquirers, is simply a case (like
the last) of “the composition of rotatory motion.”
    It should, however, be mentioned, that some experimentalists have
entertained a different view of the cause of deviation in this instance.
    Besides the results above stated, Professor Magnus (in the same
memoir) mentions several other highly curious cases produced by
 certain modifications of the apparatus, but all referable to the same
 principles.
    M. Fessel has also invented an apparatus (since called the gyro
 scope), an account of which is given with some remarks by Professor
 Plücker, and the editor in Poggendorff’s Annalen (1853, Nos. 9 and
 10), which, though apparently invented without any knowledge of
 Bohnenberger's apparatus, is a modification of                   referring     it,phae              to
 nomena    of   the same kind             as

 mentioned at first.
    This apparatus has been greatly improved upon by Professor
 Wheatstone, who has introduced other movements                          include the      to
 conditions     ofrotation       different planes.

   These higher mathematical views, though of course the most
complete and systematic, are not the most direct or easy mode of
explaining the subject to the student.    Greater simplicity certainly
characterizes the method    adopted  by Mr. Airy" (in the tract before
cited) of applying directly the theorem of the composition of rotatory
motion, as doubtless Newton would have done had it been known to
him.    But here, as in so many other instances, the first explanation
presented itself mixed up with more complex considerations; and
as has been well observed, “simplicity is not always a fruit of the
 first growth.”

 physical astronomy, the “modus operandi’                     the  precession,    per  of

      ON    THE HEAT PRODUCED BY AN ELECTRIC DISCHARGE.
                           BY R. CLAUSIUS.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
IN    a paper by Prof. W. Thomson, in the March Number of the
     Philosophical Magazine, p. 193, the following statement occurs
on the discovery of the important law, that the heat capable of being
produced by an electric discharge is not simply proportional to the
quantity of electricity employed, but to the square of the same,
“as was first demonstrated by Joule in a communication to the
Royal Society in 1840, although it had been announced by Sir W.
Snow Harris as an experimental result, to be simply proportional to
the quantity.    Mr. Joule's result has been verified by independent
observers in France, Italy and Germany.”        I may be allowed to
observe on this subject, that the investigations of Riess, mentioned
by me in my paper on the mechanical equivalent of an electric dis
charge, are of a much older date. The memoir in which Riess
refuted the statement of Snow Harris, and proved to a certainty by
numerous experiments that the heat which is produced by the dis
charge of a Leyden battery in any part of the connecting wire is
                                   2

tin are formed when a rod of that metal is inserted in a solution of
protochloride of tin, and the latter carefully overlaid with water, was
first of   allfurther tested.       appeared that, for the production                          of

tin immersed       in the solution there was always more dissolved than
was made up         by  that which crystallized.                      In

ON   THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY THE PILE.               BY J. JAMIN.

                                                                 a             in                 he

   M. Foucault explains this phaenomenon           supposing that fluids             by
transmit   electricity   two  ways:   in  physical conductibility,   by
                                                                   which
is effected without decomposition; and by chemical conductibility,
which causes separation      a   their elements. M. Foucault collected
                                                      of
the gases      the same receiver, and did not endeavour

  The experiment is more striking when two voltameters, arranged
as in the first and second case, are placed in the same circuit. In
one case there were—

   If the two plates be put into one voltameter and the two wires
into the other, without any change in the other arrangements,
similar results will be obtained; the two plates produce but little
gas, whilst the two wires furnish a large quantity.         A voltameter
may be formed with a permanent Wollaston wire, and with a plate of
platinum or of some other metal which may be changed at pleasure;
each plate will disengage (the intensity of the current being the
same) very variable quantities of gas, whilst the wireproduces aconstant
action; there is consequently complete independence between the
two electrodes. These inequalities may be increased or diminished by
very different circumstances; they become very remarkable in employ
ing the platinum plates of a Grove's battery. The author thus formed
two dissymmetrical voltameters, which only produced a disengage
ment of gas at the wires, but none from the plates; the first furnished
nothing but hydrogen, the second only oxygen; by putting the two
plates in the first vessel and the two wires in the second, and passing
the current through them, the former allowed it to pass without de
composition, whilst the second produced a great disengagement of
gas. This, therefore, has nothing to do with conductibility, but
depends on a property peculiar to each electrode.
   As one only of the elements of water is obtained by a dis
symmetrical voltameter, it must be admitted that the one which is
not disengaged must combine with the liquid, or become condensed
on the plates. These two effects take place simultaneously.
   To show that oxygenated water is produced when hydrogen alone
is evolved,   all that  is necessary        carry  is the decomposition
                                                        to          on                              in

has found that the hydrogenated liquid produced               the evolution    by                    of
oxygen from water possesses new properties.
   The decomposition          water never takes place without

when the coloration has become very intense, the plates continue to
disengage gas for a long time after the passage of the current has
ceased.
   To resume, the author thinks that the decomposition of water is
not a simple phaenomenon,-that electricity first of       produces the                          all

hope    will   possess some interest, as they settle the chemical formula
of several substances on which the opinions of scientific men do not
agree.
   To establish the normal composition of the minerals formed in the
manner of sulphur, I suppose that wherever a certain proportion of
fluorine or chlorine is met with in these minerals, these bodies only
exist there still because the reaction which should have converted the
chlorides and fluorides into oxides has only been in perfectly effected.
But if we complete, by calculation, the substitution of oxygen for
the chlorine and fluorine, converting the whole into oxides, we arrive
at a simple formula.
   For the topaz, these suppositions, already sufficiently justified by
the discussion of the analyses of this mineral due to M. Forch
hammer, have just been confirmed by some unpublished researchs
of my brother and M. Fouqué.            The topaz would thus be as
similated to a silicate of    alumina, in which the oxygen of the base
would be in relation to that of the acid in the proportion of 4 to 3.
   When the mineral contains, together with fluorine, a body which,
like silicium, and especially boron, is capable of being sublimed with
it during calcination, we may, by taking the most probable hypo
thesis, restore to the mineral its primitive composition.          I find an
example of this in the tourmaline.      It is well known that mineralo
gists are far from being agreed as to the formula which should be
attributed to this substance. In his last supplement, M. Rammels
berg proposes three different formulae, which have scarcely anything
in common, to represent the different varieties of a mineralso homo
geneous in       its
                 crystalline form and    its properties.  in  have     space           I         no
here   to discuss the numerous analyses       tourmaline contained of    the                      in
same volume; but         we suppose that the loss
                                if                      calcination, which        by
varies from 18        3.8 per cent.,

fluoride     boron, and calculate from this datum and from the boron
            of

  less had not been previously exposed to a white heat, such as those
  mentioned in M. Dufrénoy's Traité de Minéralogie, although the
  oxygen of the protoxides always presents a slight deficiency, we
  obtain results very similar to the preceding”.             Certain groups of
  minerals, although belonging to the class of those which are formed
  in the manner of lavas, are nevertheless capable of containing in a
  state of mixture quantities, sometimes considerable, of minerals
  formed in the manner of sulphur.             It is thus that we may explain
  the  presence    of fluorine, boron,  titanium,   &c. in pyroxene, and espe
  cially in hornblende.
     The following is an immediate consequence of this remark. The
 efforts which have been made by mineralogists to reduce to a simple
 formula the analyses of hornblende, in which the alumina mayamount
  to 20-0, or be entirely wanting, are well known. The opinion gene
 rally adopted for want of a better is that of M. Bonsdorff, who, sup
 posing that alumina is isomorphous with silica, represents the mineral
 pretty well by a silicate of protoxides, in which the proportions of
 the oxygen in the acid and in the base would be 9:4, instead of
 8:4 as in pyroxene. But everything is explained and simplified if
 we suppose that the alumina is foreign to the normal composition of
 the mineral, and that it only exists there as an integral portion of a
 substance formed essentially in the manner of sulphur; a spinellide,
 that is to say, a body of the form R* O° RO, like the spinels of iron
or magnesia, protoxide of iron, &c., which are found mechanically
mixed with hornblende, and consequently never alter                   crystalline      its
form.
      Inapplying this hypothesis             great number
                                                     to   a     analyses taken of
 at random from       amongst   those contained       M.  Rammelsberg's
                                                                   in      work,
we    find,   after  previously   deducting   the intermixed   aluminate,    that
the oxygen             of
                    the silica     nearly equal
                                          is          double that  to  the prot            of
oxides.      The analyses which present             noticeable discrepancy are
                                                               a

                              to                   experienced is   determining     in
this base exactly.

   I think, therefore, that the chemical formula of hornblende is
exactly the same as that of pyroxene, and that we must consequently
return to an opinion formerly maintained by M. G. Rose, but which
he has since abandoned, attributing, I think, to the presence of the
sesquioxide an influence which it should not have upon the normal
constitution of the mineral.  The secondary dimorphism of pyroxene
and hornblende would also be sufficiently explained by the very pecu
liar gaseous medium in which the latter mineral appears to have
been formed, and the curious facts noticed by M. G. Rose in ura
lite would favour this explanation.—Comptes Rendus, February 27,

      HE    solution of an important electrical problem rendered it
       necessary   for me to seek the law of the formation of the elec
  tric residue in the Leyden jar. The sine-electrometer described in
  Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. lxxxviii. p. 497, was constructed for
  this purpose; and having, by means of it and the multiplier
- described in the present memoir, subjected the facts of the case
  to a more strict investigation (§ 1 to § 8), it soon appeared
  (§ 9) that the explanations of the phaenomenon hitherto given
  could lay little claim to accuracy.    Another cause for the pro
  duction of the residue was therefore sought (§ 10), and the con
 sequence was, that a numerical law was discovered (§ 11) which
 was applicable to practical purposes (§ 12).
    The new hypothesis ought, indeed, to be subjected to strict
 criticism, for such hypotheses, on account of their wide appli
 cability, have something attractive in them, and are therefore to                          .
 be received with due caution.

                                          however, the explanation
                of 10
 given in  §     should              be
                            rejected, still the facts cited, and the
 correctness    the calculations, will not     questioned.        be

306             M. R. Kohlrausch's Theory of the
must be due to   a cause       different from the mere loss of the elec
tricity in the surrounding air.
    For the decision of this question, it is in the first place neces
sary to determine accurately the curve according to which the
tension diminishes, more especially as this curve is to form the
basis of conjectures regarding the existence of causes different
from those hitherto assigned.      Hence our first step is to make
the observations   necessary for the construction of such a curve.
   If  the observations are to be made with purity, care must be
taken that the charging of the jar is of momentary duration, and
not gradual, so that no uncertainty shall exist as to what occurs
during the gradual augmentation of the electricity; an electro
meter is also necessary, by means of which the tension may be
observed from the moment of charging onwards.            The first con
dition is secured     by connecting  a  jar  with another,   or with a
battery of jars, already charged; and the second is secured by
the use of the sine-electrometer, applying the method described
in vol. lxxxviii. p. 508 8. of Poggendorff’s Annalen.
    In order to interrupt the pursuit of the real question as little
as possible, I have deferred to Appendix I, the full description
of the mode of observation for such a curve, and moreover for
the one marked a in the table which follows, and state here the
results merely; these were obtained with three different kinds
of apparatus, a, b, c,
   a. An ordinary Leyden jar with tinfoil coatings of about five
sixths of a square foot, ºd in the form of a sugar-glass.
   b. A thick bottle with a narrow, short neck, usually applied
to the holding of reagents.      The neck was heated, and coated
within and without with    sealing-wax;   the bottle was then filled
up to the sealing-wax with mercury, and was surrounded outside
by a layer of the same metal,               l
                                    inch thick. To prevent the
vessel from  floating, it was held fast by means of screws in a
cylindrical wooden trough.
   c. A thick rectangular piece of a looking-glass had       metallic       its
coating removed for       inches from the
                           2                 edge,  and was coated
on  the other side with tinfoil; the glass rim                 on
                                                      both sides was
coated with  sealing-wax.    During   the experiments  the plate was
laid with the tinfoil   upon    sheet
                                   a            of
                                           metal, and     the other    to
side, which was connected with the electrometer, electricity was

   The series of observations contained under b is represented
graphically in fig. 2, Plate VI., by the line Lt. The curves of the
two other series of observations are not drawn.
   On the whole these curves present a similarity to parabolas,
but they satisfy a constant parameter for a short distance only.
It is seen, however, at first sight that they cannot be due to the
mere loss of electricity in the air, as they are much too curved
to be accounted for in this manner.            Adhering to the results

and that the hypothesis proposed by Sir Charles                                                     Lyell is the
true one for the funnel-shaped depressions, while                                                   there is also
no doubt that the surface of the chalk has in some                                                   places been
eroded as described by Mr. Trimmer.
   The cavities immediately below the superficial                                                   soil on the
eastern side of England might, I think, be classed                                                  under three
distinct heads, as they are not only the presumed                                                   productions
of different agents, but also the result of actions very dissimilar
in their operations.   The first are the well-known “puits natu
rels,” which from their peculiar forms may for mere distinction
be called funnel pipes; the second may be termed gully pipes;
these, however, are not, strictly speaking, pipes at all, as they
all terminate      closed point; and the third more correctly
                       in    a
chimney pipes.
   The first       or
                   funnel pipes are more         less       angular form,
                                                                        or            of    an

full extent, they invariably terminate              point. These are notin   a

the Coralline Crag at Sudbourn and Gedgrave near Orford.                                                        323
where it has been denuded, is a deposit composed almost entirely
of shells and their débris; while in the upper portion shells are
rarely to be obtained, and only in the valleys corresponding
with the present watersheds can this lower stratum be seen.
The upper or coralline portion has here become somewhat indu
rated, and on some occasions has been employed as a building
stone, the tower of Chillesford Church having been constructed
                                                                     -
principally of that material.
   These chimney pipes appear to have perforated the entire
thickness of the coralline crag deposit, at least it is so presumed,
although         I
             was unable to trace them to a greater depth than
12 or 14 feet from the surface, or immediately beneath the gravel
to where they are lost in the talus at the bottom of the pit;
but the crag at these localities has not probably more than
20 feet of thickness, as the water stands in the pit at that
depth, indicating the presence of the clay beneath.
   The most perfect of these tubes now remaining is one that
presents rather more than a semicylindrical shape, but is emptied

probable that the tanning process, which might cause the silver
solution        to    be
                  more readily acted upon when applied              the                                     to

     Inyour own history                   of
                                the photographic process, you say
“the discovery              of
                     the extraordinary property         the gallic acid             of
in increasing the sensibility     the iodide      of
                                                 silver was the most      of
valuable        of
              the numerous contributions which Mr. Talbot has

                                     Eageriments             in Photography.                                  327
made to the photographic art.”       It is nevertheless true, as stated
by Sir David Brewster, that “the first public use of the infusion
of nut-galls, which is an essential element in Mr.Talbot's patented
process, is due to Mr. Reade,” and in my letter to Mr. Brayley                                                     I
attribute the sensitiveness of my process to the formation of a gal
late or tannate of silver. Ineed scarcely say, that among various
experiments I tried gallic and tannic acid in their pure state, both
separately and mixed; but the colour of the pictures thus ob
tained with the solar microscope was at that time less pleasing
to my eye, than the rich warm tone which the same acids pro
duced when in their natural connexion with solutions of vege
table matter in the gall-nut. This organic combination, however,
was more effective with the solar microscope than with the camera,
though the lenses of my camera were five inches in diameter.      It
is probable enough that the richer tone was due to the greater
energy of direct solar rays.     In using the solar microscope,                                                    I
employed a combination of lenses which produced a convergence
of the luminous and photogenic rays, together with a dispersion
of the calorific rays, and the consequent absence of       sensible                              all
                        use Ross's cemented powers, and

328                            The Rev.       J.     B. Reade on           some early
º,      I
     employed hyposulphite of soda as a fixer.    Mr. Hodgson, an
able practical chemist at  Apothecaries'   Hall, assisted me in the
preparation of this salt, which at that time was probably not to
be found, as an article of sale, in any chemist’s shop in London.
Sir John Herschel had previously announced the peculiar aetion
of this preparation of soda on salts of silver, but believe that                            I                     I
was the first to use it in the processes of photography.”      also                                         I
 used iodide of potassium, as appears from my letter, as a fixer,
 and I employed it as well to form iodide of lead on glazedicards
 as an accelerator. Iodide of lead has of itself, as I form                   con                          it,

refrangible than the violet rays, and cognisable by their chemical
effects, was first ascertained by Mr. Ritter; but Dr. Wollaston
made the same experiments a very short time afterwards, without
having been informed what had been done on the Continent.
These rays appear to extend beyond the violet rays of the pris
matic spectrum, through a space nearly equal to that which is
occupied by the violet. In order to complete the comparison of
their properties with those of visible light,       was desirous of    I
examining the effect of their reflexion from a thin plate of air
capable of producing the well-known rings of colours.        For this
          I
purpose formed an image of the rings, by means of the solar
microscope, with the apparatus which                         I
                                             have described in the
Journals of the Royal Institution, and                       I
                                              threw this image on
paper dipped in a solution of nitrate of silver, placed at a distance
of about nine inches from the microscope.     In the course of an
hour, portions of three dark rings were very distinctly visible,
much smaller than the brightest rings of the coloured image,
and coinciding very nearly in their dimensions with the rings of
violet light that appeared upon the interposition of violet glass.
I thought the dark rings were a little smaller than the violet
rings, but the difference was not sufficiently great to be accu
rately ascertained; it might be as much as ºth or ºth of the
diameters, but not greater.       It is the less surprising that the
difference should be so small, as the dimensions of the coloured
rings do not by any means vary at the violet end of the spectrum
so rapidly as at the red end.       For performing this experiment
with   very  great accuracy  a heliostate would be necessary, since
the motion of the sun causes a slight change in the place of the
image, and leather impregnated with the muriate of silver would
indicate the effect with greater delicacy.     The experiment, how
ever, in      its
              present state    sufficient
                                       is    complete  the analogy

the invisible with the visible rays, and          show that they are
                                                                 to

decessor, he was a pioneer in the philosophy of light; and, as
we have seen, by a single photographic experiment, overlooked
hitherto by us all, has shown a perfect analogy between the un
dulations of the visible and invisible rays.  Had he happened
to head his chapter, as Wedgwood does, “On a method of taking
Pictures by the agency of Light on Nitrate of Silver,” his name
and place would have been duly marked; but because theory,
and not experiment, was the great point before him, the philo
sophical photographer is overlooked by the practical one.
    Dr. Young's propositions are, that radiant light consists in
undulations of the luminiferous aether, that light differs from
heat only in the frequency of                      its
                                     undulations, that undulations
less  frequent than those    light produce
                                         of  heat, and that undula
tions more frequent than those        light produce chemical and
photographic action,-all proved         experiments.   byof    -

   Dr.  Young’s   hypothesis   seems       anticipate   your questions,

                answer them       their order.in  He says, “All mate
rial bodies have     attraction for the otherial medium,_by means
                        an
of which     it   accumulated within their substance,—and for

siders material bodies        have within them latent light, latent

opinion, particular condition

luminous, calorific, and chemical phaenomena are exhibited under
two modifications,—the vibratory                         or
                                          permanent, and the undula
tory  or transient state; and that the forces which produce these
several effects differ from each other only           the frequency          in                           of
their undulations or vibrations.
    Such are the conclusions        which the all-inquiring Dr. Young
                                              at

is  that we are still but half acquainted with the results          his                          of

But Sir John Herschel has shown that, by certain artifices, even
the extreme rays may be rendered visible ; and Dr. Young, by
an experiment most ingenious, and to his own mind, at least,
most conclusive, has demonstrated the analogy of the invisible

IN forthe1851–52,

                   we have mentioned the existence of small
masses containing phosphate      of lime, and having the characters
of coprolites, which occur in several parts of the Lower Silurian
rocks. In a bed of siliceous conglomerate towards the top of
the calciferous sandstone, at the Lac des Allumettes, on the
Ottawa, they are abundant in cylindrical and imitative shapes,
sometimes an inch in diameter.        The same material forms casts
of the interior of a    species  of  Holopea  or Pleurotomaria, and
often fills or completely encases the separated valves of a large
species of Lingula, which Salter has referred to L. parallela of
Phillips. The phosphatic matter is porous, friable, and of a
chocolate-brown colour; it contains intermixed a large quantity
of sand, and small pebbles of quartz are sometimes partly im
bedded in        The analysis           of
                                  one specimen gave      per cent,            36                   of

of animal matter: the same thing was observed with those from
Grenville.
   The existence in Lower Silurian rocks, of these masses, whose
characters leave no doubt that they are coprolites, and whose
chemical composition is like that of the excrements of creatures
feeding upon vertebrate animals, led us to examine the shells of
the Lingula always associated with these phosphatic bodies. The
result has been that                    all
                             the specimens yet examined consist
chiefly     of
           phosphate      lime;  they dissolve readily with slight
                                    of
effervescence     hydrochloric acid, and the solution gives with
                      in
ammonia      copious
                 a   precipitate readily soluble  acetic acid, from         in
which oxalic acid throws down lime. With solution         molyb         a                  of

the shell.

    The texture of these tubes is compact, their colour brownish

    The microscopic examination of a section shows that the walls
of the tube are homogeneous, unlike the coprolites, and that the
siliceous sand in the analysis came from the sandstone which
incrusted the rough interior of the fossil. The phosphate is
finely granular, and retains no vestige of organic structure. The
chemical composition and the remarkable shape of the specimens,
 however, leave little doubt of their osseous nature, unless we
 suppose them to be the remains of some hitherto unknown                  in
 vertebrate animal, whose skeleton, like those of Lingula, Orbicula
 and Conularia, consisted of phosphate of lime, a composition
 hitherto supposed to be peculiar to vertebrate skeletons.

 ting to the Porism of the in-and-circumscribed Polygon” (Phil.
 Mag. Nov. 1853). The two theorems are as follows.
     Theorem. The condition that there may be inscribed in the

 W=0, depends upon the development in ascending powers of É
 of the square root of the discriminant of #U+V; viz. if this

     Theorem. In the case where the conics are replaced by the
 two circles a”--y”—Rº-0, (c.—a)*-i-y”—rº=0, then the discri
 minant, the square root of which gives the series
                   A+B£4-Cé"      +  Déº-FEg*--&c.,
 is
                 —(1+8){r^+ £("4-Rº–d?) +8°R*}.
 Write for   a moment
    A+Bé--C#94-D8+E£4+&c. = V (I-Faà)(1+ba)(I-Fec),

         –25°c?–26*a*–2a4b*
             &c.
To adapt these to the    case  of the two circles, we have to write
  r”(1+aë)(1+be)(1+ct)=(1+8){r}+              £(r^+  R*—a”)+*R*}.
and therefore

                      –64R*a*, 6.
    Hence the condition that there may be inscribed in the circle
a”-- y”—Rº-0, and circumscribed about the circle (w-a)*-i-y”
 —r°=0, an infinity of n-gons is for n=3, 4, 5 respectively,
i. e. in the case of a triangle, a quadrangle and a pentagon, is as
follows.
   I. For the triangle, the relation is
                            (R*—a”)?–4Rºrº–0,
which is the completely rationalized form (the simple power of a
radius being of course analytically a radical) of the well-known
equation
                                  a?= R°–2Rr,
which expresses the relation between the radii R, r of the cir
cumscribed and inscribed circles, and the distance a between
their centres.
  II. For the quadrangle, the relation is
                      (R*—a”)?–2r”(R*--a”)=0,
which may also be written
         (R+ r +a)(R+r—a)(R—r--a)(R—r—a)—r"=0.
(Steiner, Crelle, vol.     ii.
                          289.)  p.
  III.  For the pentagon, the relation          is
    (R2–03)6–12R (R*—aº)"r” +16R*(R*4-2a.”)(R*—a”)"r"
                –64R*a*,6=0,
which may also       be   written
  (R*—aº)2(R*—aº)?–4Rºrº              2–4R*{(R*—a”)?–4a”-0.
The equation may therefore            be   considered    as   the completely
rationalized form of
   (R2–d?)3+2R(R*—a”)*r–4R*(R*—a”)r°–8Ra**=0.
   This   is,  fact, the form given
                in                     Fuss  by  his memoir “De

     It  is worth noticing, that, in the case of two conics having a
4-point contact, we have F-0, and consequently M-1. The
 discriminant is therefore (1+%)°, and as this does not contain
 any variable parameter, the conics cannot be determined so that
 there may be for a given value of n (nor, indeed, for any value
whatever of n) an infinity of n-gons inscribed in the one conic,
 and circumscribed about the other conic.
     The geometrical properties of a triangle, &c. inscribed in a
 conic and circumscribed about another conic, these two conics
 having double contact with each other, are at once obtained from
 those of the system in which the two conics are replaced by con
 centric circles.     Thus, in the case of a triangle, if ABC be the
  triangle, and 25 y be the points of contact of the sides with the

 344                   Mr. A.   Cayley on the Porism     of
 inscribed conic, then the tangents to the circumscribed conic at
 ABC meet the opposite sides BC, CA, AB in points lying in the
 chord of contact, the lines A2, B3, Cy meet in the pole of con
 tact, and so on.
    In the case of a quadrangle, if ACEG be the quadrangle, and
 b, d, f, h the points of contact with the inscribed conic, then
the tangents to the circumscribed conic at the pair of opposite
angles   A, E and the corresponding diagonal CG, and in like
manner the tangents at the pair of opposite angles C, G and the
corresponding diagonal AE, meet in the chord of contact.             Again,
the pairs of opposite sides AC, EG, and the line dh joining the
points of contact of the other two sides with the inscribed conic,
and the pairs of opposite sides AG, CE, and the line bfjoining
the pairs of contact of the other two sides with the inscribed
conic, meet in the chord of contact.            The diagonals AE, CG,
and the lines      bf,   dh
                          through  the   points    of contact      pairs
                                                                    of          of
opposite sides with the inscribed conic, meet            inthe pole     con

the points F and G pass two and two through the points of con

through the foci in the case of the two concentric circles) ima

       GENTLEMEN,                                       April 19, 1854.
IT     has been  pointed  out  by M.   Clausius,  in a letter addressed
       to you and published in the last Number of your Magazine,
that the first discovery of the true relation between the genera
tion of heat in the discharge of a Leyden phial and the quantity
of the previous charge is not, as I had stated it to be, due to
Joule, but that it had been given in a paper published about
three years earlier by Riess.                            I
                                     may be allowed to explain, that,
in making the statement in question, considered the law of that            I
relation as an evident corollary from the great principle, that
the whole heat generated in any discharge of electricity is exactly
the equivalent in thermal energy for the mechanical value of the
electrical charge which is lost.*.      There is no doubt who is the
discoverer of    this, and the   originator,  in your most valuable
Magazine, of the theory of mechanical equivalence among the
electric, chemical, magnetic, frictional, and pneumatic develop
ments of energy, which has within the last two or three years
attracted so many investigators.
    The mere law, that the heat generated by the discharge of a
Leyden phial or battery is proportional to the square of the quan
tity of electricity in the previous charge, is not, as inadvertently                              I
 stated, due to Joule; neither is           M. Clausius seems sup

 pose, due     Riess. Becquerel,

convenient opportunity provided it be within the week.     Pre
vious to development, the plate should be allowed to remain for
a few seconds in the original 30-grain silver-bath, then removed
and developed  with either pyrogallic acid or a protosalt of iron,
and afterwards fixed, &c. in the usual manner.
   The advantages of this process can scarcely be overrated.
Besides the facility it affords of working in the open air without
any cumbrous apparatus, photography may now be applied in
cases where it would have been hitherto impracticable, owing to
the feebleness of the light, e. g. badly illuminated interiors,
natural caverns, &c.; if necessary, the exposure could be pro
tracted for a week, or possibly much longer, and the deficiency
of daylight compensated for by the employment of the electric or
other artificial light.    It will also be found useful where the plate
must be kept ready excited, but the exact moment of exposure
may depend upon possible contingencies rather than on the will
of the operator, or in cases where it would be impracticable to
prepare the plate just before exposure; for these reasons it might
prove a valuable adjunct on the eve of a naval or military engage
ment, for accurately recording the positions of the forces.
    A small proportion of nitrate of zinc added to the ordinary
nitrate of silver bath in no way interferes with             action, and        its
 might obviate the inconvenience          sometimes felt during hot
weather   in  photographic rooms,          the film becoming partially

LVI.     Additional Directions and Improvements in the Process for
     the Manufacture of Artificial Tourmalines.     By WILLIAM
     BIRD HERAPATH, Esq., M.D. Lond.*
     N the last November Number of this Journal the author gave
      a formula for the production of these crystals of large size,
so as to be available for optical purposes.
   That formula succeeds very well when the temperature of the
atmosphere in the apartment is 65°, and likely to be maintained
at this point for three or four hours, falling gradually to 45°
Fahr. in the course of the night.     Under these circumstances
it is rarely the case that some large plates are not discovered in
the morning.      These should be at once secured or they will
re-dissolve or sink, and thus be lost.
   When the temperature does not fall below 50° or 55°Fahr.
a different formula is necessary.      Less spirit must then be
employed, in order to render the compound less soluble in the
menstruum.
   Formula No. 2 may now be used most successfully.

the plate carrying the crystal (this being downwards) upon the
oil, elaine, &c., press together slightly, and then if too much
medium has not been used, the plates are just kept apart by the
interposed fluid.      The edges are then surrounded or painted
with a solution of    gum-arabic,    slightly toughened by the addition
of a little  isinglass or  gelatine.    This is a very rapid mode of
mounting, but not certain or safe; sometimes the edging of gum
cracks, air is admitted, the definition of the plate is lost, and                                          its
brilliancy for the polariscope much damaged.             Oil and elaine

Encyclopaediat, the construction of barometrical, thermometrical,
and hygrometrical pendulums          registering the indications  for                                                   of
such instruments.           was prevented    As I  more interesting                       by

  The facts arrived    are,         at
   1st. The shells of Helicidae increase but little for   considerable                               a
period, never arriving     maturity before the animal has once become

dormant.

    4th. Most species bury themselves in the ground to increase the
 dimensions of their shells.
                  First Experiment with Helix pomatia.
    A  specimen of this species having deposited thirteen eggs which
 were hatched during the first week of August 1852, six of the
 young ones were deposited in a box (having a lace cover) placed
 in the shade.    The young Helices were regularly fed every other
 day until the beginning of December, when they buried themselves
 in the soil for winter; up to this period they had gradually increased
 in dimensions to the size of Helia hispida. From December until
 April the soil was kept dry, the box being placed in the cellar. On
 the 1st of April they were replaced in the garden, the soil having
 previously been copiously watered.      On the 3rd of April the young
 ones appeared on the surface, being no larger in size than they were
 in December, and although regularly fed up to the 20th of June
 they scarcely increased, not being perceptibly larger in size than
 they were in December.       However, on the 20th of June five of
 them disappeared, having buried themselves (with the mouth of the
 shell downwards) in the soil; on the 30th of June they reappeared,
 having in ten days grown so rapidly as at this time to become equal
in size to Helia pisana. They again buried themselves on the 15th
 of July and reappeared on the 1st of August, having again          in
 creased in size. From this date they did not apparently become any
larger, and on the 2nd of November food was withheld for the
 winter, and at the present time (February 14th) they are in a dor
 mant state.    Probably they will arrive at maturity by July or August
next.    The sixth specimen did not bury itself until the 15th of
August.
                 Second Experiment with Helix aspersa.
    A pair of Helic aspersa having been procured in the act of copu
lation on the 19th of May 1852, they were placed in confinement.
Each individual deposited about 70 eggs, which began to hatch on
the 20th of June : these young ones grew but little during the
summer.      They buried themselves in the soil on the 10th of October,
coming again to the surface on the 5th of April, not having grown
during the winter.    In May they buried themselves (with their heads
downwards as with Helia pomatia, in winter they and other species
buried themselves with the head upwards), appearing again in a
week double the size; this process was carried on at about fortnightly
intervals until July the 18th, when they were almost fully grown.
It is worthy of remark that this species, as well as Helia pomatia
and Helia nemoralis, and probably other of the Helicae, form an oper
culum at the aperture, after which they retire considerably within
the shell, and form a second (much thinner), behind which they
rest during the winter.
   It would be swelling this paper too much to describe all the obser
vations in full; it will perhaps therefore be considered sufficient to
remark that the process of growth within the ground takes place

labours of Messrs. Laurent and Gerhardt greatly contributed to the

     We have hitherto been accustomed to resort very freely to ima
ginary distinctions of form and arrangement of matter to explain the
 differences of properties; but of late years an opposite tendency has
 arisen, and chemists have felt the necessity of reducing their language
 and ideas to simpler and more consistent forms. This necessity was
 first felt in the most complex, i. e. the so-called organic part of che
 mistry.     But the simplifications thus introduced have proved to be
 equally applicable to the inorganic part of the science; and their
 introduction is calculated to disengage, for the consideration of sub
 stantial differences of composition, the attention which has hitherto
 been absorbed by imaginary distinctions of form.           Being unable to
 express the constitution of compounds without some formal artifice,
 we shall be able to see and compare their substantial differences
 most easily when all unnecessary variations of those formal artifices
  are eliminated.    The success of this operation of course depends on
  our  finding  one form sufficiently general to replace the special and
  limited forms now employed.
     In some papers published in the Journal of the Chemical Society
  two or three years ago, I endeavoured to show that the constitution
  of salts may be reduced to the type of water; that acids and bases
  being, truly, acid salts and basic salts, are perfectly conformable to
  the same principle ; and that, amongst other things, the difference
  between monobasic and bibasic acids, &c. admits of a simple and easy
  explanation by       The leading propositions

  The very large apertures assigned    the more recent microscopicto
object-glasses drew the author's attention some time since                                          to   the   im
portance     testing the accuracy
              of                      the method employedof                                          to    deter
mine their amount.

   With this object in view       he began with the consideration that
 the central  pencil   was alone to be regarded, and that the marginal
 rays of this were the true limits of the angle of aperture, and that
 consequently the rays of all oblique pencils were to be excluded, as
 these might cross at a point not coincident with the principal focus,
 and being measured separately might form an angle (apparently of
 aperture) not coinciding of course with the true one, although per
 haps not differing from it in amount.            A short description of the
 usual method of measuring these angles will suffice to show what
 claim it has to confidence in these respects.
    The microscope, with the object-glass to be examined and an or
 dinary eye-piece, is used as a telescope, and a light placed at some
 distance is commonly made an object to define the limit of the field
 of view, the image of which is formed near the back surface of the
posterior combination, and the diffused light of this image, as seen
 through the eye-piece, is the indication that a pencil of light is ad
 mitted, whether central or oblique.          Sometimes by an additional
 glass the eye-piece is made an erecting one capable of bringing the
 image into focus. This adds much to the convenience, but not to
the correctness of the method. Thus the conditions of the micro
scopic object-glass are reversed, the principal focus being transferred
from the front to the back, and the rays estimated are those of the ex
treme oblique pencils, which may or may not pass through the point
of the principal focus of the glass when used for the microscope.
    The importance of this in the illumination of objects immediately
suggested itself; and the author obtained a further proof by another
experiment bearing directly upon this point.           A blackened wire was
placed under a microscope at the focal point, with an object-glass
of considerable power and aperture, the wire covering the field with
the eye-piece used. The field was then illuminated with an achro
matic condenser, the field of illumination exceeding, as it usually
does, that of the microscope.         As was expected, the oblique rays
which   passed  on both sides of the wire prevented            blackness from   its
being seen (this becoming           milky-grey), until the field
                                       of  a                              illumi                of
nation was reduced          to

   March 31, 1854.—On Chemical Affinity among Substances in
Solution. By John Hall Gladstone, Esq., Ph.D., F.R.S.
   An historical sketch of the development of the ideas of chemists
concerning “affinity” was first given.   The dogma of Hippocrates
that “like combines   only with like,” was shown to be superseded
by the view of Glauber and others, that unlike substances combine
most readily; and that where two bodies have an affinity for one
another,     it is a sign that they have                     no affinity      with one another.
The views of Newton and Boyle in reference to the different degrees
of strength of affinity were then considered, and particular attention
was directed to the doctrine of Bergmann, that when a decompo
sition takes place by means of the greater elective attraction of a
third body, that decomposition is complete. In opposition to this,
Berthollet contended that in     such cases  all
                                               composition         of
                                                               decom                         or
position there takes place         partition
                                       a          the base,of      subject        or
                                                                                the                of
combination, between the two bodies whose actions are opposed                                           ;
and that the proportions          this partition are determined, not solely
                                       of
by                       energy
                        of            the affinities, but also                          by

                   of                                being generated. These

                                                                              their               of
promulgation; and the attention              chemists had been drawn away

from the subject until within these last few years, when Malaguti,
Bunsen, Debus, and Williamson have published investigations bear
ing upon the point. The lecturer then stated, that before any                                           of
these papers had appeared,            had been thinking
                                            he                   and performing
                                                                              of
some experiments upon the subject              question, and that
                                                        in                was still          he
continuing them.
   After few experiments illustrative

and   of  “elective affinity,” others were introduced                  show how        to
easily this latter phaenomenon was affected by circumstances. Thus
ammonia will displace alumina from               solution

                                                                             of
 on the other   hand,  alumina will     displace  ammonia when heated with

             of

baryta, but        by
                  boiling with excess         sulphateof    potash,      of
                                                                        had been            it
converted into the     sulphate;     the other had been sulphate            baryta,          of

                                                                               had                it
suffered the opposite change into the carbonate. The lecturer then
stated that      great
                  so       the influence exerted
                             is                                         by
                                                          these various circum
stances, that some have doubted whether there be                  true “elective  a
affinity;”        he
                 however believed that after making every allowance for
known causes there         still
                             is      residuary phaenomenon

name    is  the most appropriate.          Allowing then, with Bergmann,
that relative degrees            affinity exist, the question arises:–
                                  of                                                                   at

other influences.          Several reactions, however, were mentioned
as tending to show that there is some truth in the law :—for
instance, the solution of gold in hydrochloric acid upon the addition
of nitrate of potash. The experiments of Bunsen on mixtures of
carbonic oxide and hydrogen, exploded with a quantity of oxygen
insufficient for complete combustion; and those of Debus on the
precipitation of mixed hydrates of lime and baryta by carbonic acid
were explained; as also the remarkable fact noticed by both, that
the resulting products were always in certain atomic proportions to
one another.          But in both these cases the first products of the
chemical action are removed at once from the field: it is quite
another case when they remain free to act and react on one another.
Supposing they            remain  all  solution, the requisite

diminution of the colour greater than the mere dilution would have
produced, as was exemplified in the cases of the red sulphocyanide
of iron mixed with sulphate of potash, and of the scarlet bromide
of gold mixed with chloride of potassium.                   The lecturer accord
ingly drew the conclusion that when two salts mix without preci
pitation or volatilization, the acids and bases frequently, if not uni
versally, arrange themselves according to some definite proportion;
and that this depends on the relative quantity of the two salts, as
well as upon the proper affinities of the substances composing them.
He was unable then to enter upon the influence of heat, or of dilu
tion in certain cases, or to add any remarks connected with double
salts, or with other metals, or upon certain practical applications of
these views in chemical and physiological science.
   The fact that we very frequently find the double decomposition of
a salt to be complete, the whole of one of its constituents being pre
cipitated, was shown to be easily explained on the principles of
Berthollet.      Thus, for instance, when chromate of potash and
nitrate of silver are mixed, at the first moment a division will take
place producing four salts, but one of these — the chromate of
silver—is thrown down at once as a precipitate, and thus put out of
the field of action.       Another division of the acids with the bases
must take   place,   producing    of course more of the insoluble chromate,
and so   on,  till at length   the whole of the silver is removed. And
that this is really what does take place is rendered almost certain by
the fact that wherever by an interchange of acids and bases a pre
cipitate can be produced, that precipitate does form; and, if the
substance be perfectly insoluble, the whole is thrown down; this
occurring in opposition to                all
                                       rules      “affinity,” and
                                                     of                     all tables
                                                                                     to
that Bergmann,            or
                        any other chemist, ever did                       or

 sphere will set the silica free from the water-glass, and the silica,
 thus separated, will be deposited within the pores and around the
 particles of the stone. The points of contact of these particles will
  thus be enlarged, and a sort of glazing of insoluble silica will be
  formed, sufficient to protect the stone against the effects of moisture,
  &c.    This cause of protection applies chiefly to sand-stones. But
  wherever carbonate of lime or carbonate of magnesia enters notably
  into the composition of the building-stone, then an additional
  chemical action, also protective of the stone, is expected to take
 place between these carbonates and the water-glass.           Kuhlmann
  remarks, “Toutes les fois que l’on met en contact unsel insoluble
  avec la dissolution d'un seldont l'acide peut former avec la base du
  sel insoluble unsel plus insoluble encore, il y a €change; mais le
 plus souvent cet échange n'est que partiel”.”         In consequence of
 this  “partial  exchange”   an insoluble salt of lime may be looked for
  whenever a solution of   water-glass  is made to act on the carbonate
  of lime or carbonate of magnesia existing in oolitic or dolomitic
 building-stones.                   -
     This expectation, however, has not been altogether sanctioned by
 experiment.      A gentleman, eminently conversant with building
 materialst, immersed a piece of Caen-stone in a solution of silicate
 of potash in the month of January 1849. This fragment, together
 with a portion of the block from which it had been separated, was
 placed on the roof of a building in order that it might be fully
 exposed to the action of atmosphere and climate.         After five years
 the silicated and the unsilicated specimens were found to be both
 in the same condition, both being equally corroded. These specimens
 were exhibited in the Theatre of the Institution.           But whatever
ultimate results may ensue from this process, the immediate effects
on the stone are remarkable.          Two portions of Caen-stone were
exhibited, one of which had been soaked in a solution of water
glass two months before. The surface of the unsilicated specimen
was soft, readily abraded when brushed with water, and its calca
reous ingredients dissolved in a weak solution of sulphurous acid.
The silicated surface, on the other hand, was perceptibly hard, and
resisted the action of water and of dilute acid when similarly appliedf.

   III. The Stereochrome of Fuchs.-The formation of an insoluble
cement by means of the water-glass, whenever the carbonic acid of
the atmosphere acts on this substance, or whenever it is brought in
contact with a lime-salt, has been applied by Fuchs to a most im
portant purpose. The stereochrome is essentially the process of
fresco secco" invested with the capability of receiving and perpe
tuating works of the highest artistic character, and which may be
executed on a vast scale.         Fuchs's method is as followst:—
   “Clean and washed quartz-sand is mixed with the smallest quan
tity of lime which will enable the plasterer to place it on the wall.
The surface is then taken off with an iron scraper, in order to re
move the layer formed in contact with the atmosphere; the wall
being still moist during this operation.            The wall is then allowed
to dry; after drying it is just in the state in which it could be rubbed
off by the finger. The wall has now to be fired, i.e. moistened with
water-glasst.       [An important point is not to use too much water
glass in moistening the wall.] This operation is usually performed
with a brush. The wall must be left in such a condition as to be
capable of receiving colours when afterwards painted on.                                                 If,   as
frequently happens, the wall has been too strongly fixed, the surface
has    to    be
            removed with pumice and                 fixed again. toBeing fixed

   The following crucial experiment was made on one of these pic
tures.   It was suspended for twelve months in the open air, under
the principal chimney of the New Museum at Berlin; “during that
time it was exposed to sunshine, mist, snow, and rain,” and never
theless “retained     full brilliancy
                                its      colour.”               of

was separated from cobalt and nickel by addition of a sufficient
quantity of acetate of potash, in order to convert the nitrates into
acetates, and evaporation to dryness in a water-bath.         The dry mass
was boiled with water and filtered.        From the filtrate, which con
tained the whole quantity of oxides of cobalt and nickel, these were
precipitated by caustic potash.        The precipitate of sesquioxide of
iron was redissolved in hydrochloric acid and precipitated by am
monia. This method gives excellent results if used with care; the
only objection might be, that the sesquioxide of iron thus separated
is difficult to filter.
   The insoluble residue was ignited and fused with bisulphate of
potash.     On treating the fused mass with water, a white substance
of the appearance of titanic acid remained, which hydrochloric acid
slowly dissolved.       This substance and sesquioxide of iron were pre
cipitated by ammonia, and from the filtrate, oxide of nickel separated
as usual.     The precipitate was weighed, dissolved in hydrochloric
acid, and the iron precipitated by sulphide of ammonium after the
addition of tartaric acid and ammonia.       From the sulphide of iron the
iron was determined as usual.        From the filtrate, the other substance
remained after the tartaric acid was destroyed by heat. It was,
however, a very small quantity, and only sufficient for one blowpipe
reaction.    The borax bead gave in the inner flame an enamel of a
bluish colour.       Itherefore believe that it is titanic acid, though the
reactions somewhat differ.
   The insoluble residue seems to be a combination of iron, nickel,
and titanium.  It contains no cobalt. Neither part of the meteorite
contained carbon, sulphur, phosphorus or tin.

               oN M. FoucAULT's PENDULUM                         EXPERIMENTS*.
  Your Committee having undertaken to make this experiment with
as much care as possible, have the honour to submit the following
report on the results obtained by them.
        ºxtracted from the Second Report of the Special Committee                 of the
         tryand Historical Society Canada.       of

380            Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles.
     Acarefully turned spherical ball of lead, 5-2 inches in diameter
and   weighing  about 17 lbs., was employed as the weight, and sus
pended in the passage of the Quebec Music Hall, where a height of
60 feet was obtained. This weight was suspended by a fine steel
wire, on one end of which a fine screw was turned, by means of
which the wire was fastened to the ball from which the pendulum
was suspended.
   The following were the arrangements adopted by your Committee
at the point of suspension.      A small spherical ball of brass was
ground into a hemisphere in a plate of the same metal.     A hole was
drilled through the centre of the hemisphere for the wire, and suffi
ciently large to allow the pendulum to vibrate in the required arc
without coming into contact with the plate. The wire was screwed
into the ball of suspension.
   In order to start the pendulum for the experiments, a cotton
thread was passed round the ball and tied over two pins in a heavy
moveable block.      When the weight secured in this manner had
been brought to a state of rest, the thread was fired with a taper,
and the pendulum commenced vibrating, the thread falling to the
ground.    A circle, 10 feet in diameter, was described on the floor
from a centre under the point of suspension, and graduated into
degrees, by which the progress of the plane of vibration was mea
sured.
    The first series of observations recorded in the tables were made
 on the 14th, 15th and 16th ; and the second series on the 19th and
 20th of May, 1853.
    The first series of observations gives the angle actually moved
 through in 47° 18" (after applying the correction for the progression
 of the apse due to elliptic motion) only 1° 56' less than that calcu
lated.    The second series gives an error of 2° 2' in 23* 10". These
errors may be represented in time by about 10 and 12 minutes; and
your Committee consider that these experiments agree so nearly with
calculation as to be strong corroborative evidence of the correctness
of the theory, that the time taken by the plane of vibration to per
form a complete revolution varies approximately as the time of the
latitude.
    It may not here be out of place to give an explanation of the
accompanying tables. Columns (1) and (2) refer to the times of
observation; (3) denotes the nature of the ellipse described by the
pendulum, showing, if there be no elliptic motion, or if elliptic
motion, whether it is progressing or retarding; (4) shows the azi
muthal angle observed; (5) the angle moved through, and (6) the
time between the observations; (9) is the angle calculated; (7) is
the difference between (5) and (9); (8) is the angle corrected for
elliptic motion; and (10) is the difference between (8) and (9).
   Your Committee have great satisfaction in submitting the results
of the different experiments.      In some instances they have varied
considerably from the calculated angles; but in         allthese the fact
that the pendulum had acquired       an elliptic motion, would seem   to
point    to
          that circumstance    as the chief cause of  disturbance, while
in most   ofthe  experiments  in  which there was      noelliptic motion,

                   ON            THE SUPPOSED CONVERSION OF AMMONIA INTO NITRIC ACID
                                   IN THE ANIMAL organ ISM. BY CHRISTIAN JAFFé.
                        series   Aexperiments have recently been publishedof                                                                                                                                     by           Dr.
                   Bence Jones, from which      inferred, that after introducing                          it   is                                                                                                         into

the stomach a large quantity of ammoniacal compounds, nitric acid
appears in the urine as a product of their oxidation.
   From the extreme apparent improbability that such an oxidation
could be effected in the animal organism, and at the instigation of
Prof. Lehmann, the author has repeated the experiments upon which
this inference is founded; and has come to the conclusion, that the
method which Dr. Bence Jones adopted for detecting the presence
of nitric acid in the urine is altogether inapplicable, and consequently
that the inference that ammonia is oxidized within the organism is
perfectly unfounded.
  The method consists in distilling the somewhat concentrated urine
with concentrated sulphuric acid until about one-half or two-thirds
 have passed over, treating the distillate with carbonate of potash,
 evaporating and testing the residue for nitric acid by means of starch,
 iodide of potassium and dilute hydrochloric acid, or with indigo.
    The author believes that this process is inapplicable, because,
 even admitting the presence of nitric acid, it would appear impos
 sible to distil over this acid in the presence of urea, or indeed any
 other organic substance. In order to decide this point, the author
 added a few drops of nitric acid to normal urine, concentrated by
 evaporation, and then distilled with sulphuric acid. The distillate,
 treated with starch and iodide of potassium, gave a reaction, which,
 although readily accounted for by subsequent experiments, at first
 led the author to form the erroneous opinion that a distillation of
 undecomposed nitric acid from urine actually took place.                Normal
 urine, distilled with concentrated sulphuric acid, gave a liquid which
 became intensely blue when treated with starch and iodide of
 potassium, while at the same time it gave no indication of nitric
 acid with protosulphate of iron.         It soon became evident that this
 reaction was altogether owing to the presence of sulphurous acid,
 formed by the action of the sulphuric acid upon the organic sub
 stances, and which, as is well known, causes a separation of iodine.
 It thus becomes easily intelligible why Dr. Bence Jones so seldom
obtained this reaction in normal urine, as he saturated the distillate
with carbonate of potash, and evaporated.
    The presence of sulphurous acid in the distillate, and the dependence
of the reaction upon    it, was demonstrated         the following manner:—
                                                                  in
     In the first instance, normal urine was distilled without any addi
tion  of  acid; and,    as was     to           be
                                       expected, the distillate gave          re            no
action.     Normal urine was then distilled with sulphuric acid; the
distillate gave    a reaction with starch and iodide          potassium; whenof

    Thus then it appears that an oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid
in the animal organism has not by any means been proved by
Dr. Bence Jones's experiments. It remained, therefore, necessary
to ascertain by some other means whether such a formation of nitric
acid really took place. For this purpose, concentrated urine, mixed
with a few drops of nitric acid, was distilled with phosphoric acid;
and the distillate did not give the slightest reaction either with
starch and iodide of potassium or with protosulphate of iron.
     After these results, the author considers it unnecessary to enter
more fully upon the consideration of the various deductions from
Dr. Bence Jones's experiments; such, for instance, as the assumed
formation of nitric acid from urea introduced into the stomach, espe
cially as Frerich has already proved that this is always attended
 by an increase in the quantity of urea in the urine.—Journ. für

386            Dr. E. W. Davy on a                   new and simple              Method of
their execution much time and trouble, and in some cases com
plicated and expensive apparatus; and though capable in ex
perienced hands of yielding tolerably accurate results, would in
the case of those not much practised in chemical manipulation,
and perhaps unaware of the many sources of error to be guarded
against, give anything but correct results, and are therefore in
applicable to the greater number of those desirous of a quick
and easy method of determining the quantity of urea in urine.
    The method             I
                   propose is one of extreme simplicity, and can
 be  performed  by  almost any one in a very few minutes, and is
 capable of yielding results sufficiently accurate for      practical                         all
 purposes.          It
                   founded

much longer, even for a day if convenient, and having set the
experiment going, it requires no further attention; and when
the decomposition is completed, it is only necessary to measure
the quantity of gas produced by transferring it into a graduated
tube or measure.
    I have generally used a graduated tube in the first instance,
as it saves the trouble of transferring the gas and incurring the
risk of losing some of it in the process. That which would    I
recommend as being convenient for this purpose is a stout tube
having a bore of half an inch in diameter, and capable of hold
ing from 2 to 3 cubic inches.          A tube having this bore and
about 14 inches in length, will hold 2} cubic inches, which will
be quite large enough.       Each cubic inch of it should be divided
into tenths and hundredths of a part of a cubic inch.
    It is scarcely necessary to remark, that in cases where great
accuracy is required, due attention must be paid to the tempera
ture and atmospheric pressure, and certain corrections made if
these should deviate from the usual standards of comparison at
the time of reading off the volume of the gas; but in most cases
sufficiently near approximations to accuracy may be obtained
without reference to those particulars.        From a number of expe
riments,   I  have ascertained that the quantity of gas evolved from
different amounts of urea, treated in the way I have just de
scribed, very closely approximates to the quantity of nitrogen
gas which should be furnished from the urea by calculation.
This will be seen from the following, taken from many experi
ments.
    The fifth part of a grain of urea should furnish by calculation
0.3098 parts of a cubic inch of nitrogen gas at 60°F. and 30
bar.; the same quantity of urea treated as described furnished in
one experiment 0-3001, and in another 03069 parts of a cubic
inch of gas at the same temperature and pressure; which shows
that the calculated quantity of nitrogen differs from the amount
of nitrogen gas obtained by only a few thousandths of a part of
a cubic inch.      I  may observe that I was obliged to operate on
such small     quantities of urea, on account of the graduated tube
 I had at the time being only of one cubic inch capacity.
    Seeing, then, that the quantity of gas evolved agrees so very
closely with the calculated amount of nitrogen present in a cer
tain quantity of urea,    I take the calculated amount as being the
more correct; and knowing the relation that exists between a
certain quantity of urea and nitrogen,         I can from the quantity
of  gas  evolved in   any  case easily  calculate the amount of urea
present by the simple process of rule of three.          Thus the fifth
part of a grain, or 0:2 of a grain of urea, gives by calculation
0.3098 parts of a cubic inch of nitrogen gas. Then 0.3098: the

or multiplying the first and third terms by 5, we have 1549
cubic inch of gas representing one grain of urea, which is a
simpler proportion.   Using these data, I made several compara
tive experiments  on different samples of urine with my method
and that of Baron Liebig’s, which I believe is considered one of
the most accurate of the methods of determining urea in urine
at present known. The following are the results of three com
parative experiments on different samples of urine, using the
same with each method.
 Amount     of urea in grains       and parts of a grain in one fluid ounce

        3rd experiment          .     .   4976
  In the first  and second experiments the quantity of common
salt present in the urine was taken into account, as it is found
to increase to a slight degree the apparent quantity of urea in
the urine by Liebig’s method.      In the third this was not taken
into consideration, and the quantity of urea was compared with
the mean of two results obtained by my method.        These experi
ments show how      very closely the results obtained by the new
method   agree  with those  by  Baron Liebig’s, and therefore show
the correctness of the former method.
  I  prefer the hypochlorite of soda to that of potash as a decom
posing agent, because the soda salt is an article of our pharma
copoeia under the name “Sodae chlorinatae liquor,” and therefore
can be so easily procured; whereas the potash salt, not being
used in medicine, would require to be specially made for the
purpose. As to the hypochlorite of lime,                I
                                                  do not think it so
effectual, and it has the disadvantage of soiling the sides of the
graduated tube by the carbonate of lime formed in the reaction.
   In reference to the quantity of hypochlorite of soda to be
employed, it should always be used in excess; and                  I
                                                           think that
about five or six times the volume of the urine employed would
be found generally to be quite sufficient, and ensure there being
an excess of the hypochlorite.      The amount required may be
easily determined also by direct experiment, by adding to a cer
tain quantity of urine to be examined in a glass a measured
quantity of the hypochlorite, and leaving it for a short time till
                                                              on            of

used to arrive at this point indicates the amount necessary.                        I
found by experiment that one grain of urea requires somewhere
about half a fluid ounce of the ordinary sodae chlorinatae liquor
for   itscomplete decomposition. The amount                          mercury em        of

   There is one other source of error which may arise, and which
can be easily avoided.      It is the following: that if a solution of
the  hypochlorite    of soda alone, or standing over mercury, be
exposed to the light for several days, it will very gradually evolve
a minute quantity of oxygen, which shows that in determining
urea we should not allow the experiment to go on for too long a
time; but if left for a day, or even two, it will scarcely make any
appreciable effect on the quantity of gas evolved in testing for
urea.
   The reaction which appears to take place in the process seems
to be the following. The hypochlorite of soda acting on the
urea gives rise to the formation of carbonic acid, water, and
chloride of sodium, together with the evolution of nitrogen gas.
Thus
      Urea.          3 Hypochlorite soda.
Cº. H4. Nº. 0°,   + 3(CI, O. NaO)=200°4-4HO4-3Cl. Na.--N*.
   The nitrogen is evolved and the carbonic acid is absorbed by
some of the hypochlorite of soda in excess, for       I find that this
salt absorbs carbonic acid very quickly without evolving any
other gas; and I failed in several experiments to detect the
smallest portion of carbonic acid in the gas produced by acting
on urea, though I have always noticed the presence of a very
minute quantity of oxygen in the nitrogen gas. These appear
from my experiments to be the changes produced; but this part
                I
of the subject have not as yet minutely examined, and my expe

riments have hitherto been made on healthy urine; have, how
ever, ascertained that several of the substances found in urine
during disease, as for example, sugar, albumen, bile, and excess
of urinary colouring matter, produce scarcely any effect on the
results obtained by this new method of determining the quan
tity of urea in the urinary secretion.

   3. Police carbine; length 28.75 inches; diameter 0-66 inch.
   With these guns were used the following bullets:—
   Two-groove rifle.—l. A Minié bullet, provided with two pro
jections corresponding to the grooves of the rifle, without ‘culot;’
weight 697 grs. 2. A sugarloaf bullet, fired point foremost ;
 weight 669.75 grs. 3. A belted, spherical bullet; weight 482
  S.
   Minié rifle.—The regulation Minié bullet, with ‘culot;’
weight 744 grs.
   Carbine,—Spherical bullet; weight 391 grs.
   The method employed to determine the velocity of the bullets
was Robins' ballistic pendulum; and the same quantity of the
best gunpowder (40 grs.) was employed with each gun and bullet.
   For the erection of the pendulum, and most efficient assistance
afforded in the conduct of the experiments,          am indebted to      I
Mr.  Joseph    Harris, of the firm of Truloch and Son, Dawson
Street, Dublin, without whose aid                    I
                                         should have been unable to
bring these experiments to a successful issue.
   I shall first give the details of the experiments, and then men
tion the principal deductions which may be obtained from them.

        w = ratio of circumference of a circle to its diameter.
        f = distance from axis of gun attached to pendulum to
                    axis of suspension.
         c   =   distance from axis of suspension to point of attach

  The two-groove rifle barrel being firmly strapped with iron
plates to the pendulum, the constants   of the pendulum were
carefully determined, and were as follows:–

    If we assume that the force developed by the explosion of the
powder, diminished by the friction of the barrel, is constant, it
is easy to deduce the following expression for the velocity

     Carbine bullet........................    1083.7       1257-49      –   173-79
   The agreement of these results is very striking in the case of
the rifles, and proves the truth of equation (4); and the disagree
ment in the case of the carbine proves, as might be expected,
that the force of the powder is greater in the smooth bore than
in the rifle. From the preceding results we may assert with
confidence, that the velocity with which a bullet is propelled from
a rifle by a given charge of powder depends mainly on the weight
of the bullet and the length of the barrel, varying inversely as the
square root of the former, and directly as the square root of the
                                -
latter*.
    The following experiments were made to ascertain the resist
ance of the air to bullets of different figures and weights. The
bullets were fired at 80 feet distance, from the two-groove rifle
into the pendulum, and the velocities calculated from formula (1).

   * The former of these laws was proved by Mr. Hutton to hold for smooth
bore guns of large size, but the latter did not hold true for his experiments.
I suppose the reason it is nearer the truth in rifles is on account of the
increased friction in the latter.

 Prof. Faraday on Subterraneous Electro-telegraph Wires.          397
send you; the effects are produced with wires covered with gutta
percha and laid in the earth.
   “A very remarkable phaenomenon is constantly observed on
long, well-insulated telegraphic lines. Suppose one extremity,
B, of the wire be insulated, and the other, A, be connected
with one pole of a battery of which the other touches the earth;
at the instant of communication a brief current is observed in
the near parts of the wire in the same direction as the instanta
neous current which would exist if the extremity B were con
nected with the earth; on lines of perfect insulation no trace of
this current remains.    Suddenly replacing, through the action
of a  commutator, the  battery  by an earth conductor, a second
instantaneous current is obtained of an intensity nearly equal to
the first, but in the inverse direction.       Finally, breaking the
communication of A with the        battery and also the earth, so as
to insulate this  extremity,   and  uniting  the end B at the same
instant with the ground, an instantaneous current is observed
nearly equal in intensity to the former, and this time in the
same direction as the first, i. e. as the continuous current of the
battery. This last experiment can only be made on a double
subterranean line having the two extremities A and B at the
same station.    One might at first sight suppose these phaeno
mena to be due to secondary polarities developed on the wire,
but many facts oppose such a conclusion.          1. The phaenomena
are more striking as the wire is better insulated.       2. The cur
rents are much more brief than those due to      secondary  polarities.
3. Their intensity is proportional to the force of the battery, and
independent of the intensity of any derived current that ma
occur in consequence of imperfect insulation; it follows that the
intensity of the instantaneous currents can greatly surpass the
maximum intensity which secondary currents in the same cir.
cuit could acquire. 4. Finally, the intensity of the instanta
neous currents is proportional to the length of the wire, whilst
an inverse relation ought to occur if the currents were due to
 secondary polarities.
    “The phaenomena are easily comprehended if we recall the
beautiful experiment by which Volta furnished the most striking
proof of the identity of galvanism and electricity. . He showed
that on communicating one of the ends of his pile with the earth,
and the other with the interior of a non-insulated Leyden bat
tery, the battery was charged in an instant of time to a degree
 proportional to the force of the pile. At the same time an instan
taneous current was observed in the conductor between the pile
and the battery, which, according to Ritter, had       allthe proper
ties   of  ordinary
            an        current. Now
                                      it
                                      is    evident that the subter
raneous wire with     its insulating covering may      be  assimilated

7 square metres per kilometre. Making such a wire communicate

esting    your readers
          to                give the few following particulars rela
                                   to
tive to the closely-allied experiments      M. Fessel, and the dis
                                                             of
cussions which have taken place respecting them, more especially

                          on Rotatory Motion.                   399
as they will form an appropriate introduction to the beautiful
researches on the subject which Professor Wheatstone has very
recently brought before the Royal Society.
     In Poggendorff’s Annalen, Sept. 1853, No. 9, Prof. Plücker
has given some account of the rotatory machine of M. Fessel.
Notwithstanding the luminous theoretical researches on the sub
ject in the papers of MM. Poinsot and Poisson, he observes that
experimental illustration of it is still desirable, and mentions
 that M. Fessel, “formerly teacher in the provincial school of
 industry, now by the kindness or unkindness of circumstances
 led to exercise his art as a mechanician,” has constructed an ap
 paratus, which, from the way in which it presents the phaeno
 mena to the eye, excites surprise even in those who are acquainted
 with the principle.
     The instrument will be understood at once from the sketch
 annexed.
      The disc A, loaded
 round its circumfer
 ence,     can be spun
 rapidly on the axis B,
 whose ends rest in the
 ring C, itself joined by
 a hinge at D to the
  axis bent at a right
 angle at E, the ver
  tical part of which
  turns freely in the
 tube F, supported on
  the stand G.
      The observed phaenomenon is this. When the disc is set in
  rapid rotation about B, the whole begins also to revolve bodily
  round the vertical axis E, and this is easily seen to be due to
  the action of gravitation tending to bring down the ring C
  about D.
      M. Fessel adds, in a note, an account of the way in which he
  accidentally discovered the principle, by rotating a heavy wheel
  on one end of an axis. And M. Plücker proposed to him to
   modify the construction by attaching the ring C to one end of a
   bar carrying a sliding counterpoise, and capable of revolving
   about a pivot; and this, he says, answered admirably.
       “The apparatus thus improved,” Prof. Plücker continues,
   “gave the previous phaenomena, but at - the same time others
   immediately appeared.
       “If the disc rotated in a vertical plane, then the axis moved
   itself round towards the opposite direction in the horizontal
   plane.    If the first rotatory motion gradually lost, the second

  gained.   If the second motion was quickened by an extraneous
  force,then the ring with the disc appeared to become lighter,
 since it rose up; on the contrary, by a retardation of the hori
 zontal movement, it seemed to become heavier, or sank. With
 the same rotatory velocity of the disc, the horizontal rotation
 increased or diminished according as the force of gravitation was
 increased or diminished; as, for example, if the rotating disc be
 made of soft iron, it rises or sinks if we precede or follow it with
 a magnet, thereby accelerating or retarding the horizontal revo
  lution.”
     He also points out the analogy of this apparatus   to that of
 Bonenberger.        the Annalen, No. 10 (Oct. 1853), the editor
                                    In
 adds “one more word on the Fessel rotatory machine,” in which
 he confirms the account of      inventor                  its
                                              his own experience                            by                                     of

    The general nature       this explanation may of     stated thus:                                         be

      Suppose now that the group

The former group is said to be  a multiple of the latter group,
and the latter group to be a submultiple of the former group.
Thus considering the two different forms of a group of six, and
first the form

the group of six is a multiple of the group of three, 1, 2, 2° (in
fact, 1, 2, 2* and y, ya, yo” are each of them a symmetrical
holder of the group 1, 2, 2*); and so in like manner the group
of six is a multiple of the group of two, l, y (in fact, 1, y and
o, ay, and 2, 2°y are each a symmetrical holder of the group 1,                                                                           y).

      Considering, secondly, the other form                                                of      a   group       of   six, viz.

       OON after the discovery of the variations in height of the
        barometer, Descartes proposed the following mode of ren
dering them more conspicuous,    almost as much so as they are
in one filled with water alone.    He suggested that two tubes
should be joined to the opposite ends of a short wide cylinder so
as to form one straight tube, which, being closed at one end,
was to be filled with pure water and mercury in such proportions
                         of the two fluids at                         all      pressures            meeting

the variations            of

between the mercury and the glass, had so allowed the air to
enter.
  A solution of muriate of lime, not being crystallizable, was
next tried; and this seems to stand best, as yet having sunk in
23 years only 03 of an inch, the greater part of this depression
having occurred in the first few months, giving rise to the sur
mise that the air which has caused it was left in at the time of
filling, and has not crept in since.   The addition of the salt to
the water, besides removing to a great extent the air, has the
effect of diminishing the correction required for the force of
vapour; the last named solution has          boiling-point    234°F.,

IT residue
   is clear the question may arise, whether the cause of the
           does not reside in the uncoated part of the jar or
rim, inasmuch as a part of the electricity may move about                                                   be
tween the glass and the varnish.
   It appears plausible, that if such a movement occurred, it
would do so gradually and in tolerable quantity, for the electri
city pushed on to the rim on the insulated side would cause the
opposite electricity to follow it up the other side, and condensa
tion might take place as well on the insulator as under the
coatings.         At
                any rate the decision                             of this question does not
appear superfluous.
   If the rim of the jar actually influences the residue, then this
influence ought to be more considerable, in proportion to the
total charge, not only when the rim is broader (for it might be
assumed that the movement was never very extensive), but parti
cularly when the periphery of the coating is greater in compari
son to      its
             superficial area.  Hence       with     equal area   if,             an                        of
coating, the rim            be

greatest residue, and that with the metallic coating the least.
   Apart from the fact that this difference may         attributed                         be                    to

out with    solution

                                       analogous to the influence
of cements,  one would expect that in this case the proportions of
the residues would be different from those when, between the
surfaces of the mercury and the glass, a thin and dry stratum of
air must have been interposed; for it may be here remarked,
that before pouring in the well-dried mercury, the glass had
been washed with distilled water, heated, and sucked dry by
means of a glass tube. No difference however was observable in
these two cases; the residues formed in the same time had just
the same magnitude, as may be seen from the following num
bers, which refer to a case where, at both times, the charge at
first imparted had been allowed to stand for 606 seconds                          —

   Here, indeed, the mercury appears to have the advantage,
though the circumstance may probably be attributed to the
great difficulty of constructing two Leyden jars with exactly
equal magnitudes of coating, the one with an adhering, and the
other with a non-adhering liquid,
   The question as to the influence of the cement would be
answered most decidedly by coating a glass plate on both sides
with amalgam, and after examination replacing it by tinfoil.    It
will, we think, be difficult to find any measurable difference.
                                           § 8.
    The magnitude of the residue appears to depend most essen
tially upon the thickness of the glass, the thicker glass pro
ducing the greater residue.          The experiment about to be cited
on this  point   is not  quite  decisive, for the amount of residue, of
course, depends very much upon the kind of glass; and the two
bottles which were compared should, on this account, have been
blown from the same mass of glass, and cooled in exactly the
same manner. Although this was not the case, yet the interesting
result which was obtained may here be mentioned.
    The mean thickness of glass of the bottle b, so often referred
 to, was 2.7 millims. This was found from the absolute and spe
cific gravities, as  well    from direct measurements. The interior
                               as
surface,  so  far    as    can
                          it         be
                                     considered       coating, has been
                                                               as
already stated   to   contain 230 square centims.
   Another bottle,    e,     thin glass had
                              of                 mean thickness
                                                       a              0.82       of
millims., and   an   interior surface        of
                                           230  square  centims.
   Both bottles were converted into Leyden jars                        by
                                                              filling, and
surrounding them with acidulated water; and                          by
                                                            the methods’

tities of electricity in these bottles b and e, at equal tensions on
their knobs, had the proportion 508 : 1303.
    To both jars a charge was momentarily imparted, which was
immediately indicated by the sine-electrometer as 1:4941; and
on discharging the jars after an interval of 9 minutes, the
residues 0°3052 and 0.1180 were collected.
    The proportion of the mean densities of electricity in the two
bottles b and e, if they possess equal tensions at their knobs, is
                               508            1303

                               275            330°
  The proportion of the quantities of electricity concealed as
residues in b and
                e is
               508    ×   0.3052         :    1303   ×    0.1180, or 1:0.991.
     We                 that the jar, whieh, compared with a second,
          see, therefore,
has three times the thickness of glass, produces the same quantity
of electricity as residue, although the mean density is three times
less.
     Exactly similar phaenomena were observed with two Franklin’ s
plates   of unequal thicknesses.
                                                     § 9.

electricities    in
                  the glass has not ceased, the reappearance            the                         of
same   may     be
                accounted for, without attributing          repulsive force         a
to  the substance           of
                        the glass,                   by

   This explanation, however, necessarily involves the assump
tion, that the potential         the electricity which remains

under examination; an assumption which, from the commence
ment, appears requisite on account of the proportionality existing
           the disposable charge and the tension on the knob of
the  jar.
   Further, the following facts ought to be considered:—
   1.     after discharging the Franklin’s plate it be turned up
                If
side  down,  the sine-electrometer being connected with the coating
formerly in connexion with the earth, whilst the side which be
fore was positive is now connected with the earth, a residue of
negative electricity will be obtained.
   2.           If
          a Franklin’s plate, with exactly equal sides, had equal
and    opposite  charges imparted to them, then the quantities
which penetrate the glass would certainly be exactly equal, in
reference to arrangement and magnitude. In such a case, how
ever, the potential before referred to would certainly not be zero.
But how little this state must differ from that which ensues
when, with a thin plate, the one coating remains connected with
the earth ! And, bearing fact 1 in mind, is it not probable that
the residue would be obtained with exactly equal and oppositely
charged sides?
   3. Why, with equal charge of coating, does the thicker Frank
lin's plate give the greater residue 7
   4. Why does not the residue continually increase the longer
the jar remains charged, or why does it approach a definite
maximum dependent upon the magnitude of the charge?
   These are points which after some consideration cause legiti
mate doubts concerning the truth of the whole hypothesis which
regards the electricity as penetrating the glass; and in any case
they authorize the attempt here made to substitute another hy
pothesis which will solve                 all
                                 these problems.    Departing, there

fluence, whereas under the magnetic moment of a magnet the
idea of stability is associated, or at any rate the idea that within
pretty large limits the magnetic moment is essentially indepen
dent of external influences.     Nevertheless, for the condition and
mode    of action of a body in whose interior the electric fluids are
unequally distributed, and are only capable of extremely slow
motion or of none at all, we have no better term, inasmuch as the
condition itself is hypothetical, and hence it may not be deemed
inappropriate to introduce the expression “electric moment.”
    Let us conceive the possibility of the neutral electricity within
an insulator being by some cause or other so separated, that
    a. under the surface on the one side a stratum of positive,
and on the opposite side a stratum of negative electricity formed
itself; or that
    b. a series of such alternate parallel strata were arranged be
hind each other; or that
    c. in every ultimate particle the separation took place in the
same direction, but that the electricity could not pass from one
particle to another; and if we now further assume that such a
state can exist after the cause which produced this separation of
the electricities has ceased to act, then such an insulator could
exercise an action, i. e. an electromotive force, on an external
point.
    d. A fourth condition is also conceivable ; for instance, in
every particle of the glass the electricities may be naturally sepa
rated, but in general without external action (for exactly the same
reason as the molecular currents in soft iron are so, that               be                             is,
                                  equilibrium does not permit it); but,

cause their own condition

 with the fixed electricities    clinging      them, may             to

                             positive particles from any plane may

in the usual manner, it is nevertheless evident that some such
distribution causing equilibrium is possible.
  If  we now insulate one of the coatings, and impart to it a fresh
quantity of the same kind of electricity as it already possesses, so
that on the other side a corresponding quantity of the opposite
kind of electricity will be rendered latent, then these new elec
tricities will distribute themselves as if the plate had not been
charged.    The principle of statics is here applicable, according
to  which, if a system of forces are in equilibrium, they will still
remain so when another system, itself in equilibrium, is added
to the former.     Hence the tension, at any point of the insulated
coating, will be proportional to the quantity of electricity newly
imparted, and the latter only will constitute the disposable
charge.
   It is only necessary to invert the process of reasoning here
given, in order to see that the phaenomena of the electric residue
are contained in what has been said.

another, but either separates itself on each particle, as in the
case of magnets, or was already separated on these particles, and
the latter, together with the electricities clinging to them, are
turned. In the first hypothesis, a force must be attributed to
the several particles of glass, which only permits the separation,
and the corresponding motion, to take place gradually, and which
resists it the more the longer it is prolonged, so that the limit of
the residue has herein          cause.     its

                  a                             circumstance which    a
has  great similarity  with the one here  mentioned,    and which                                     in
its way stands single. This         the so-called elastic seconda
                                                  is
action, which has been made known              W. Weberº,   to   us   by
his researches        silken threads (the only complete research
                           on

   Probably       bodies possess this elastic secondary action;                                       at

characterized:—

                               first the form changes quickly, after
wards very slowly. The subsequent slow change has been de
signated the “elastic secondary action,” although the latter,                                         as

 the electricity actually is distributed almost uniformly over a
 great portion of the Franklin's plate; and near the rim, where
 this is not the case, the principal action on the points in the
 glass must be ascribed to the neighbouring parts of the coatings,
so that the conclusions before made will be approximately true”.
Herefrom we learn, not only that with the same quantity of
charge a greater electric moment is produced with the thicker
glass, but also that at different places the action on the glass will
be different; so that the manner in which the concealed residue
produced by the electric moment disposes itself, cannot be very
different from the distribution of the electricity which is pro
duced underneath the coating by the disposable charge.
   What has here been said of the Franklin’s plate may, with
modifications suited to their forms, be on the whole repeated of
the common Leyden jar; hence it would appear that the phae
momena of the electric residue may be completely explained by
the electric moment, particularly under the hypothesis that the
change in the glass affects                           its
                                individual particles only.

restriction of Mr. Faraday's beautiful law of the definite de
composing agency of the galvanic current. It may not per
haps be altogether superfluous to state, that it is now nearly
fourteen years since I read to the Chemical Section of the
British Scientific Association at Glasgow a notice of experi

redly no inference was drawn affecting Mr. Faraday’s law; and
which notice was afterwards inserted, in January 1841, in the
18th volume of this Journal, page 49*. My object at that time
was to illustrate the voltaic decomposition of alcohol, by showing
that the quantity of hydrogen liberated from the negative pole
in acidulated water was the same as that liberated from the
negative pole in alcohol, having                     its

seemed       modify the result: first, the absorption
                to                                         hydrogen              of

secondary products                 of
                        oxidation formed     the positive pole; and
                                                            at
secondly, that when the conducting power           the liquid dimiof
nished, the galvanic action diminished also, “a result,”      added,               I
“which may                be               by

shank’s battery of 36 pairs of 4-inch plates, charged with water
containing ºrd of a mixture of two measures sulphuric acid and
one measure nitric acid.      From the bad conducting power of the
distilled water which formed a part of the circuit, the action was
slight.    During the first half-hour similar minute quantities of
hydrogen were collected at the two negative poles.            After 8;
hours'   action, a decided difference in the   quantities  had become
apparent, there having been evolved from the negative pole in
the distilled water 0.04 cubic inch, and from the negative pole
in the acidulated water 0-07 cubic inch. After 24 hours, the
amounts were respectively 0.105 cubic inch and 0.2 cubic inch,
i. e. twice as much from the acidulated water as from the distilled
water.
   The only inference which I attempted to draw from such ex
periments was, that the bad conducting power of the distilled
water interfered with the full electrolytic action. I confess that it
never once occurred to me that any inference could be drawn from
them, trenching upon the law of definite voltaic chemical agency;
nor does it yet appear to me that there is any foundation for
such an inference+.     If M. Foucault’s views be well founded, that
it follows from this and other experiments to which he refers,
that liquids have a conducting power independently of suffering
decomposition,     and that in experiments such as the above, a
part of the current passes by this proper conduction, how is it
to be expected that the full decomposing effect should be pro
duced       It would be a violation of the law of definite agency if
the same amount of electrolytic action ensued, when a part of
the current passed by proper conduction, as when the whole
current passed in virtue of decomposing agency.               There is
scarcely any law in science which does not present exceptions
and limitations, till we come to be able to ascertain the true

the limits of the general proposition.      The histories of the rela

and even of gravitation itself, afford illustrations of this principle.

LXIX.      On the Generation of Heat by Electricity.      By P. RIEss.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
I
       GENTLEMEN,
     REGRET exceedingly to find that Mr. Thomson, in the
       Philosophical Magazine for May, page 347, while admitting
one error, has fallen into a new and more serious one, which           I

reason to change his opinion.—ED.]

       On certain Questions relating to the Moon's Orbit.                                                   429
cannot allow to pass unnoticed. Mr. Thomson no longer ascribes
the discovery of the law, that the quantity of heat generated by
the Leyden jar is proportional to the square of the quantity of
electricity, to Mr. Joule, but claims it for Cuthbertson, from
whose experiments, he asserts, M. Becquerel had “quite ex
plicitly enunciated” the law in 1835. I regret that the re
mark of M. Becquerel has not been given completely, for if
this had been done I should have been spared the present
communication.     The place in the original reads as follows:—
“Cuthbertson et autres physiciens qui ont mesuré avec des
électrometres l'action calorifique produite par la décharge d’une
batterie, ont trouvé qu’elle croissait a peu pres comme la carré
des charges des batteries pour certaines longueurs des fils.  Cette
loi varie          en

of this is in Mr.                    J.
                     T. Graves's valuable mathematical library at
Cheltenham.
   By logarithms the author intends the same quantities as                                                                             I
term respondents, certainly a less objectionable and safer term
to employ.    There appears to be an error in the title in affirming
that any  two numbers, not separately exceeding 20,000, may be
multiplied by aid of these tables, as the sum of the two factors
ought not to exceed 20,000. Mr. Peter Gray, so favourably
known to an important section of the public as the author of
many useful tables,has informed me that Major Shortredd, now in
India, has computed a table of quadratic respondents extending to
the argument 200,000, which he is taking measures to have pub
lished. Such tables would be very useful to computers, as they
would serve for the multiplication of any two numbers whatever
not containing more than five figures each.          should like to                                "I

        Primaeval Seas, afforded by the remains of colour in Fossil
 Testacea.”    By Edward Forbes, F.R.S., Pres. G.S. &c.
    When   engaged  in the investigation of the bathymetrical distribu
 tion of existing  mollusks,  the author found that not only did the
 colour of their shells cease to be strongly marked at considerable
 depths, but also that well-defined patterns were, with very few and
 slight exceptions, presented only by testacea inhabiting the littoral,

  eighteen of the shells taken from below 100 fathoms exhibited any
 markings of colour, and even the few that did so, were questionable
 inhabitants of those depths. Between 35 and 55 fathoms, the pro
 portion of marked to plain shells was rather less than one in three,
 and between the sea-margin and 2 fathoms the striped or mottled
 species exceeded one-half of the total number.
     In our own seas the author observes that testacea taken from below
  100 fathoms, even when they were individuals of species vividly
 striped or banded in shallower zones, are quite white or colourless.
 Between 60, and 80 fathoms, striping and banding are rarely

  The following paper was read:—Note on the Melting-point and
Transformations of Sulphur.” By B. C. Brodie, Esq., F.R.S.
   In the treatises of chemistry where the results of different ob
servers are collected, various statements will be found as to the
melting-point of sulphur.          The numbers given in Gmelin's Che
mistry vary from 104°5 C. to 112°2 C., but of five chemists cited, no
two agree as to this apparently simple fact. There is evidently
some peculiarity about this melting-point which is the cause of these
anomalous results.       In some experiments on allotropic substances,
                 I
in which have been engaged, I had occasion to submit this ques
tion to a more searching inquiry than it had hitherto received, in
which        I
            have discovered the cause of these discrepancies.             In the
present note I will briefly give the results at which I have arrived,
reserving the details for a further and more full communication.

stated to have such a high melting-point, distinctly melted. The
octohedral sulphur had become opake and rounded at the edges, the
other was unaltered in appearance.          Further inquiry convinced me
that the cause of the melting of the insoluble sulphur was, that it
had passed into another modification, and that this conversion was
attended with evolution of heat sufficient to melt the sulphur.          The
insoluble sulphur thus converted remains transparent, and is per
fectly soluble in bisulphide of carbon.
   It is stated in chemical treatises that the opacity which on solidi
fication comes over the melted sulphur, is due to the transformation
of the oblique prismatic into the octohedral sulphur, and the con
sequent disruption of the crystal." To this cause also is attributed the
evolution of heat which has been observed in solid sulphur imme
diately after cooling.     There are, however, no sufficient grounds                                                    for

  In the execution of the foregoing plan, the whole of the problems
of Euclid  are omitted as irrelevant to the demonstration of the other
propositions.    The grounds on which they were adopted in the
system of Euclid appear to be these.      It frequently happens that it
is necessary  in the course of demonstration to make some new con
struction not included in the figure which forms the original subject
of the proposition, and it was evidently thought that the geometer
would not in strictness                                  until he had
                           be entitled to take such a step
demonstrated the means of executing it with exactitude.      The stu
dent was accordingly in the postulates put in possession of a ruler
and a pair of compasses; and wherever any additional construction
was required in the proof of a proposition, a problem was premised,
showing the means by which the construction might be made by the
aid of those implements.
   But it should be recollected that the figure by which the demon
stration is commonly accompanied is not the actual subject of the
reasoning, but a mere illustration to aid the imagination and the
memory, the exactitude of which is matter of comparative indiffer
ence. Moreover, the principle on which the problems are introduced
is not consistently carried out to its legitimate conclusion even in
Euclid. There is no difference in the reasoning between the figure
which forms the original subject of the proposition, and the addi
tional construction which is made in the course of demonstration;
and therefore if it were necessary for the validity of the conclusion
to demonstrate the means of executing the latter figure, it would be
equally necessary in the case of the former. The student would not
be entitled to move a step in the demonstration of the equality of
two triangles having two sides and the included angle equal, until
he had been taught how to construct two such triangles, and con
sequently how to describe an angle equal to a given angle.        The
demonstration in Euclid begins with perfect legitimacy.   “Let ABC,
DEF be two triangles in such and such conditions,” without the
necessity of indicating the means by which those conditions may be
mechanically executed, or indeed of their possibility of actual exist
ence; and it may with equal legitimacy proceed to exemplify in
like manner any further construction which may be found necessary
in the course of demonstration.
   The question of motion has commonly            beenconsidered so essen
tially distinct from that of position, that       all

  with respect to which it will be necessary only to define the test by
  which they are respectively to be demonstrated in concrete figure.
  The relations of direction are of a much more complicated nature.
 The different phases of this elementary attribute of motion are di
  stinguished, not, like those of colour, by a permanent character inde
 pendently cognizable in each individual, but more like musical notes,
 by their relative position on a peculiar scale which may be made to
 rest on any individual as an arbitrary basis.
     The scale by which directions are compared is founded on the
 elementary relations of opposition and transverseness.                In whatever
 direction we suppose ourselves to be traversing space, we recognize
 the possibility of returning to the same position from whence we set
 out by motion in a different direction, the relation of which to the
 original is that of opposition; or the two may be classed together as
 the positive and negative modifications of a common direction.
     Again, if we fix our thoughts upon any given direction, we find a
 series of others in each of which it is possible to traverse space with
 out advance in the original direction or in the one opposed to                                                              it.

  certain distance in the direction of each of the two coordinates of
  the scale. The aggregate character (in respect of distance and
  direction) of the space traversed in different tracks (by which the
 position of the terminal points is governed) will thus be made to
  depend on the aggregate distance advanced in the direction of the
  two coordinates, a question to be tried by simple superposition.
  When the distance advanced in the direction of each coordinate is
  the same, the positions finally attained will be recognized as iden
 tical, and the points will coincide whatever may be the amount of
 intermediate divergence in the tracks by which they have actually
 been reached.
     From the same principle it may be shown, that a straight line may
 be drawn from a given point to any other point in space. Because
 the space traversed in the track by which the second point must be
 supposed to have been determined, will be equivalent in distance and
 direction to a certain distance in each of the two standard directions of
 the system.     Now inasmuch as the series of directions intermediate
 between   any pair of transverse directions includes individuals partaking
 in  every  conceivable proportion of the nature of both the transverse
 directions between which they lie, it will always be possible to select
 one of the series a certain distance in which will be equivalent to
 given distances in each of the two transverse directions, and there
 fore the distances in the direction of the coordinates of the system
 under consideration, into which the space traversed in the original
 track has been resolved, may again be exchanged for an equivalent
 distance in a single direction duly related to each of the coordinates;
 in other words, the same position may be attained by motion in a
 single continuous direction as by a track of any other description, or
 what amounts to the same thing, a straight line may be drawn from
a given point to a point determined by a track of any other de
scription.
     As soon as a straight line is known as lying in a single continuous
direction, it becomes the most obvious means of marking the direc
tion so exhibited throughout a finite extent of line. The series of
directions transverse to a given normal may then be represented by
two straight lines crossing each other at right angles, and an inde
finite number of other straight lines diverging from the point of
intersection, and dividing the plane surface round that point into as
many parts as there are diverging lines.          If now we take two of
these lines, like the hands of a clock, and suppose one to remain
fixed while the other revolves from left to right, it will pass success
ively through          all

place, after which the system of lines must be altered that the bend
ing may continue.     Such lines of bending are in continual motion
over the surface during bending, and may be called “instantaneous
lines of bending.”    When a second condition is satisfied, a finite
amount of bending may take place about the same system of lines.
Such a system may be called a “permanent system of lines of
bending.”
   Every conception required by the problem is thus rendered per
fectly definite and intelligible, and the difficulties of further investi
gation are entirely analytical.    No attempt has been made to over
come these, as the elementary considerations previously employed
would soon become too complicated to be of any use.

two points on a curve is the developable surface (or surfaces) drawn
through the two curves. The developable surface which touches
the given surface in a curve (and not the tangent plane) is the ana
logue of the line which touches a curve in a point. A biordinal
equation being given, one surface satisfying it is selected by a curve
through which that surface is to pass, and a developable surface
passing through that curve which the surface is to touch.                                                             ººmy

enter, in order that a biordinal partial equation may exist indepen
dent of these functions, are wholly unknown. The case, which is
fully analogous to a biordinal of two variables, is of the most limited
character.    Ampère has noticed this: Mr. De Morgan was led to
it by an examination of the polar properties of p(x, y, zia, b, c)=0.
This equation leads to a<U+017F><U+017F>=A, b=B, c=C, where A, B, C, are fung

tion. And the general solution of (1) is found by assuming b and
c in terms of a, and then making a a self-compensating variable.
   24. The paper is concluded by some remarks on notation.
   In an appendix to the preceding paper, read to the Society on the
1st of May, 1854, Mr. De Morgan points out an error committed
by M. Cauchy in a very remarkable theorem, of which his enuncia
tion is as follows.
   Let prºbe a function which can be developed in integer powers
of w. Let r(cos 0--sin 0. V–1), r being positive, be any one of
the roots of pre-o or of q'a-oo. Then the development of ºr is
convergent from w-0 up to a = the least value of r.
   M. Cauchy stipulates that the function shall be continuous; but
he defines a function to be continuous so long as it remains finite,
and receives only infinitely small increments from infinitely small
accessions to the variable. It is then obviously impossible that the
above theorem should be universally true. Were it so, it would
follow that the development of (1+w)? is convergent for all finite
values of z, whereas it is well known that this development becomes
divergent when a is greater than unity. The error of M. Cauchy’s
demonstration (which contains a valuable method for establishing a
large class of definite integrals) is the assumption that if an infinite
number of convergent series of the form a + ba +ca” +..., all with
one value of a but different values of a, b, c,                ...,
                                                     be added together,
the sum divided by the number of series is also a convergent series.
This assumption is not universally true.
   Mr. De Morgan takes a totally different line of demonstration,
 and establishes the following theorems.
    If r(cos 0+sin 6 . V-1), r being positive, represent a root of
any one of the equations pr=oo, p'ar- 20, p"w-co,                    then the    ....

    ON   THE PRODUCTION OF   OZONE BY THE DECOMPOSITION                                                            OF
             WATER AT LOW TEMPERATURES.   B.Y. M. GORET.
   some     experiments in which I employed a voltameter cooled in a
INmixture     of ice and common salt, I observed that the gas evolved,
which was to be carried through drying tubes, attacked and quickly
ate through the caoutchouc tubes uniting the different pieces of the
apparatus. When the voltameter was not cooled, the caoutchouc
completely retained the gas.          It appeared to me that this corrosive
action must be due to the presence of a larger quantity of ozone
when the decomposition of water is effected at a low temperature.
   I endeavoured to ascertain this quantity in the following manner.
Ozone, like chlorine, possesses the property of converting arsenious
acid into arsenic acid.                       If,

                                 BY PROF. LIEBIG.
   The mixture of the two oxides is dissolved in hydrocyanic acid
and potash; the solution is then heated for half an hour on the
water-bath in an open dish, or, what is better, boiled in a flask.
Cyanide of cobalt and potassium and protocyanide of nickel and
potassium are produced.       Mercury added to the solution throws
down        all
          the nickel    the form   inoxide, forming cyanide

    In     1801    Mr. Hatchett announced the discovery      new metallic                   of  a
 substance, contained           oxygen acid combined with oxide
                                      as    an                        iron                                  of
in    an undescribed heavy black mineral from Massachussetts. To
 this new metal Mr. Hatchett gave the name         columbium, and the ore    of
lin  which        he
               found      has usually
                                 it      this country been called colum

 called tantalum,      two Swedish minerals, which
                             in                          distinguished by               he

of Berlin published       a series of researches on the ores from these
different localities, from which, so far as I can understand the matter,
he drew the following conclusions: first, that the metal in the
Swedish tantalite is a distinct metal, with                            its
                                                        peculiar oxygen acid and
other   combinations,     and for this metal the name             tantalum may        of                             be
with   great   propriety    reserved,   being   the metal discovered by Eke
berg, and      byhim called tantalum; secondly, that                the Bodenmais     in
and American minerals two metals are contained, which M. Rose
                                         be by
proposed       distinguish
               to                the names         Niobium and Pelopium, the
                                                                 of

ought not to overlook what was done before him.
   The matter is now reduced to a very simple issue.
  We have columbium in the American and Bodenmais columbites,
and probably now in some other minerals.
   We have tantalum in Swedish tantalite and yttrotantalite, and
probably in some other minerals.

  LXXIV.      On the Theory of Chances developed in Professor Boole's
     “Laws of Thought.” By HENRY WILBRAHAM, M.A., Fellow
     of Trinity  College, Cambridge*.
  Soº         communications having already within the last few
         months appeared in the Philosophical Magazine, by Mr.
 Cayley and Professor Boole, relating to the subjects treated in
 the work lately published by the latter on the Laws of Thought,
 it may be considered not out of place to publish in the pages of
 the same Magazine the following observations on the theory of
 chances developed in that work.
    The object of this paper is to show that Professor Boole does in
 the greater number of questions relating to chances solvable by his
method (or at least in those which are most difficult to treat by
other methods), tacitly assume certain conditions expressible by
algebraical equations, over and above the conditions expressed by
the data of the problem, and to show how these assumed con
ditions may be algebraically expressed.
    When no condition among the chances of the simple events,
but only the absolute chances of those several simple events
are given, the reasoning of Chapter XVII. of Prof. Boole's
book shows that it is assumed that the events are independent,
i. e. that the event A is as likely to happen in one state of cir
cumstances as regards the remaining events as in another; for
instance, that A is as likely to happen if B happen and C do not,
as  it is if B and C both happen or both fail; and this assump
tion is implicitly introduced in the logical method of working
the problem. It is an assumption easily expressed by an alge
braical equation or system of equations.       For instance, take the
most    simple  case,   there are two events A and B, the chance of
A happening is a, of B, b : what is the chance of A and B both
happening        There are four possible cases; viz. (1) both hap- -
pening, (2) B happening without A, (3) A without B, (4) both

chances  besides the absolute chances of the simple events A
and B. The new given condition appears now to supersede and
take the place of the previously assumed condition; and with this
new condition combined with the three former equations among
6, A, u, p, the problem is easily solvable by algebra.      In the
second  question, where there are three simple  events A, B and C,
suppose there to be one other given relation among the chances.
This new condition certainly does to some extent supersede those
previously assumed; and it appears to me that Professor Boole's
reasoning would lead one to suppose that the former assumptions
are entirely banished from the problem, and no others except the
said newly given condition assumed in their stead.        The fact,
however, is that in this case certain additional assumptions are
made, otherwise the problem would be indeterminate.            The
nature of these assumptions, which are different from the assump
tions made when no condition besides the absolute chances of
the simple events is given, will perhaps be better seen from the
following discussion of an example than from any general rea
soning.                 I
             shall adopt in it the same assumptions as are made
in Professor Boole's method, but work it out without the aid of
his logical equations.    Any question which can be solved by the
logical method may also be treated in this manner.

468            Mr. H. Wilbraham   on the Theory   of Chances
concur.   Consequently    those of the above sixteen compound
events which represent S occurring while any one or more of the
other three events do not occur, and which represent A, B, C all
to occur without S occurring, must be considered as beyond the
range of our observation.    This does not contradict the former
assumption of the mutual independence of the four simple events;
for we do not by this last supposition say that such compound
events are impossible, nor do we make any new assumption as
to the probability of their occurrence, but only that, as they are
beyond the limits of our observation, we have nothing to do with
them.    The events, therefore, which come within our circle of
observation are those marked respectively 8, v, p, t, v, b, X, o ;
and the absolute chance that any event which may occur is an
event within the range of our observation is
 .
  ay2s +    (1—a)/2(1–s) + w(1—y)2(1–s) + ay(1–2)(1–s)
           + w(1–y)(1–2)(1—s) + (1–2)/(1-2)(1—s)
           + (1—a)(1—y)2(1–s) + (1—a)(1—y)(1–2)(1—s),
          is similar to the quantity called   V in Professor Boole's
 ook.                                                     -
  I  must here observe that w, y, and z are not the same as the
given quantities a, b and c; for the latter represent the chances
of A, B, and C respectively occurring, provided that the event
is one which comes within our range of observation, whereas
w, y, and 2 represent the absolute chances of the same events
whether the event be or be not within that range.
   Of the eight events 8, v, p, t, v, b, X, a which compose V,
four, viz. 8, p, t, and v, imply the occurrence of A. Consequently
the chance that if the event be within our range of observation
A will occur, is the sum of the chances of these last four events
divided by the sum of the chances of the eight. This will be
equal to the given chance a.      Hence

equal    to    m.    Therefore

        developed   in Professor Boole's “Laws of Thought.”                             469
  Out of the events represented by V there are two,                             or   and v,
which imply that      A occurs but not B;                  consequently        the chance
of A occurring but not B, which is the required chance and may
be called u,   -              —s)
                    w(1-y)(1–s=%          .        From these five equations a,y,z,s
may be eliminated, and there remains an equation which gives u.
Or the values of w, y, z, and s may be found from the first four
equations, and thence the value of any function of them is known.
  This method of solution is almost identical with Professor
Boole's. The assumptions are the same in both, and they differ
only in my examining as above the import of each step taken
separately.   Representing the chances of the sixteen separate
compound events by the Greek letters prefixed to them, the
condition that the four events A, B, C, and S are mutually inde
pendent is equivalent to the following relations among 8, e, &c.

ment that the four simple events are independent is only a con
cise way of stating that these eleven equations are assumed to
hold good.    The assumption of these eleven is equivalent to
saying that 8, e, &c. are proportional to ayas, (1–2)/2s, &c.
   We have taken S to represent a simple event of which the
absolute chance is s, not to represent the concurrence of A, B
and C.; and when eight out of the sixteen compound events were
struck out as implying the concurrence of the events which we
know to be incompatible, we did not make S identical with A,
B, and C concurring, but we only say that the cases in which S
is accompanied with the absence of A, B and C, or of any of them,
are beyond our universe of observation.    The truth of the eleven
assumed equations is supposed throughout the problem; for if
at any point we were to discard or deny them,          conclusions       all
based    on
          them would fall     the ground.

his reasoning “does not require that the drawings of a white and
marble ball should be independent in virtue of the physical con
stitution of the balls; that the assumption of their independence
is indeed involved in the solution, but does not rest upon any
prior assumption as to the nature of the balls, and their relations
or freedom from relations, of form, colour, structure, &c.”

472         Mr. H. Wilbraham                      on the Theory        of Chances
  I will  first, however, examine what result can be arrived at
without making any assumption.      Let # be the chance of A1 and
A, both happening and being followed by E, #'that of their both
happening but not followed by E, m and m' the chances of A2
happening without An according as it is followed and not fol
lowed by E, & and º' those of A1 happening without A2 accord
ing as it is followed or not by E, and o' the chance of neither A,
nor A2 happening, and E of course not happening. The data of
the problem give the equations

                                                         m
is necessarily less than either cup, or caps. We can get no further
in the solution without further assumptions or data, having only
six equations from            which to eliminate seven unknown quantities.
Without such the   question is indeterminate.
   Now, to adopt   Professor Boole's assumptions, let a, y, z be
the chances of A1, A2, and E respectively, and s, t those of two
subsidiary events; w, y, s, t are assumed to be mutually inde
pendent events; consequently the chances of the sixteen mu
tually exclusive contingencies formed by combinations of these
four simple events will be

derived from the assumed independence of the simple events, are
always enough to determine the unknown quantities w, y, &c.,
and consequently to determine the chances of the compound
events represented above by the Greek letters 8, e, &c., there are
cases in which the required chance cannot be exactly expressed
in a series of the terms 8, e, &c. In these cases the problem
remains indeterminate, notwithstanding the assumptions.         Of
this nature are Examples 1, 4, 7 of Chapter XVIII.      In Ex. 1,
for instance, the absolute chances of the four events there repre
sented by uw, u(1—a), (1–u)w, (1–u)(1—a) may be found,
but the chance of the required event cannot be expressed in a
series of these chances, for it comprises               cases which come    all
under the event        ua,  but   only  part,    unknown part,    an   those                      of
which come under (1—u)(1–a).

486                  M. R. Kohlrausch's Theory of the
time, however, we know that at the moment of transferring the
electricity, the single jar will show a tension on the knob equal
to that of the battery itself; hence, also, that the indication of
the electrometer will be the same at this moment whether it be
connected with the battery or with the single jar, for the quan
tity of electricity which this instrument withdraws from the bat
tery always vanishes in comparison to the quantity in the latter.
     To return to the experiment, therefore, the following method
 was pursued.
     A second electrometer S' was placed near the battery, though
 at so great a distance from the first S that their needles did not
 irritate one another. Both were at first connected with the bat
 tery of five jars, and the latter charged.           By the help of an
 assistant both instruments were adjusted at the same moment,
 The electrometer S showed thereby a deflection of 18°49'.             The
 angle of deflection in the instrument S' was of no importance, it
 being intended to remain undisturbed, so as, on subsequently
 charging the battery, to indicate the moment when the electro
 meter S, if the latter were still connected with the former, would
 show an angle of deviation equal to 18°49', or in other words,
 when the charge in the battery amounted to Q= Vsin 18° 49'.

 the instrument S was on another day connected with the single
jar, and by means of the galvanic current deflected to 13°. This
 is the angle of deflection which would be produced if the charge
 Q= Msin 18°49' in           the battery spread itself over the single jar,
 and corresponds to the value of a in the equation
                     Q'-    A/sina-0-835 w/sin T8°49'.          -
     The battery was now charged again, the charge, which was at
 first too great, weakened by contact with a rod of dry fir-wood
until the electrometer S' showed almost the requisite deflection,
 and then the whole allowed to remain until, by loss of electricity,
 exactly the former charge reappeared.           At this moment, which
 was communicated by an assistant, the falling lever substituted
 the deflecting force of the electricity which was transferred to
 the electrometer S for that of the galvanic current.        The disturb
 ance of the needle was scarcely perceptible at first, but it soon
 moved quickly towards the meridian, so that a new and correct
 readjustment could only be made after 18 seconds*, when the
 angle of deflection was 9°50'.
     An assistant noted the time when the first charge was im
parted to the jar, as well as the moments whenever the sine
electrometer was readjusted, he also wrote down the correspond
    * In  this case the loss of so much time was due to bad manipulation.
In   other observations the readjustment was often completed in 5 seconds.

               Description         and use         of the Multiplier.
   A very  strong copper damper of an elliptical form was sur
rounded   by  1000 coils of good copper wire about 0.25 millim.
thick, covered with silk, and coated with collodion; the bed of
every coil was also well saturated with collodion,    The ends of
the wires were led to    clamping   screws,   which were cemented
with shell-lac into the same board that carried the multiplier.
In the elliptical opening of the damper, which was 8.5 centims.
long and 33 centims. high, a very strong cylindrical steel mag
net 6 centims. in length and 1 centim, in diameter was suspended
by means of a cocoon thread, stirrup and fork. The fork on
which the magnet hung carried a mirror, in order that observa
tions might be made in magnetometer fashion.        The whole was
well enclosed in a case provided  with  glass  windows, so that the
needle could not be disturbed by currents of air,    The damping
action was so strong, that oscillations of one degree elongation
were quieted in one minute.
   In using it for our purpose, one end of the multiplying coil
was connected by an intermediate wire with the outer coating of
the battery, which, besides this, was in good connexion with the
earth. The other end of the multiplying coil was connected
with the wire of a lever similar to that drawn in Plate VI. fig. 1 a,
though between them a glass tube filled with water, and not too
short, was interposed.    The discharge which deflected the mag
net was effected by        the   fall   of   the lever.      The velocity with which

 490              M.      Becquerel on a new Electro-magnetic                                 Engine
         Any electro-magnetic                     engine         must be composed essentially
 of             of electro-magnets of soft iron, of armatures also of
         a series
  soft iron, or arranged as electro-magnets, with various adjuncts,
 for the transmission of the electricity furnished by a battery or
  electro-magnetic machine, and of a commutator or breaker, for
 the purpose of producing a continuous circular or backward and
 forward motion.
     In the machines hitherto constructed, these various parts do
                          in all
 not combine          the conditions desirable for making use              all                              of
 the   power   set    action;     cheap, constant, and powerful source
                                                  a
     electricity does not yet exist; the soft iron, never being pure
 or ofperfectly malleable, retains for          longer       shorter period              or
 after each interruption          portion     a                       of a

                                             the current; the primitive

 current and the extra current         produce    contrary effects, causing
a   mutual   injury;   and the commutators often present   -     alterations
 when the circuit        closed.   is
     M. Jacobi, moreover, who has carefully studied the subject                                                  of
 the practical employment                electro-magnetic  of engines, has
arrived         this
                at   result,   that the mechanical effect           amount                         or

But this does not set the question            rest; for,          at
                                                             we succeed                  if                      in

main notations answering thereto (namely S, V, K, T, U), of the
calculus of quaternions, along with several general formulae result
ing, come thus to receive extended significations, as applying to
certain polynomial expressions which involve n vector-units, and
for which as many as #(n°--n) constants of multiplication are
still left arbitrary and disposable; yet it must be observed, that
we have not hitherto established any modular property of either
of the two functions, which have been called above the tensor and
versor of a polynome; nor any associative law, for the multipli
cation of three such polynomes together.

FoºI the specimen which afforded the minerals here described
     am indebted to the kindness of Professor Williamson of
Queen's College, Kingston, C.W., to whom it was given by
Dr. James Wilson of Perth. The locality assigned to it is the
second lot of the ninth concession of the township of Bathurst,
and it is probably derived from the crystalline limestone of that
region. It consists of a white, massive pyroxene or diopside,
with small crystals of silvery-gray mica, prisms of bluish-green
apatite, portions of copper pyrites, and of a milk-white cleavable
                                                                                       It its

  collection of the Canadian Institute, the cleavage prism is appa
  rently right rhomboidal; the inclination of M: T=110° to 115°.
  The cleavages with M and P are perfect, and easily obtained,
  giving to the mass a fibrous aspect; with T the cleavage is im
  perfect. Hardness, 3:5; density, 2.765 to 2776. Lustre vitreous,
  shining, occasionally pearly on the cleavage surfaces.       Colour,
 rose-red to  peach-blossom  red;  subtranslucent;    fracture uneven.
     Before the blowpipe it becomes white and opake from the loss
..of water, and fuses easily with intumescence into a white enamel.
 When pulverized and boiled with hydrochloric acid, it is partly
 decomposed with separation of pulverulent silica. A qualitative
 analysis showed the presence of silica, lime, magnesia and
 alumina, with a little iron and traces of manganese, besides a
 large quantity of potash.       The results of three quantitative
 analyses are subjoined; the earthy ingredients were determined
 by fusion with carbonate of soda; the alkalies in the first ana
 lysis were separated by a method for which I am indebted to
 Dr. A. A. Hayes of Boston.       It consists in fusing the pulverized
 mineral for half an hour with one part of pure lime and four
 parts of chloride of calcium in a platinum crucible; the fusion
 was effected over a spirit-lamp. When cold, the mass was di
gested with water, and the solution then contained    the alkalies                          all
as chlorides, mixed with chloride     calcium.  The lime-salt was

separated      by
              sublimation from the evaporated residue, leaving
the alkaline chlorides      state     purity.

it follows that as much heat must flow out from the interior
across the surface, as flows into the interior from the sources of
heat at the surface. Hence the total flux of heat from the original
surface to an adjacent isothermal surface in the interior is nothing.
Hence also the flux of heat from this latter surface to an adja
cent isothermal surface in      interior must      nothing; and

       actual sources of heat are arranged, whether over an isothermal
       surface or not; and the temperature produced in an external
       point by the former sources is the same as that produced by the
       latter. Also the total flux of heat across the isothermal surface,
       whose temperature is v, is equal to the total flux of heat from
       the actual sources.   From this, and from what has been proved
       above, it follows that if a surface be described round a conduct

   The first step is to find pi, which is proportional to the quan
tity of matter at any point in the surface of an ellipsoid, when
the matter is so distributed that the attraction on a point within
the ellipsoid is nothing.      Now the attraction of a shell, bounded
by two concentric similar ellipsoids, on a point within it is no
thing if the shell be infinitely thin; and            attraction will      its                                       be

   In the first place, Trigonocarpon is so abundant throughout the
coal-measures, that in certain localities some species may be pro
cured by the bushel; nor is there any part of the formation in which
they do not occur, except the underclays and limestone.               The sand
stone, ironstones, shales and coal itself, all contain them.
   Secondly. The symmetry in form and size which many of them
display, the regularity of the sculpturing on their surfaces, and
various other points, suggested their belonging to a class of highly
organized vegetables.
   Thirdly. The fact of our being wholly unacquainted with the
organs of fructification belonging to the exogenous vegetation, which
also abounds in the coal formation, coupled with the assumed highly
organized nature of Trigonocarpon, favoured the assumption that
these might throw light upon one another, and seemed to afford a
legitimate basis upon which to proceed, should I ever procure speci
mens of Trigonocarpon displaying structure, which I had long hoped
to do.
   It  is,however, only since my return from India that have been                                        so

    The number, structure and superposition of these, are strongly
 indicative of the Trigonocarpons having belonged to that large sec
 tion of existing coniferous plants, which bear fleshy, solitary fruits,
 and not cones; and they so strongly resemble the various parts of the
 fruit of the Chinese genus Salisburia, that, in the present state of our
knowledge, it appears legitimate to assume their relationship to                                                             it.

in the form of a colourless liquid, boiling at about 121°C., and having
an odour greatly resembling sulphuretted acetic acid. On mixing
with water it falls to the bottom, without, at first, suffering any

   The following papers were read:—
    1. “On the Changes produced in the Blood by the administration
of Cod-liver Oil and Cocoa-nut Oil.” By Theophilus Thompson,
M.D., F.R.S.
   The author has found that during the administration of cod-liver
oil to phthisical patients their blood grew richer in red corpuscles,
and he refers to a previous observation of Dr. Franz Simon to the
same effect. The use of almond-oil and of olive-oil was not fol
lowed by any remedial effect, but from cocoa-nut oil results were
obtained almost as decided as from the oil of the liver of the Cod,
and the author believes it may turn out to be a useful substitute. The
oil employed was a pure cocoa oleine, obtained by pressure from
crude cocoa-nut oil, as expressed in Ceylon and the Malabar coast
from the Copperah or dried cocoa-nut kernel, and refined by being
treated with an alkali and then repeatedly washed with distilled
water.     It burns with a faint blue flame, showing a comparatively
small proportion of carbon, and is undrying.
    The analysis of the blood was conducted by Mr. Dugald Camp
bell.    The whole quantity abstracted having been weighed, the
coagulum was drained on bibulous paper for four or five hours,
weighed and divided into two portions.              One portion was weighed
and then dried in a water-oven, to determine the water.               The other
was macerated in cold water until it became colourless, then mode
 rately dried and digested with aether and alcohol to remove fat, and
finally dried completely and weighed as fibrine. From the respective
 weights of the fibrine and the dry clot that of the corpuscles was cal
 culated. The following were the results observed in seven different
 individuals affected with phthisis in different stages of advance
 ment:—
                                                Red corpuscles.     Fibrine.

     2. “On    a Property of Numbers.”            By the Rev. James Booth,
  LL.D., F.R.S. &c.
  - I know not whether the following property of numbers has been
  made public.
     A number of six places, consisting of a repetition of a period of

 522                            Royal Society.
 any three figures, is divisible by the prime numbers 7, 11 and 13.
 Thus 376376, 459459, 30.1301 are so divisible.
     A number N of six places may be thus written:—
           N=100.000     a + 10.000 b + 1000   c-- 100 d-H 10 e-H f,
 which, when divided by 7, will give       a quotient   q and a remainder
 5a-H4b-H 6c-i-2d-H 3e-Hf.
     Now if d-a, e=b, f=c, this remainder may be written 7(a+b+c),
 which is divisible by 7, whatever be the values of a, b, c.
     In like manner if a number of six places be divided by 13, the
 remainder will be
    4a–H3b-i-12c-H 9d-H 10e-Hºf; and, as before, if d-a, e=b, f=c,
 the remainder may be written 13(a+b+c), which is divisible by 13,
whatever be the value of a, b and c.
     In the same way it may be shown that a number of this kind is
 divisible by 11.
    When the first figure of the period is 0, and the second any what
ever i and j, the number is 0ij0ij=ij0ij; or any number of five places,
 the first two and the last two being the same, while the middle place
is 0, is divisible by 7, 11 and 13. Thus 34034, 14014 are so
 divisible.
    When the first two places are 0, the number may be written
00:00i=iO0i, or any number of four places, the first and last figures
being the same, while the two middle places are 0, is divisible by
 7, 11 and 13.      Thus 5005, 8008 are so divisible.
    Like   properties may be found for 17, 19, 23, but the periods are
 longer.     The  prime   divisor being 2n + 1, it is manifest the number
 of  places  in the period  cannot exceed, however it may fall short of n.
    Thus when the divisor is 17, the number of places in the period is
eight.
    3. “On Fessel's Gyroscope.”         By C. Wheatstone, Esq., F.R.S.
     Since the announcement of M. Foucault's beautiful experiment
which has afforded us a new mechanical proof of the rotation of the
 earth on its axis, the phaenomena of rotary motion have received re
 newed attention, and many ingenious instruments have been con
 trived to exhibit and to explain them.      One of the most instructive
 of these is the Gyroscope invented by M. Fessel of Cologne, de
 scribed in its earlier form in Poggendorff’s Annalen for September
 1853, and which, with some improvements by Prof. Plücker and
some further modifications suggested by myself, I take the present
opportunity of bringing before the Royal Society.
    It is thus constructed: a beam is capable of moving freely round
a horizontal axis which is itself moveable round a vertical axis, so
that the beam may move in any direction round a fixed point; at
one end of the beam is fixed a horizontal ring which carries a heavy
disc, the axis of rotation of which is in a line with the beam; at the
opposite extremity is a shifting weight by means of which the equi
librium of the beam may be established or disturbed at pleasure.
    If the beam be brought into equilibrium, and the disc be rapidly
rotated, by means of a thread unrolled from its axis, it will be seen

                                       Royal Society.                                         523
that the   beam      has no tendency to displace itself in any direction.
                                        The Gyroscope.
Not so, however, if the equilibrium be in any way disturbed; on
moving the weight towards the centre of the beam, thus causing
the disc to preponderate, it will be observed that if the disc ro
tates from right to left the beam will move round the vertical
axis also from right to left; and if the motion of the disc be
reversed the rotation of the beam will be reversed also.              On
causing the equipoise to preponderate contrary effects will take
place. The velocity of the rotation of the beam round the ver
tical axis increases in proportion to the disturbance of the equili
brium.    It will also be observed that, notwithstanding the increased
or diminished action of gravity on the disc,             axis   rotationits        of
always preserves the same inclination                      to
                                              the vertical axis   which                 at
it has been originally placed. The effect produced              seeming       is   a
paradox.    When the equilibrium         disturbed while the disc
                                                      is                                     is   at
rest, the beam being placed       any other position than the vertical,

                        turn  to round it  horizontal axis; but when the
          in                              gravity of a
                                                   disappears, and there

substituted for       continued rotation round
                     it   a                           vertical axis, that is,
                                                                   a

and the liquid. The volume of the gas disengaged by zinc under
goes no change in the course of several days; the volume of the gas
produced by the pile diminishes rapidly.     The following are the
numbers furnished by the experiment:—
         4h 20m             4h 25m           4h 40m               5h 5m           5h 55m           12h

The action was afterwards prolonged indefinitely, but the remainder
of the gas was no longer absorbable; the gas is consequently com
posed  of an absorbable portion, and of a portion which behaves like
ordinary hydrogen. The absorbable portion sometimes amounted to
three-fourths of the total volume, but most frequently it was less
than half; occasionally no absorption took place.
   To ascertain the relation existing between the formation of this
absorbable gas and the current, I measured the intensity (of the
latter) with a tangent compass, and reduced the results to the
unities of time and intensity.      ascertained that the volume of hy
                                                      I
drogen may attain a maximum or remain at a lower value; in the
former case it was not absorbable, in the latter, absorption took
place. We may say, therefore, that in order to disengage a volume
of absorbable gas, we must employ more electricity than in the pro
duction of a similar volume of ordinary gas.
   These facts may be interpreted in two ways; we may suppose
that the hydrogen disengaged by the pile is produced in a peculiar
molecular condition whilst taking the gaseous form under the influ
ence of the electric current, nearly as in the case of the oxygen
which is electrified and modified at the positive pole. This con
clusion is the only possible one if the gases disengaged be chemi
cally pure.
   But       if,
           contrary   the generally received opinion, the gas collected

     2. The reciprocal action of two homogeneous bodies is of the
Same nature.
   3. When an atom of A combines with several atoms of B, the
latter arrange themselves in such a manner that the reciprocal action
becomes a minimum.
   When in a combination of two heterogeneous bodies the recipro
cal action is represented by 2, and the reciprocal action of the homo
geneous atoms by 3, taking n and m to signify the coefficients de
rived from the number of atoms B, r for the distance, and f(w) for
some function of heat, &c., we arrive at the following equation                                             :-

   As regards heat, I find a posteriori, that r is equal to the product
of the mass of the combination and the specific heat; f(w) is equal
to the elevation of temperature. As to light, I have abstained from
determining f(w), because the fundamental experiments are still
wanting.
