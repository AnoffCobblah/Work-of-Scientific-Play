   Eaperiments with nitric acid.—The experiments with nitric
acid were carried on in precisely the same manner as those
already described.     The acid employed had the specific
gravity 1.325.   By combination with potash the quantity of
heat evolved from an atom of this nitric acid was found to be
expressed by the numbers 419-5 and 399-4, mean 409:45.
 With soda, the numbers 410.9 and 4092 were obtained
(mean 410.05).    With ammonia, the experiments being car
ried on in the calorimeter, the results were 398-5, 404:5, and
400-8, the mean being 404:3. When combining with dry
lime an atom of nitric acid was found to evolve heat, in pro
portions expressed for five trials, by the numbers 459-3, 459.3,
450.6, 435-6, and 451-7, the mean being 451-3.
   The composition of the nitric acid used being expressed by
the formula NO,--8 HO, the general results obtained by the
combination of the bases and acids experimented on by M.
Hess may be arranged as in the following table, in which the
numbers exhibit the proportional quantities of heat, expressed
by each base with an atom of the acid at the head of each
column.

      Ithough the mean numbers are here given without any
 correction, it is yet evident that the three first in each column
are the same, differing only by quantities which fall within
 the limits of unavoidable experimental error.

                                              much higher, but                           it   is

    Before passing to describe the other researches of M. Hess,
it is proper to observe here, that the law just now announced
is at variance with that which Dr. Andrews has deduced from
his experiments, an abstract of which has been given in the
Phil. Mag., S.     vol. xix.3.,                  p.
                               183. Dr. Andrews considers that
all  acids evolve, when combining with the same base, the same
quantity     heat, but that different bases evolve different quan
               of
tities    of
          heat. For sake        comparison, we here present

     The difference here evidently results                M. Hess) from     (says
there having been more water in combination before the mix

the acid, but only the difference between the heat lost                 se                                by
paration from water, and gained                            by

This difference          with the same acid

tricity manifested in an insulated boiler, during the emission
of steam, could not be attributed to the accompanying eva
poration of the water; and being wholly unable to conceive
any other cause, operating in the boiler, to which the effect
could with any probability be ascribed, I became persuaded
that the source of the electricity could only be situated at
the discharging orifice, or in the channel through which the
steam was conveyed to           Such        my previous experiments

 the cock, the boiler became negatively electrified in the usual

    It was obvious, therefore, that the excitation took place at
 the cock, where, by reason of the narrowness of the channel,

      Ithen removed the second glass tube, and discharged the
 steam direct from the cock, which continued to be negatively
 electrified precisely the same as before.

 rupture the tube which passed                          and several an it,

  The boiler which I am now using is made of wrought iron,
and the electricity of the steam discharged from it has been
invariably               except in the instance I am about to
                     positive,
mention. Potash and soda, which in the gun-metal generator
tended so strongly to the increase of positive electricity in the
steam-cloud, appear to have little influence when introduced
into the iron boiler; but I have not yet tried, in the iron boiler,
the acids and other things which, in the gun-metal generator,
caused the steam to give negative electricity.
   In consequence, however, of the influence which the state
of the inner surface of the generator had been proved to ex
ert upon the electricity of the steam, I was induced to try
whether the steam from the iron boiler could not be caused
to evolve negative, instead of positive electricity, by
brought into contact with a considerable surface of polished                                    .#

                                  to

        I                                                     brass                         a

tricity       of

                                                      to
exceedingly feeble.        then moistened the inside

        That
not universally interesting, I will conclude with stating, that
the real difficulty in the way of a molecular theory is our
want of power to sum expressions in Finite Differences.        To
convert them into definite integrals is to omit that part of their
value which is the most important.          Should any of your
readers desire to examine the subject, I would recommend
them to consult, in addition to M. Mossotti's papers in the
Scientific Memoirs, and my memoir in the Transactions of

 I  have not seen any plates thus prepared, but the few ex
  periments which I have made with nitric acid, have given
  me a burred and imperfect outline; and I have experienced
 extreme difficulty of manipulation from the circumstance of
 the acid never attacking the plate uniformly and simulta
 neously. My object, however, in this communication, is not to
 find fault with a process which I have never perhaps fairly
 tried or seen tried by experienced hands, and the inventor of

20       Professor Grove on a Voltaic Process           for Etching
during which the process should be continued;                    and fifthly,
the solution to be employed.
     1st. With regard to the first element, or quantity, many
previous experiments had convinced me, that, to give the
maximum and most uniform quantitative* action of any vol
taic combination, the electrodes should be of the same size as
the generating plates; in other words, that the sectional area
of the                  should be the same throughout the whole
voltaic circuit.      It seems strange that this point should have
 been so generally overlooked as it has been : an electrician
 would never form a battery, one pair of plates of which were
 smaller than the rest; and yet the electrodes, which offering
 of themselves a resistance to the current, from the inoxidabi
 lity of the anode, are, d fortiori, a restriction when of small
 size, have generally been formed indefinitely smaller than the
 generating plates; I therefore, without further experiment,
 applied this principle to the process about to be detailed.
     2nd. The intensity of the voltaic current.— Here it ap
 peared to me, that, as in the electrotype, where the visible
 action is at the cathode, a certain degree of intensity throws
 down metal as a crystal, an increased intensity as a metallic
 plate, and a further intensity as a pulverulent mass; that de
 gree of intensity which would show on the negative deposit
 the finest impressions from the cathode, would also produce
 on the anode the most delicate excavations, and consequently,
 an intensity which would just fall short of the point of evolving
  oxygen from the plate to be etched, would be the most likely
  to succeed; this point was not, however, adopted without
  careful experiment, the more so, as in one instance Mr. Gas
  siot succeeded in procuring a very fair etching with a series
  of ten pairs of the nitric acid battery; however, the results
  of repeated experiments, in which the intensity has been va
  ried from a series of sixteen pairs to one of the nitric acid
  battery, were strongly in favour of the above idea, and con
  sequently, went to prove that one pair gives the most efficient
  degree of intensity for the purpose required.
      3rd. The distance, between the plates.—As it was proved
  by De la Rive, that in an electrolytic solution, when the elec
  trodes are at a distance, the action extends a little beyond the
                                                       ...
  parallel lines which would join the bounds of the electrodes,
  and thus, that the current as it were diverges and converges,
  it appeared advisable to approximate the                          as nearly
       I
     * say quantitative action; for, where great intensity is required, as in
  decomposing alkalis, &c., it may be advisable to narrow the electrodes, so
  as to present a smaller surface for the reaction of the liberated elements.

as possible,     so as to produce uniformity of action over the
 whole    plate.   Provided a solution be used which does not
 evolve gas at the cathode,       Iam inclined to think that the
 plates may be with advantage indefinitely approximated; but as
                                          I
 this was not the case with the solution selected for the greater
 number of experiments, 0:2 of an inch was fixed on as the
 distance, in order that the gas evolved from the cathode should
 not adhere to the anode, and thus interfere with the action.
    4th. Time of continuing the operation.—This was a matter
 only to be decided by experiment, and must vary for the vol
 taic combination and solution employed.        With a single pair
 of the nitric acid battery, from twenty-five to thirty seconds
 was, after a great number of experiments, fixed on as the
 proper time; and as the plate may at any period be removed
 from the solution and examined, the first experiment should
 never exceed twenty-five seconds, when, if not complete, the
 plate may be again subjected to electrolysis.
     5th. The solution to be employed.—Here a vast field was
 open, and still is open to future experimentalists.      Admitting
 the usual    explanation  of the  Daguerreotype,   which supposes
 the light parts to be mercury, and the dark silver, the object
 was to procure a solution which would attack one of these,
 and leave the other untouched.          If one could be found to
 attack the silver and not the mercury, so much the better; as
 this would give a positive engraving, or one with the lights
 and shadows, as in nature; while the converse would give a
 negative one. Unfortunately, silver and mercury are nearly
 allied in their electrical relations. I made several experiments
 with pure silver and mercury, used as the anode of a voltaic
 combination; but found, that any solution which would act
 on one, acted also on the other.       All then that could be ex
pected, was a difference of action.       With the Daguerreotype
plates I   have used the following:—
    Dilute sulphuric acid, dilute hydrochloric acid, solution of
sulphate of copper, of potash, and of acetate of lead. . The
object of using acetate of lead, was the following:—With this
solution, peroxide of lead is precipitated upon the anode;
and, this substance being insoluble in nitric acid, it was hoped
that the pure silver parts of the plate, being more closely      in
vested with a stratum of peroxide than the mercurialized por
tions, these latter would, when immersed in this menstruum,
be attacked, and thus furnish a negative etching.        I   was also
not   altogether   without hopes  of some curious  effects, from the
colour of the thin films thus thrown down; here, however,          I
was disappointed: the colours succeeded each other much as
in the steel plate used     for
                            the metallochrome; but with          in

of dilution, the plates were unequally attacked, and the etching
burred and imperfect.              Of the other solutions, hydrochloric
acid    was,    after   many   experiments,     fixed on as decidedly the
best:     indeed,     this                  from the strong affinity of
 chlorine for silver.
     I will now describe the manipulation which has been em
 ployed by Mr. Gassiot and myself, in the laboratory of the
 London Institution, with very uniform success. A wooden
 frame is prepared, having two grooves at 0:2 of an inch                                       di
 stance, into which can be slid the plate to be etched, and a
j.
 plate of platinum of the same size. To ensure a ready and
 equable evolution of hydrogen, this latter is platinized after
        Smee's method; for, if the hydrogen adhere to any part
 of the cathode, the opposite portions of the anode are pro
 portionably less acted on. The back and edges of the Da
 guerreotype are varnished with a solution of shell-lac, which
 is scraped off one edge to admit of metallic connexion being
 established. The wooden frame with                               its

the satin stock very accurate. The microscopic details alone
appear incapable of transference to paper, but these, as stated

ing, that the two apparatus described           this partin  your
 Correspondents’ letter, viz.            an
                                  iron tube closed with       iron
plug, and      gun-barrel protected
                  a                                 by
                                          luting and well secured
at  the orifice, were the very instruments that foiled me last
 November and December. There must                        be
                                                 free enough exit
for nitrogen,” &c. Now we may observe, that the iron tube
 with     an
         iron plug was the instrument chiefly employed                      by   us
for the purpose        of
                     heating ferrocyanide      potassium and car

                                           employ this instrument

          on the alleged Conversion  of Carbon into Silicon.    25
on one occasion only, but at least half-a-dozen times. The    plug
only loosely went into the orifice, and the luting was a       thin
layer of china clay, more for the purpose of preventing dirt,
&c. getting into the tube than for anything else; it appears,
therefore, to us out of the question to talk about there not
being free enough exit for nitrogen; besides, we find in the
original memoir, p. 231 of the Transactions, the following state
ment:—“A little crucible of Berlin porcelain was filled with
paracyanogen, and after the lid had been tightly luted on, it
 was imbedded in stucco paste within a larger crucible.        The
 gypsum having set and dried, the apparatus was kept at a
 white heat for an hour and a half; the residue of this process
 resembled the last, only that it was denser and darker.” Now
 in this experiment Dr. Brown asserts, that the transformation
 was effected; but will any candid observer maintain, that
 greater opportunity for free erit of nitrogen obtained in
 this experiment than in our experiments with the iron tube
 and plug 2 Again, at p. 286 of the Edinburgh Transac
 tions, we are informed that a siliciuret of copper was obtained
 when bicyanide of mercury was heated for more than an
  hour to whiteness in a double copper tube: if reference be made
  to p. 174 of the Transactions, a description of this double
 copper tube will be found, and it is there stated that the open
  ends of these tubes terminate, the one in a male screw, the
  other in a female screw: and the section in which this tubular
  apparatus is described closes with the following remark, of
  considerable importance, we imagine, as regards the subject
  immediately under discussion:—“The latter,” speaking of one
  of the tubes, “thrice as long as the former, is charged, and
  the two are firmly screwed together, so as to give very great
  but not fired pressure, for the screws always permit gaseous pass
  age    in such circumstances.”
      We     must therefore be allowed to think, that the objection
   raised   by  Dr. Brown to our employment of an iron tube and
   plug, and gun-barrel, is answered by himself, seeing that in
   his own recorded experiments the alleged transformation of
   carbon into silicon was brought about in tubes, and in a cru
   cible so contrived, that no greater, and we very much doubt
   if the same amount of freedom for gaseous passage, was allowed
   as in the instruments employed by us.
       It is therefore incumbent upon Dr. Brown to look for other
   reasons to account for our failure: he will not say we did not
   hit upon the right temperature, for in certain experiments the
   temperature at which we failed was the same as that at which
   he succeeded. Will Dr. Brown still continue to maintain that
   the alleged transformation, when the materials operated upon

   26              Mr. Smith       and   Dr. Brett's Additional Remarks
   are ferrocyanide of potassium and carbonate of potash, and
   the instrument an iron tube and plug, is so difficult of per
   formance that a person may work for six weeks in continual
  failure? if so, we are totally unable to reconcile such an opi
  nion with one or two statements, in very decided language, to
  be met with near the close of the original memoir, in p. 243
  of the Transactions: the author there speaks of the production
  of crystallized siliciuret of iron from the action of heat upon a
  mixture of ferrocyanide of potassium and cyanide of potassium.
  “In one operation,” says he,                “I
                                     procured half an ounce of these
  little eight-sided  crystals, and have worked with glass, porce
  lain, black-lead, iron and platinum vessels with equal success.”
  He continues, “This is a difficult process, however, and one
  must be content to make several trials before a fine product
  be obtained; but although it is not easy to produce a perfect
  specimen, it is the simplest thing in the world to satisfy oneself
  of the change which is effected; nay, it is impossible to make
  cyanide of potassium by the common process without performing
  this transformation.”       And further on we have the following
  somewhat remarkable statement:-‘‘I have at length come to
  the conclusion, that the production of silicon from paracyano
 gen has been performed by every one who has decomposed the
Jerrocyanide of potassium by heat, in order to procure the cy
 anide of the same metal.”            How comes                     it,
                                                          we would ask,                          if

p.     244        of   the Transactions       we   find the following statement:

         on the alleged Conversion                 of Carbon into Silicon.                    27
“3-04 grs. of silicic acid were extracted from 5 grs. of para
cyanide of iron.” The term extraction here, we presume,
has reference to the conversion of the carbon of the ferru
ginous compound into silicon, and subsequently into silicic
acid by the action of carbonate of potash. Dr. Brown states, at
p. 240 of the Transactions, “That the substance in question,
viz. paracyanide of iron, contains nitrogen, carbon and iron,
in the ratios of 1, 2 and 1.” We suppose these numbers re
present the atoms of the respective substances; 5 grs. of para
cyanide of iron would therefore contain 1-111 of carbon, for
54: 12:: 5: 1-111. Now taking the atom of silicon at one
third of Berzelius's atom, in order to make silicic acid an
equi-atomic compound of silicon and oxygen, we shall have
22*22 + 3 = 7-406, and 7.406 : 15-406 :: 1-111 : 2-3; so
that    all
          the silica which could have been procured           the                       by
transformation             of
                    the whole      the carbonof    grs.     para    in   5         of
cyanide      iron, would have amounted
              of                              2-3 grs. instead to                             of
3-04  grs.,        as         original memoir. We       not know              do

whether the excess           silica           in

transformative force exercised         upon  iron       nitrogen,  or both;         or
but we cannot conceive that the carbon could have furnished
it;     so, Dr. Brown has even surpassed the transformative
       if
power        of
            nature.         another experiment, however,

the calculated proportions, supposing the alleged conversion
to  have been full and perfect. Thus                   stated

                    “sufficient evidence”        show that the pre
 liminary process was rightly performed; yet the sole difference
  inthis process from those described         him, was the substitu            by

  30      Mr.   Smith and Dr. Brett's Additional Remarks
  tion of a well-luted and covered Berlin crucible, inclosed in
  another covered and luted crucible, for the glass, iron and
  copper tubes employed by him, a variation surely not of a
  nature to affect the product: then comes the remark, “that
  this process is so difficult of performance,” which, as we have
  before shown, was not even distantly alluded to in the original
  memoirs, and which we have therefore a right to consider an
 er post facto objection, and as such inadmissible by us: this is
 followed by the volunteer of the opinion, that     “I  do not think
 Mr. Smith employed the same material as        I   used in this ex
 periment.”     Perhaps not, but at any rate it was a substance
 prepared, as before noticed, with a slight, and, apparently to
 us, most trivial variation of apparatus, in the mode prescribed
 by Dr. Brown, and possessing the properties assigned by
 him to paracyanogen.
     To gratify Dr. Brown, and “to make assurance doubly sure,”
 we prepared some paracyanogen by inclosing bicyanide of
 mercury in a tube of German glass, drawing it out to a ca
 pillary, placing this in an iron tube with a plug, and exposing
 the apparatus to a heat visible only in the dark, for a consi
 derable time over a coal fire.        Dr. Brown directs a “coke
fire” to be employed; we trust this accidental departure from
 “the very letter of the text” will not entirely vitiate the result
and “render the experiment of no value,” for we did not no
tice it until the experiment was terminated: the paracyanogen
thus obtained resembled that described by Dr. Brown as em
ployed by him, and possessed the acknowledged properties of
paracyanogen; 5 grs. of it mixed with 20 grs. of carbonate
of potash and ignited, in a closed platinum crucible placed in
an exterior covered and luted one, and        all   the precautions
taken directed   to in 236    ofthe Transactions,at   ayellow heat,

previously employed, and       this case also

   The objections raised against our experiments          on
                                                         the          al
leged formation   ofmetallic  siliciurets, are the paracyanogen
employed, and that they “were not performed according                 to
my direction.”. The first has already been disposed             of,
                                                              the
second  is  wholly uncalled for the difference being, that we

           on the alleged Conversion   of Carbon into Silicon.   31
substituted a tube made by rolling up platinum foil for the
crucibles or shreds of platinum foil mentioned in pp. 237-8
of the Transactions; and that a copper tube and paracyanogen,
and copper in a minute state of division and paracyanogen
were employed, instead of “a copper tube packed with             bi
cyanide of mercury,” which salt, according to Dr. Brown's
own showing, must be converted into mercury and paracyano
gen before any reaction could take place between the latter
substance and the copper; so that this objection must also fall
to the ground, unless this discoverer chooses to contend that
our non-success was owing to our employing a tube made
by rolling up thin sheet copper, whilst he used a cast copper
One.
  In  the “Observations,” Dr. Brown remarks, “Even so late
as last November and December I tried to effect the alleged
transformation before a celebrated physician and chemist six
weeks in vain; but at last succeeded, or, as I must now say,
appeared to succeed.” As we before observed, we do not
find in the original memoir a single recorded case of failure, or
even a distant hint of the slightest difficulty being experienced
in effecting the alleged transformation, which we are now        in
formed was tried in vain for six weeks before a celebrated
physician and chemist: may we in our turn be allowed to ex
press our “respectful conviction” that such repeated unsuc
cessful attempts, say an average of one experiment per diem,
should have rendered both the experimenter and the cele
brated physician and chemist extremely cautious in recogni
zing that experiment, attended with success, as the true and
proper result; and might have recalled to their recollec
tion the unfortunate result of the laborious experiments,
sometimes accompanied with apparent successful results, re
specting the identity of palladium and an amalgam of mercury
and platina? This unsuccessful attempt to effect the alleged
conversion is not only not alluded to in the original papers, but
 the very reverse obtains; there “simplicity,” “freedom from
 any intelligible source of fallacy,” “infallible and easy of ex
 ecution,” are the terms applied to the various experiments.
 As to the six weeks' trial, we scarce know which to sympathize
 with most, the experimenter doomed for that period to con
stant failure and repeated disappointment, or the celebrated
personage, whose patience, which is evidently great, was put
 to   SO   Severe a test.

                           that we conceive         necessary

 Dr. Brown, we feel that truth is most likely to be arrived at
 by calmness in discussion.       Time, which always does so much
 both in  fixing  scientific facts on a firm and solid basis, as well
 as in dissipating errors which will inevitably creep into ex
 perimental research, will, it is hoped, ere long settle this at
 present, perhaps, quaestio verata.                        If
                                                Dr. Brown be right,

 must suffer a complete change in respect to          we understand   all

            ACKENRODER  has attempted to show that there is
      only one hydrate of citric acid, the formula of which is
C*H" O'", and which is the common acid, whose crystals
have been measured by Brooke.       Marchand has made some
experiments on this subject; he found that the common acid
of commerce contains 34:45 per cent. carbon, and 4.86 per
cent. hydrogen. This acid was then crystallized at a tem
perature not exceeding 60°C. The crystals had the same
form as described by Brooke, and, after having been pressed
and dried between bibulous paper, were found to contain 34.72
per cent. carbon, and 4.69 hydrogen.         The formula for this
acid is exactly                 C*H*
                            O". When dried in vacuo over sul
phuric acid the crystals lose two atoms, or 8.5 per cent. of
water, which is exactly the quantity that it loses when heated,
according to Berzelius; the acid so obtained agrees with
Wackenroder's formula, viz. Cº H!" O'".
      If
      a concentrated solution of citric acid be evaporated at a
temperature of 100° C. until a crystalline pellicle is formed
on the surface and then allowed to cool, the first crop of cry
stals consists of small, scarcely determinable individuals, which,
according to Gustav Rose, are quite different in form from
those described by Brooke. Afterwards the first compound
crystallizes out of the mother liquor.     This hydrate has the
formula C*                 H"

    Laurent has prepared        anew volatile crystallizable body
 from coal-tar, whose formula is Cº. HºO + 2 aq, and which
 he names hydrate of phenyl.       With potassium it gives a cry
stalline  compound,   Cº H” O + KO, and combines directly
with baryta without giving off water. With sulphuric acid
it gives the phenosulphuric acid, the baryta salt of which is
C* H10O, H° O, SO3 + Ba O, SO3. This salt, when distil
led, gives hydrate of phenyl.      The phenosulphate of ammo
nia, when treated with nitric acid, yields sulphuric acid, water
ammonia and picrinnitric acid. Chlorine gives with hydrate of
phenyl the well-known chlorophenesic acid, C*H" Cl* O+aq,
and afterwards the chlorophenisic acid, Cº Hº C1 O + aq.
With bromine an analogous bromophenisic acid is obtained.
Nitric acid gives at first nitrophenesic (or pheneso-nitric) acid,
which is yellow, crystallizable, forms red and yellow salts, and
has the formula C*H*N*O", 3 aq; and then it produces                    ni
trophenisic (phenisonitric) acid, by which name the author
now represents picrinnitric acid, = C* H* Nº O'”, aq.
When phenesonitric acid is treated with bromine a yellow
crystalline acid is obtained, which forms beautiful salts. For
mula C*H* Br” Nº O”, aq, and which is converted by the
continued action of nitric acid into picrinnitric acid.        By
treating chlorophenisic acid with nitric acid, chloride of phenyl
is obtained in golden yellow scales, C*H* Cl*O; the bromide
cannot be obtained in this manner.                 If
                                               the chlorophenisic
acid is  prepared  by acting  on coal-tar with chlorine, chloride
of albin is formed at the same time; it is a volatile body, cry
stallizes in white needles, is not altered by potash.    Formula
C*H*       Clº.  Phenesonitric,  picrinnitric, chlorophenisic and
bromophenisic acids are isomorphous, and moreover the pot

   1. Having lately made some interesting observations upon
the magnetic influence of the lunar spectrum, which may tend
to the establishment of a new theory of magnetism, I venture
to submit them to the many natural philosophers who read
the Philosophical Magazine, in the hope that they may lead
to other inquiries upon the same subject.
   2. The hypothesis of Dr. Morichini, that the blue and vio
let  rays     the solar spectrum were capable
                of                                     imparting mag       of
netic    qualities            to

fluence, has been contested                            by
                                         several practical physicists,
who have failed           obtaining the desired result when they
                               in
adopted his method                     of
                              making the experiment.          Being de

                         of                     developed       polarity
                                                                   it                    a

                                                              to      the                          of
sun,       by
           arranging itself      the plane  in                   of
                                               the magnetic meridian
with its thinnest part        point towards the north, and
                                       or                            head                     its
or  thickest  part  towards the south.
      3.The experiment was frequently repeated with different
needles, and the result was always the same, unless the head
of   the needle was more than usually thin; the inference be
 ing, that the polarity                    of
                                the needle was governed               law                     bya
 which made the end        having   the least bulk      north  pole.                                    It
                                                                           of of a
is  probable that Morichini was not aware              the fact, that                                    a
 polarity existed          needle independently
                              in   a                     any such mag
  netizing influence, and that         supposed    heordinary polarityit
 to  have been produced                     by
                                  his exposing       the refracted rays
                                                                      to its
of the sun.
      4.     But such         an
                      exposure occasioned     important change          an
in     magnetic properties; for having removed
       its                                             from the                      it
surface           of
             the water, and placed             table    the blue it   on   a             in
rays, where     remained for about five
                       it                 minutes,   found that                      I
when      was again made
             it                float upon the water,
                                             to         assumed                      it
a  polarity opposite       that above mentioned, with
                                    to                      head                              its
instead         of
                point  its
                       directed towards the north  magnetic pole
of the earth.
      5.
      This experiment, repeated                             in various ways with different
 needles, always offered the same                             result:-1. The point was

            On the Magnetic Influence of the Lunar Spectrum.                                                   41
placed in the blue rays; the head in the red rays. 2. The
point was placed in the extreme violet rays; the head in the
dark space beyond the violet rays. 3. The needle was placed
longitudinally in the blue or violet rays. 4. It was also placed
longitudinally in the red rays. The change however was
effected more rapidly when the influence of the blue or violet
rays acted on the needle, than when it was exposed to the
 red rays, but in            cases all    head pointedits        the north,       to                           al
though       ithad previously pointed           the south.    to
      6. Several    subsequent    experiments      proved that the needles
 so    acted upon, retained their newly acquired magnetic pro
 perties, for twenty-four hours               least, after they had been
                                                             at

 submitted         to
                   the  power      the refracted solar rays.             But                                  it   is
 evident that this change            the poles was          phaenomenon     a                                  in
 dicating some alteration                     in
                                   the relations        reciprocity between
                                                                        of
 the    previously   existing  magnetic     properties         the needle and    of
 those of the earth.
      7.  As series inferential arguments had already induced
                 a             of
  the   conclusion,   that the magnetizing influence               all cases can       in
           be
  not      a  gravitating        attractive force, but one which only
                                         or
  interferes with,         controls that force; and that
                              or                                             some           it   is   in
  way connected with the production                 light—although of         may                      it
  prevail where there                           no

as an influence             wholly distinct from the gravitating                              lunar
 force which mainly occasions the rise and fall of the tides, as
 well as from those calorific qualities which accompany the
 direct light of the sun.
    10. It is evident, that the phaenomenon which we term
 light, can only be a relation to an animal sense of perception,
 or to a seeing organ in an animal body, which is affected in
 a peculiar manner by some reciprocal influence acting be
 tween the organ and the object perceived.            But the influence
 of solar or lunar light, thus made manifest to one of our
 senses, must be attributed to some real property direct or
 reflected of the sun or moon; for illumination in the case of
 the moon-beam is evidence in favour of the existence of some
 force derived from the sun, which is separated from the heat
 ing and gravitating forces by the process of reflexion. Hence,
 supposing a magnetic influence to be the force which pro
 duces light when it acts upon our organs of vision, we are justi
 fied in the speculation that this result is not the only conse
 quence of            its

     16. After this cessation of motion, the needle with its head
 directed towards the true north pole of the earth, soon began
 to move laterally as before; but although it went through the
 same varied and peculiar changes of position as it did pre
 viously, but more slowly, it exhibited a short cessation of mo

    attained that position, and       point was             its

needle soon arranged itself         the magnetic meridian with that

wise have this well-known equation,
                      p = k p (1 + 2 3);
and it will easily be seen that this latter equation is inconsist
ent with the former one; for from it we obtain                                             L_*(1            +4%),

which would prove that the pressure is determined when the
temperature is given, a property that certainly is not verified
in the atmosphere.   It is most evident, that, in atmospheric
air, there can be no general relation between 0, p, p, except
the law of Mariotte.

                  Mr. Lyell on          the Faluns            of the Loire.                         51
fossils.    Among the shells are numerous fragments of the large
Terebratula variabilis. The corals and some of the Testacea are com
mon to the Faluns of Touraine, but none of the distinguishing fossils
of the latter have been discovered in the Carentan deposits.
   Sainteny.—In sinking a well at this place, more than sixty feet of
a white calcareous aggregate of comminuted shells were passed
through.     At Longueville, one and a half mile from Sainteny, is a
soft calcareous stone, consisting of innumerable casts of fragments
of shells, among which Mr. Lyell detected the Pecten striatus of the
Suffolk crag ; and a similar rock occurs at the farms of Blehou and
Raffanville, several miles distant.   The fossils obtained at these lo
calities could not be satisfactorily determined, but Mr. Lyell is of
opinion that they agree with those which are found near St. George
de Bohon, except that he observed no fragments of the Terebratula
variabilis.   As far as they can be identified, they consist of Suffolk
crag species, and they do not appear to possess a character interme
diate between the Suffolk fauna and that of the Faluns.
   Mr. Lyell saw no recurrence of this crag further south, and the
most northern point at which he noticed a deposit of the age of the
Faluns of Touraine was near Dinan, sixty geographical miles to the
south-east of Sainteny, the intermediate country consisting of ancient
strata and crystalline rocks.

coralline and shelly sand, overlaid               beda of   stiff, reddish-brown

at   the junction      ofthe two strata, and the occasional projection                              of
continuous layers        ofthe sand into the clay, Mr. Lyell explains by

  is overlaid by a bed of clay of variable thickness, having been
  very irregularly denudated; and it is penetrated by cylindrical hol
  lows, similar to the sand-pipes in the English chalk. From these
  localities Mr. Lyell obtained twenty-six species of shells, one Cir
  riped, five species of Echinodermata, five of corals, and seven of
  fishes, besides the remains of Cetacea and Mammalia before men
  tioned.    The shells are for the most part identical with species found
  in the Faluns of Touraine; the whole of the corals are well
  known Touraine fossils; and the fishes, according to M. Agassiz,
  have been all found in the molasse of Switzerland, with the excep
  tion of one species, Carcharias megalodon.     In the solid limestones of
  the localities above enumerated, many of the shells, which in several
  places in Touraine are beautifully preserved, occur only as casts.
     Rennes.—The country between Dinan and Rennes consists of an
  cient rocks.    M. Desnoyers states, in the memoir before alluded to,
  that  tertiary beds of the age of the Paris basin and of the Faluns
  occur near    Rennes, but Mr. Lyell is not aware of any published ac
  count of the fossils.    In the ancient quarries of St. Gregoire, to
  which he was conducted by M. Pontallier, he found corals and casts
  of shells of Touraine species; also a large Spatangus, a claw of a
  crab, and teeth of sharks, imbedded in soft and hard limestones
  similar to those near Dinan.     At La Chaussairie, five miles south of
  Rennes, occurs a perfectly distinct limestone, containing Milliolites
 and casts of marine shells, resembling those of the Paris basin; and
 associated with it are green and blue marls, enclosing freshwater
 Testacea.      The deposit is of small extent, and rests upon transition
 strata; but Mr. Lyell suspects that it is in places overlaid by the
 ruins of the true Faluns, and that from these were derived the re
 mains of a Lamantin and a tooth of Carcharias megalodon, found in
 the debris of a shaft sunk at La Chaussairie.
     Nantes.—The district between Rennes and Nantes consists of
 transition and granitic rocks, but there are many detached patches of
 Miocene strata around Nantes.         At Les Cleons is a soft coralline
 limestone, containing pebbles of quartz and spangles of mica, the
 fundamental rock of the country being mica-schist.          Mr. Lyell ob
 tained from the limestone six species of corals and five of Testacea,
 the whole of which, capable of determination, belong to Touraine
 fossils. In the museum at Nantes he saw specimens which indicate
 the existence of Falun strata at Le Loroux, Vieilleville and Limousi
nière, places within thirty miles of Nantes; also other organic re
mains which prove that Eocene strata occur at Cambon.
     Angers.—Mr. Lyell was prevented from examining the pits north
of this place, but he was presented by M. Millet with an extensive
suite of shells and corals, collected by that gentleman.          Of fifty
seven species of Testacea, all but thirteen occur in the Faluns near
Tours, Savigné and Pontlevoy; but the fact of there being thirteen
peculiar to the Angers district induces Mr. Lyell to suspect that the
fossils depart more than those of other localities from the common
type.     The collection contains also only nine species which can be
positively identified with known recent shells, and one which is

                        Mr. Lyell            on the Faluns                   of the Loire.                            53
 doubtful, giving about seventeen per cent. of existing species, a much
 smaller proportion than was obtained by the author in other localities.
     Doué.-At this town are extensive quarries of a calcareous build
 ing-stone, composed of comminuted shells and corals, and exposed
 to the depth of forty feet.         The beds are horizontal, but exhibit
 highly inclined cross-stratification.      From the marl-beds at La Gré
 zille, and the calcareous sand and limestone of Renaudan and Illet,
 villages situated six or seven miles north of Doué, Mr. Lyell pro
cured twenty-four species of corals, four of Echinodermata and three
of fishes; also a few species of shells, the most conspicuous being the
large Pecten solarium.         In the great abundance of corals and Echi
noderms, and the small number of Mollusks, Mr. Lyell states that
this deposit presents a perfect analogy to the white or coralline crag
of Suffolk; but that          fauna its   distinct, with respect
                                                   is   as             species,                       to

    Savigné-Between Doué and Savigné the country consists partly
of    the Eocene freshwater formation, which extends thence almost
continuously        Paris, and partly

in the Falun bored by Petricolae, and full of their shells. The marl
is usually covered by three feet of red clay, sand and mould.       Mr.
Lyell found here the first specimens of the shell, generally con
sidered to be the Voluta Lamberti of the English crag, but which he

    General Remarks.—Previously               his tour, Mr. Lyell considered
                                                     to
that the collections which              he
                                     had seen from the Loire might           di                    be
vided into two     groups,  the  larger  resembling     Mediterranean
                                                                    a      even                   or
   more northern fauna, and the smaller tropical one; and that some
                                                          a
of athe shells composing the latter came from inferior beds             the de               of
posit,  or  from patches      ofFalun            of
                                            more ancient date than others:
 he  also suspected, that where the tropical forms abounded, there
would    be  found  a  smaller proportion                 of
                                                  recent shells.   He     how                 is,
ever, now convinced that                all
                                     the shells belong      one group,   tothat                   or

with the large cones, Cypraeas, Fasciolarias, and other tropical forms

                                          found these large univalves,
as of

                           Mr. Lyell on         the Faluns           of the Loire.                            55
  obtained the greatest proportion of recent shells, or thirty-two per
  cent., the average being twenty-five.            In making the examinations
  upon which these results depend, Mr. Lyell states that he always
  had recourse to the assistance of Mr. G. Sowerby, and in doubtful
  cases to that of Mr. E. Forbes, or some other conchologist; and that
  he excluded from his calculations a great many species of which he
  did not possess perfect specimens, or a sufficient number to enable
  the specific identification to be confidently proved.               Of the corals
  collected by the author, forty-three species have been determined by
  Mr. Lonsdale, only seven of which, or fifteen per cent., agree spe
 cifically with those found in the Suffolk crag. This per-centage in
 the Polyparia is almost exactly the same as that which has been ob
 tained from a comparison of the Testacea.                Some of the genera of
 corals, fossil in Touraine, as the Astraea, Lunulites, and Dendrophyllia,
 have not been found in European seas north of the Mediterranean; ne
 vertheless the Polyparia of the Faluns do not indicate a climate warmer
 than that which now prevails on the southern coasts of Europe.
    The next general question considered by Mr. Lyell                       whether           is,

 Mr. Lyell combats by stating that the whole assemblage                     English
crag genera and species departs very widely from that                       the ad            of of
jacent seas, consisting              of
                                 northern and southern forms.             Thus the
 Glycimeris, Cyprina and Astarte are northern genera, and                        the                   of
Astarte there are about fourteen species; and                 genera now known
                                                                            of
as  existing only      equatorial latitudes, are Pyrula, Lingula, and some
                            in
others.     The fact, that four-fifths         coralline crag Testacea are ex
                                                          of
 tinct, implies high antiquity;         well     the sixteen species
                                                as         as              Echino             of

the greater distance of these seas from each other than of the eastern
shores of England from the Faluns should be urged as an objection
to the inference that the crag and Faluns belong to one epoch, Mr. Lyell
calls attention to the difference in the Testacea on the opposite sides of
the isthmuses of Suez and Panama, though these tracts are very incon
siderable, both in height and breadth. That land existed in the imme
diate neighbourhood of the Faluns, Mr. Lyell says, is proved, from
the occurrence of the remains of terrestrial Mammalia, and of land and
freshwater shells, though they are of rare occurrence, compared with
the marine reliquiae; and if it formed a barrier between the district oc
cupied by the crag and that by the Faluns, the more northern charac
ter of the crag fauna might be due to the sea in which it lived opening
to the north; and in supportof this opinion he alludes to the rapid trans
ition in the southern hemisphere from a district possessing a mild and
equable climate, in which tropical forms of Testacea exist with others
common to high latitudes, to one of extreme cold. Lastly, Mr. Lyell
says, whatever speculations may be indulged, it is clear that the fos
sils of the crag and Faluns are almost entirely different from those of
the London clay and Paris basin; that at least one-fifth of the fossil
shells, both in the crag and Faluns, are identical with recent species;
that fifteen per cent. of the shells and corals of the Faluns are spe
cifically identical with those of the Suffolk crag, and that the sup
posed difference of climate indicated to the Testacea and Polyparia
is by no means so great as some observers have supposed.        Mr. Lyell
nevertheless does not attach such importance to the per-centage of
recent shells in the present state of knowledge of all the recent species,
as to deduce from this source alone a positive inference regarding
the precise agreement in age of the Faluns and the crag, merely
stating that both deposits are referable to the Miocene epoch; and as
the red and coralline divisions of the Suffolk crag were not formed
at the same time, so he conceives there may have been shades of dif
ference in the relative age of the Faluns and the crag.
    June 16. “Description of a Newer Pliocene Deposit at Stevenston,
 and of Post-Tertiary Deposits at Stevenston and Largs, in the County
 of Ayr,” by the Rev. David Landsborough, and communicated by
James Smith, Esq., F.G.S.
    The Newer Pliocene Deposit.—This stratum was discovered in 1839
 in opening two coal-pits in the parish of Stevenston. After penetra
 ting from thirty to thirty-five feet of sand, a bed of blue clay, nine
 feet thick, was passed through, and found to contain marine fossils
 of the newer Pliocene epoch. All the species have been obtained in
 other deposits of the same age in the basin of the Clyde, except two,
 —Astarte borealis, which occurs in a fossil state in the crag and living
 in the Arctic seas, and Astarte propinqua, a new shell. Mr. Lands
 borough gives a list of the twenty-seven species collected by him,
 nineteen of which are common in the adjoining seas, six are known
 to exist in the Arctic seas, and two, Natica glaucinoides, a crag fossil,
 and Astarte propinqua, are believed to be extinct.
    Post-Tertiary Deposits.—The author prefixes to his account of
 these beds a notice of the older formations in that part of Ayrshire.

The prevailing rock is red sandstone, which, at almost every point
on the coast, has been worn, by the former action of the sea, into
cliffs, which indicate a change of level of about forty feet. The ter
race at the base of the cliff, Mr. Landsborough states, may be con
sidered a marine raised beach, and the shells contained in it are, with
two exceptions, one of which is doubtful, of existing species.
    At Ardrossan, a deposit twenty feet above the level of the sea,
and at Kelly, the soil which covers the base of the inland cliff to the
height of thirty feet, are full of common marine shells. Similar beds
are stated to occur in the islands of Arran, Cumbra, and Inch Mar
nock. In the parish of Stevenston, immediately under the vegetable
soil, is a bed of shingle, in which forty-seven species of shells com
mon on the adjacent shores have been found.           It rests upon shale
perforated in many places by the Pholas crispata, of which the shell,
in a very friable state, is generally found within the cavity.
    At Largs the shore rises to the height of twenty feet above high
water.     Under a bed of loam, from five to ten feet above the sea
level, is a sandy stratum one foot thick, from which Mr. Lands
borough has obtained specimens of Millepora polymorpha, and seventy
species of marine shells, the whole of which are well-known inhabit
ants of the British seas, except two species of Rissoa, one of which
had been previously found only in the crag, and the other is referred
with doubts to the Rissoa Harveyii of Mr. Forbes.
    Respecting the age of this deposit, Mr. Landsborough states, that
 160 species having been found in it by Mr. Smith and other geolo
gists, it would be rash to infer from the above two exceptions, “that
there is a difference in the faunas of the existing period of sea-level
and of that which preceded it;” but he thinks it is not improbable
that some change may have taken place during the very long period
in which the inland cliff was formed by the slow wasting of the sea;
and he adds, the position of the bed at Largs, being ten feet under
 the surface, indicates a considerable antiquity, although its age must
 be much newer than that of the Pliocene strata, in which there is a
 decided proportion of extinct Testacea.
    Lists of the shells found by the author at each locality accompany
the paper.
    A letter from Capt. Alexander, F.G.S., “On the Annual De
 struction of Land at Easton Bavent Cliff, near Southwold.”
    From careful observations, made during the last five years, Capt.
 Alexander is of opinion, that the local statements, of 350 yards in
 breadth having been destroyed at Easton Cliff in about thirty-five
 years, are not much overrated, as, during that period, a nearly square
 field, containing twelve and a half acres, has been entirely removed
 by the sea, and as only three acres remain of another which con
 sisted of eighteen and a half.      This ratio of loss, he says, has ex
 tended   along the whole  range  of the cliff except at the extreme south
 end.    During   the five  years  that Capt. Alexander has personally
  watched the action of the sea upon this coast, the annual loss in
  breadth has been at least seven yards.
     About 200 yards in rear of the lowest part of the cliff is a tract,

consisting   principally of marsh land, which is beneath the level of
 the sea, and extends in different directions to Bungay, Beccles and
 Halesworth, and was undoubtedly occupied, Capt. Alexander states,
 at no very remote period, by extensive rivers flowing into an estuary
 connected with the German Ocean.
    The letter was accompanied by a section constructed by Mr. R.
 Alexander, and which gives the following bearings of two churches
 at each end of the cliff:—
    South End.—Southwold church, 22° 30' S. of W.; Blyborough
 church, 7° 30' N. of W.
    North End.—Roydon church, 14° 3' 45" N. of W.; Covehithe
 church, 30° E. of N.
    The bearing of the edge of the cliff, at the two extremities, is
 stated to be 43° 7' 30" E. of N.
    A paper entitled “Description of Cuttings across the Ridge of
 Bromsgrove Lickey, on the line of the Birmingham and Gloucester
 Railway,” by Hugh Edwin Strickland, Esq., F.G.S.
    When Mr. Strickland laid before the Society, in June 1840*, a
 description of a series of coloured sections on the Birmingham and
 Gloucester Railway, the cuttings on the Lickey not having been
completed, he was prevented from detailing the phaenomena exhibited
on this part of the line.      The present communication is therefore
 supplementary to the former memoir.
    Where the cutting crosses the ridge, it has been excavated to the
depth of fifty-six feet, and exhibits, Mr.Strickland states, clear proofs
of the disturbance which attended the elevation of the Lickey. The
lowest rock which has been exposed is a mass of hard, grey, brown
ish or reddish, compact or coarse-grained sandstone, occupying a
horizontal distance of about seventy yards, and rising gradually to
the north-east to the height of twenty feet.      At the point where it
attains this visible thickness,  it is suddenly cut off by a nearly ver
tical fault. The strata    dip about 60° to the east-south-east, or from
the trap composing the Upper Lickey. No organic remains having
been noticed, it is difficult, Mr. Strickland states, to fix the precise
geological position of the deposit; but he is inclined to assign                                it,   on
mineral characters,       the lower new red sandstone of Mr. Mur

      “Description of a Model of Arthur's Seat and the King's Park,
  Edinburgh,” by J. Robison Wright, Esq., F.G.S.
      This model was constructed on a horizontal scale of ten inches
  to a mile, but for the vertical scale double that dimension was em
  ployed, to render the crags perceptible to the eye. The included
  area is between two and three square miles, extending from Edin
  burgh on the west to Duddington on the east, and from Holyrood
  Palace on the north to Prestonfield on the south. The author notices
  in his description the structure and phaenomena successively exposed
  in proceeding from Edinburgh eastward; but as the details have been
  chiefly extracted, with acknowledgment, from Mr. Maclaren's pub
  lished work on Fife and the Lothians, it is not considered necessary
  to give an abstract of them.
      “Notes by Mr. Maclauchlan, F.G.S., to accompany some Fos
  sils collected by himself and Mr. Still, F.G.S., during their employ
  ment on the Ordnance Survey in Pembrokeshire.”
      Taking for a base-line the northern boundary of the Llandeilo
  flags laid down by Mr. Murchison, the author proceeds to describe
  a section extending from near Llanhuadain on the south, to Dinas
 Head on the north.        At Potter's Slade, a little north-west of Llan
 huadain, a conglomerate dips to the northward, and is traceable
 westward to Ford, and eastward towards Llangan, where a sandstone
 conglomerate occurs containing Trilobites and shells.          Proceeding
 on the line of   section,  the conglomerate   is succeeded first by sand
 stone and sandstone    shales,  and then at Clarbeston by limestone with
 carboniferous   shales, dipping   northward, and containing Graptolites
 and casts of shells.    Similar carbonaceous shales exist on the west
 of Clarbeston, at St. Catharine's Bridge, near Camrose; also at
 Rudbaxton, and on the east at Long Ford, near Llandysilio. They
 have in some localities been unsuccessfully worked for coal.        Grap
 tolites have likewise been found in calcareous shales at       Robleston,
 about a mile north-west of Camrose.        At Llys-y-fran, north of Clar
 beston, the carbonaceous shales are succeeded by roofing-slates,
 which at Mynydd Castell-bythe (Castell-y-furoch, Ord. Map) and
 Morfel alternate with trap. On the summit of Mynydd Pontfaen,
sandstone with coarse slates occurs, and between the summit and
 Pontfaen, trap again alternates with slates. The summit of Mynydd
Llanllawer consists of coarse-grained, rudely columnar greenstone,
flanked on the northern declivity of the mountain by coarse sand
 stone of trappean aspect.       This rock is overlaid by roofing-slates,
which extend      nearly   to Dinas Head, where a hard conglomerate
sandstone, containing crinoidal remains, is exhibited.           All these
strata are represented in a section as dipping towards the north.
     In Aberreiddy Bay, about twelve and a half miles to the south
west of Dinas, slaty beds with a northwardly dip, and apparently
prolongations of the schists on the line of section, contain the Grap
tolithus Murchisonii and G. foliaceus of the Llandeilo flags, also nu
merous casts of an Euomphalus, resembling the E. perturbatus of
that formation, and a species of Lingula. Although these slates
differ in lithological characters from the Llandeilo flags, yet Mr.

                          Geological Society.                        61
Maclauchlan is of opinion that this difference may have been pro
duced by the masses of trap which are associated with the slates.
   The conglomerate sandstone of Dinas Head, which occurs also in
Newport Bay and at Trewyddel, near Cardigan, is stated to resem
ble one of the conglomerates of the Caradoc sandstone described by
Mr. Murchison; and the crinoidal stems which it contains, to agree
with analogous remains found by Mr. Murchison in the Caradoc
sandstone at Little London, May Hill”.
   In addition to the phaenomena which occur in the immediate vi
cinity of the section, Mr. Maclauchlan alludes to indications of anti
clinal lines near Narberth and at Camrose, in Southern Pembroke
shire; also at Solfach, south-east of St. David's, and at Porthllisky,
to the south-west of that city.    At the latter village the dip changes
to the  westward,  and  continuing to alter, assumes in Whitesand Bay
a  northwardly  direction.   This  dip  also prevails at St. Laurence,
thirteen miles east of St. David's   Head;    at Leweston, three miles
south of St. Laurence,   and at Long Ford,   about two and a half miles
south of Llandysilio. Trappean ash also is stated to occur near green
stone at Penbury (Penberry, Ord. Map) Hill, two and a half miles
north-north-east of St. David's; at Llanllawer, two miles south-east
of Fishguard; and at Carningley, one mile south of Newport.
   Though the summit of the principal Pembrokeshire chain is
roofing-slate, yet trap-rocks occur near the top, and are described by
the author as continuous through the district, extending to Plumb
stone Mountain (five miles north-west of Haverfordwest) and to St.
David's Head, re-appearing at the Bishop and Clerks and the Hat
and Barrels rocks, and at the Smalls light-house.    At Fishguard and
Strumble Head, three miles west of Fishguard Bay, the trap is co
lumnar.    On the north-east of the chain at Whitechurch (Eglwys
wen), six miles south-east from Newport, on the east at Llanfirmach
(Llanfrynach, Ord. Map), and on the south at Llanglwydwen, are
beds of dark carbonaceous shale, which have been fruitlessly worked
for culm; they appear to mantle round the trap, but preserve a
northerly dip; they are accompanied by lead-veins, one of which, at
Llanfernach, has been worked successfully. At Llanglwydwen Bridge
are indications of copper in a lode in contact with a considerable
bed of limestone.     Mineral veins also exist along the coast, from
Newgate, in St. Bride's Bay, to St. David's Head.
   “Description of some remains of a gigantic Crocodilian Sau
rian, probably marine, from the Lower Greensand at Hythe, and of
Teeth from the same formation at Maidstone, referable to the genus
Polyptychodon,” by Richard Owen, Esq., F.G.S.
   The fossil saurian remains from the lower greensand discovered
by Mr. H. B. Mackeson include portions of the iliac, ischial and
pubic bones, a large proportion of the shaft of a femur, parts of a
tibia and fibula, and several metatarsal bones. In consequence of
the absence of vertebrae and teeth, the determination of the specific

62               Geological Society:—Prof. Owen on remains                                                   of
difficulty, and he therefore confines his remarks, in the present paper,
to indications of the characters by which it differs from previously
known extinct genera of Saurians.                 In the first place, Mr. Owen
shows, from the femur and other long bones having no medullary
cavities, but a central structure composed of coarse cancelli, that
the animal of which they formed part was of marine habits; he,
however, adds, that the principal bone being a femur, independently
of the size and shape of the metatarsals, at once negatives the idea
that these remains belonged to the cetacean order; and that the
form and proportions of the metatarsals equally forbid their reference
to any other mammalian genus.
   Femur.—The portions of this bone secured by Mr. Mackeson                                                            in

 reptiles; and he shows that it is distinct from the Poikilopleuron of
 M. Deslongchamp by the long bones of that Saurian having medul
 lary cavities.
    Saurian Teeth from the Lower Greensand.—These teeth, described
 by Mr. Owen in his “Odontography’ under the name of Polypty
 chodon, are characterized by the crown presenting numerous closely
 set longitudinal ridges, which are continued, of nearly equal length,
 to near the apex of the crown. In their size and simple conical form
 the teeth of the Polyptychodon resemble those of the great sauroid
 fish, Hypsodon, Ag., but may be distinguished by the solid compact
 structure of the dentine, which is resolved by decomposition into
 successive cones; and also by the ridges on the exterior of the crown
 of the Hypsodon's teeth being alternately long and short, and ter
 minating abruptly at different distances from the base, the interspaces
 between the longer ridges widening as they approach the apex. The
 tooth of the Polyptychodon is slightly and regularly curved, and                  in
 vested with a layer of enamel of a clear, amber-brown colour, and of
 which the ridges are composed, the surface of the outermost layer
 of dentine being smooth. A tooth from the lower greensand near
 Maidstone has a crown three inches long, and one inch four lines
across the base. It consists of a body of compact dentine composed
of successive lamelliform cones, and has a short and wide conical
cavity at the base.
    From the teeth supposed to have belonged to the Poikilopleuron,
the specimens above described differ in the ridges on the crown
being greater in number and more closely set, as well as in the form
of the teeth being nearly circular instead of elliptical; from the teeth
of the Pliosaurus they differ also in being round and not three-sided,
and in having longitudinal ridges over the whole surface of the crown;
and from the teeth of the Mosasaurus they differ in being ridged
and not smooth.
    In conclusion, Mr. Owen states, that as the Hythe Saurian is di
stinct from    all
                 other described Saurians, and            as
                                                   these teeth belonged

When acid water was electrolyzed, the odour was not produced,

in ammonia to absorb the chlorine, which appeared to disguise the
ozone.   When the gases obtained by electrolysis were exploded in
proper proportions in the eudiometer, the odour disappeared with

Monthly Register for October:—
   “The most remarkable features of the month have been the fre
quent recurrence of its heavy gales, and long-continued torrents of
rain; and the major part of these were, in the language of an elec
trician, decidedly of a neutral character. The quantity of rain fallen,
and, moreover, the immense deposit of dew during several of the
nights,     albeit that the amount of daily evaporation proved com
paratively very small,—were unprecedented within memory, as re
gards the locality of our observations.”—“The neighbouring marshes
and low lands are inundated.         Many cellars in the town (Sandwich),
known to have been         dry upwards    of sixty years, are now full from
a  rising  in the  springs.”

 De la Rive's    ring,  through which the current to be examined is sent.

   June  18, 1841.—Mr. Walker read a letter from Professor Forshey,
of  Natchez,  giving an account of several interesting displays of me
teors.
   Mr. Walker observed, that the display of the 20th of April, which
was noticed in Virginia in 1803, and which has been referred to by
MM. Arago, Quetelet, Herrick and others, was watched for by Mr.
Herrick in the last three years, without any remarkable result. Cor
responding observations were made in the present year at Cambridge,
New Haven, Philadelphia and Washington, on the 19th, the 20th
and 21st being cloudy, from 11 o'clock till midnight; but the num
ber of meteors seen was not greater than usual.     In the morning
of the 19th, however, a gentleman of Philadelphia, Mr. William F.
Kintzing, counted eight in the course of ten minutes, shortly after
midnight.
   At about 8 o'clock on the same night, the 18th, at Vidalia, in Louis
iana, Prof. Forshey noticed an unusual number of meteors in different
parts of the heavens, and on tracing their paths backwards, found
that they traversed the constellation Virgo.             Having commenced
precise observations at half-past eight, and continued them for three
hours, he saw in two hours and a quarter, forty-five minutes being
lost in recording, sixty meteors, of which                       all
                                                       but five passed within
10° from the common radiant          point.   These meteors were very un
like those     of
                the  August     shower,  being   chiefly without trains, and
of   a reddish   colour,  few      them   of the first magnitude, and the
                                                       of
greater number         the third and inferior magnitudes.

ties were   remarkably    equal and gentle; their paths short; and their
light first increasing, then waning,           they were moving
                                                   as   if               chord

cannot have been much less than that of the observer, or about six
teen geographical miles per second. This observation of the con
vergent point of these meteors, Mr. Walker regards as strongly con
firmatory of the cosmical theory of shooting-stars; inasmuch as it
seems to demonstrate the existence in this group of a planetary velo
city, like that of the December group observed by Mr. Herrick in
1838, in a direction normal to the observer's motion, and incapable
of resulting from           it.
   Professor Forshey also observed the meteor-shower                   the 12th       of                 of

                        Professor Olmsted and            others,  and which has
been called Twining's meteor, after the Professor who calculated                                         its
relative path and velocity.          Both Professor Courtenay and himself
noticed the white nebula which               left                    on

    Professor Forshey does not believe that the meteors                    the 12th         of
of   November have the anniversary character.                He has watched for
them every year, except 1834 and 1836, since their appearance                                            in
 1833.     He saw the great auroral arch               17th Nov. 1835, from
                                                                      of                                  a

 son arch,   a  rare phaenomenon          that latitude, 31°36'.        He noticed
also occasional brilliant meteors on the 13th and 14th                  November,      of
 1837, but they did not appear            come from the well-known radiant

                      Leo.      The times for observation          1838 and 1839 in
were too cloudy             to
                           allow      satisfactory results. The subsequent
                                              of
anniversaries were clear, and well watched, but without any obser
vation of interest.
    Professor Forshey mentions that               had seen the zodiacal light

PROCEEDINGs of the section of Physics, ETC., of The sci
ENTIFIC CONGRESS HELD AT FLORENCE IN SEPTEMBER 1841*.
    We owe to the kindness of M. Matteucci an extract from the
minutes of the meetings of the physical, mathematical and chemical
sections, of which he is the Secretary.
    M. Pacinotti read a memoir on the induced currents which are
developed in magnets put in rotation.          After having studied the
principal circumstances of this phaenomenon, he showed how it may
be made use of in order to study the distribution of magnetism in a
magnet, and in order to have a current of constant power; and how
also suitably, in bringing together several magnets in rotation, we
may have a very powerful electrometer.
    M. Cagnozzi read a memoir on tonography. He presented an             in
strument which he calls a tonographe, and with which he proposes
to write down the music of declamation.
    M. Vegui    showed some wire ropes (cordes en fil de fer), in the
centre of which there is a cord of hemp : it appears that this modi
fication destroys the rigidity of ordinary wire ropes.
    Professor Cassiani of Parma read a memoir, the object of which is
the study of the oscillatory motion observed long since in an astatic
system of magnetic needles. He finds that this motion is connected
with the electric state of the atmosphere.
    Prince Louis Bonaparte exhibited some platina gilt by De la
Rive's process, and observes that this metal takes the gilding better
than silver.     He explains this, on the one hand, by the greater
density of the platina, and, on the other, by the insoluble layer of
chloride of silver, which must withstand the perfect gilding of silver.
    M. Matteucci spoke of the experiments lately made in England,
and of those of M. Peltier in France, according to which the vapour
of water appears to him to manifest a state of electricity when it is
formed at a high degree of tension and at very elevated tempera
tures.    He afterwards noticed the observations which he has made
for the purpose of studying the electric state of the atmosphere near
the columns of vapour which rise in the Lagoons of Tuscany, where
boracic acid is produced.      He says that he has not observed any
difference, with respect to electricity, between the air near the La
goons and that at a great distance from them.          From this he con
cludes, that we cannot consider the slow evaporation of water from
salts, or from the sea, as the cause of atmospheric electricity.
    M. Vincent Amici extends the principle of virtual velocities, and
of living forces, to liquids which are acted upon by any forces what
ever in their elements, and compressed at their surface.
    M. Majocchi communicated a series of experiments, the result of
 which is that heat, whether conducted or radiating, is endowed with
 the same property which M. Becquerel, jun., found existing in those
 rays of the spectrum which he has named continuateurs.          It is thus
 that he has discovered that photogenic papers submitted to the ac
 tion of light during an exceedingly short time, and without their

  undergoing any action, change if they are heated in any way what
 ever.
     M. Perego related his experiments on the development of electri
  city by the immersion of bodies in mercury.      One of the substances
  which succeed the best is the felt used in making hats.
     M. Mossotti read a memoir on the explanation of the dispersion of
  light in the undulatory theory.
     M. Dini communicated some experiments relative to the influence
  of heat on capillary attraction.
     M. Orioli communicated the observation of a kind of light seen by
  an individual on his toes.    M. Boyer noticed a similar observation.
  These two physicists explain these phaenomena by supposing a
  morbid secretion of electricity.—M. Matteucci cannot admit this
  explanation, not seeing how a luminous electric charge can be pre
  served without discharging itself upon bodies which are in contact;
  he thinks that these phaenomena should rather be referred to those
  which relate to the phosphorescence of rotten wood, fish, &c.
     M. Matteucci exhibited an apparatus for electrostatic inductions.
  He describes an apparatus which he calls a differential inductometer,
  and which is composed of a spiral plane placed between two similar
  spirals; these may approach more or less to the intermediary spiral,
  and their extremities may be united together so as to produce two
  currents which circulate in contrary directions.        He mentioned
  some contrary results which he found in studying these induced
 currents by means of magnetizing, by the galvanometer, and by the
  hole made in paper by the spark of induction.
     M. Pacinotti described two experiments which appeared to him
 contrary to the theory of Ampère.      He has a cylinder of soft iron,
                    ;
 which is hollow he introduces into the internal central part of this
 cylinder a spiral, and places a similar spiral at the exterior.  M. Pa
  cinotti has found that the current of the external spiral does not
 give an induced current in the internal spiral, and that a current in
 the internal spiral does not magnetize the cylinder of soft iron.
     M. Mahlmann of Berlin read an extract from a work on the
 distribution of heat on the surface of the earth.
     M. Giazi read a description of the effects produced by lightning.
 He exhibited some pretty vitrification of stones, some black and
 yellow traces left on a wall, and a nail magnetized by means of the
 thunder stroke.
     The Count Scopoli mentioned the causes of the inundations of
 Lombardy, and added to the known causes the slow destruction of
 certain artificial lakes which are found on the declivities of the
mountains.
     MM. Stefani and Jordani presented models of electric telegraphs,
and of electro-magnetic telo-typographs.
     M. Cini exhibited a singular reproduction of a drawing, which is
produced at the end of a certain time on the plate of glass which
covers this same drawing.
     M. Marianini read a summary of the experiments made by him on
induction.     He thinks he can establish as a fact, that the current of

             Prof. Gonnella          on a new system          of   Eye-pieces.   71
 induction is developed in the metallic thread, the circuit of which is
 closed an instant after the voltaic circuit has been shut or opened.
 He believes, that by following up these experiments he shall be able
to connect the principle of electro-dynamic induction with that of
the influence of the electricity of tension.
    M. Matteucci mentioned his experiments on the current yielded
by the frog, and described some new experiments on the torpedo.
    M. Carlini spoke of the use of the barometer in the measurement
of heights, and described an apparatus for the purpose of having the
level of the mercury constant.
    M. Marianini read the history of two cases of paralysis which were
completely cured by the use of dynamic electricity, applied in an in
termittent manner.                  -
    M. Zantedeschi confirmed the experiments of M. Matteucci on
the torpedo; he thinks that the nerves come from the dilatation of
the medulla oblongata, which forms the fourth lobe, with the gray
matter which covers it.—M. Savi has also made the observations.
   M. Morren has found phosphorus in glow-worms, as well as a
system of prisms or transparent lenses above the luminous matter.
    Professor Gonnella” presented some printed memoirs, in one of
 which appears the theory and the description of a machine for measu
 ring plane surfaces, which he had invented and constructed in 1824,
 and an abridged memoir of which he had published in the Antologia
 for 1825. In another of these memoirs he gives a theory of new
 systems of eye-pieces of arbitrary lengths for the Newtonian tele
 scope, and for spherical as well as for parabolic object-glasses, ac
 cording as is best suited for artists.    In reducing for each telescope
the length of the tubes of the eye-pieces greater than the semi
diameter of the object-glass, we may substitute for the small plane
metallic mirror a rectangular prism of glass, very small, whatever
 may be the opening of the object-glass, since the prism may be
placed very near the focus without the eye of the observer being
obliged to be within the great tube; for the length of the eye-piece
determines the place of the eye on the outside of this same tube.
We thus obtain the power of constructing the best telescopes, with
the prism, as pointed out by Newton, of large dimensions; for, the
prism being very small, we may,+1st, easily find pieces of perfect
glass for them ; 2nd, we may have the total reflexion of the rays,
since the quantity of light absorbed by the thickness of the prism is
insensible; 3rd, we may obtain the advantage that the loss of the
central rays of the object-glass, intercepted by the prism, shall be
very small in relation to the diameter of the object-glass, and always
smaller relative to the greatest diameters; for the size of the prism
is always constant for         all
                              the object-glasses, viz. about     inch for  an

             In of
each side      the                    of

                                                  observe, that the tele

scopes with the prism have double the clearness                    of
                                                        those which have
the small plane metallic mirror.

     ON   THE THEORY OF ELFCTROLYSIS : SUGGESTION                                          OF A
                      NeW ExPERI MENT,
     HE highly     interesting experiments of Mr. Knox open new views
       on the subject of dynamical electricity.       It would however be
desirable to extend the trial to all the known metals possible; since
probably the power of conducting electricity through the mass will be
found to be different for each metal, and to be in any given case                                    in
versely as the density of the metal. The case of a current of elec
tricity passing through an electrolyte is very analogous; take water
as an example: so long as the particles of the fluid are extremely
near one another, the internal forces, or forces produced by the action
of the molecules on each other, are sufficiently powerful to prevent the
passage of the greater part of the current and consequent decomposi
tion of the fluid; when, however, we mix sulphuric acid with the water,
the only effect of which is to increase the distance between the mole
cules of the water and consequently diminish the value of the internal
forces, the current is able to overcome those forces, and, by causing
the molecules of the fluid to revolve round their axis, to effect its elec
trolyzation. This reasoning suggests an experiment, which it might
perhaps be worth while to try.       Thénard many years ago discovered
that  phosphorus    when   suddenly  cooled,  after being heated to a cer
tain  temperature,    becomes  black,  owing    to some change in the ar
rangement of its molecules. The internal forces at some instant,
whilst the molecules are passing from one state of equilibrium to the
other, must have passed through zero; if then this substance be
decomposable by electricity, it will most probably be so whilst this
change in the arrangement of                     its
                                         particles     taking place.                            It

                                    COMPOSITION OF WOLFRAM.
   M. Schaffgotsch, in analysing wolfram obtained from different
places, found that the sum of the ponderable quantities of the bases
was always greater than it should be in a neutral tungstate of iron
and manganese, and that the quantity of tungstic acid yielded by
analysis was constantly larger than that calculated according to the
composition generally admitted.          This circumstance, supported by
direct  analysis,  led M.   Schaffgotsch    to the conclusion that wolfram
contains oxide of tungsten, and not tungstic acid.
   The analyses were performed in the following manner:—The finely
powdered mineral was fused with three times             weight     carbonate        its             of
 ofsoda. After    treating  the fused mass with     water, the two oxides                                          of
iron and manganese which were left, were dissolved by hydrochloric
acid, and separated by means                            of
                                        ammonia and its succinate.        The
tungsten exists                in
                     the solution      tungstic acid; but

in hydrochloric acid; the acid                  repeatedly added, and the

ON THE GASES DISENGAGED BY MARINE PLANTS,                                           BY M.   AIMé,
           PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS AT ALGIERs.
   Having frequently had occasion to observe the plants which grow
in the sea, M. Aimé remarked that they are commonly covered with
a great quantity of bubbles; and this phaenomenon is more readily
visible as the water is more tranquil. In certain localities a kind of
froth is formed on the surface of the liquid similar to that which is
seen in freshwater marshes; and M. Aimé thought at first that they
were similar in composition, but analysis showed that this was not
 the case.
    The formation of bubbles takes place at                    all     the year, but
                                                                           it of

 water, immediately produced bubbles on the surface                              of

These     plants    were     kept  alive for two months and retained their
powers:       to  render this observation more conclusive, some plants                            on
 the sea-shore were examined during several successive days; after
sunset    all  the bubbles were removed by agitation, and the next morn
ing they were again perceptible.                No appreciable quantity             gas     of

bubbles      on the surface, but some have the additional property               form  of

gave at first NO" and much oxygen; on continuing the distillation
there passes a substance which solidifies and forms white crystals in
the neck of the retort, and the disengagement of hyponitric [nitrous]
acid and oxygen ceases.
    The liquid in the retort is of a deep yellow colour, but becomes
colourless by cooling; when put in contact with water a violent dis
engagement of nitric oxide takes place, and sulphate of nitric oxide
remains. The reaction appears to be explained by the decomposi
tion of the nitric compound at a high temperature into the much
more stable compound nitric oxide, with the disengagement of
oxygen.
    The fluoride of boron and the fluoride of silicon, when put into con
tact with nitric oxide, hyponitrous, nitrous and nitric acid, give rise
to corresponding compounds. The fluoride of boron especially has
great affinity for nitrous compounds; no one of these compounds
forms combinations with nitrous oxide.
    The fluoride of boron and the fluoride of silicon are absorbed in
large quantity by concentrated nitric acid; their solutions emit
white fumes: water separates boracic acid from the solution of flu
oride of boron, but does not separate silicon from that of fluoride of
silicon.
    When the last-mentioned fluoride is saturated with the alcalies, the
silica is not precipitated, and the fluoride of silicon dissolved appears
to enter into the composition of the saline matter obtained. The
compound of fluoride of boron and nitric oxide appears to be the most
stable, for on heating the compounds of hyponitrous acid, oxygen is
disengaged.     The perchloride of tin gives with nitric oxide a cry
stalline  compound   which readily distils, and is decomposed by wa
ter.    Analogous   compounds    are obtained with the perchloride of
tin and hyponitrous, nitrous and nitric acid; but the reaction of per
chloride of tin on the acids is accompanied with an abundant disen
gagement of chlorine and nitrous acid, and after the distillation ox
ide of tin remains.
  The most oxigenated nitrous compounds appear to be reduced by
heat to the state of the compounds of chlorides with nitric oxide,

with much water, decomposes after a certain time; it becomes black,
and eventually consists entirely of finely divided mercury, the su
pernatant liquor containing arsenious and hydrochloric acids.
   This decomposition is perfectly analogous to that which water
effects in the precipitate formed by phosphuretted hydrogen in the
solutions of bichloride of mercury, this precipitate changing into
mercury, phosphorous and hydrochloric acids.       This decomposition
occurs more   rapidly  than that with the arsenical compound.
   Both  precipitates undergo   similar changes by the action of nitric
acid; by the aid of a gentle heat they are converted into protochlo
ride of mercury, and the arsenic and phosphorus are at the same
time oxidized.
    This similar reaction             seems to indicate also a               similarity of com
position, and this is confirmed by analysis; the arsenical precipi
tate, according to M. Rose, is represented by Asº Hg2 + 3 Hg Cl*.
   The phosphuretted precipitate differs from the above only in con
taining three atoms of water, whereas the arsenical one is anhydrous.
These two precipitates also differ in the mode in which they are
acted upon by heat; the chloro-phosphuret of mercury contains ex
actly so much water that                     its
                                  hydrogen converts         the chlorine intoall

                                              the phosphorus into phospho
hydrochloric acid, and          oxygen
rous acid.    The chloro-arseniuret          mercury,     the contrary, doeson
not yield any gaseous product under the same circumstances;
sublimes without any residue, decomposing into protochloride                                         of it
mercury and metallic arsenic.         There sublimes,        the same time,      at
a  small quantity          of
                           reddish substance which consists
                                a                                   mercury,               of

                                                    is    the substance sub
limed without decomposition.         Sometimes the sublimate contains                                 a
little metallic mercury. The analysis              the arsenical precipitate

                     of  a                                                                            ;
splendent; penetrated with small cavities, some          which were par      of

                         a           dull pale yellow

                                                    a  colour, and which
the miners call oxide       lead; other cavities contain very small im

perfect crystals, which are brilliant, and of a pale olive-green colour,
and have the appearance of chloride of silver.           This specimen was
very rich, for it yielded 0-0688 of silver, and contained 0.45 of car
bonate of lead, which, intimately mixed with quartz and a little
oxide of iron, formed the principal portion of the mass.
   M. Berthier has also found this mineral among the silver ores of
Huelgoeth, department of Finistère in France.                 Two specimens
were obtained    by   him:   the  first  of  these   is  described   as being
porous or scoriform, containing white quartz imbedded in foliated
hydrate of iron. On the edges of the foliated iron ore the naked eye
could distinguish small cubic grains of a pearl-white colour, which
had all the characters of chloride of silver.
   The second specimen had the appearance of compact oxide of iron,
containing here and there milk-white quartz; it was throughout im
pregnated with chloride of silver, which occasionally appeared in the
form of very small brilliant crystals.        To analyse this mineral, 10
grammes were first treated with ammonia and heat to dissolve the
chloride of silver, and afterwards by boiling hydrochloric acid to dis
solve the oxide of iron; this acid also dissolved a certain portion of
lead, which probably was in the state of phosphate.            The quartzose
residue weighed 3-26 grammes; it contained 0.17             gramme    of silver,
which must have been in the metallic state: the ammoniacal solu
tion gave by boiling and saturation with nitric acid, I-84 gramme of
chloride of silver, which, supposing it to be pure, contained 1:40
gramme of silver, which, added to 0-17 gramme remaining in the
quartz, gives a total of 1:57 gramme; a result which differed so
very little from that obtained by assaying, as to prove the absence
of bromide of silver, and that this was the case was confirmed by
additional experiments.
   After this a third specimen was received from Huelgoeth; it was
very small, but as rich as the foregoing, and in it there were distin
guishable, besides granular cubic crystals of chloride of silver, other
grains of an olive-green colour, which had exactly the same appear
ance as the bromide of Plateros, and the following experiments proved
the presence of this substance.
   Five grammes of the pulverized mineral were boiled in a solution
of oxalic acid, until the oxide of iron was perfectly dissolved: the
residue weighed about a gramme, and it evidently contained a mix
ture of canary-yellow and white grains.            It was digested in hot
solution of ammonia until          all
                                 the  yellow   powder     disappeared;   it  re
quired    large quantity                              purpose,

not have been the case       dissolve pure chloride.        The solution was
gradually saturated with nitric acid, and        it was observed that the
successive deposits formed had          evident yellow tint, but gradually
                                         an
diminishing    in intensity, except   the last, which were white.          The
yellow deposits were collected and examined           in the following man
ner:—A portion was treated with chlorine and aether; the aether be
came  of   ayellow colour.     Another portion was dissolved        in ammo
nia, hydrosulphate    of ammonia was added         to  the solution, and the
black precipitate formed was separated, and was found              to   bepure

sulphuret of silver.    The liquor was concentrated by exposure to the
air, and filtered to separate the sulphur which was deposited; a little
potash was then added, and it was evaporated to dryness; acetic acid
was added to saturate the excess of potash, and it was again dried.
   To determine whether the saline residue contained a bromide, a
small portion of it was treated in a tube with pure nitric acid, and
a yellow liquid was immediately obtained.         Another portion was
mixed with peroxide of manganese, and the mixture was placed in
a glass tube; a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid were added,
and when gently heated, red vapours were immediately disengaged,
and after some time there were deposited on the sides of the tube
small drops of a red liquid. The existence of bromine was there
fore evident, and it was proved that the bromide was unmixed with
iodide.    Bromide of silver appears to be rare at Huelgoeth; but it
may be readily distinguished from the chloride by its greenish or
canary-yellow colour, which is characteristic of            remarkable                     it.       It    is

THE  subject of mixed gases is of great importance in
  many physical researches; and, in particular, the atmo
sphere being a mixture of gases, the inquiry into              constitu                       its
tion essentially depends upon the knowledge               the laws ac                    of

               which elastic fluids combine        the same volume.         in
But   although    the subject   has been often   discussed,         still                           it   is
embarrassed               by
                    several difficulties which          very desirable       it    is
to clear up.

Carrickfergus, by Mr. Wm.Young of this town; and consisted
of a large dorsal vertebra and some smaller ones from the
extremities, but in such a position as rendered it doubtful
whether they belonged to the same individual. They were
easily recognized to be vertebrae of an Ichthyosaurus, by the
compressed form of the body, the double concavity of the
articulating surfaces, by the small pits on each side of the
spinal canal, and by the articulating tubercles for the attach

is an inch and a half, and the diameter of           end four inches.    its

 Differential Equations applicable to the Motion of Fluids. 85
that the partial differential equations of fluid motion (namely,
those in which the principal variable is usually designated by
 4) cannot be generally applied, unless the variation of the co
 ordinates from one point to another of space at a given time,
 be restricted to take place in the direction of the motion. The
 necessity for this limitation, which might reasonably be ob
jected to if the equations were general, arises from the limited
 nature of those equations. Were we in possession of the most
 general equations no such limitation would be required. In
 support of this view I proceed to point out the method of find
ing the general partial differential equations of fluid motion.
   Let the pressure (p) and density (p) of the fluid be related
to each other by the equation p = k p.         Let u, v, w be re
 spectively the resolved parts of the velocity, in the direction

   To   render these equations applicable to instances of fluid
motion, it is requisite to transform them into others contain
ing partial differential coefficients of a single variable. This
has been done in the case in which u da + v dy-H w dº is an
exact differential, with respect to space, of a function of w, y, z,
and t, by substituting d 4 for this quantity. The views I have

detailed in the Number of this Magazine for last June (S. 3,
 vol. xviii. p. 477), led me to infer that this is only a limited
 case, and that in every instance of fluid motion essentially
 different from that of a solid, u da + v d y + w dºz may be
 made integrable by a factor.      Independently of those views,
 it is clear that the  reasoning   is not conducted in the most
 general manner by                that quantity integrable per                                 se,
  andit   isremarkable that no one hitherto has traced the con
 sequences      of   introducing     a   factor.
   Let    us   therefore suppose             N   to   be the factor, and let

     important to the right understanding of Fernel's operation, and
     to the discussion of the point at issue. The passage is as fol
     lows:–After describing the manner in which he ascertained,
     by observations of the sun's altitude, that he was exactly one
    degree to the north of Paris, and stating that, according to the
    report of the country people, the distance of the place from
     Paris was twenty-five leagues, Fernel adds (I quote from
    Snellius, Eratosthenes Batavus, p. 115),
        “Nec tamen vulgi supputatione satiatus, vehiculum quod
     Parrhisios recta via petebat conscendi, in eoque residens tota
    via 17,024 fere rotae circumvolutiones collegi, vallibus et mon
    tibus ad acqualitatem quoad facultas nostra ferebat, redactis.
    Erat autem rota, illius diameter 6 pedum, serque paulo magis
    digitorum geometricorum, ob idque ejus ambitus pedum eral
    20, seu passuum 4 ; his ergo revolutionibus per 4 ductis, repperi
    passus 68,096; qui miliaria sunt Italica 68, cum passibus 96,
    malui tamen hos passus in passus 95 cum quarto convertere,
    ne quaepiam fractio foret in terrae diametro praftgenda.”
        Here, then, is a perfectly clear and explicit account of the
    whole of the geodetical part of the operation. Aftermaking adis
    cretionary allowance for the inequalities of the road, the wheel
    of the vehicle in which he travelled was found to have made
-    17,024 revolutions. The diameter of the wheel was measured
    and found to be six geometrical feet and six
    is one-sixteenth of a     foot),  and a little over;            "..
                                                                 (the digit
                                                           whence the cir
    cumference of the wheel was twenty feet, or four paces,
    and the whole distance 17,024 x 4 = 68,096 paces of five
    feet each, that is to say, 340,480 feet.          The primary mea
    sure is therefore in    feet,  and the   question   to be decided re
    solves itself into this, What is the equivalent of the measure
    which Fernel calls a geometrical foot?
        Now the most obvious and probable supposition                     is,
                                                                    that the
    foot used     by  Fernel     inmeasuring the diameter                of

  the numbers which he gives it is easy to see that he proceeded
  in this manner: observing that his value of the degree would
  give the diameter nearly equal to 7800 miles of 1000 paces

          he assumes it to be 7800 miles eractly; whence, taking
  the ratio of the circumference to the diameter to be as 22 to
  7, he finds the circumference = 24,514 miles and 285; paces,
  and consequently one degree = 68,095+ paces nearly, that                                                      is,

  paces (of five feet) make 56,746 toises and four feet (the toise

  57,070,           as
                stated      Lalande by                  in to
                                           the passage above quoted, and

Mr. Galloway's Remarks on Fernel's Measure of a Degree. 93
also in his Astronomie (2638).           In adopting the correction of
Lalande, Delambre probably did not think it worth while to
verify the numbers.
     Lalande refers to the Mémoires for 1714 as the authority
for his correction.         The volume indicated contains a paper
by La Hire, in which the reduction of the toise is simply men
tioned with a reference to a former volume, but a circumstan
 tial account of the matter is given by Paucton (Métrologie,
 p. 18).
      But to return to the subject in hand. The case as respects
 Montucla and Delambre stands thus:—(I quote the dates, as
 Mr. De Morgan says the confusion is older than Delambre
 and Lalande.)
      1. Fernel, in 1528, declares the length of a degree of any
 great circle of the earth to be 68,0954 paces of five feet each.
      2. Picard, in 1671, assumes that the foot used by Fernel
 was the ordinary Paris foot of six to the toise, and accord
 ingly states the result to be 56,746 toises, which is the num
 ber given by Montucla.
      3. Lalande, in 1787, shows that in consequence of the al
  teration of the toise in 1668, which Picard had overlookèd or
  not thought it worth while to notice, the result obtained by
  Fernel was 57,070 toises, which is the number given by De
  lambre in his Astronomiel.
      Thus it appears that Montucla and Delambre, instead of
  stating “a very different result” from Fernel, state precisely
  the same result but in different terms; on the assumption, how
  ever, that Fernel gives the diameter of his wheel in Paris feet.
       It is now necessary to advert to the passage in which Fernel
   states the result of his measure to be 68 Italian miles and 96
   paces. This point has been discussed by Lalande (Mém., 1787),
   who remarks that Fernel's Italian mile of 68 to the degree is
   in fact a measure used in some parts of Italy, but that the
   mile differs widely in different parts of the country, varying
   from 48 to 81 in the degree; and from this circumstance and
   the manner in which Fernel compares his result with that
   of the Arabians, he concludes that what he says about Italian
    miles must be abandoned; in other words, has no definite
    meaning apart from the expression of the measure in feet.
    Riccioli, who lived nearer the time of Fernel, and will be ad
    mitted to be an unexceptionable authority, confirms this de
    scription of the vagueness of the Italian mile. “Italica mil
    liaria incredibilem habent varietatem, tum in modo ea compo
       *  Delambre has given a detailed account of Fernel's measure in the Hi
    stoire de l’Astronomie du Moyen Age.

 94     Mr. Galloway's Remarks                          on Fernel's Measure                   of a      Degree.
 nendi ac metandi, tum in quantitate.” (Geographiae et Hy
 drographiae Reformatae, lib. xii. 1661, p. 48.) It is obvious,
 therefore, that the expression Italian mile, unless accompanied
 with some explanation, or reference to some other standard,
 conveys no precise information.          Fernel's statement, taken
 altogether, seems to suggest the idea that he used the expres
 sion, not for the purpose of defining the foot which was the ori
 ginal measure, but as a popular term, familiar to the writers of
 that age, and therefore likely to give a clearer notion of a large
 magnitude than would be conveyed by expressing it in feet.
    The geometrical pace participates in        the vagueness       the    all                           of
 Italian mile. Riccioli makes frequent mention             the Roman                         of

support      this view, but the following may suffice.

    Norwood,       the “Epistle Dedicatory” prefixed
                        in                                     his Sea                            to
man's Practice    (1678),   says “the    way     finding  distances        of                                 at
sea     rather opinionative and conjectural than certain, being
        is
founded upon this supposition, that the compass             the world                         of
in  any great circle     21,600 Italian miles (as they call them),
                                   is
and that such        Italian mile contains 1000 paces, and every
                             an
in of
    those paces five English feet.” Thus the common practice
    England, according         Norwood, was  to    call 5000 English            to
feet an Italian mile.
   Paucton (Métrologie,         179) cites the following passage

  ancient Roman foot of the time of Vespasian, and conse
  quently that a Roman mile, or 5000 Roman feet, must con

  barley grown in Lombardy to be of the same size as those of
  barley grown in Arabia, the ancient Roman mile is to the
 Arabian mile in the ratio of 400,000 to 576,000, or of 1000

 whence the Arabian degree is 563 x 1440 = 81,600 Ro

 be to the ancient Roman foot in the ratio of 1520 to 1200
 (p. 46), that          is,15.   Multiplying, therefore, 81,600

 Mr. Galloway's                    Remarks on Fernel's Measure                    of a      Degree.          97
of Budaeus, De   Asse, &c., had been recently published; and ac
 cording to Snellius (Eratos. Bat., p. 132), Budaeus expressly
 makes the Roman foot the same as the Pied de Roi.        Fernel
was not   likely to be better  informed, and in such case could
have no reason for stating the dimensions of his wheel in terms
of a foreign standard.
   With respect to the statement of Weidler, on which Mr.
De Morgan has raised some questions, namely, that Fernel's
measure was finished in 1550, Lalande's remark may be re
garded as a satisfactory reply: c’est encore une erreur.
   Although I have already trespassed too far on your space,
it would scarcely be right to close these remarks without
observing, that neither Picard, Montucla, Lalande, nor De
 lambre attach the slightest value to Fernel's measure, but

                              of the Heat of Combustion.                                          99
chemical combination is the same as calculation founded on
these facts would lead us to expect, no reasonable doubt can
be entertained that it also is the product of resistance to                                 elec
tric conduction.
   3.  In studying the character of the heat of combustion, the
first point was to determine the intensities of the affinities of
different combustibles for oxygen.          For this purpose I have,
in accordance with the views which were first stated by Davy,
and have since been adopted by the most eminent electricians,
made use of the measure of these intensities which is afforded
by the electric current.
   4. I had not proceeded far before some curious phaenomena
were observed, which, though not very well understood, have
long been known” to electricians.                             I
                                             shall notice these first,
because of their important bearing upon subsequent reason
ings and conclusions.
   5. I was working with an arrangement consisting of iron,
platinized silver, and dilute sulphuric acid.        The circuit was
closed by a galvanometer, the coil of which consisted of 119
turns of thin-silked copper wire, forming a rectangle, measu
ring 1 foot by 6 inches. The needle indicated a pretty con
stant deviation of 20°, but on moving the platinized silver
backwards and forwards the needle advanced gradually to 40°,
where it was kept for some time by continuing the agitation.
As soon as the motion of the platinized silver was disconti
nued, the needle resumed                    its
                                   former position.    Similar effects
were produced                by
                      stirring the liquid, and thus causing

milar results, but       found that whenever

showing the increase of intensity arising from the presence of
oxygen.     Some dilute sulphuric acid was agitated with chlo
rine until the former had taken up as much of the gas as it
could.    By pouring a solution of sulphate of oxide of silver
into the liquid,              I
                    now precipitated chloride of silver, leaving
sulphuric acid and oxygen in solution.        When a pair, con
sisting of platinized silver and iron, was placed in the acid thus
prepared, the galvanometer was permanently deflected 50°, and
by agitating the platinized silver the needle advanced as far as
60°. When a piece of amalgamated zinc was substituted for
the iron the permanent deflection of the needle was 65°, and
by agitating the negative element as before, the needle ad
vanced to 70°. Had the same pairs been immersed in a sim
ple solution of sulphuric acid, the permanent deflections would
have been no greater than 30° and 68°.
   13. Similar results were obtained with the solution of chlo
rine, as might have been anticipated from         strong affinity for       its
hydrogen.
   14. From the above experiments, we see that the agitation
of the negative element       productiveit      increase         of

 this way was associated in dilute sulphuric acid with a piece
of iron, the needle would deviate 63}” for some time, and then
gradually decline until it took up a permanent situation at
294°.     By experimenting in the same way with amalgamated
zinc as a positive element, I had a transitory deflection of 76°,
and a permanent deflection of 63°.
    22. Very trifling transitory effects were obtained by the im
mersion of iron, when that metal was associated with amalga
mated zinc. But this might have been anticipated, because
the transitory current is owing to the presence of oxygen on
the negative plate, and it is obvious that the hydrogen evolved
by the local action of the iron, would, whilst in a nascent state,
combine with that oxygen, and thus prevent a great part of it
from exercising any influence upon the intensity of the current.
    23. An experiment was also made with an arrangement of
copper, amalgamated zinc, and dilute sulphuric acid.        It was
able to deflect the needle 51°   pretty  permanently.   On wash
ing and drying the copper, and experimenting as in (16.), I
observed a transitory deflection of 72°.     This experiment de
serves  attention,  because it shows that the transitory current
occasioned by the copper is the same as that exhibited by pla
timized silver when experimented with in the same way (20.).
I  take it as an argument, that when copper is in       best state               its
it forms with amalgamated zinc battery         intense
                                                 a        the plaas                as
tinized silver.
    24. That the transitory currents which we are discussing
are not occasioned               by
                             the diffusion                 of

                                                        voltaic action,                          is
obvious from the fact that (when the            proper   precautions are
observed) they are not produced                       by
                                              the agitation (8.),                          or    by

transitory currents did not entirely disappear as was antici
pated.     The gas, though prepared carefully and in different
ways, could not be obtained perfectly pure, and when exposed
to an alkaline solution, gºth of it would remain uncondensed.
In order therefore to remove any free oxygen which the gas
might contain, I exposed it during two days and two nights to
the action of a stick of phosphorus.                After this, immersion
caused   no,  or  atmost,    very   trivial  transitory  effects; but on ad
mitting only one per cent. of oxygen they became very consi
derable,      a striking example of the power possessed by metals
 of collecting and condensing oxygen upon their surfaces.                     I
do not bring forward this experiment as a proof of the entire
 non-action of carbonic acid, because the phosphorus was found
 to have decomposed it partially.

                      to

 106             Mr.   J. P. Joule on   the Electric Origin
   Intensities   of the Affinities which unite        bodies with Orygen.
    34.    In order to ascertain the intensities of galvanic arrange
 ments, we may either use a galvanometer furnished with a short
 and thick wire, or with a long and thin wire (within certain limits
 (14.). In the former case the calculations must be conducted
 on the principles of Ohm; in the latter it is only necessary to
 take care that the resistances of the pairs under comparison are
 pretty nearly equal, in order that the deviations of the needle
 may be depended upon in calculating the intensity of the cur
 rent.   I have adopted the latter plan on account of the supe
 rior facilities which it presents.
   35. Affinity of zinc <U+017F>or oxygen.—From (32.) we have the                     in
tensity of the action of zinc = 0°.056 Q; and the intensity re
  uired for the electrolysis of water = 0°029 Q.           Hence
29 : 56  ::1, the affinity of hydrogen,  : 1-93, that of zinc for
oxygen.
   36. Affinity of iron for oxygen, likewise obtained from (32.),
is 1:27, for 268 : 340 :: 1: 1:27.
   37. Affinity of potassium for oxygen.—Twenty grains of
potassium were combined with about ten ounces of mercury.
The amalgam was poured into a wooden cup, into the bottom
of which a copper wire connected with the galvanometer (5.)
had been let.   At about half an inch above the surface of the
amalgam I secured a piece of platinum, also in connexion with
the galvanometer.    On pouring dilute sulphuric acid into the
cup the needle was deflected 74° (= 0°-05 Q) during three
successive minutes, but the local action of the amalgam was so
vigorous that at the end of this interval of time most of the
potassium was dissolved, and the needle declined very fast.
On treating 20 grains of zinc in precisely the same manner,                     I
had a deviation
                               - -
                   of 49° (= 0°-0152 Q).
                         k   h   0:05,
                                                      Hence
and                      z     –
                             h = 0.0152,
whence                        152 k = 500      2   – 348 h.
But from (35.), z = 1.93, and           h   = 1; therefore    k, the affinity
of po assium, = 4:06.                                                            -
   38.    It
         is necessary, however, to pay attention to the circum
stances under which the experiments were made, in order to
obtain correct ideas concerning the above intensities of affinity.
The increase of the intensity of the voltaic apparatus by heat
is by no means great; and as            all
                                      the experiments were con
           common temperatures,               no
                                        regard need     paid
                                                              bybe
ducted    at                                                              to   it.
But then the intensities       of
                             affinity were obtained    comparing
currents which had been produced under peculiar circum
stances with regard      to
                        the condition          of

gaseous state; whilst in the other, the hydrogen, by combining
with free and condensed oxygen, did not escape.        Now we
shall see from the following experiments that electric intensity
is expended in the act of converting a body into the gaseous
State.

                                   I
  scale, and over it placed a heap of fine zinc turnings, weigh
  ing 50 grains.               I
                     now ignited the phosphorus, and plunged
  the scale into the inner jar.  After the combustion had termi
  nated, and the heat thereby evolved had been evenly distri
  buted throughout the water by stirring, the increase of tempe
  rature was noted.    The contents of the scale were then thrown
 into dilute sulphuric acid, and the volume of hydrogen thereby
 evolved indicated the quantity (generally about 15 grains)
 which had not been burnt.      Two-tenths of a degree of heat
 were deducted from the observed heat, on account of the phos
 phorus, and an allowance having been made, on account of
 the capacity of glass for heat, the results were reduced to the
 standard of one pound of water.
    53. The mean of several experiments conducted in the above
 manner, showed that the heat evolved by the combustion of
 32.3 grains of zinc is able to increase the temperature of a
 pound of water by 10°8.
      54. The heat evolved by the combustion of iron was ascer
   tained in a similar way. The iron was in the state of fine
   wire, and that portion of it that was not burnt was carefully
   collected, weighed, and deducted from the original quantity.
  The mean of several trials indicated that 28 grains could                                  in
  crease the temperature of a pound of water by 9°48.
      55. Heat evolved by the combustion of potassium.—This metal,
  in pretty large lumps, was introduced into an atmosphere com
  posed of equal bulks of oxygen and air.            I then introduced
  a stout iron wire, sharpened at the end, into the jar, and with
  it I cut the potassium into small pieces. Under this treat
  ment it soon became so soft, that every time the rod was lifted
 it would draw out a string of metal. In this state it often                                 ig
 nited, and the experiment was spoiled on account of the par
 tial formation of peroxide.         However, by careful manage
        I
 ment, succeeded in making some good experiments, in which
nearly      all
              the potassium was converted into potassa; and the

   57. We shall now proceed to examine how far the theory
of resistance to electric conduction agrees with the above ex
perimental results.
   58. We have seen (47.), (48.) and (49.) that the intensities
of the affinities which unite gaseous oxygen with zinc, iron,
potassium and gaseous hydrogen, are as 1:32, 1:18, 2:05 and 1;
and the proportional quantities of heat which were generated
by the combustion of the equivalents of these bodies are 10°-8,
9°48, 17°-6, and 8°36, or 1:29, 1:13, 2-105 and 1, a ratio
which is very nearly the same as that of the intensities just                                                                 .
given.   Hence we see that the quantities of heat which are
evolved by the combustion of the equivalents of bodies are pro
portional to the intensities of their affinities for oxygen.  Now
I proved  in my   former  paper*   that a similar law obtains in
the voltaic apparatus, in consequence of           heat being pro                 its
duced        by
             resistance                to
                              conduction.      And hence we have                                                      an
argument that the heat            combustion has the same origin.

 x 15°12 = 44°74 of heat. But in (70.) of my former paper,
I proved that the same quantity of heat should always (ac
cording to the theory which refers the whole of the heating
power of the voltaic apparatus to resistance to the electric cur
rent) be produced by a given quantity and intensity of electro
lysis, whether the resistance opposed to the current be small
or great. Wherefore, the heat, which on these principles
ought to be generated by the combustion of 3:234 equivalents
of zinc, is 44°74; or, in other words, one equivalent, or 32-3
grains of zinc, should generate heat sufficient to increase the
temperature of a pound of water by 13°83.
   61. Now, as I have before stated, the quantities of heat
evolved by the combustion of the equivalents of bodies, ought,
according to the theory of resistance to electric conduction,
to be proportional to the intensities of their affinities for gaseous
oxygen. These, in the cases of zinc, iron, potassium, and hy
drogen, are 1:32, 1:18, 2:05 and 1. Hence 13°83, 12°36,
21°47, and 10°:47, are the quantities of heat which ought, ac
cording to our theory, to be produced by the combustion of
32.3 grains of zinc, 28 grains of iron, 40 grains of potassium,
                                                     -
and 1 grain of hydrogen.
   62. By comparing these results of theory with the quantities
of heat, 10°.8, 9°48, 17°-6, and 8°36°, which were (53–56.)
obtained from experiment, it will be seen that the former ex
ceed the latter by about one quarter. Considering the difficulty
of preventing some loss of heat, in consequence of the escape
of air from the mouth of the inner jar (51.) during the first mo
ments of combustion, &c., it will, I think, be admitted that
experiment agrees with the theory as well as could have been
expected.

 ance to conduction be great, as it most probably is when po
 tassium is slowly converted into potassa by the action of a
mixture of oxygen and common air; or little, as it probably is
when a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen is exploded; still the
quantity of heat evolved remains proportional to the number
of equivalents which have been consumed, and the intensity of
 their affinity for gaseous oxygen.
   64. That the heat evolved by other chemical actions, besides
that which is called combustion, is caused by resistance to elec
tric conduction,      I  have no doubt.     I  cannot, however, enter
in the present paper upon the experimental proof of the fact.

XVIII.       On the Development of the Cosines and Sines of Mul

       the Philosophical Magazine for August 1841, [S. 3. vol.
IN   xix.] Mr. Booth has developed the cosine of a multiple arc
in descending powers of the cosine of the simple arc, by the
application of a new theorem in the calculus of finite differ
ences, and has demonstrated that cos n 6 cannot be so ex
panded when n is either negative or fractional.
   As this is the case, it seems sufficient to present the expan
sion of the integral multiple in an easier way.
         cos (n + 1) 6    = 2 cos 0. cos n 6 — cos (n -      1) 6:

XIX.         Additional Note on the History of Fernel's Measure
              of a Degree. By Professor DE MoRGAN.
 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    GENTLEMEN,
Toing,my which
         last communication on this subject I add the follow
                I cannot help thinking is completely decisive
on the subject. You will remember that the assertion made
by me     is,
           that Fernel's 68.096 Italian miles are not (as De
lambre and others make them) more than                English miles,      69
but really  less than 64%   English   miles.     my  last left upon  In          I
any one who would dispute this assertion the onus             proving              of
that Fernel's pace was longer than five English feet:             will                     I
now  disprove    this alternative.
   Fernel himself has table       a           of
                                     his own measures,      which,               in            as
was usual,        he
                 makes the geometrical pace            five feet, and to   be
the Italian mile 1000     paces;   and      always styles he
                                                           his degree

          The Rev. D. Williams                    on the Devonian System.                             117
as 68-096         Italian miles.            He mentions besides a                        common mile
which he says is of 1000 common paces.          But of these com
mon paces, which are his own and those of                men      or                all             of
dinary stature,        says that five make six geometrical paces.
                          he
His words are, “Horum autem passuum (qui mei cujusque                                     et
hominis staturae mediocris sunt)quinquesex geometricos passus
efficiunt.”    Hence, according       him, the common pace
                                                  to              sia,                               is
of  his feet,     the simple step (half
                   or                       the pace)       of
                                                          three feet.                    is
Now     ifthis foot were       long    as
                                        the English   as
                                                    foot,  this gives
too   much,   for       well known that the
                        it   is                yard        long and                 is    a
forced step for man     a         of
                             moderate stature, whose walking step
is rather under than over                   30
                                 inches; and Fernel says      walked                          he
from the    palace     St. Denis and found
                          to                   5950 common paces,    it
and also the whole length            Paris, whichof     found 2110                  he
paces. But           to
                    make   68,096    geometrical  paces   exceed                                          69V
English miles, his step must have exceeded            English yard              an
and     2%
        inches. There      then this alternative:—if his walking

of the Old Red Sandstone which fills that whole intermediate
position.”    Athenaeum, No. 736, page 937.
   Admitting the validity of the organic test for the sake of
argument, it has not yet been shown that the Devon and
Cornish organic fossils are of the requisite intermediate type
or proportion, taking the mountain limestone as a standard
of reference, to justify the identification contended for; nay
more,    Icontend that when the elements of the premises are
fairly distributed, the result will tend rather to impeach the
Old Red hypothesis than to confirm                                          it.

Mr. Lonsdale however relieves himself from this untoward
result,     bypretty broadly stating that “Professor Sedgwick
and Mr. Murchison have proved for the first time that the
culm-measures       the central part
                        of             Devon are newer than     of
any    of

120   The Rev. D. Williams's Proofs that                             the Devonian
age of the carboniferous series*.”                  I
                                        earnestly invite and en
treat Mr. Lonsdale to adduce the     proofs  in opposition to an
array of structural facts which I purpose to detail in the course
of this communication.     I can well anticipate that the results
of six years' patient and cautious and rigid investigation of the
structure of Devon and Cornwall by myself will go for nothing,
or that the great facts I have already announced, or am now
about to advert to, will be considered at present as not worth
refuting. The indifferent arbitration between Mr. Lonsdale's
proofs and mine, I confidently leave to free and just and
generous minds hereafter, when geology, under happier au
spices and in whiter days, shall be something more than a mere
conventional thing of arbitrary and false hypotheses of facts
perverted to d priori views, or forced and tortured to artificial
adaptations; till then I patiently bide my time; and having
discharged a duty         I
                       owe to truth, it will be indifferent to me
whatever pleasantries of identification may be indulged in or
received. The twenty-mile diameter of the Devon and Cornwall
beds may be designated as Old Red or New Red, or Oolite
or Chalk, for aught I care, for either would be equally true.
   The meaning of that remarkable hypothesis is sufficiently
obvious.    Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison assume
the Silurian and Cambrian deposits to be the base-line of
geology as a system, that therefore                      all
                                            the formations     the                               of

 Coddon Hill grits, which constitute the lower division        base

line of the culm-measures in the north of Devon, are brought
up in the south through the upper culm-measures, throwing
them, and at times irregular portions of the overlying killas,
off on either shoulder with a counter or reversed dip north
and south, as I have before explained at Ashton and Doddis
comb Leigh. This great dynamical axis extends from Dod
discomb Leigh, near Exeter on the east, to the western ex
tremity of South Tregear Down, at Tor-Park Water on the
north-west of Launceston, where, by a moderate declination, it
becomes depressed below the upper culm-measures; and be
tween this and the sea, a distance of ten miles, is only met
with again on this range in one instance, which I shall shortly
notice.   Now if I had nothing more to advance, the evidences
connected with this great southern axis never could be shaken,
but wherever nature proclaims any great truth she is sure to
be lavish of her proofs. The Coddon Hill grits of the north
of Devon, with their Posidonia'limestones, are brought up on
the south, and in the range I have mentioned.      No one dis
putes the fact; but they are protruded with a reversed dip
through the upper culm-measures, and do not trough up from be
low them, in the way they ascend in the north of Devon. The
southern parallel, or fractured counterpart of the upper culm
measures, ranges from the south of South Tregear Down,
branching       off
            there from the floriferous mass, and extends     in                                by
Launceston and Heathfield     Dartmoor. Now that southern

range, repeatedly alternating with, and finally underlying, the
killas, altogether negatives the supposition, that the killas

 128          The Rev. D. Williams's Proofs that                                     the Devonian
  Survey was necessarily so limited. That accomplished geolo
 gist, however, departed somewhat from his characteristic cau
 tion, when (pp. 195 and 196) he states that “the Petherwin
 slates rise from under the black carbonaceous shales;” and                                                      I
 venture to hope, on re-perusing the section on the “Petherwin
 Group,” he will correct the only blemish I have noticed in his
 admirable work. The evidences about Landlake are of them

 black greasy shales and grits to the depth of forty fathoms,

    At Bittaford Bridge the Coddon grit dips S.S.E., the killas

 in his works,) “found out the Almighty to perfection,” will
 be left to the Word and his own free-will to form his judge

 friend Mr. Panizzi that they were in possession of a large
 number of notes by L. da Vinci, consisting of manuscript
 scraps on various subjects. These are bound up in a book,
 which was shown to me. It consists of loose memoranda prin
 cipally on mechanics, and is written in Italian, from right to
 left, after the Oriental fashion, as if it had been written with
  the left-hand: any Christian who wishes to make it out, must
 use a looking-glass, and examine the reflexion of the page,
 instead of the page itself. At a glance I was struck with the
  frequent occurrence of the sign + in arithmetical processes,
  with an occasional use of — ; but on looking more closely, I
  found that + always stood for the numeral 4, which at the
  beginning of the book is a cross with two adjacent points
 joined, and gradually degenerates into nothing but the cross,
  sometimes with one of the corners a little crooked.      For ex
  ample (p. 221 of the manuscript), we see (putting Da Vinci's
  written numerals into common type, except in the case of
- the 4)       3 — 1       2

   This sign of division x (a very significant one, evidently
 imagined from the process) is used throughout: but the acci
 dental mark = by which equality is here denoted in effect,
 does not occur again, or it might have been supposed that
 Da Vinci was the first who used the sign =. Other instances

very much with their proximity to the sun.                      Laplace has
adopted the number without alteration.                    In order to obtain
approximately the mass of Mercury, which has never yet been
determined, I have first substituted the most accurate values
of the other masses. Thanks to your excellent observations,
which are completely confirmed by Bessel (Bessel finds the
mass of Jupiter = Tot; arr), we are quite clear about the most
important of them, that of Jupiter.               The others have a smaller
influence even if they are erroneous.               I have then used a dou
ble calculation.        In the first I have assumed that, till 1835       in
clusive, the earlier determined elements were quite accurate.
In fact the errors of 1832 and 1835 are small. With this as
sumption I have sought to remove the apparent error in 1838,
by an alteration of the mass of Mercury, and an alteration of
the constant of the resistance. This succeeded perfectly, and
I  obtained a slightly changed constant of the resistance, and
a mass of Mercury = xrºgry, about £rds of the former mass.
In the second calculation               f have endeavoured to remove the
errors of 1832 and 1835, as well as that of 1838 (each being
previously treated as if it had arisen from an erroneous time
of perihelion-passage), by an alteration of the same elements,
namely, the mass of Mercury, and the constant of the resist
ance. Here remain likewise only small differences, if the con
stant of the resistance is left quite unchanged, and the mass of
Mercury assumed at raglrrr, or about ºths of that of                     La
#.          This last determination            I intend to adopt as a basis
 or accurate comparison, and correct it more closely. It has
the truly remarkable peculiarity that with it the densities are
          =   1- 12         Q   =    0.92      3  = 1.00      6 = 0.95
       G) =  0.25           1 = 0.24           H =  0: 14     H = 0.24;
consequently the solar system appears to be composed of two
sets of bodies, whose densities are either nearly = 1, or = },
and which are separated by the interval between Mars and
Jupiter, where there exists no large planet, but only the four
small ones.                                                            -

I

    HAVE the honour to acquaint you with the arrival of
         Majesty's ship under my command, and the Terror,
        Her
under   my orders, this afternoon at this port.
    Ihave further to report to you, for the information of my
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that in accordance
with the intentions expressed in my despatch to you, dated
from Hobart Town on the 11th of November last, I proceeded
to Auckland Islands, and satisfactorily accomplished a com
plete series of magnetometric observations on the important
term-day of November last.
   Under             all
             the circumstances,   appeared      me, that  wouldit                   to               it

  142                 Capt. James C. Ross on the Discoveries
 of greater magnetic intensity, might be                       over and de
                                                                         passed
    termined, and directly between the tracks of the Russian na
   vigator Bellinghausen, and our own Captain James Cook; and
   after entering the Antarctic circle to steer S.W. towards the
    Pole, rather than attempt to approach it directly from the
   north, on the unsuccessful footsteps of my predecessors.
       Accordingly, on leaving Auckland Islands on the 12th De
   cember, we proceeded to the southward, touching for a few
   days at Campbell Island for magnetic purposes; and, after
   passing among many icebergs to the southward of 63° lati
   tude, we made the Pack Edge, and entered the Antarctic cir
   cle on the 1st day of January 1841.
       This pack presented none of those formidable characters
   which I had been led to expect from the accounts of the Ame
  ricans and French; but the circumstances were sufficiently
  unfavourable to deter me from entering it at this time, and a
  gale from the northward interrupted our operations for three
  or four days. On the 5th January we again made the pack,
 about 100 miles to the eastward, in latitude 66° 45' south, and
  longitude 174° 16' east, and although the wind was blowing
                                                                         i.

we neared the land, some exposed patches of rock appeared,
and steering towards a small bay, for the purpose of effecting
a landing, we found the shore so thickly lined for some miles

            The changes of horizontal and vertical force, and of the total intensity, are expressed in
         terms of the whole forces, and are uncorrected for variations of temperature, the precise cor
         rections for which have not been yet determined, but the extreme corrections on this account
         would probably fall short of .0003 in the horizontal, and '0005 in the vertical force.
            Increasing numbers denote an increase of force.

          Magnetic Disturbance on September 25th and 26th, 1841.                                                     151
     Remarks relative to the Magnetic Disturbance at Toronto on the
                    25th and 26th of September, 1841.
   The disturbances appear to have commenced at Toronto nearly at the same
absolute time as at Greenwich, and to have been generally simultaneous at
both stations.   Additional observations were taken at Greenwich early in the
morning of the 25th, the needles being in an agitated state, and an aurora be
ing visible.   Though additional observations were not commenced at Toronto
at this time, the difference between the regular observations at 2 and 4 A.M.,
Gött. mean    time, show a considerable disturbance; the change of declina
tion between the hours of 2 and 4 amounting to 15'-3; the change of horizontal
force to 00444 of its whole value; and of vertical force to 00202 of its whole
value.    The additional observations at Greenwich were soon after discon
tinued, the disturbance appearing to be over.
   The readings at 10 A.M., Gött. mean time, exhibited so great a change at
both stations, that extra observations were resumed at Greenwich, and com
menced at Toronto.
   The additional observations at Toronto were continued without intermission
for 20 hours, from 10 A.M., Gött. mean time on the 25th, until 6 A.M., Gött.
mean time on the 26th, each instrument being observed at intervals of 5 mi
nutes, in the following order, viz.: Declin. 00" O'—H. F. 2m 00"—W. F. 3m
30°–Declin. 5m 00°, &c.
  The disturbance in the first hour (10 to 11) was not yery great, compared
with those that followed; but in the next 5 minutes, viz. from 11h 00" to
11" 05", the change of declination amounted to 19.6; and between 11h 27m
and 11" 52" the horizontal force had decreased by 01030 of      whole value.                           its
These changes are specially noted,                              consequence             ofthere apparently having
       no
        corresponding disturbance                             at at in
been                                                            Greenwich.

mean time:            its
               general effect appears         have been that    causing    decrease               of             a
of easterly variation and                 of

five hours longer than those     Greenwich; and during these five hours

second disturbance was observed even greater than the preceding.
   Between    and 10 P.M., Gött. mean time, the disturbance had been much
                 4
lessened;     then increased rapidly, and the changes between

the variations       the inclination and total intensity are directly observed.

As  the two magnetometers were not observed precisely simultaneously, the
changes        of
            inclination and total intensity can only      regarded     approximate, be                 as

152         Magnetic Disturbance on September 25th and 26th, 1841.
though the difference in the times of observation having been only 1% minute,
the errors occasioned thereby are probably seldom very great.
   The observations of the second disturbance show a striking connexion be
tween the changes of declination and intensity, an increase of force corre
sponding to an increase of easterly declination, and vice versä : the same con
nexion was observed in the Toronto observations of the 29th of May, 1840.
   Auroras.-An aurora was visible at Greenwich both in the morning and
evening of the 25th.   At Toronto the morning was heavily clouded, with rain,
consequently no aurora could be seen : in the evening the aurora was visible
at intervals from 7 to 10 P.M., Toronto time, or 1 to 5 A.M., Gött. time, the
period of the second great disturbance; the remainder of the night was
heavily clouded.    A gale of wind occurred on the following day (26th), and
in the  evening another aurora was seen.
   The eartreme changes of the declination, horizontal, and vertical force, du
ring the two disturbances, were as follows:—of the declination, 1° 05'; of the
horizontal force, "02438 of its whole value; and of the vertical force, 0.1288
of   its

   Postscript, Dec. 14th-Whilst these pages were in the press, I received,
through the kindness of Mr. Caldecott, the abstract of the observations made
in September at the Magnetic Observatory instituted by the Rajah of Tra
vancore, at Trevandrum, in lat. 8° 30' 35'2" N., and long. 5" 7" 59° E.; by
which I am enabled to state, that an unusual magnetic disturbance took place
in India simultaneously with those observed in England and America: al
though, in consequence of the easterly position of Trevandrum, the com
mencement only of the disturbance was observed there.              Each observatory

  than the average of the preceding twenty-four days of the month, by the
  quantities shown in the above table; and at the Göttingen hours of noon,
  2, 4, and 6 P.M., when great disturbances were taking place at Greenwich
 and Toronto, the observations at Trevandrum show a decrease of intensity
  much exceeding the usual fluctuations.    Mr. Caldecott has annexed the fol
 lowing remark to the readings at these hours:—“These irregular readings
 “examined into at the hours they were made, and found not to arise from
 “any instrumental irregularity.—J. C.”                                    -
    On the 26th, being Sunday, no observations were made; but the following
 table, exhibiting the mean position of the magnetometer in each day in Sep
 tember, shows that during the remaining days of the month the horizontal
 intensity did not return to               its
                               previous average value; corresponding with the
 remark deduced             by
                     Professor Kreil from ten perturbations observed  Prague,                             at
 namely, that “the horizontal intensity remains weaker for some time after the
 “great oscillations have ceased, and only gradually resumes         ordinary                           its

156          Magnetic Disturbance on September 25th and 26th, 1841.
this weakened state remained, with little change, until 2 A.M. on the 25th,
when the force again augmented, and had regained about half the original
loss at 10 A.M., the period when the disturbances at Greenwich and Toronto
occasioned extra observations to be commenced at those observatories.                   At
this   epoch  another  great   diminution of the horizontal force took        place  at St.
Helena, and the intensity continued to weaken until 7" 42" 30° P.M., when
the loss since 10 A.M. amounted to 0118, and since noon of the preceding
day, to 015 of the whole force. The magnetic inclination at St. Helena being
–    21°, the horizontal force forms by much the larger component of the total
magnetic force: the approximate absolute horizontal value in English units
may be taken at 5'9.
    In the account of the Toronto observations it has been noticed that the
greatest disturbance of the instruments took place after the observations at
Greenwich had been discontinued; namely, after the midnight of Saturday at
Greenwich. St. Helena being nearly in the same meridian as Greenwich,
the observations ceased at nearly the same time and for the same reason: St.
 Helena does not therefore afford any observations corresponding to those of
 the second disturbance at Toronto.
     On Sunday 26th, the instruments were observed at 9 and 11 A.M., 3 and 8
 P.M.; and on Monday 27th, extra observations were commenced at 1"30"A.M.,
 at intervals of 30", and continued until 11 A.M., when the intervals were
 changed to 5" for the declination-magnetometer, and to 10" for each of the
 force-magnetometers, the extra observations being finally discontinued at
 midnight of that day.
     A table is subjoined of the mean positions of the magnetometers at the
 several magnetic hours during the month of September, showing the mean
 diurnal curve for the month of each element; also a table of the mean po
 sitions of the instruments on each day of the month, showing the monthly
 curve. It is seen by the latter table that the horizontal force was considera
 bly below        its
                 average intensity                    on

    2. “On the Laws of the rise and fall of the Tides in the River
 Thames."     By George Biddell Airy, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Astronomer
 Royal.
    The conclusions arrived at by the author, and stated in this paper,
were derived from an extensive series of observations of the tides,
made, on his suggestion, at the Royal Victualling Yard at Deptford,
under the superintendence of Captain Shireff, R.N. The object of
the first series of observations was simply to ascertain the times of
high and low water, for the purpose of ascertaining the duration of
the rise and fall of the tide: the height of the water was observed at
every quarter of an hour, night and day, during half a lunation. The
curves representing the law of rise and fall of the water were found
to be different for high tides and for low tides; and both are sensibly
different from the line of sines. The author then investigates ma
thematically the motion of a very long wave, such as a tide-wave, in
a rectangular canal, whose section is everywhere the same, on the
supposition that the extent of vertical oscillation bears a sensible
proportion to the mean depth            water; and deduces an expres

 sistances and electro-motive forces in the circuit. The light which
 these investigations has thrown on the theory of current electricity
 is very considerable; and although the labours of Ohm were, for
more than ten years, neglected, (Fechner being the only author who,
within that time, admitted and confirmed his views,) within the last
five years, Gauss, Lenz, Jacobi, Poggendorff, Henry, and many
other eminent philosophers, have acknowledged the great value of
his researches, and their obligations to him in conducting their own
investigations.    Had the works of Ohm been earlier known, and
their value recognised, the industry of experimentalists would have
been better rewarded.       In this country those who have had most
experience in researches in which voltaic agency is concerned, have
borne the strongest testimony to the assistance they have derived
from this source, and to the invariable accuracy with which the ob
served phaenomena have corresponded with the theory of Ohm. This
accordance, it may be observed, is altogether independent of the
particular hypothesis which may be adopted as to the origin of elec
tro-motive force; and obtains equally, whether that force is regarded
as being derived from the contact of dissimilar metals, or as refer
able to chemical agency.
    The Council have awarded one of the Royal Medals for this year,
which had been proposed for the subject of Chemistry, to Robert
KANE, M.D., M.R.I.A., Professor to the Royal Dublin Society, for
his paper “On the Chemical History of Archil and Litmus,” pub
lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840.
    It has been found that various lichens, which communicate no
colour to pure water, strike a fine blue with solution of ammonia.
The valuable colouring matters archil, litmus and cudbear, are com
mercial preparations of these lichens.     Some progress had already
been made in the investigation of their colouring principles by the
labours of Robiquet, Heeren, and Dumas; of which the most im
portant step was the discovery of Orcine, and also of Orceine, into
which the former is converted by ammonia; but the observations
were isolated, and the whole subject was in the greatest obscurity.
The present memoir by Dr. Kane records the first attempt to sketch
a general history of the class: and, considering the great and pecu
liar difficulties attending inquiries into organic colouring matters,
the attempt may be esteemed eminently successful.        It proved an
investigation of considerable intricacy and great extent, involving
several hundred organic analyses; and it has been conducted in a
manner highly creditable to the author's skill as an analyst. The
paper contains an account of the discovery of a large number of
new compounds, not less than twelve, derived from archil and litmus,
together with the more exact discrimination of several others, already
known, but imperfectly described.        The distinction made of two
 Orceines, which have hitherto been confounded as one, is a striking
result contained in the paper: while the observations on the action
of chlorine and of nascent hydrogen upon several of the bodies
described, open new branches of inquiry.
    The objects which the author had in view in these inquiries were
the three following: namely, first, to ascertain the primitive form

of the colour-making     substance in a given species of lichen, and
trace the  stages  through which it passes before the coloured sub
stance is developed;   secondly, to determine the nature of the various
colouring substances which exist in the archil of commerce; and
thirdly, to examine the colouring materials of ordinary litmus.      He
finds in the lichen Roccella tinctoria the following bodies, either pre
existing in the plant, or formed during the processes employed for
 itsanalysis:     Erythryline;
                       1.          Erythrine (the Pseudo-erythrine

                  3.                                           4.    Telerythrine; and     Roccelline5.

these substances are then described, and the chemical formulae given,
which are deducible from their respective analyses.                                                   The author
finds the archil  commerce     of

dients, namely, orceine, erythroleic acid, and azoerythrine;            each                                   of
of the two former there exist two modifications, and there               ad                                   is,   in

      This paper may be viewed as a very important contribution to
  organic chemistry, and as highly deserving of the Royal Medal; an
  award which will, doubtless, be hailed by chemists as a just encou
  ragement to perseverance in skilful analytical research.
      There being no paper on Mathematics coming within the stipu.
  lations regulating the awards of the Royal Medals, which has been
  deemed worthy of that for Mathematics in the present year, the
  Council have, in virtue of the power given to them, under these cir
 cumstances, by the regulations prescribed by Her Majesty, awarded
 the other Royal Medal to EAton Hodgkinson, Esq., for his paper,
 which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840, and
 is entitled “Experimental Researches into the Strength of Pillars of
 Cast Iron, and other materials.”
     This paper has been esteemed by the Council to be peculiarly va
 luable in a practical as well as theoretical point of view, and there
 fore to deserve, in an eminent degree, the honour of a Royal Medal.
 It contains the results of an immense series of experiments, conducted
 with great patience and admirable skill, and at a very considerable
 cost. Mr. Hodgkinson's position among the manufactories of Man
 chester, together with the unlimited command over the resources of
 one of the largest engineering establishments, which he obtained
 through the liberality of               proprietor Mr. Fairbairn, enabled him

 M. Redtenbacher observes, that the greater part fatty bodies, both         of
of   animal and vegetable origin, yield sebacic acid when they are
distilled,       ox-fat, hog's-lard, olive-oil, &c. Neither stearin nor
                as
 margaric acid, nor glycerin, when they are pure, yield the smallest
 trace of   sebacic acid                by
                                  distillation:                 as

 necessary conclusion, that sebacic acid              produced from

    When oleic acid          distilled alone, the product, among other sub

                             a                    sebacic acid, the quantity

    which is not increased when the oleic acid employed contains other
    fixed fatty acids: wax yields no sebacic acid by distillation, there
    fore it contains no oleic acid, nor does spermaceti.     M. Thénard
    has indeed indicated the formation of sebacic acid during the distil
    lation of wax, as a means of determining whether it is adulterated
    with fat.
       As sebacic acid is but very sparingly soluble in cold water, it is
    easily recognised, both by                     its

                SEPARATION OF GOLD AND PLATINA.
   Mr. Kemp has found that oxalic acid reduces the solutions of
gold, and has no action on those of platina.   To separate these two
metals, therefore, and to determine their quantities, a solution may
be made in aqua regia and the gold precipitated by oxalic acid in the
metallic state, and the platina by formic acid. The difficulty of se
parating these two metals which has hitherto existed, renders this
process of considerable importance.—Journal de Pharmacie, Jan.

cohol, and water, and acids decompose it completely; the lithofellic
acid then separates entirely from the aqueous solution, and yields by
desiccation a white powder; one part of soda saturates ten parts of
lithofellic acid.
   Ammonia dissolves lithofellic acid, and hydrochloric acid separates
it from solution, without any alteration, in the state of a white pow

decomposition also occurs, and the acid separates in white scales.

Dr. Rutherford's registering thermometer, and Dr. Mason's wet and
dry bulb hygrometer.
   The complete instrument consists of four thermometers, two max

frames; with separate frames I take for the first.
   Two spirit thermometers, with indexes as commonly made      the                                                   for

imum tubes furnish the dew-point at the time of maximum tempera
tures; I say in most cases, for there are times in unsettled weather
when the result is fallacious.     I watched the instrument through
May and June last in the sun; the dew-point at time of maximum
temperature reached 17° in town, while the dew-point at minimum
temperature never exceeded 3°; this last occurred when the earth
was screened by high thin clouds.

                        INFLUENCE OF COMETS.
    Dr. Forster has just published a short Essay on the Influence of
Comets, in which, alluding to a controversy long going on between
him and M. Arago on this subject, he says, in conclusion,   “I do not
pretend that there is any calculable amount of influence exercised
by comets sufficient to account for their apparent influence on our
atmosphere. I assert merely, that on comparing catalogues of these
bodies with terrestrial and atmospheric commotions, the coincidences
are too numerous to belong to the chapter of accidents.    The doc
trine of chances forbids such a supposition.”
   VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL FIBRIN, ALBUMEN, AND CASE IN.
   MM. Scherer and Jones, operating in the laboratory of M. Lie.
big, have found that vegetables contain three azotized bodies, which
they have called vegetable fibrin, vegetable albumen, and vegetable
casein. These substances possess precisely the same elementary
composition.
   Vegetable fibrin is the matter which does not dissolve when gluten
is treated with alcohol; the portion soluble in this liquid they have
named vegetable gluten.      Vegetable albumen is found in the juice
of vegetables, and casein is extracted from peas, beans, or lentils;
when these are treated with water, the portion dissolved is the
casein.
   On comparing the properties of these three bodies with those of
the corresponding bodies of animal origin, that is to say, albumen,
fibrin, and casein, it is found that the vegetable substances possess
all the properties which belong  to  thoseof   animal organization.
   On  submitting  these different matters to   analysis, MM. Scherer
and Jones found that they are isomeric.      These unexpected results
throw great light  on  physiological phaenomena; they explain the re
ciprocal transformations which fibrin, casein, and albumen undergo
in the animal organization;     they also lead  to this very remarkable
physiological consequence, that herbivorous animals find    in   vegeta

XXVII.       Abstract of Dr. Hermann Kopp's Researches on the
   Specific Weight of Chemical Compounds”.                      By HENRY
   CRoft, Esq., Teacher of Chemistry t.
C HEMISTS              have lately commenced directing considerable
       attention to the “atomic volumes" of bodies, that is to
say, the space occupied by an atom of any body, or, in other
words, the quotient of the density into the atomic weight.                 In
one of the preceding volumes of this Journal, Dr. Kopp has
shown that perfectly isomorphous bodies possess the same
atomic volume, and that in the cases of those bodies which
are not perfectly isomorphous, every difference in the crystal
line form is expressed by a difference in the atomic volume.
The same author has lately published a work, entitled “Uber
das specifische Gewicht der Chemischen Verbindungen,” in
which he discusses the composition of chemical bodies ac
cording to the volumes of their elements.               The following is a
short abstract of this         work,   which it seems very desirable to
make known to English chemists. Dr. Kopp has struck out
an entirely new branch in molecular chemistry, which pro
mises to be hereafter of very great importance.                The first at
tempt to determine the composition of bodies according to
the volumes of their elements was made by Schröder (Pog
gendorff's Annals, 50, p. 553), but many objections may be
raised to the manner in which this attempt was made, and to
the conclusions therein deduced; a critique, by Dr. Kopp, of
this work appeared in the 52nd volume of the same Journal.
    In his researches on the same subject, Dr. Kopp has en
   * Uber das Specifische Gewicht der Chemischen Verbindungen.         Frank
furt, 1841.

lume and   crystalline  condition of bodies will be found in Phil. Mag. Third
Series, vol. xviii. p. 255.

178         Mr. H. Croft's Abstract of Dr. H. Kopp's                                              Researches
deavoured to avoid those faults which he blamed in Schröder's
work, and which consist principally therein, that Schröder
made too great a number of arbitrary assumptions and sup
positions, and, notwithstanding, considered the results of his
theory as absolutely certain,
of a   theory  becomes the less in      proportion

assumptions on which it is founded becomes greater.                   Dr.
Kopp, on the contrary, believes that on this subject no abso
lutely true theory can at present be made, but still a very
probable one may be proposed, whose probability is proved
 by   its
        explaining,          by
                          means     the fewest possible assumptions,
                                                     of
the greatest possible number              experimental facts. Theof
views       Dr. Kopp, which are explained
            of                                            the following                in
paper, differ considerably from those               Schröder; but they       of
embrace       amuch greater number            compounds, which they    of
fully explain with very few assumptions.

ber of assumptions would be necessary in the formulae for the
densities of salts than if we adopted the hydracid theory, as
the improbability of a theory increases with the number of
assumptions which it is obliged to make, and as that theory is
the most probable which makes fewest assumptions, Dr. Kopp
decides in favour of that of the hydracids. In a future com
munication we may perhaps enter more fully into this subject.
   The densities of several hydrated oxides may be calculated
if weassume the water to have the atomic volume 78, and the
oxide to retain              its
                 primitive volume.

XXVIII.         On a great Regularity in the Physical Properties of

 INCompoundst,
        a recent publication on the Specific Weights of Chemical
                         I endeavoured to show how the atomic vo
 lumes of analogous groups of such combinations might be
 very simply explained by means of certain general admissions,
and how the specific weight of any compoundbelonging to such
a group might be determined d priori with considerable ac
 curacy.     This work was confined to inorganic compounds: I
 have since then extended my researches to the organic com
 binations, and have likewise arrived at very simple results.
     In organic chemistry there are proportionally more liquid
 compounds than in the inorganic, and the existence of dimor
 phism, which frequently renders the discovery of the laws for
 the specific weight difficult in this latter branch, is of rarer
 occurrence.       The determinations of the densities of fluids are
 in general easier, and the statements respecting them more
 accurate than is the case with solid bodies.             On the other
 hand, fluids have a greater expansibility by heat than solids,
 and as long as it remains unascertained at what temperature
  a comparison of the specific volumes of various bodies can
  properly be made, this stronger expansibility, which varies in
  different compounds, appears to lay great difficulties in the
  way of our arriving at correct results from a comparison of
  specific volumes.       I have not hitherto been able to devote
  any special attention to this subject, on account of the several

statements respecting the specific weight of one and the same
compound frequently differing very considerably, and the un
certainty which this gives rise to is greater than that resulting
from our ignorance of the temperature which should be taken
as basis when determining the density of any body.
   Let us imagine a great number of organic compounds,

   But, as I have already stated, too much uncertainty prevails
respecting the boiling points to allow of our determining the
numbers in a law with absolute accuracy: the existence of
a law of the form which has been proposed is beyond doubt.
     When the specific volumes of a body are known for all
temperatures, those  of an analogous compound always differ
by a constant magnitude,  and the knowledge of the specific
weight, and of the expansion of the first and of the specific
weight of the latter for any temperature, consequently gives
the expansion of the latter.
     It is
        scarcely necessary to call attention to the importance
of these laws; they are for the determination of the physical
properties of chemical compounds what the law of definite
proportions is for the knowledge of their constitution.

                    R = k g = k'g';                 g   =    TET             g    =      }
The equations (1.) show that R, g, g! stand for the respective
densities of air, oxygen, and azote, under the same pressure
p and the same temperature 6: but it has been determined
experimentally that the three densities in such circumstances
are proportional to the numbers 1, 1’ 1057, 0-972: wherefore,
putting A = 1-1057, A' = 0-972*, we shall have
                                  g     = A R,                      *=A
                                   g     = A'R,                     ;        = A'.
Multiply the densities by the respective volumes, and take the
sum of the products; the result will be
                            g v         + g'w'     = (A v + A'w') R.
  Now g u + g! V is the sum of the masses of the oxygen and
azote; and we may assume that this sum is equal to R V the
mass of the atmospheric air; in consequence, by substituting
and leaving out the common factor                                    R, we shall obtain
                                          V = Av             +      A'v'.
..
   This equation is not sufficient for determining v and v' when
a given value is assigned to V: we may therefore assume this
      condition, that v--w' is equal to V, viz.
                                              V =       u   +       v'.
   By means the two equations, the values                                                                       be

azote with one atom of oxygen.              According to the view of
the matter we have here           taken,  there is no such thing as an
atom of air: for a volume of that fluid contains the atoms in
21 parts of oxygen and 79 parts of azote, the atoms of each
of the two gases being separately arranged in symmetrical
order through the whole volume of air. The difficulty al
luded to is completely solved when it is observed that the
action of any one of the gases at a point of the common sur
face is transmitted to                          all

surrounded         by   many    particles  of aether.
    But if we adopt a different hypothesis and suppose that
there are not so many, or at most as many, particles of aether
as there are particles of matter in the transparent body, then
it is evident that the particles of aether will be arranged with re
spect to each other in a perfectly symmetrical manner (suppo
sing of course that the same is true with respect to the particles
of the transparent body, i.e. supposing it to be perfectly ho
mogeneous and uncrystallized); this will appear immediately,
without any further explanation, from the following figures.

            of Luminous     Waves    in Transparent Bodies.            203
    Fig. 1 represents what we may conceive to be the arrange
ment of the particles of aether and matter*, supposing that
there are fewer of the former than of the latter, the larger dots
representing the particles of matter and the smaller those of
aether.
    Fig. 2 represents the case where there are just as many
particles of aether as of matter.
    Fig. 3 represents a case (and, as we shall hereafter show,
a very probable case) in which there are more aethereal than
material particles, and yet the circumstances are exactly the
same as in fig. 2: it is that case in which the particles of mat
ter exercise so strong a repulsive force on the aethereal parti
cles as to gather them into globules, which may be regarded
as each one particle.
    Fig. 4 represents the case first described, in which each
particle of matter is surrounded by many particles of aether,
which are not gathered into globules as in fig. 3, but spread
over the whole space between the particles of matter.
    It is evident from these figures, that we have two very dif
ferent cases to consider in applying the equations of motion
to the vibrations of aether as it exists in the interior of trans
parent bodies: 1st, that case which is represented by figures
1, 2, and 3, in which (as will be shown) the equations of mo
tion will be linear equations with constant coefficients; and
2ndly, that case which is represented by fig. 4, in which the
equations of motion will be linear equations with variable co
efficients.      My object in the present investigation is to
examine the circumstances of propagation of waves in both
these cases, confining myself entirely to the consideration of
plane waves propagated with a uniform velocity, both for the
sake of simplicity and because similar results to those deduced
in the case of plane waves may be obtained in a similar man
ner in the case of any other species of waves.
    The following is a brief outline of the course            I have pur
sued and the results I have arrived at.                  -
    In the first place, I have investigated the general equations
of vibratory motion of a system of material particles sur
 rounded by aethereal particles.
     I have then simplified these equations by assuming that the
arrangement of the aethereal particles is such as is represented
 in figures 1, 2, or 3, and applied the equations thus simpli
 fied to the case of plane waves propagated with a uniform
 velocity.
    * We here suppose the particles of matter to be placed at the corners
 of cubes; but our reasoning will be equally true for any other arrangement
of the particles, provided it be perfectly symmetrical and homogeneous.

 204          The Rev. M. O’Brien      on the Propagation
     I have then deduced    the following results:—
     1st. That the  velocity   of propagation is in general different
jor transversal and for direct vibrations, and that consequently
 any arbitrary disturbance will give rise to two waves, propa
 gated with different velocities, one consisting of transversal
 and the other of direct vibrations.
     2ndly. That plane waves cannot be propagated with a uni
 form velocity, unless the particles vibrate according to the
 cycloidal law.
     3rdly. That if v be the velocity of propagation, and a the
 length of the wave, then there is the following relation be
 tween v and a (quite independently of the hypothesis of finite
 intervals), viz.
                            4  ºr?       C
                            Tx2     F J2 — B'
 supposing the particles      of matter absolutely fixed in space;

                             w”  – B v – B,
 supposing the particles     of matter capable of motion (as they
 must be).
     In these formulae B is a certain constant depending on the
 law of force of one particle of aether on another; B, a similar
 constant with reference to particles of matter; and C C, two
 constants depending on the mutual action of matter and aether
 on each other.     B and B, are not the same for transversal and
 direct vibrations.
     These results show that the dispersion of light may be com
pletely accounted for without having recourse to the hypothesis
 of finite intervals. Indeed a more general value of x than
 that just given may be obtained in the following form, viz.
            -yC
      *                                  C,

            =   = B   +          B,  **     B, t w  =  B, *
 by supposing that the particles of transparent bodies are com
 pound (as they must be in many cases), consisting of several
 essentially different atoms, there being a term in the above
 equation for each different atom. Of course with such a re
 lation as this we may make the different corresponding values
 of u and x agree with their actual values obtained by obser
 vation as nearly as we please.
    Lastly. I have shown that, though it appears at first sight
 almost impossible to solve the differential equations in the
 case represented by fig. 4, yet there is a peculiar circumstance
 in the case of luminous waves which enables us to get over

                      of Luminous                    Waves          in Transparent Bodies.                                      205
this difficulty and arrive at exactly the same results as those
just mentioned; so that these results are true in general what
ever be the arrangement of the luminous particles in the inter
stices between the particles of matter.

     The following two consequences follow from these results:
     1st, That the particles must necessarily vibrate according to
the cycloidal law; a plane wave cannot be transmitted with
a uniform velocity unless this condition hold.
   2ndly, That the velocity of transmission depends on the
length of the wave; for if x be the length of the wave,

where v, is the velocity with which the vibrations of the
material particles are propagated.    We here make no differ
ence between u and u, for supposing a 3 y and 2, 3, Y, to be
long to contiguous particles, it is evident that u, does not
differ sensibly from u.
   We have supposed (v) the velocity of propagation of the
vibrations of the material particles not the same as (v) that
of the aethereal particles; for these quantities are evidently
quite independent of each other, so far as the above equations
of motion are concerned ; and whatever connexion subsists
between them must evidently be determined from initial or
                                ;

far more than we find to be the case in determinations of car
bon and hydrogen. These differences resulting from the diffi
culties and uncertainties of the usual methods, made chemists
feel the want of one more simple and accurate.
    M. Dumas has already, in his examination of oxamide, de
termined the nitrogen by collecting it in the form of ammonia;
and the experiments of H. Rose left no doubt that ammonia
could be most accurately weighed in the form of the ammo
nio-chloride of platinum.          These, and direct experiments of
Woehler, who had succeeded in determining correctly the                                                         ni

ploy more than 400 milligrammes with substances containing
little nitrogen, and not less than 200 milligrammes of those
which contain much.          The weighed quantity of the sub
stance is mixed with the measured quantity of soda-lime in a
mortar previously somewhat warmed and unglazed, by stirring
gently with the pestle.             If
                               these two measures of precaution
are   observed,   there is no  danger   of any loss resulting from
an adhesion of substance to the sides of the mortar and pestle.
When the mixture has been introduced into the tube in the
usual manner, the mortar is repeatedly rinsed with some
soda-lime, the tube filled within an inch of the aperture, and
a close layer of previously ignited asbestos introduced to pre
vent any of the fine powder being carried away by the gases
evolved during the burning, which, especially on employing
a mixture of the hydrate of potash and lime, would give rise
to incorrect results, as the potash-chloride of platinum acts
in the same way towards solvents as the ammonio-chloride.
In this respect the mixture of soda and lime is preferable, for
should any such accident happen, the soluble soda-chloride
of platinum is easily removed by washing.
   The tube is then connected with the apparatus containing
the muriatic acid by a soft tight-fitting cork, placed in a com
mon combustion furnace, and some air expelled by warming
the bulb a with a glowing charcoal, to see whether the appa
ratus be air-tight; if so, the front part of the tube, which con
tains none of the organic substance, is heated to redness by
surrounding it with glowing charcoal, that nothing may distil
over undecomposed. The cork must be kept as warm as pos
sible, that it may not retain or imbibe any moisture, which,
by absorbing ammonia, would occasion an error in the result.
As soon as this part of the tube is red-hot the burning is pro
ceeded with ; carbonic acid is formed from the oxygen of the
hydrate and the whole or a part of the carbon of the sub
stance; the hydrogen set free combines with the nitrogen in
 its nascent state       ammonia, which escapes

with nitrate of silver.    It is therefore advisable to boil the
sponge several times in distilled water previous to dissolving
it in aqua regia. We consider it more simple, and as afford
ing more accurate results, to weigh the nitrogen in the form
of the ammonio-chloride of platinum, as in this case we have
for every 177 parts of nitrogen 2788 parts of the salt on the
balance, but with metallic platinum only 1233 parts for the
same quantity of nitrogen.       The error in weighing must con
sequently be double as great to exert the same influence on
 the result.    The weight of the ammonio-chloride remains
constant even when desiccation at 100° is continued for a
 considerable length of time, and the filter does not vary in the
 least if previously well washed; but when it contains a trace
 of free acid the paper becomes black and friable.
    [The authors have tested the accuracy of this method on
 various nitrogenous compounds, and a comparison of the re
 sults with those obtained by former methods will convince
 every one of           its
                    superiority.   We give     present but    few  at                     a

The oxide is easily freed from the salts of soda by washing. Ac
cording to the methods generally in practice, this preparation
is obtained in an impure state, either mixed with metallic an
timony, which is easily detected, or, what is more frequently
the case, with the higher oxides. To detect these the author
proposes the following method, founded on the well-known
fact, that oxide of antimony melts with the sulphuret to form
the glass of antimony without any disengagement of sulphurous
acid, while the higher oxides are reduced to this protoxide
under liberation of sulphurous acid. Fifteen parts of the sup
posed pure oxide are carefully mixed with thirty-five parts of
the sulphuret, and the mixture placed in a glass tube, which is
connected on the one side by a chloride of calcium tube with a
flask for disengaging gas, on the other with a glass tube, which
is bent at right angles, and terminates in a small vessel contain
ing dilute water of ammonia. The mixture is then heated, du
ring which a current of carbonic acid gas is passed over it to
prevent any access of air.      As soon as the oxide has melted
with the sulphuret, the heating is discontinued, and the ammo
niacal liquid subjected to examination.       Hydrochloric acid is
added to             it,

copper, which dissolves completely in muriatic acid.      In this
way he found, that on the conversion of starch into dextrin
and so into grape sugar, not a trace of gum is formed as inter

     e.   The induced current does not                           act on the galvanometer,
does not decompose chemically, and cannot magnetize soft
 Iron.
     The explanation of these phaenomena would be as follows:–
     An electric current when it commences produces in iron
 near it an electric current of very short existence; during
 whole continuance         causes magnetism, and
                                    it                   the moment          at                  of its
 its cessation another electric current.         The actions of this
evanescent magnetism, and                          of
                                     the second electric current, are
exactly opposed                 to
                        each other.
     If the current continued longer (i.e.             were galvanic), if   it
          is, the magnetism could           fully developed,
                                                         of be
that            if                                                would                     it
overpower the opposing action              the electric    current,  but
if   momentary (or electrical) this latter action overcomes
the former.      The electrical currents           iron have thereforein
different properties          what the magnetism

    3. On the Magnetism                of the so-called Unmagnetic Metals.
    We  have as yet endeavoured to prove the magnetism of the
so called unmagnetic metals by attempting to direct or at
tract them by strong magnets, or else by trying their power of
moving very light delicate magnetic needles; both methods
however without success.       In the above experiments we have
demonstrated the    hindering   influence of the electrical currents
induced in iron during                   its
                               magnetization, and this excited                                     a

that Baron Zach informed Montucla that he had seen a
manuscript in the Radcliffe Library, at Oxford, in which the
ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference was
carried to 154 places.    Professor Davies, of the Royal        Mili

Mathematics, vol. i. p. 476, also refers to the Oxford approxi

the Penny Cyclopaedia.      Should Mr. Halliwell be successful
in his search in the Radcliffe Library, it is to be hoped that
he will publish an analysis of the contents of this curious ma

of the ratio of the diameter to the circumference to 154 places

XXXIV.       On Fernel's Measure of a Degree, in reply to        Mr.
       Galloway's Remarks.   By Professor DE MoRGAN.
  To   the   Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
            some reply to the remarks which Mr. Galloway
INhasmaking
       made on my correction (as I am obliged still to main
tain   it to be) of Montucla and Delambre (or Lalande),     I   must
first express my gratification at the subject having been taken
up with so much research.
   The question between Mr. Galloway and myselflies in little
compass: he contends for the geometrical foot of Fernel being
the French foot of the day: I maintain this to be unlikely in
itself, as being contrary to usual practice, and wholly inadmis
sible, as by implication making Fernel declare that the step of
an ordinary man was more than 38 English inches.          As this
                              ‘.
last point however is a new one, raised by me in my second
letter (of last month), I will here confine myself to the first
point, namely, as to the question whether the geometrical foot
is to be taken to be the          foot.
   I will also omit     all
                       question        whether the French foot
                                      as   to
                    *   Probably Professor De Morgan.

                        important change took place from 1528

            system is found
conspicuous from the invention of printing up to A.D. 1570.
It sank gradually, as actual measurement began to prevail,
and was hardly understood by the middle of the seventeenth
century. This table appears also in the Cosmography of Gem
 ma Frisius (1548); in that of Apian (printed at various times
from 1529 up to 1570), in which the measures are illustrated
by drawings from the human body; in Stofler's Commentary
on Proclus (1534); and in many other works which I have
seen.    From             its

learned language was           use.    The vernacular writers soon
                                      in
made the confusion          not distinguishing the feet
                                 of                          their own             of
country from the geometrical foot. Their predecessors made
the distinction; their only connexion with the actual measures
of  the world being their belief that the geometrical Italian mile
was the old Roman mile,            which they were not far wrong;
                                           in
and that their    geometrical    German mile was        representative  a
of  some one mile used          Germany, nearly.

of   75)   inhis Commentary            Sacroboscoon     quote the edi   (I

mensuras quae certae acrarae apud omnes nationes haberentur.”
He then gives the preceding table. Clavius would be,                                                       I
should think, a better authority than Riccioli on a habit of
the sixteenth century.
   It is not then a thing to be taken without further showing
that Fernel, a mathematician, writing for mathematicians,
used a French foot when he says he used a geometrical foot.
Even without the assertion relative to his own pace, as com
pared with the geometrical pace of five foot-lengths, it seems
to me that there is ample ground on which to contest such
an assumption.      If the writers of the sixteenth century had
had  anything   to do with the usual measures, they would some
times have mentioned their diversity; instead of which there is
a uniform determination to avoid speaking of local measures,
and a continual reference to a system which is adopted in the
same words, with the same descriptions, and by writers of                                                 all
countries, Italian, German, French,         Belgian. That this sy or
stem was     practice “curious fiction,”
                    in          a              perfectly true, since,   is
though the difference between the results           one careful ap            of
peal      the natural standard and another might
           to                                                 rather                            be
small, there was               no
                       certainty     any agreement  of    even what                        of
would then be called the closest kind. But, let their mode
of measurement         ever    bedefective,   so
                                               was their mode           it                                of
measurement, and Fernel must be held            have had recourse       to
to
it   until some reason      given  for supposing
                                         is        that     chose                           he            to

various regions of the south of Italy are afflicted with the
scourge described in the country by the names of cattivº aria
and mal aria (bad air), common language thus appearing to
attribute the morbid effects to the constitution of the atmo
sphere in these localities.   Examinations into the causes of
the unhealthiness of various regions of the Tuscan soil have
previously occupied several                   and the author of
this memoir has endeavoured to throw      light on this important
question at a period in which the generous efforts of the sove
reign are directed towards improving the salubrity of these
localities.
   M. Savi readily admits that he is not prepared to propose
a remedy for the scourge: the object of his memoir, which is
principally geological, is to review the different unhealthy      lo
calities, to examine carefully the constitution of their soil, and
particularly to describe those regions in which the unhealthi
ness appears not to result from the usually admitted causes,
in order to discover in the phaenomena peculiar to these places
the origin of their insalubrity; the information acquired in
these particular cases probably leading to the discovery of a
common cause of the noxious effects in various localities,
and which may have been attributed to very different causes.
   We shall follow the author through the several parts of his
memoir.—[EDIT. Annales de Chimie et de Physique.]
               Insalubrity of the Environs of Wolterra.
    M. Savi begins by examining the low valleys of the en
 virons of Volterra, in which the non-existence of marshes
precludes the most common hypothesis, as to the origin of
their unhealthiness. This country is formed by very exten
sive marine deposits of the tertiary epoch, and which are
chiefly composed of gray argillaceous marls (mattajone); these
lands, raised in many places by igneous rocks, and altered in
others by subterraneous emanations, frequently contain seleni
tic  masses impregnated with sulphur, and often with common
salt; the igneous rocks constitute the peaks      of the mountains;
its  sides are formed       this mattajone, raised, altered and im
                              of
pregnated with gypsum and common salt; the valleys are also
formed   of  mattajone.
    In  the bottom      these valleys, not only near water-courses,
                         of
but also  on  the sides      the hills, and even

     He notices another opinion existing in Tuscany, which,
 though absurd at first sight, appears to him not to be desti
 tute of some foundation.       It is stated, that these lands, after
 having been dried by the heat of the summer, and then sub
jected to rain water, undergo a kind of fermentation; that the
 earth boils (ribolle), as they commonly say; and that, in conse
 quence of this ebullition, deleterious miasmata are disengaged,
 which are the source of diseases, and particularly of intermit
 tent fevers. It is quite certain that diseases do not commence,
 or at least do not become common, until after rain and inun
 dations have occurred.       The greater the alternations of heat
  and rain which occur in a year, the more are the ravages of
  fever felt. This is a fact ascertained by experience, and which
  no inhabitant of the maremma would deny. It is cited by many
  authors, especially by the celebrated Brocchiº.
     It is also asserted, that these circumstances are productive
  of fevers, not only in marshy soils, but also in certain situa
  tions that contain no marshes, such as that of the environs of
  Volterra. Instead therefore of saying, as often happens, that
  the morbid effects are derived from a mixture of rain and stag
  nant water, it would be more rational to say that they are due
  to the action of water on certain parched lands.
         Examination of the Substratum of unhealthy Marshes.
      M. Savi begins by observing, that        marshes      all
                                                             not appear     do
 to      be
         capable         of
                     evolving hurtful effluvia; hence the necessary
 distinction between unhealthy and indifferent marshes.                                    It   is,
 however, well known that the latter contain scarcely any salts
 in  solution, and the substratum yields          marine mineral pro
                                                                  no

a perceptible smell       putrid eggs, and these places become

Can Sulphuretted and Carburetted Hydrogen either directly or
           indirectly render the Air insalubrious 2
    The insalubrity of the air has been long attributed to these
gases; this observation has been questioned with respect to
sulphuretted hydrogen by many philosophers, who observed
that the emanations of the solfaterras and lagoni of the Siennois
and Volterrano, which contain a considerable proportion of this
gas, do not occasion the marsh diseases in those who breathe
the air of these localities.    The same observation applies to
the air of the   lagoons  of Venice. These incontestable facts
prove that sulphuretted hydrogen is not always capable of
producing fevers; but as in                    all
                                                                            or of

which unwholesome air       prevails,  sulphuretted       carburetted
hydrogen, and especially the former, are generated, their for
mation       naturally regarded       connected,
                                               as      least, with the at
             of is
cause      insalubrity.
    The author will not however affirm that insalubrity depends
 on  one cause only: several circumstances may concur              de                   to
velop noxious influences,       much     or           to

 Such     the effect already attributed

 effects      on
             unhealthy countries.
                                         Conclusions.
  It     appears          to   be   proved that places exposed                to    the effects
of insalubrious air are—

                                         algae accumulate, which
are afterwards watered      fresh water,by       mixture     or

                  of 1841, observed at Comrie, near Crieff.
      1839 to the end
     By JAMEs DRUMMond, of Comriek.
         ONSIDERING       that the theory of the Comrie earth
      quakes has not yet been satisfactorily established, I thought
that an account, by a resident on the spot, of the shocks du
ring the last two years might be of interest, and perhaps of
value, to the readers of the Philosophical Magazine, and to
those engaged in inquiring into these phaenomena.           It is not
my intention to enter into any discussion on the question just
now, but I think it right to say that these observations origi
nated in the dissatisfaction I feel as to the theories heretofore
propounded, and as to the seat of the disturbance.         When I
consider that the shocks are     only  of modern  occurrence,    that
they date only from the opening of quarries into the basaltic
dykes on each side of the river Lednoch, and that they are
consequent on floods of that river, I cannot feel justified in
giving my assent to the doctrine, that they are derived from
the percolation of water.      Neither can I admit, as is the po
pular belief here, that the seat of the disturbance is in any of
the neighbouring mountains.
     I
     flatter myself, also, that a register of shocks from a resi
dent at Comrie will not be without          uses,              its
                                                      from greater            as
habitude the   people       this    of

guish the shocks.                                         -
   Before coming       the register, think advisable
                               to                   I        make    it                 to        a

      Mr.      J.   Drummond's                Table    of Earthquakes                at Comrie.             241
     In            of June and beginning of July were wet
           1841, the end
nearly every day until the 13th of July, when we had good
summer weather. After the shock the weather got cold and
stormy, and on the 29th of July we had a regular hurricane
from the north-east, doing much damage. After the great
shock on the 30th the weather got mild: I observed that the
shock was transmitted much further in the direction of the
hurricane than in any other.
   The greatest shocks happen in summer and harvest. The
vertical shocks, I cannot find, are felt further south from the
Lednoch quarries than Comrie, on the east further than Tam
                                                                                             on all
perran, or on the south-west than Leachkin, being      about half
a  mile distant.                   At
                      Kinggart, the nearest house      the north
and   amile off, the shocks, vertical   Comrie, &c., are felt la at
terally. The greatest        the lateral shocks are nothing
                                             of                                                              in
comparison with the greatest                           of
                                    our vertical shocks, and yet
the people           of
                 Comrie are more afraid       the lateral shocks          of
than of the others.           considered here that the shocks
                                            It   is
originate      the mountains, some referring them
                    in                                    Dunira                                  to
Hill,   some     the Cluan, and some
                     to                     Kinggart. Upon this  to                                         I
will   observe,  that,      the 12th    onOctober 1839, the people
                                                            of
living     those parts observed five shocks, while
            in                                                the same                       on
day       Bruckhill and Saures
          at                         eight  were    observed,    and                                         at
Comrie ten;          the 23rd following, the people about Dunira
                              on
and Cluan observed three, while              Comrie some observedat
fourteen, others eighteen, and some            many               as
                                                          twenty. On                 as
the 30th       July,of1840, the Dunira    people   observed six, and
at  Comrie fourteen were observed.               general, the shocks  In
are not felt      equal  at
                         distances     every   direction:
                                                       in     think the                    I
greatest shocks are felt further north-east and south-west than
in  any other direction.      The shock      the 30th       July, 1841,
                                                                  of                   of

   To come                        I
               to the register, must observe that it gives the state
of the  river,  then the number of what I call gas explosions,
next the hour at which the vertical shocks occurred, the num
ber of them, and the utmost distance at which felt; afterwards
the lateral shocks, and then the tremours or waving shocks,
and lastly the state of the weather. The noises, which               I  am
inclined to consider as       arising  from   gas  explosions,  are  only
heard at Comrie, Tamperran and Leachkin, the site of the
vertical shocks.

DR.itROGET    begged leave to observe, that, for many years past,
      has been customary for the President, in his anniversary ad
dresses to the Society,    to give narratives of the leading incidents in
 the lives, and an account of the scientific labours of the more distin
 guished associates of whom death had deprived us during the pre
 ceding year. The utility of such a retrospect, he remarked, is suf
 ficiently obvious.    Consolation may be afforded to the survivors by
 the just tribute thus publicly paid to the memory of those they
 mourn. In marking the several steps of their ascent to eminence, in
 retracing the services they have rendered to science and to man
 kind, and in establishing their respective claims to our respect, our
 admiration and our gratitude, fresh motives of emulation are pre
 sented to those who are following in the same arduous paths, and
 aspiring to the same honourable distinctions. The Society can never
 forget how well these objects have been fulfilled by the excellent bio
 graphical notices we have been accustomed to hear from our Presi
 dents on each returning anniversary, and must feel how much reason
they have to regret the omission of the usual discourse from the
 Chair on the present occasion. It is with a view to prevent this
interruption of the series being drawn into a precedent, that Dr.
 Roget has now been induced, by the desire of the President, to at
 tempt supplying, however imperfectly, the omission he has alluded
to. Having but little leisure to perform this task, he wished to
claim the indulgence of the Meeting for the many imperfections they
will discover in the mode of its execution.
    Of the deceased members on the home list, Dr. Roget has been
able to notice only two, namely, Mr. Bauer and Sir Astley Cooper,
not having received, with regard to the rest, any authentic informa
tion which was deserving of record in this place. It is impossible
for him, however, to pass over in complete silence the honoured name
of one, whose loss within these few days we                  all
                                                           deeply deplore—

and too sudden    to  afford the opportunity,       indeed the effort could,

present month (Nov. 1841); only five days before the present meeting.

                                            Francis Bauer.                                                249
appointment as painter to Prince Lichtenstein; so that the care of
his education devolved upon his mother. He manifested very early
a talent for botanical drawing; and the first published production of
his pencil, at the age of thirteen, was a figure of the Anemomepratensis
appended to a work of Stoerck.         He came to England in the year
1788, and was about to proceed to Paris; when, on the eve of his
intended departure, he was offered by Sir Joseph Banks the appoint
ment of draughtsman at the Royal Gardens at Kew, a proposal
which induced him to relinquish his intentions of leaving England.
He took up his residence near those Gardens, and he continued to
dwell, during the remainder of his life, in their neighbourhood.
The salary of the new office which Mr. Bauer held was defrayed by
Sir Joseph Banks during his own life, and                                  its   continuance after his
decease was provided for    his will.       by

as opportunities    offered, nearly to the termination of his life. A
selection from these, which form one of the most beautiful and ex
tensive series of his botanical drawings, was lithographed and pub
lished by Professor Lindley, between the years 1830 and 1838, under
the title of “ Illustrations of Orchidaceous Plants.”
    A paper by Mr. Bauer, entitled “Some Experiments on the
Fungi which constitute the colouring matter of the Red Snow dis
covered in Baffin's Bay,” was published in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1820. By mixing the snow containing these fungi with
water, he found that they could be made to vegetate, but that they
produced new fungi of a green instead of a red colour.            By ex
posure to excessive cold the primitive fungi are killed, but their
seed still retains vitality, and, if immersed in snow, which appears
to be their native soil, they reproduce new fungi, which are gene
 rally of a red colour.
    The Philosophical Transactions for 1823 contains the paper by
 Mr. Bauer already alluded to, entitled “Microscopical Observations
 on the Suspension of the Muscular Motions of the Vibrio tritici,"
 which forms the Croonian Lecture for that year. This minute
worm, which infests wheat, and is the immediate cause of that de
 structive disease called the Ear Cockle or Purples, congregates in
 immense numbers in the substance of the grains thus diseased,
 forming masses of a white and apparently glairy mucus, which,
 when immersed in water, separate and exhibit, under the micro
 scope, the worms in lively motion.        After they have become per
 fectly dry, and apparently lifeless, they may be readily revived by
 being moistened with a drop of water, when they become as lively
 as before.    Mr. Bauer determined, by a series of experiments, that
 the ova of these worms are conveyed into the cavities of the ger
 mens by the circulating sap.       On inserting some of the worms into
 sound   grains  of wheat,  and  allowing  them to germinate, he found
 the worms, in different stages of their growth, in the stalk, and ulti
 mately in the germens of the new plant.
    In the year 1816 he commenced lending the assistance of his
 pencil to Sir Everard Home, in the various anatomical and physio
 logical investigations in which the latter was engaged; and in the
 course of ten or twelve years furnished, in illustration of Sir Eve
 rard's numerous papers in the Philosophical Transactions, more
 than a hundred and twenty plates, which were afterwards reprinted
 in his ‘Lectures on Comparative Anatomy. These plates, which
 form together the most extensive series of Mr. Bauer's published
 works, embraced a great variety of important subjects, chiefly in
  microscopic anatomy, and afford abundant evidence of his powers
 of observation and skill in depicting the most difficult objects.
  It is this rare and previously almost unexampled union of the
  observer and the artist that has placed Mr. Bauer in the first rank
  of scientific draughtsmen.        His paintings, as the more finished
  of his   productions   may  well be termed, are no less perfect as
  models of artistic skill and effect, than as representations of natural
  objects.

                      Sir Astley Paston Cooper.                       251
    He died at his residence on Kew Green, on the 11th of December
last, in the 83rd year of his age".
    SIR Astley PAston Cooper, Bart., was the fourth son of the
Rev. Dr. Samuel Cooper, of Yarmouth in Norfolk.               His mother
was a daughter of James Bransby, Esq., of Shottisham, and was
known as the authoress of a novel entitled ‘The Exemplary
Mother.' Sir Astley was born at Brooke, in the same county, on
the 23rd of August, 1768. Even in his boyhood he was noted for
his bold and enterprising spirit, the sociability and kindness of his
disposition, and for the animation with which he entered into all
the sports of his juvenile companions.         After receiving from the
village schoolmaster, and from his father, who was a good scholar,
some portion of classical instruction, he was placed, at the age of
fifteen, with Mr. Turner, a surgeon and apothecary at Yarmouth.
Here he remained but a few months, and was then sent to London,
and bound apprentice to his uncle, Mr. William Cooper, one of the
surgeons of Guy's Hospital, but was soon after transferred, by his
own desire, to Mr. Cline, who had already attained great eminence,
and was surgeon of St. Thomas's Hospital.             This connexion af
forded him ample opportunities of acquiring professional know
ledge, under the guidance of a master distinguished by a truly
philosophical mind, and for whom his pupil always felt the most
profound regard and veneration. Young Cooper's labours in the
wide field of observation thus open to him, both in the hospital and
dissecting-room, were unremitting; and the practical information he
there acquired formed the solid basis of his future fame. He made
a short visit to Edinburgh in the year 1787, and, although only in
his nineteenth year, was a distinguished member of the Royal Medi
cal Society of that place. On his return to London, Mr. Cline, who
was the teacher of anatomy, physiology and surgery at St. Thomas's
 Hospital, appointed him his demonstrator of anatomy, and soon after
gave up to him a part of the anatomical lectures.          Sir Astley also
gained the consent of Mr. Cline and the other surgeons of the hospi
 tals of Guy and St. Thomas, to give a course of lectures on the prin
 ciples and practice of surgery, a subject which had previously only
 formed a part of the anatomical course.       He had now full scope for
 the display of those talents which afterwards shone forth on the wider
theatre of the world, in a profession of which he became the bright
est ornament.     At first he was attended only by fifty students; but
his class soon increased to four hundred, which was by far the largest
that had been known in London. His popularity as a teacher rapidly
increased: he made no attempts at displays of oratory, but always
studied to render the subject which he treated as plain and intelli
gible as possible to his hearers, wisely avoiding distracting their atten
tion by entering on controversial topics connected with physiology.
    On the close of 1791, the year he commenced as a lecturer, he
married the daughter of Thomas Cock, Esq., of Tottenham, who was
a distant relation of   Mr. Cline: but    as a proof of his constant  soli

citude never to neglect the performance of any public professional
duty, it is remembered that on the evening of the day on which the
marriage ceremony was performed he delivered as usual his lecture,
without the slightest intimation to his class of what had happened
in the morning; and even at the time when he        was most fully en
gaged in this exceedingly laborious practice, he never omitted to
deliver his regular lectures at the hospital.
   In 1792, after spending some months at Paris and attending the
lectures of Dessault at the Hotel Dieu, and also those of Chopart,
he commenced practice in London, taking up his residence in the
city, where he dwelt for many years before he removed to the west
end of the town.     The popularity he enjoyed as a surgeon, and the
extent of his  practice, have probably surpassed that of any of his
predecessors: and the large fortune which he acquired was the just
and honourable reward of distinguished merit and the most unre
mitting application.
   Sir Astley Cooper was elected a Fellow of this Society on Febru
ary the 18th, 1802. He had previously contributed to the Philoso
phical Transactions two papers: the first entitled “Observations on
the Effects which take place from the Destruction of the Membrana
Tympani of the Ear”,” and the second containing “Further Ob
servations on the same subject, together with an Account of an
Operation for the removal of a particular kind of Deafness t.” The
operation of puncturing the membrana tympani for the relief of that
species of deafness which arises from an obstruction of the Eusta
chian tube, suggested itself from observing that, in several cases, an
aperture in the membrane did not essentially diminish the powers of
the ear, and that even     total destruction by disease
                               its                       not followed                    is

tion proved successful;     but           of

any other cause, the operation         not likely
                                               is                        to   be

   The splendid anatomical and pathological museum which he had
collected and created entirely by his own industry and labour, and
chiefly within the few last years of his life, at a period when the ar
dour of most men for scientific pursuits begins to flag, consists of
nearly three thousand preparations, each most exquisitely worked
out, and the whole admirably arranged. The injected preparations
are of unrivalled beauty, and show that he had acquired a facility
and perfection in the art of anatomical injection quite peculiar to
himself.
   He was latterly engaged in an experimental investigation on the
functions of the different parts of the brains of the lower animals.
His health had suddenly declined a short time before his death, which
happened on the 12th of February, 1841.
   Sir Astley was left a widower in June 1827; the year following,
he married the daughter of John Jones, Esq., of Derry Ormond, in
Cardiganshire.               He   has left no children, and has bequeathed by his
will the whole of his museum to his nephew, Mr. Bransby Cooper,
and he has also left some property in the funds (namely, £4000 three
per cent. consols), of which the interest is to be given as a triennial
prize for the best original Essay or Treatise on given subjects in
Anatomy, Physiology or Surgery, to be awarded by the Physicians
and Surgeons of Guy's Hospital *.
   AUGUSTIN PyRAMUs DE CANDolle, one of the most distin
guished botanists of the present age, was born at Geneva on the 4th
of February, 1778. The same year is also memorable by the death
of Linnaeus, the father of modern botany, which took place about
three weeks before the birth of one, who was destined to emulate
his fame in the same department of natural history.              When seven
years of age, De Candolle sustained a serious attack of hydrocepha

merely as recreations from severer study.
   A visit to Paris, which he made in 1795, gave him the opportu
nity of attending the lectures of Cuvier, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and
other distinguished Professors of that period, and of forming friend
ships with Desfontaines and Lamarck. He always prided himself
in having been the pupil of Desfontaines, in particular, towards
whom he continued through life to feel the warmest gratitude and
affection.
   The establishment of the Society of Physics and Natural History
at Geneva, which took place, after his return, under the auspices of
the celebrated De Saussure, gave a fresh and powerful impulse to
his exertions; as was evinced by the numerous memoirs which he
presented to that Society.
   The state of Geneva being, soon after this period, absorbed into
the French empire, De Candolle was induced to quit that city and
attend the medical lectures in Paris; a course of study which, tend
ing to enlarge his views of the physiology of organized beings, con
tributed greatly to the success with which he afterwards cultivated
the Philosophy of Botany. While at Paris, he founded, in conjunc
tion with his friend M. Benjamin Delessert, the Société Philantro
pique. One of the first advantages resulting to the public from this
institution was the distribution of economical soups throughout the
different quarters of the city. Of this institution he was the active
secretary for ten years; during which period another society was
also formed under his direction and management for the Encourage
ment   of National Industry.
    In 1804 he gave lectures on Vegetable Physiology at the Collège
 de France, and published an outline of his course in 1805, in the
 Principes de Botanique prefixed to the Flore Française.
    In 1806 he was commissioned by the French Government to col
lect information on Botany and the state of Agriculture through the
 whole of the French empire, the limits of which, at that time, ex
tended beyond Hamburgh to the north, and beyond Rome to the
south.      Every year, during the following six years, he took a long
journey in the fulfilment of the task assigned him, and drew up a
report of his observations for the minister. In these annual reports,
however, he did not confine himself to the special objects of his com
mission, but made known his views with regard to the internal ad
ministrations of the countries he visited, suggesting at the same time
measures for their amelioration and for the correction of existing
abuses. He had projected a great work on the agricultural state of
the empire, and had even executed considerable portions of      it, com
prehending the French Flora arranged according        to   modern views
of  classification, when the political events
                                            of   1814 put  anentire stop
to the work.

 the study of Botany assumed a degree of importance it had never
 before possessed.     De Candolle quitted Montpellier in 1816, very
much to the    regret  of the students and of his colleagues, who em
ployed every means in their power to induce him to remain among
them: but his country had been restored to liberty, and he was firm
in his determination to fix himself in his native city, and devote to
 itsservices the remainder        his days.            of

    SIMon L'Huillier, for many years Professor of Mathematics at
Geneva, was born in that city on the 24th of April, 1750. The rapid
progress which he made in his collegiate studies was viewed with so
much interest by one of his relations, a minister of the reformed
church of Geneva, that he bequeathed him a large portion of his
fortune, on the express condition that he would embrace the cleri
cal profession: but young l’Huillier, feeling no inclination to the
studies which this condition would have imposed upon him, resisted
the temptation, and preferred devoting himself to the pursuits of
abstract science.     The spirit of independence evinced by this sacri
fice, together with the extraordinary aptitude he displayed for mathe
matical acquirements, excited the interest and conciliated the affec
tion of another of his relations, the celebrated Le Sage, by whose
instructions and counsels the most salutary influence was exercised
over the studies of his pupil.    Bertrand, who then occupied the chair
of Mathematics in the same      college, was also one of those who dis
cerned in l'Huillier the dawn of genius; and even at that early period
he regarded him as destined to be his successor in that professorship.
    As l'Huillier advanced to manhood, it became necessary for him
to engage in some active employment, in which he could turn to
account his academical attainments.        He had the good fortune, at
this critical time of his life, to be chosen tutor to Prince Czarto
rynski, with whom he remained for a period of thirteen or fourteen
years; ever honoured with the friendship and respect of
                                                                                                               of all

bers  of the Prince's family.    He dedicated      the father    his pupil                 to
his first work, which was published          Warsaw      1782, under the at                          in

    The prize proposed by the same Academy in 1786, was adjudi
cated to him for a memoir, which was since published under the
title of Exposition élémentaire des principes des calculs supérieurs.
In this masterly essay the differential calculus is derived from a prin
ciple which D'Alembert had, in the first edition of the Encyclo
pédie, so happily illustrated, and which is now so generally recog
nised as the basis of that calculus; namely, the doctrine of limits.
    On his return to Geneva in 1789, l'Huillier published an opus
cle, which acquired great celebrity, entitled La Polygonométrie;
ou de la mesure des figures rectilignes, et abrégé d'isopérimétrie élé
mentaire, ou de la dépendance mutuelle des grandeurs et des limites
des figures; at the conclusion of which he gives a masterly sum
mary of his former researches on elementary isoperimetry.         In this
work are given several formulae of great generality, and which, at
that time, were entirely new, and were calculated to facilitate the
study of numerous relations arising from the perimeters and areas of
polygons.      About the same period, indeed, Mascheroni published
 formulae  very analogous to those of l'Huillier; but the latter after
wards succeeded in showing that he had arrived at the same results
by original processes.
    During the tempestuous years of the revolution, l'Huillier sought
 in Germany the retirement so necessary to his pursuits; and chose
 Tubingen    as his residence.     The fruit of his labours during this
 seclusion was a work almost wholly new, which appeared at Tubin
gen, in 1795, under the title Principiorum calculi differentialis et
 integralis eagositio elementaris.
     He was invited, about this time, to the chair of the Higher Ma
 thematics in the University of Leyden; but his attachment to his
 native country was too deeply rooted to admit of his accepting this
 flattering offer: and eventually, in June of the same year (1795),
 he attained the object of his highest ambition, by receiving, after
 a successful public competition, the appointment of Professor of
 Mathematics in the Academy of Geneva.
     At a subsequent period he was associated with his friend and col
 league Professor Prévost in the composition of several memoirs on
 the calculation of probabilities, which appeared under their joint
 names in the memoirs of the Berlin Academy.              The questions
 treated of in these  memoirs,     although they do not reach the higher
 problems belonging to this department of mathematics, are yet re
  solved by methods remarkable for their perspicuity and elegance.
  L'Huillier published, in 1804, his Elémens raisonnés d'Algèbre, publiés
  a l'usage des étudians; in 2 vols. 8vo, a work of considerable merit,
  as developing with clearness the true principles by which the under
  standing advances from that which is known to that which is unknown.
     His last work, the Elémens d'Analyse Géométrique et Algébrique,
  appliquées à la recherche des lieur géométriques, in 4to, appeared in
  the year 1809. It was dedicated to his former pupil, Prince Czar
  torynski, who was, at that time, minister of public instruction in the
  vast empire of Russia, but who has since become better known to
  Europe as the most illustrious of the exiled Poles.

    The declining health of l’Huillier obliged him at length to resign
a professorship which he had held during five-and-twenty years, and
the duties of which he had ever discharged with the most unde
viating regularity, and the most scrupulous exactness. Even while
suffering acutely from a painful attack of sciatica, he insisted on
being carried to his class, lest any detriment should arise to his
pupils from an interruption to his lectures. Many of these pupils
have subsequently distinguished themselves in their scientific career;
among these may be cited one of our illustrious foreign members,
Professor Sturm.
    For the simplicity of his manners and the strict integrity of his
character, l’Huillier was no less remarkable than for the vigour
and extent of his mathematical powers: by these qualities he was
endeared to his friends, and esteemed and respected by all, during
a life protracted beyond the ordinary duration. His death occurred
on the 28th of March, 1840, when he had nearly completed his 90th
year, with a constitution, however, which had some time previously
been shattered and broken down by the infirmities incident to so
advanced an age".
    Félix SAvART, a philosopher distinguished more especially for
his researches in the science of Acoustics, was born on the 30th of
June, 1791, at Mézières, the capital of the Department of the           Ar
dennes, in France.     He very early exhibited a decided turn for me
chanical   invention, and his greatest delight was to contrive and con
struct with his own hands musical instruments and apparatus               il
lustrative of Natural Philosophy, a study of which he was passion
ately fond.     His parents had been connected with the school of
engineers at Mézières; and several of his relations having been           di
stinguished as artists, he was himself educated with a view to the
same destination.     But the family afterwards removing to Metz, the
path which had at first been marked out for him was abandoned,
and he prepared himself for another profession, by directing his
whole attention to medicine.       In course of time he obtained the
appointment of Assistant Surgeon in the Military Hospital. Not
satisfied with this probation, he, in 1814, repaired to Strasburg for
the purpose of prosecuting his medical studies in the Military
Hospital of that town; and he subsequently, in 1816, took a degree
in medicine in the University. He then returned to his paternal
roof at Metz, with the intention of settling, and of applying himself
diligently to the practice of his profession.      But on being restored
to the scene of his youthful occupations, the renewed sight of those
philosophical instruments to which so many delightful associations
were attached, rekindled in full force the innate predilection for the
physical sciences, which, during so long an interval, had lain dor
mant in his breast. The charms of science, arrayed in her most
 attractive colours, glittered before his imagination, and were con
 trasted, in his ardent mind, with the cares, the toils, and the anxie

   Jan. 18.-Another communication from Mr. Iremonger was                read,
containing    further directions for the construction of the “Hydro
static Galvanometer.”       Instead of selecting the heating power of a
given arrangement as the standard of graduation, as he at first sug
gested, he recommends now that the decomposing power should be
chosen.     He enters into the minutiae of the arrangement, and illus
trates by a drawing several improvements which may be introduced
with advantage. The account of the original instrument was pub
lished by the Society in the last Number of their Proceedings.
   The conclusion of Prof. Jacobi's paper was then read, containing
descriptions of apparatus for retaining a voltaic current at a given de
gree of intensity; this is effected by interposing either a liquid or a
solid resisting medium. It would be difficult, without the drawings, to
furnish our readers with an intelligible account of the arrangement.
The latter portion of the paper is devoted to a description of experi
ments made with this apparatus.
   The Secretary then briefly communicated the success with which
Dr. Leeson had employed the bichromate of potash for the last six
months as a material for exciting voltaic pairs.         There are several
curious facts in the course of development, the result of which he
anticipates ere long laying before the Society.           The arrangement
has been   employed    with much success in the    deposition    of metals.
   Mr. Weekes's Register for December was submitted to the Society,
and extracts were read. The character of the atmosphere relative to
the earth during this month was (to employ electric language) mostly
neutral.

ACTION OF NITRATE OF LEAD ON OXAMIDE—TRISOXALATE                            OF
                         LEAD.    B.Y. M. PELOUZe.
       BOILING     solution of oxamide is not altered either by nitrate or
        acetate of lead;  but add to either of these salts a little ammonia,
and there is soon    precipitated  an abundance of small, white, brilliant
laminae, soft to the touch, and which are formed of 90-5 of oxide of
lead and 9.5 of anhydrous oxalic acid; this is a new oxalate of lead,
a trisoxalate 3 Pbo + C*O°, in which the oxygen of the base and
that of the acid are equal, and which consequently corresponds to
oxalic acid crystallized in water.
   The decomposition of the oxamide into oxalic acid and ammonia,
facilitated undoubtedly by the insolubility of the new salt, is much
more rapid in this case than with the alkalies and aqueous acids.
   This trisoxalate or tribasic oxalate of lead is also formed when

                          Meteorological Observations.                                    263
oxalate of ammonia is poured into a solution of tribasic acetate of
lead; but in this case it is pulverulent, and devoid of lustre.
     In whichsoever mode prepared this salt absorbs carbonic acid from
the air, and is eventually converted into a mixture of carbonate and
neutral oxalate. Nitrate of lead boiled with this salt is rapidly
changed into neutral oxalate, whilst the nitrate becomes bibasic.
Nitrate of lead, slightly heated with carbonate of lead and water, be
comes monohydrated bibasic nitrate; there occurs, during the change,
so rapid and abundant a disengagement of carbonic acid, that it might
be supposed free nitric acid was present in the solution.—Journal de

tained in the liquid as protoxide (an addition of a few drops
of the sulphuretofammonium answers the same purpose), and
then thrown down by cyanide of potassium, and an excess
of the latter added. The iron then dissolves immediately as
ferrocyanide of potassium, while the oxide of chromium is left
behind.     In many cases the cyanide of potassium can be em
ployed to advantage in separating iron from alumina (little
iron from much alumina), as the protoxide as well as the sul

phuret of iron are so easily soluble in that salt, while alumina
is perfectly insoluble. The cyanide of potassium well deserves
to be studied as a general agent of separation. Unfortunately
the composition of the numerous double compounds it forms
with other cyanides is only imperfectly known, while their
relation to mineral and vegetable          is wholly unknown,'
so that the entire investigation must necessarily be repeated.

      HEVREUL        gave the name of Cetine to spermaceti when
    rendered    absolutely   pure. The spermaceti of commerce
always contains more or less of a yellowish oil, which it re
tains with great tenacity, and by which                    its

   These    analyses  differ  considerably     from that of    Chevreul,

   It  is needless,   however,     at present    attempting    to deduce
any formula from these analyses, as the acids which spermaceti
contains have not been accurately determined.               Spermaceti is
usually supposed to consist of margarate and oleate of ethal.
From experiments, I have reason to think that one of them
is margaric acid; but as spermaceti, when distilled, yields no
trace of sebacic acid, there is every reason to conclude the
other acid it contains, the quantity of which is extremely small,
is certainly not the oleic acid.
    In order to ascertain how far cetine differs in composition
from ordinary spermaceti, I was induced to submit a portion
of the latter also to analysis. The melting point of the crude
spermaceti analysed was only 107° F.
    (1.) O'3279 gave 0.9499 carbonic acid, and 0.3904 water.
    (2.) 0°349 gave 1°0065 carbonic acid.
    (3.) 0-3755 gave 1-0887 carbonic acid, and 0.4399 water.

    It is evident from these analyses, that the composition of
crude    spermaceti   is precisely the same with that of the purest
 cetine.    The small quantity of oil, therefore, which accompa
 nies the former is probably isomeric with the more solid fat.
                                  Ethal.
    The ethal which      I  analysed was prepared by saponifying
 spermaceti with powdered potash. The saponification was
 twice repeated, in order that none of the spermaceti might
 escape decomposition.         The lime-soap was then formed by
 precipitation with chloride of calcium.             It was dried with a
 gentle heat and the ethal extracted by aether: alcohol was found

   It is evident from these        results,  that oil of assafoetida is a
mixture of various     oils, one or more of which consist probably
only of carbon, hydrogen and sulphur, with other oils con
taining more or less oxygen. The less oxygenated portion is
the most volatile.       It is therefore unnecessary to attempt to
deduce     any  formula from these analyses.          Though             as                       oil   of

For by these three equations and the two preceding, u, v, w,
and g may be eliminated, and the resulting partial differential
equation in b, a, y, z, and t being integrated, furnishes the
means of satisfying the given conditions of the motion.    The
above are not, however, the most general expressions for
u, v, w; and the partial differential equation thus obtained is
applicable only to limited instances of motion.   I have given
reasons for supposing the general values to be

for a very extensive range of substances, the indices of refrac
tion as found both by experiment and by theory. The near
agreement of results, as there exhibited, is such as cannot fail
to impress the reader, who is content with a general view of
them, with most favourable sentiments respecting the theory
from which they are derived.                 I
                                  have however dipped deeper
into the matter, and by executing the calculations of several
cases have arrived at results which I desire now to set before
your readers, chiefly with a view of eliciting from some one
such an explanation as shall induce me to assent to the opi
nion of Professor Powell, that “the theory of undulations sup
plies at once both the laws and the explanation of the phae
nomena of dispersion.”
   The first method of calculation is the one which was made
use of by Professor Powell in three papers printed in the
Transactions of the Royal Society, under the title “Researches
towards establishing a theory of the Dispersion of Light,” and
distinguished as Nos. I. II.               III.
                                    The formula employed is
equivalent to the following:—

riment, Professor Powell comes         the conclusion that “the

refractive indices are related    the lengths

                                                                                          distinction
which  will be considered very important, when it is remem
bered that the results are expected to be accurate in the third
place of decimals, and to approximate to the figure in the
fourth place, and that the values of 9 are by no means small.
Let us consider the case of flint glass, No. 13: the values of
8 in “Research No. I.” range from 16° 10' for letter B, to
27° 39' for H. In the formula (2.)                         I
                                           find the corresponding
values to be 15° 21}' and 27°    22';  consequently   the range of
8 in the latter case is greater than in the former   by  above half
a degree; an excess, which, being nearly the 30th part of the
value of 6 for B, and about the 20th part of the whole range
of 0, must be expected to produce some manifest discrepancy
of results.
   As no applications of the formula (2.) have ever, to my
knowledge, been made public,                     I
                                    have appended the followin

   How much soever we might be disposed, after inspecting
the former of these tables, to think it confirmatory of theory,
the wide discrepancies of the latter entirely obliterate the fa
vourable impression.     If upon the same line of abscissae we
construct two   curves, the ordinates of which respectively re
present the values of u as found by theory and by experiment,
the abscissa being proportional                           to the corresponding values of
#.    we find that for flint glass they intersect in                                    four points,
the first and last of which are the extreme points, which were
assumed to be the same in the two curves; the other two points
are at C, and a point about midway between D and E. An
inspection of the figure will show, that for about a third part
of the whole there is a kind of proximity of which we might
be disposed to think favourably, were it not that in the re
maining #rds of the figure there is precisely the same sort of

    investigations were commenced and conducted, we ought not
    hastily to throw it aside.  It has besides a strong claim upon
    our indulgence arising from the fact stated by Prof. Powell,
    “that it is certain that such a formula affords the closest ac
    cordance with truth throughout the whole range of low-disper
    sive substances; and even among many of the higher it gives
    a very near approach to such an agreement.”      The following
    remark may perhaps on this account be worthy of notice.
       The constant represented by A in equation (1.) is equal to
    T A r, where Aa is the distance between two adjacent par
    ticles of the refracting medium.    Now in flint glass for the

it will be said that the undulatory theory suggested the form
of the assumed series. It is a sufficient answer to this, that
that form might have been conjectured from the mere inspec

we sure that the form suggested is the correct one? Let any

•ving been puzzled about the anagram.      The name is often
 spelled Torporley, but still there is no u.    It however oc
 curred to me that this was   probably  a fault of the printer;
 that the word manufactured in this way was Porlterey, which
 the man, thinking of his cocks and hens, had altered to the
 form in which it now stands.”     I have recently met with a
 passage in Aubrey's MS. collections in the Ashmolean                                            Mu
 seum at Oxford which confirms one part of Professor Rigaud's
 conjecture, and makes known the source whence Wood de
 rived his information. It is as follows:—
     “Mr.Hooke affirms to me that Mr. J. Torporley was
amanuensis to Vieta, but from whence he had that information
he has now forgot; but he had good and credible authority
        it;
for    and bids me tell you that      was certainly so.     He byhe
printed something against Vieta,     the name       John Porl                       of

   Another portion of this vegetable fibrine was prepared from
rye meal by boiling with dilute sulphuric acid, by which the
starch was removed as dextrine.            The boiled mass was     fil

liquor and precipitated by acetic acid. Having been treated
with boiling alcohol and aether, it was analysed by combustion

   The nitrogen was determined by comparing the relative

combustion.
   Of   ten tubes, three gave the       proportion of 1 to 7, three
gave   1 to 7-1, and four gave 1      to 7.2. But Dr. Scherer con
cludes the true relation to be 1 to 8, and points out the grounds
of that opinion in detail.

   To   ascertain the action to which the azotized nutriment is
subjected during digestion, Dr. Scherer digested in one portion
of artificial gastric juice, prepared by Eberle's method, some
boiled beef, and in another some boiled gluten, at a tempera
ture of 100° Fahrenheit; in fourteen hours they were for
the most part dissolved. The filtered liquor did not coagu
late by heat, but was slightly troubled by alcohol. Carbo
nate of potash threw down a few flocks redissolved by an ex
cess.    The liquors from               and gluten reacted alike, as
                              tlybeef

did also the liquid filtered from the acid half-digested natural
food contained in a calf's stomach.
   What remained after the above reactions of the artificially
digested beef and gluten, were mixed with fresh calf's gall,
and placed, each by itself, in a piece of clean duodenum of the
same animal, closed accurately above and below with a                           liga
 ture, and immersed in distilled water. After ten hours the
 water was examined; it coagulated by heat, strongly, and
 was precipitated by alcohol and corrosive sublimate.
    It hence follows, that the alimentary matters, as well animal
and vegetable, when dissolved by the acid gastric juice, are
converted by the alkaline bile into albumen, which is then
 absorbed by the intestinal vessels.
    Composition of Albumen, Fibrine, and Casein.--Dr. Scherer
first undertook the examination of the circumstances of the
remarkable conversion of fibrine into albumen, by solution
 with saltpetre, and was enabled to explain the contradictory
 results obtained by many chemists, as follows:–
    The fibrine of arterial blood does not dissolve in solution
of nitre.
    The fibrine of healthy venous blood dissolves readily, but
the solution is precipitated by dilution with much water.
    This precipitation is prevented by the addition of a small
quantity of alkali. If the free alkali of the serum of the
blood be neutralized by acetic acid, it becomes turbid, and de
posits flocks of albumen when diluted.
    The proportions given by Denis for dissolving fibrine, are
 150 parts of moist fibrine, 50 of saltpetre, 3 of alkali, and
270 to 300 of water. The solution so obtained possesses                              all
                        strong solution               of

out the serum and colouring matter with water. These cir
cumstances made Dr. Scherer suspect the differences                             to   be
due   to the action     of
                        oxygen, which was confirmed            experi     by
ment.      He found that fresh venous fibrine         rapidly  absorbs
oxygen from the air and gives out carbonic acid, but when
boiled this property        lost. The boiled fibrine

  The following observations indicate that albumen may
change back again into fibrine by a continuation of the me
tamorphosis by which fibrine is changed into albumen.             A
solution of venous fibrine in   saltpetre liquor  was left in a tall
glass for fourteen days; it became turbid at the top, and this
extended downwards and increased in quantity: the white

which he enumerates.     He conceives that each filament is a com
pound body which enlarges, and, from analogy, may contain the ele
ments of future structures, formed by division and subdivision, to
which no limits can be assigned.
   He then traces the formation of muscle out of cells, which, ac
cording to his observations, are derived from corpuscles of the blood,
to the state where there exists what is denominated the fibril.         In
this process, there are to be observed the formation of a second order
of tubes within the original tube; a peculiarly regular arrangement
of discs within these second tubes; the formation, first of rings and
then of spirals, out of discs so arranged; the interlacing of the spirals;
and the origin, in the space circumscribed by these, of spirals having
a minuter size; which in their turn surround others still more mi
nute; and so on. The outer spirals enter for the most part into the
formation of the investing membrane discovered by Schwann, but
for the only complete description of which, in a formed state, we are
indebted to Mr. Bowman. The inner spirals constitute what are de
nominated the fibrilla. The fibril appears to the author to be no other
than a state of the object which he designates a flat filament; and
which, as he shows, is a compound structure. The fibril he finds to
be, not round and beaded, as         it has been supposed, but a flat and
grooved filament; the description above given of the structure of the
filament being especially applicable here. This flat filament is so
situated in the fasciculus of voluntary muscle, as to present          edge                   its

    June 30, 1841.-The following papers were read :—
     1. “Abrief note to accompany a series of specimens from Lockport,
near Niagara, in the State of New York,” by William Jory Henwood,
Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Mr. Henwood commences by calling attention to Mr.               J. Hall's
Geological Reports of the fourth division of the State of New York,
particularly to that for 1840, which contains an important stratigra
phical account, with lists of organic remains, of the beds near Lock
port (p. 452), and in which the deposit called the Lockport lime
stone is placed in the lowest portion of a series of beds considered
by Mr. Hall to be the equivalents of the Wenlock limestone. Mr.
Henwood likewise especially alludes to that geologist's description
of several beds classed with the Wenlock limestone of the State of
New York, but which have no representative in Shropshire and the
adjacent counties.
     At Lockport the strata are nearly horizontal, and are well exposed
 in a section of great length, and about 100 feet in altitude, along the
banks of the Erie Canal.       The uppermost bed Mr. Henwood believes
 to be the Lockport or Wenlock limestone; and it is succeeded in
 descending order by several other thin beds of similar or slightly va
 rying characters, and they are all traversed by joints, the principal
 bearing about magnetic N. and S.         Organic remains are stated to
 be abundant in these limestones.
     The next subjacent formation is the Rochester shale, considered by
 Mr. Hall to be the equivalent of the Wenlock shale. It extends to
 the bottom of the section, except at a few points, and consists of beds
  of green shale abounding in organic remains, including Asaphus longi
  caudatus 2, Homalonotus delphinocephalus,     Platynotus Boltoni, Ortho
  ceras annulatum ?, Conularia               ?, Leptana transversalis, L.
  depressa, Terebratula aspera, Avicula striata ?, Caryocrinites ornata".
  Beds of limestone occur in the shale at irregular intervals, but they
  contain no organic remains.
     At the few points where the cutting has penetrated the shale, a
  bed of limestone is exposed, and is stated to contain, on the author
  ity of Mr. Forman, who has made the fossils of the district his par
  ticular study, Orbiculae and other organic remains; and the same
  gentleman informed Mr. Henwood, that beneath this limestone there
  are strata of sandstone enclosing fucoides and leaves of plants.
      At Rochester the Genessee traverses a channel 500 feet wide and
     • The above species have been determined by specimens which Mr. Hen
  wood presented to the Society.   The Asaphus longicaudatus is distinguished
  from the fossil described by Mr. Murchison in the absence of the large pro
  tuberance “on the anterior edge of the buckler," Silur. Syst., p. 656.

 depth, composed of beds of quartzose limestone and calcareous sand
 stone containing shells, and abounding in hollows lined with stalag
 mitic incrustations.

and the river Ristigouche in New Brunswick,” by Mr. Henwood.
    Granite constitutes the lowest rock in the neighbourhood of Ba

portions of the shale give out, on being broken, a most powerful
garlic or arsenical odour.
    At the Capes, about ten miles east of Bathurst, the sandstones con
tain thin beds of coal, and the greater part of the plants which ac
companied the paper was obtained from them. The coal is bitumi
nous and stated to burn well; but the quantity is too small to be
worked profitably.     On the beach Mr. Henwood noticed enormous
quantities of nodular iron-stone, though he was able to discover in
situ only a few in one of the beds of sandstone.
    Towards Belle Dune, on the coast of Chaleur Bay, hummocks of ser
pentine, traversed by small veins of steatite and calcareous spar, rise
through the sand; and in a few places beds of sandstone and conglo
merate, assuming a flinty character, are in contact with the serpentine.
Some of the strata of conglomerate are displaced or heaved by certain
joints; but other joints traverse the strata without displacing them.
    At Chambers's, near Belle Dune Point, is a quartzose ferruginous
limestone, which contains remains of Favosites polymorpha and other
corals. The beds strike about N.E. and S.W., and dip 20° S.E.
    At Dumerisque's on the Ristigouche, near Dalhousie, the western
extremity of Chaleur Bay, Mr. Henwood observed a series of strata,
extending less than a quarter of a mile in length, and bounded by two
trap dykes, beyond which he was unable to detect any traces of the
beds.    The strike of the strata was nearly N.E. and S.W., and dip
from 40° to 50° towards the S.E.
    The following ascending sectional list is given by the author:—
    1. Lowest bed, impure limestone, containing species of Cyatho
phyllum, Favosites, and Syringopora, also crinoidal remains.

Favosites Gothlandica, Producta depressa, Atrypa aspera 2

in dip and strike with the subjacent strata. The fossils are for the
greater part the same as in the other beds, consisting of Producta
depressa, Atrypa aspera, and a Spirifera which occurs also in No. 6.
   The rock near Dalhousie is a reddish slate, in which Mr. Henwood
sought in vain for organic remains. The dip of the laminae is 70° to
the S.E.                                               -
   On the opposite side of the river in Lower Canada, the strata con

   Near Cambellton, both the Canadian and the New Brunswick
banks of the Ristigouche are composed of sandstone and conglomerate
with imperfect fragments of vegetable remains. The strata are cut
through by numerous trap dykes, many of which have produced
faults, but in an equal number of instances no similar effects are
visible.
   At John Pratts, seven miles above Cambellton on the New Bruns
wick side of the Ristigouche, is a slaty limestone enclosing Crinoidea
and a few other obscure organic bodies. The beds dip W., and strike
20° E. of N. A thin-bedded limestone, in which the author could
discover no fossils, extends to the Maramajaw, and thence to the Up
salguilch river.    In some places it is much traversed by trap dykes,
and at the Little Falls of the Upsalguilch by dykes of felspar porphyry
resembling the Cornish elvans. The strike of the strata is N. and
S., and the dip W.
   3. “On the locality and geological position of Cuculla a decussata,”
by Joshua Trimmer, Esq., F.G.S.
   The object of this communication is to determine the geological
formation to which the siliceous casts of the Cucullaea decussata really
belong, it having been stated that they occur at Faversham in Kent",
in a bed of greenish siliceous sand, placed by Mr. Webster above the
chalk+; in the upper greensand of Kent, but with a doubt: ; in the
lower greensand of Kent and Sussex, and in the greensand of Black
down $.
   The fossil was first described by Mr. Parkinson, who states, on the
authority of the late Mr. Francis Crow, that it was found at Faver
sham associated with a silicified shell exactly agreeing with the Strom
bus pes Pelicani of the Devonshire whetstone pits; but he adds, that
it is specifically different from the Cucullaea of Devonshire, and he
proposes to designate it by the name of C. decussata.     The collection
of the late Mr. Crow, now in the Canterbury Museum, contains three
specimens of this fossil, which, with two others presented by Mr. E.
Crow to the Geological Society, are said by the author on the au
thority of that gentleman, to have been found in digging a ha-ha at
Nash Court, about two miles from Faversham.          Mr. Trimmer like

 wise mentions as independent evidence of these fossils having been
 found at Nash Court, that it is stated on both editions of Mr.
  Greenough's Map, that siliceous fossils occur there.
    A careful examination of the specimens presented to the Geologi
 cal Society by Mr. E. Crow, has verified the correctness of Mr.
 Parkinson's opinion, that the Faversham shell is specifically distinct
 from the Cucullaeae of the greensands.
    The strata of Nash Court, Mr. Trimmer says, undoubtedly belong
 to the lowest sands of the London clay, and to that portion which is
 very near the junction with the chalk.
    In the village of Boughton, not far from Nash Court, Mr. Trim
 mer has examined two sections situated to the east and west of the
 50th mile-stone, and nearly on a level with the ha-ha, in which, the
 Cucullaea decussata was found.       The strata consisted of white and
 ferruginous sand with layers of ferruginous clay, in some parts con
 siderably indurated.    He did not observe any organic remains, but
 shells are reported to have been found in the eastern section.      At a
 greater elevation on the side of Boughton Hill, and a little below
 the junction of the sands with the brown clay, which forms the sum
 mit of the hill, are courses of geodes of a ferruginous sandstone very
 like some of the Wealden sandstone, and lined with mammillary sili
 ceous deposits and quartz crystals.      Casts of plastic clay shells are
 occasionally found in the sandstone, but more abundantly in the al
 ternate layers of indurated ferruginous clay.      From a bed four feet
 thick of this sandstone worked in a quarry in the wood on the side
 of Boughton Hill, Mr. Trimmer obtained casts of Calyptraea trochi
formis, Rostellaria Sowerbii (Strombus pes Pelicani of Mr. Parkinson),
 Potamides intermedium, and a Venus which has been considered a
 variety of V. ovalis, but is clearly distinct. Similar remains are stated
 by the author to occur in the upper part of the cliffs at Reculver,
 either in loose masses, or sand slightly indurated.       In conclusion,
 Mr. Trimmer acknowledges the assistance which he received in pre
 paring the communication.

 a  gigantic  extinct Saurian Reptile occurring in the Oolitic forma
 tions of different portions of England,” by Professor Owen, F.R.S.,
 F.G.S.
    The remains described in this memoir consist of vertebrae and
 bones of the extremities obtained by Mr. Kingdon from the oolite
 quarries of Chipping Norton, in Oxfordshire; of vertebrae and other
 bones from the oolite of Blisworth, near Northampton, transmitted
 to the author by Miss Baker; and of other remains from the oolite
 of Staple Hill, Wotton, three miles north-west of Woodstock; from
 the oolite near Buckingham; the Portland stone at Garsington and
 Thame, in the collection of Dr. Buckland : Mr. Owen has likewise
 examined a vertebra and some bones of the extremities of the same
 saurian from the Yorkshire oolite, and preserved in the Scarborough
 Museum.

mensions a middle caudal vertebra of a full-sized whale, the antero
posterior diameter being five inches, the transverse eight inches six
lines, and the vertical seven inches.      The sides and under part of
the centrum are described as     very  concave;   and the shape of the
articular extremities as  nearly  circular,  with a greater concavity in
the anterior one than in the  posterior.    The posterior haemapophysial
articular surfaces  slope downwards and forwards in the form of semi
circular facets for nearly two inches upon the under surfaces. . The
neurapophyses commence close to the anterior surface of the cen
trum, their antero-posterior extent being three and a half inches,
and they meet at a rather acute angle above the spinal canal. The
vertical diameter of the spinal canal was one inch nine lines, the
transverse two inches, and the breadth of the base of the neural arch,
  from the outside of the neurapophyses, five inches three lines. The
 transverse process is developed from the centrum just below the neu
 rapophysial suture.        In          all

   Mr. Owen then describes, with his wonted minuteness and per
fect acquaintance with the subject, other caudal vertebrae found at
Blisworth, but it is not possible to abridge the details.
   Among the remains discovered near Chipping Norton are eleven
caudal vertebrae without transverse processes, and therefore assigned
by the author to the terminal half of the tail. They progressively
diminished in transverse diameter from five inches to two inches,
but without losing in equal ratio their length, which continues
the same, or five and a half inches in the vertebra which has only
three inches and three lines of breadth, five inches in that which is
two inches and nine lines broad, and four inches in that which has a
breadth of two inches.     These eleven vertebrae do not constitute,

the slender terminal caudal vertebrae of the Iguanodon are also hex
agonal, and not cylindrical as in the Cetiosaurus.
     As there is no known extinct saurian which can so nearly com
pete in size with the Cetiosaurus as the Iguanodon, it is fortunate,
Prof. Owen observes, that the distinguishing characters are so well
marked and easily recognizable.
     Dorsal vertebra.-The only portion of a dorsal vertebra described
 in the memoir is the extremity of a spinous process, the posterior
 surface of which is rough and flattened, 4 inches across, at about
 the same distance below the end of the spine; the sides are traversed
 to a certain extent by a longitudinal ridge, anterior to which they
 are concave and smooth, but their anterior margin is again flattened
 and rough, though it is not so broad as the posterior.

ping Norton.
    Numerous fragments of long bones without a trace of a medullary
cavity have been found at Chipping Norton, and correspond in mag
nitude with the vertebrae.      The articular surfaces which are pre
served are covered with     large  tubercles for the attachment of thick
cartilages.    The best preserved fragments are considered to belong
to metacarpal or metatarsal and phalangeal bones, and are therefore,
Prof. Owen says, decisive evidence against the cetacean nature of
the animal; but he adds, they possess characters by which they
may be distinguished from the corresponding bones of known ex
tinct gigantic saurians. One of these bones, believed to be a meta
carpal or a metatarsal, is double the bulk of the largest analogous
bone of a full-grown elephant, though the metacarpals or metatar
sals are much smaller in proportion in Saurians than in Pachyderms.
The bone is 7 inches in length, 9 in circumference in              middle,                   its               5

more probably belong to the Steneosaurus.
   In conclusion, it is stated that the vertebrae described in the paper
prove the existence of a saurian genus distinct from the Mega
losaurus, Steneosaurus, Poikilopleuron, Plesiosaurus, or any other
large extinct reptile, remains of which have been discovered in the
oolitic series; that the vertebrae, as well as the bones of the extre

    In the upper beds, consisting of sand and gravel, and known as
 the Golden Sands of the Tagus, Mr. Smith found no organic remains;
 but in the next inferior series of strata, composed of yellow sand,
calcareous sandstone and blue marl, the Almada beds of Mr. Sharpe,
marine remains abound.        Of upwards of 150 species collected by
the author, 124 have admitted of being carefully determined, and of
these, 20 are new, 51 occur near Bordeaux, 17 in the Faluns of Tou
raine, 15 in the Sub-apennine and Sicilian beds, 8 in the London
and Paris basins, and 35 are recent.         Several of the species also
occur in the tertiary deposits of Vienna, Switzerland, Turin, and
the Morea.
    A list of five new species of Echinodermata is also given, one of
which M. Agassiz has identified with a Molasse species.          The fol
lowing fishes have likewise been determined by M. Agassiz.:-Ory
rhina Xiphodon, a Bordeaux ichthyolite; Carcharias productus, C.
megalodon, which occurs in the London basin; Galeus aduncus, and
Lamna denticulata; also a species of Delphinus.

   6. “Some remarks on the Silurian Strata between Aymestry and
Wenlock,” by Charles Lyell, Esq., V.P.G.S.
   Two points are more particularly discussed in this paper:—1st,
the inferences which may be drawn respecting the dislocation of
strata from the position of fossil corals in the bed in which they occur,
and of the subsidences which beds containing Polyparia underwent
during the accumulation of the upper Silurian strata; and 2ndly,
certain features in the physical geography of the district between
Aymestry and Wenlock, dependent on geological structure.
   1. Inferences from the position of Corals, &c.—The corals which
abound in the Aymestry and Wenlock limestones, in the neighbour
hood of Aymestry, retain, Mr. Lyell states, the position in which they
grew, the points of attachment being inclined towards the lower part
of each stratum, and the convex surface of the hemispherical masses
being upwards.      At Lower Lye, near Aymestry, this arrangement is
advantageously exhibited near the junction of the Wenlock limestone
with the lower Ludlow formation, in consequence of the layers of
shale or mudstone marking more clearly the stratification than in
places where the limestone is almost exclusively an aggregate of or
ganic remains.      The Rev. T. T. Lewis has also noticed some rare
instances of the roots and base of the stem of an Encrinus growing
on the top or convex surface of a coral. These facts, with the great
size and extent of the corals, (the Catenipora escharoides sometimes
spreading continuously in a horizontal direction for nine feet and
even more, and a hemispherical mass of Cyathophyllum in the Ludlow
Museum being four feet in diameter) imply, Mr. Lyell states, the slow
accumulation of the materials composing the upper Silurian strata.
   The vertical position of the corals with respect to the plane of strati
fication is sufficiently general to deserve particular attention, with a
view of determining the amount of dislocation which the enclosing

336                              Geological Society.
beds may have undergone, and of deciding in some cases whether the
strata have been completely inverted; but considerable caution, the
author says, is necessary in the application of this test, and that the
inference must be drawn, not from a single specimen or a few corals
being reversed or inclined, but from the prevailing disposition of the
great masses.       At Gleedon Hill and Bradley, near Wenlock, he no
ticed that some of the Polyparia, particularly beds of Catenipora, main
tained their original vertical direction, while others were inclined or
reversed and mingled with broken stems of Crinoidea, leaving no
doubt upon his mind that the dislocated specimens were fragments
which had been broken off by the action of the waves, and thrown
 down upon the reef.
     From the inquiries of Mr. Darwin and other naturalists, it appears
 that stone-corals do not flourish at a depth exceeding 120 feet.
 Without assuming that the habits of extinct species were precisely
 similar to those now living, Mr. Lyell says, it may nevertheless be
 inferred from aralogy, that the stone-corals of the Silurian period
 did not live at a depth of many hundred feet; and, consequently,
 that those parts of the Wen<U+017F>lock limestone in which the corals pre
 serve their natural position, were produced at a moderate depth
 from the surface. This conclusion, he shows, is also supported by the
 occurrence of the inverted and broken corals noticed above, and as
  sociated with others in the position in which they grew.
     A further inference drawn by Mr. Lyell from the limited depths
  at which corals grow beneath the surface of the ocean, is the sub
  sidences which must have consequently taken place during the accu
 mulation of the upper Silurian strata. Thus in the Gatley escarp
 ment near Aymestry, he shows, that the lower or Wenlock coralline
  limestone is separated from the upper or Aymestry limestone by
  more than 400 feet of mudstone or lower Ludlow strata, and that
  in the same neighbourhood a great thickness of mudstone, amounting
  at the New Bridge, Ludlow, to 700 feet, is superimposed on the Ay
  mestry limestone.       It        is,
                                 therefore, evident,     says, that      he
                                                                        least            at
  two   great subsidences took    place  during the accumulation     the up             of

  carried down the Wenlock limestone              depth exceeding 500 feet,
                                                          to   a

                                    of

                                       which depressed the whole       these             of

                deposited upon the surface where the Aymestry corals
  had grown.       He thinks, however, from analogy, that the sinking                         of
              the ocean probably went          during the whole period, but

 certain that the fossils contained in the transition rocks of the islands
 and shores of the fiord of Christiania agree most nearly with those
 in the lower part of the English Silurian system; and, Mr. Lyell
 adds, that in mineral character the Norwegian rocks also resemble
 more closely that part of the system as exhibited in Shropshire and
 Radnorshire than the upper.
    The two principal divisions of the Christiania group consist, first,
 of dark shale, slate and clay, some of the beds being highly calcareous,
 and enclosing Graptolites, Trilobites and other fossils; also of beds
 of grit; and secondly, of strata of smoke-grey limestone abound
ing in corals, and of sandstone, shale and conglomerate. Prof. Keil
 hau, who has long studied these formations, of which the beds are
 much disturbed, inclines to the opinion that the second division is
the uppermost deposit. Among the fossils common to the Chris
tiania series and the English lower Silurian strata are Calymene punc
tata, Trinucleus Caractaci, Orthoceras conicum, Bellerophon bilobatus,
Pentamerus oblongus and Graptolites Murchisonius: other species of
Trilobites, which are not British, partake of the same type as those
which characterize the Caradoc sandstone or Llandeilo flags.
    In the island of Langoen in the fiord of Christiania, a few miles
from Holmstrand, Mr. Lyell examined a limestone rich in fossils.
It dips regularly towards the west, or in the direction of Holm
strand; and he believes that it constitutes, together with the quartz
ose sandstone near that town, one of the uppermost divisions of the
Christiania formation.      Among the corals which he obtained from
the limestone, the following have been determined as identical
with British species; and as five of them have been found in En
gland, hitherto, only in the upper Silurian strata, and others both in
the upper and lower, Mr. Lyell is of opinion that the Langoen deposit
may indicate a passage from the lower to the upper Silurian rocks.

at least one-third of which are unknown as British—a want of agree
ment, Mr. Lyell observes, which may be partly ascribed to an im
perfect knowledge of the Silurian Fauna of both countries, and
partly to the laws which influence the geographical distribution of
existing animals.    The author does not deny, that, when the more
ancient rocks were formed, the marine species may not have enjoyed
a wider geographical range than now ; for when coral reefs existed
between the 50th and 70th degrees of latitude, a more uniform tem
perature must have prevailed than at the present day; but he con
tends that there are no data for imagining that the same species were
ever universally distributed.
   A description of the igneous rocks of the fiord of Christiania is
not within the object of this communication; but Mr. Lyell states,
that the island of Langoen is traversed in an east and west direction
by several dikes of greenstone, from two to three feet thick, but with
out dislocating the strata; he likewise mentions, that the junction of
the quartzose sandstone of Holmstrand with a vertical dike of felspar
porphyry thirty feet thick, is finely exhibited at Smörsteen.         The
same porphyry also overlies the sandstone at Engnaes.        The trap of
this district passes into a reddish granite, and the contact of the latter
with horizontal, thin beds of Silurian limestone and shale is exposed
to the height of fifteen feet at Sotfjeld, N.E. from Holmstrand; and
the contact is visible on the opposite side of the fiord. At the line
of junction the limestone is white, and the shale is converted into
Lydian stone. No veins of granite penetrate the fossiliferous strata
in that neighbourhood, as at some places near Christiania; and the
occurrence of a breccia at one point, where the limestone joins the
plutonic rock, induced Mr. Lyell to suspect that the latter had been
there protruded in a solid form.

  Nov. 2, 1841.-The following communications were read:—
  An extract of a letter from M. Dumas “On the Analysis of
Atmospheric     Air.”
  The method of analysis adopted in these experiments was to
cause the air under examination to pass through the combustion
tube employed in organic analysis, charged with reduced metallic
copper, into an exhausted flask, and then weighing the resulting
oxide of copper and the nitrogen in the flask. M. Dumas says, “You
may be assured that no combination of nitrogen with copper is formed
in the circumstances under which we operate, a decided red heat
being used; besides,        all
                         our analyses agree,     you will      as

     “Thus  the three first figures expressing the proportion of oxygen
contained in the air are constant, the fourth figure variable.      I do
not consider, however, that the whole of this difference can arise
from errors of observation; it is a subject requiring still further
examination.      MM. Melloni and Piria are performing the same
experiments, at Naples, by the same means; and also M. Stas, at
Brussels.    M. Levy, who has assisted in the above experiments,                                in
tends to  repeat  them in Denmark.”
   M. Dumas urges the repetition of these experiments to be made
at various times and in various places all over the world, to which
the English chemist has more easy access than others, in order to
resolve this curious physical problem.
   “The density of nitrogen appears to me,” he adds, “to be be
tween 0-970 and 0.973. That of oxygen, with which we have been
particularly occupied, and upon which we have made twenty dif
ferent experiments, is always found comprised between 1-105 and
1:108; it appears to be represented very nearly by 1-106. That of
carbonic acid has varied between 1526 and 1:528; if 75 is adopted
for the atom of carbon, then oxygen is condensed some thousandths
in forming carbonic acid.
   “The density of hydrogen is always found above 0-0691, it has
varied between 0.0692 and 0-0696; we have operated on quanti
ties of about 17 litres of this gas. As to the composition of water
by weight, which has occupied me personally during nearly two
months, and on which I am still experimenting, I remain doubtful.
I  have never found less than 12:50 for the equivalent of hydrogen,
and often 12:55, and at present I cannot choose between them. In
adopting the first of these numbers no error of any practical conse
quence can result; but as a philosophical question I take so high an
interest in     it,
                 that shall continue my experiments until they leave

  ever strange,       it is true that the results appear, almost all, to have
  been     miscalculated.         The specific gravity of hydrogen, instead of
    being calculated 0-0687, should have been 0-06986, or with Rud
   berg's dilatation, 0.06988.            With the received specific gravity of
    oxygen, this would give 12-67 for the equivalent of hydrogen;
   Dumas's specific gravity of oxygen would give 12-64. On                            these                             all

expressing the specific gravity by 2.77", and then deducting 360 from
the result, gives of course the saccharometer indication or gravity;
thus
       #... — 360 = 36. Many works, held in high estimation, by way
of  facilitating this operation, have adopted the use of the factor 2:78,
but this must of necessity involve error without materially shortening
the calculation; some parties have gone so far as to state that 2:7
is a sufficient approximation; this, however, with the gravity taken
as an illustration, will give an error of 11.4 pounds in excess, or 47-4
instead of 36. The rule adopted by the author for converting real
specific gravities, or hydrometer indications, into saccharometer gra
vities, is as follows:—From the specific gravity observed, expressed
in terms of distilled water as unity, deduct l, and then multiply the
result by 360; the product is the equivalent saccharometer indication;
thus for specific gravity 1 100; 1:100–1000 x 360=36 of the sac
charometer. The saccharometer gravity again is calculated from the
real specific gravity, by the converse of this operation; divide the
saccharometer indication

                                                 by 360 and then add                      l;   thus       *+        1,000

   To find the filament in red blood-discs, Dr. Barry recommends the
blood of a batrachian reptile, such as the frog or newt, on account
of the large size of the discs in these animals. The blood should be

    The connexion of the several points in (1) will trace out the
northern limiting line of total eclipse, those in (2) the central line,
and those in (3) the southern limiting line of total eclipse.
   To indicate some of the principal places over, or near to which
the shadow will pass, a small map, on Mercator's projection, is
added (Plate IV.); representing the table from 43° to 49° of north
latitude, and from 1° to 21° of east longitude. The transverse curve
lines represent arcs of vertical circles; and for the same moment of
time, inserted above them, their intersections with the north, central,
 and south lines respectively, represent the phaenomena numbered
 1, 2, 3, previously explained.    The central line will pass
            North of Marseilles . . . 0°28' or 32.2 miles.
            South of Turin . . . . . 0 27 or 31.0        ...

            North of Buda . . . . . . 0 58 or 66.8 ...
    The beginning of the total eclipse at a place on the central line,
being the contact of the eastern limbs of the moon and sun, and the
ending the contact of the western limbs, the interval representing
the duration of the total eclipse at any point will be about 2"'4.
    Should the darkness be sufficiently intense, as has been sometimes
the case during total eclipses of the sun, to render some of the
planets and brighter stars visible, the planet Mercury may be looked
for about 5° south of the sun and moon. The planet Mars about
west by north, Mars being 15" of right ascension to the west, and
1° 16' of declination to the north of the sun and moon.       The planet
Venus is below the horizon until the shadow has passed Vienna, and
will scarcely be visible at the eastern limit of the map. Jupiter and
Saturn are invisible, being below the horizon during the whole in
terval.   The Georgian is 7* 13" of right ascension to the west, and
23°53' to the south of the sun and moon.
   The sun and moon are in the constellation Gemini, and will have
Castor and Pollux not far distant in a N.N.E. direction; Ursa Major
to the northward and eastward; Procyon to the south and east; Orion
to the south and west; Taurus to the west; and Auriga and Perseus
to the north and west.
   Those persons who wish for more detailed information regarding
the circumstances and phaenomena of solar eclipses, will be amply
gratified by consulting “A Memoir relative to the Annular Eclipse
of the Sun, which will happen on Sept. 7, 1820, by Francis Baily
(London, 1818);’ the works therein referred to, viz. Phil. Trans.,
vol. xxix. p. 245, vol.xl. p. 177, vol. xlv. p. 582, &c. &c.; and a paper

Royal Astronomical Society, “On a remarkable Phaenomenon that

   Since the preceding matter was in type, a copy of Professor Silli
man's Journal of Science and Arts, for January 1842, has arrived
from America, containing an article “On the Solar Eclipse of July
8, 1842 ' (civil time), from which the following is extracted, as me
riting particular attention:—
   “As the approaching eclipse will excite great interest throughout
Europe, and especially in those places where it will be total, it is
earnestly hoped that particular attention will be paid by those fa
vourably situated, and in possession of suitable instruments, to the
determination of the correctness of a recent suggestion, that the
irregularities so frequently noticed at the second and third contacts
of nearly central eclipses, and at all the contacts of the transits of
Venus, may be seen or not at the pleasure of the observer, according
as the colour of the dark glass he applies to his telescope is red or
green. These irregularities, as seen by many, have been minutely
described by Francis Baily, Esq. of London, in an article in the
tenth volume of the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, although
it particularly relates to the appearances, observed by himself, in the
south part of Scotland, during the eclipse of May 15th, 1836, which
was annular there. Many of the appearances described by Mr. Baily
were seen through a red glass at the second and third contacts of
the eclipse of February 12th, 1831, which was annular in the south
 eastern part of the State.    Shortly afterwards, however, it having
been ascertained that a double screen, composed   of one light red and
one light green glass, would not only render the  light of the sun very
pleasant to the eye, but would far better define the limbs, and would
sometimes even enable me to see a small spot, that was invisible
through the dark redialone, a screen of that kind was adapted to
the telescope, and was used for the partial eclipses of 1832 and
1836, and those that were central in 1834 and 1838. Through this
screen no one of the irregularities described by Mr. Baily has ever
been perceived, although carefully looked for.    Indeed, so remark
able was the difference between the observed and expected appear
ances of the sun's limbs at the second and third contacts at Beaufort,
S. C. on November 30th, 1834, that even then a suspicion was ex
 cited that the entire absence of               all
                                           distortion      irregularity
                                                                  or       the        in
 cusps, just before and after the total obscuration, was                 attri to    be
 buted  to  the colour of  the screen, especially since other observers                        in
 the vicinity  of Beaufort saw through red screens many            most    the or         of

with 3}-feet telescopes by Dollond and Fraunhofer, were enabled di
stinctly to see some of these appearances through the red eye-piece of
the former, though none was visible through the green screen of the
latter instrument.    At Washington, where the eclipse was nearly
central, no distortion of the limb of the moon could be seen through
the double screen above mentioned, and the cusps of the sun, just
before and after the ring, were as pointed as needles. The Committee
of the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, in their report on this
eclipse, say, ‘This suggestion is one of great importance, as it seems
to furnish evidence of the existence of a lunar atmosphere, through
which, as through our own, the red rays have the greatest penetra
tive power.     It also leads to new views concerning the cause of the
remarkable    appearances   of the beads of light and the dark lines fre
 quently noticed; since it shows that their appearance may be com
pletely modified by a change in the colour, and, consequently, in the
absorbing power of the screen glass through which they are ob
 served.’ It is believed that on another account will this suggestion,
 if well founded, be of great importance, viz. in       obvious tendency                                            its

        DECOMPOSITION OF BROMATE OF POTASH BY HEAT.
   According to M. Fritzsche, when bromate of potash is subjected to
a high   temperature in a mercury-bath, the crystals of the salt de
crepitate, and are reduced to powder.    If this powder be thrown into
water it immediately disengages pure oxygen gas: the evolution is
most rapid when the temperature of the water is raised from about
160° to 175°.    In the opinion of the author, the bromate influenced
by heat is decomposed into bromite and oxibromate, the latter being
immediately decomposed by the water into bromate and oxygen gas.
                                        -
It appears that the bromite possesses the property of readily absorb
ing oxygen, and reproducing bromate, for the author found that the
powder, dissolved in water and evaporated in the air, reproduced
exactly the quantity of bromate originally submitted to experiment.
   The production of oxibromate, under these circumstances, is a
curious fact, which connects the bromate with the chlorate of potash;
and the decomposition which the oxibromate undergoes in water,
explains how it happens that it has been found impossible to obtain
oxibromate of potash in the moist way.—Journal de Pharm. et de

                                   BY M. H. ROSE.
   By fusing a mixture of one equivalent each of sulphate of potash
and soda in a platina crucible, the author obtained a vitreous mass
devoid of crystalline texture; this was dissolved in boiling water and
the solution quickly filtered, and allowed to cool slowly in the dark;
it exhibited the same appearance of light as was observed by M.
Rose in 1836 during the crystallization of a solution of vitreous ar
senious acid in hydrochloric acid; the formation of each rudiment of
a crystal was announced by a spark. The crystals thus obtained ex
hibit nothing similar when re-dissolved; but if crystals which have
been formed with the disengagement of light be taken from the so
lution, they become again phosphorescent when strongly rubbed or
pressed; they do not retain this property for more than a few hours,
and have the usual crystalline form of the salt.
   No phosphorescence occurs during the crystallization of the sul
phate of potash, when the vitreous mass is dissolved more than 24
hours after       its
                   fusion;    itappears then         to
                                                   have passed        the cry  to
stalline state. The crystals deposited with phosphorescence are not
formed   of pure sulphate       potash; they are true double salt, which
                                  of                     a

it a double salt, in which, contrary to what usually happens, the pot
ash is isomorphous with soda.
   The double sulphate of potash and soda is produced, not only by
fusing the two mixed sulphates, but by fusing sulphate of potash with
chloride of sodium, or carbonate of soda, or chloride of potassium with
sulphate of soda.
   Equivalents of neutral chromate of potash and anhydrous sulphate
of soda, exhibited after fusion the same phaenomena as the compound
of the two sulphates; the crystals formed were composed of the two
acids and two bases.
   The double chromate of potash and soda, free from sulphate, ex
hibit very lively phosphorescence, and so also does the seleniate of
potash and soda.
   The light which appears during the crystallization of certain bo
dies is due, as proved by the foregoing statements in the opinion of
the author, to the passage of a salt from one state to another isomeric

LII.     Reply to the Objections           and Strictures   of Dr. Hare,
    with reference to the          Whirlwind Theory of Storms. By
    W. C. REDFIELD +.
    N this    Journal for December 1841 (S. 3. vol. xix. p. 423),
      there appears an article “On the Theory of Storms, with
reference to the views of Mr. Redfield,” by Robert Hare,
M.D., &c. &c., which is also found, substantially, in Silliman's
American Journal of Science for January 1842, and affords
occasion for the notes and remarks which follow.
    The several series of facts and observations, showing both
the rotary and progressive movement of great storms, which I
have published, together with those which have also been ad
duced by Reid, Milne, Dove and Piddingtont, are deemed
sufficient to establish the whirlwind character of these storms.
 In the absence, therefore, of contravening facts of a reliable
character, it seems incumbent on an objector to set aside these
facts and observations as unfounded and inaccurate, or to
show that the results which they appear to establish have been
 deduced erroneously. This task Dr. Hare has not attempted;
 and I might therefore have been excused from replying to his
 objections and strictures, as these cannot affect the results
 which it has been my chief aim to establish.
     But the observations which           I  have published extend also
 to the so-called tornado or water-spout, and with similar re

354                           Mr. Redfield's Reply                    to   Dr. Hare,
sults"; while Mr. Espy and Dr. Hare have                                         each       in turn     ad
vanced his theory of tornadoes and storms, founded on d priori
reasoning or speculation, and on alleged deductions from
phaenomena observed. Hence, perhaps, originates this fourth
attempt, from one or other of these sources, to discredit the
results of my principal inquiries; being, however, the first
from Dr. Hare.
   Moreover,                  I
                 have sometimes ventured to offer summary
sketches of other results or conclusions which seemed to follow
from the above-mentioned and other developments, which came
under notice in pursuing my meteorological inquiriest. These
sketches or conclusions were given, partly as notifications, and
partly because I was not willing it should appear in after years,
that such results or conclusions as I have noticed had been
overlooked in conducting my examinations. These inceptive
statements seem to have occasioned many of the strictures
and criticisms which I am now to notice.
   Dr. Hare says, that my “idea that tornadoes and hurri
canes are               all
               whirlwinds, involves some improbabilities,” and
that     requires,
          it       that “during every hurricane there should
be  blasts         of
             nearly equal force coinciding with every tangent
which can       applied  be circle,” and that “thirty-two ships,
                                              to    a
equidistant from the axis                                  of
                                 gyration and from each other,
should each have the wind from          different point    the com
                                                                 a                      of
pass with nearly equal force.”      The only modification        ad                                he
mits, “is that resulting from the progressive motion which
tends     increase the velocity
              to                    the wind"               of
                                                     one side, “and              on
to diminish    upon the other.”
                        it
I    could never have imagined that any “idea”             mine ne                          of
cessarily involved the conditions here specified; and            the                               if
                                                                                                        vi by
fact      be
         such, Dr. Hare would have rendered some service
making       manifest.
               it         The modification admitted         him,                            by
tally important            shows  only
                                  as

would doubtless prevent any such perfect symmetry             results                         of

posing that the course       the wind         whirlwind must coin     in   a
cide with the tangents         circle. He alleges also, “that

come back to the same point of the compass from which it
had before blown, except by an extraneous force or influ
ence, we shall in this be able to agree. He states further,
that “in the course of time it would be felt, at any station, to
proceed from many different directions, if not from every
point of the compass.” The first of these conditions is verified
by observation, except as I have shown that the changes in a
regular whirlwind storm will not, in the true wind of the gale,
be likely to exceed sixteen points of the compass at any one
station. It will be difficult, however, for Dr. Hare to show,
that the regular changes in a progressive whirlwind storm, as
truly exhibited at any fixed station, should run through every
point of the compass; although this may sometimes happen
to a ship moving in the storm.
   Dr. Hare does not appear to perceive, that the several con
ditions above referred to are for the most part no more pre
dicable of the whirlwind storm than of the affluent theory of
storms which he advocates.
   Dr. Hare states (in the American Journal), that “the fact
that during the same storm different vessels variously situated
are found to have the wind in as many different directions,
may be explained by the afflux of winds from               quarters       all                    to
  common focal area,        well as                 by
                                         supposing them involved
                                               as
in a  great whirlwind.” This might

of   the winds from these centripetal directions being nearly
equal       ninety degrees,

 I    have formerly stated, that               “I
                                       have observed        the effects       in

                                the vortex        the surface  at   the
groundt.” But Dr. Hare thinks, “that the survey                 Bache                 of
and Espy shows that        would not
                                it                   be

            be

beg leave         assure Dr. Hare that

                                                 has greatly misappre

found    any  evidence       the  supposed

    In  my first essay, the prevalence           westerly winds      of the                            in

                        the  atmosphere     was  incidentally    and  par
tially ascribed        the deflection      the trade-winds of      moun                           by
tains. Dr. Hare alleges that this explanation harmonizes
with the theory          Halley. He adds, “In fact,
                            of                                  the water                    as

 be   an aerial accumulation and current corresponding with
that  of  the aqueous current above mentioned?”              This comes
nearer     tomy views             of
                              the course      circulation       of

                                   so
the trade-winds.        That the alleged accumulation             water                       of
the Gulf        of
              Mexico              by
                           the trade-winds         the main cause          is
the gulf-stream, Dr. Hare may perhaps show hereafter. The
contrary would appear                   to

which have    already  been obtained.
   Dr. Hare intimates that the trade-winds “cannot be ex
plained without the agency          temperature;”of       alleges also                 he
that  I“admit        no other cause of atmospheric currents be
                       of
sides that    gravitation;” and
                of                                     he
                                      inquires, “what other effect
could gravitation have,                in
                             the absence                             of
                                              calorific and electrical
reaction, unless that     producing

He also speaks        my treating momentum
                           of                        “the antagonist            as

                this    answer,-1. That,
                            I                      my apprehension,        to
the essential features            of
                           the trade-winds can         best explained            be

moving power.              ,   2. It is
                                  an error to say that                    I
                                                             admit no other
  cause of winds besides        gravitation,   if  by  this is meant that                          I
 reject the influence of heat, as is alleged in the American
 Journal. 3. I consider the influences of momentum, centri
 fugal force, and centripetal action, as being comprised in the
 laws of gravitation.         4. It is true that                      I
                                                          do not consider
 “electricity” as a general cause of atmospheric currents; for
 the reason, that so far as I know, this has never been shown.
 5. That the only effect of gravitation, without calorific or
 electrical reaction, would be to produce “a state of inert qui
 escence” in the atmosphere of a moving and rotative planet
 like our own, is to me inconceivable. 6. I have never con
 sidered nor asserted “momentum” to be “the antagonist of
 gravitation.” In the paragraph quoted by Dr. Hare,                      had             I
suggested, the courses of great storms as indicating the law of
circulation in our atmosphere, and which deemed to be founded    I
mainly on the laws of gravitation.             By some mistake, he has
given the phrase “causes of great storms” instead of courses;
and proceeding on this error, he calls it a summing up of the
“causes” of atmospheric currents; although he alleges that
I   here admit but one cause.
    It is next asked,            “If
                                the minuteness of the altitude of the
atmosphere, when compared with                        its

rarefaction,”         as   he
                         states     have
                                       I   alleged,  “wherefore,    for the
same reason, should not momentum,                   any other cause

358                     Mr.    Redfield's Reply to Dr. Hare,
  After a short comment on the functions of gravitation, Dr.
Hare next inquires, “But if neither gravity, nor calorific ex
pansion, nor electricity be the cause of winds, by what are
they produced?” I answer, 1. According to my apprehen
sion, the gravity which induces a nearly equal “distribution
of the atmosphere over the surface of the globe,” may and
does, in        modified influences, constitute the main basis of
                  its
winds and storms.             That calorific expansion
                                        2.                            “cause                      is is
of  winds,”       universally admitted; but that                    the chief                        a
                                                                                          be it
                    is

that    “if  this were true, evidently whirlpools,                 vortices                  or                    of

that “the      aquatic   gulf-stream,     resulting     from the impetus
of   the trade-winds, ought          produce      to  many vortices     as                                    in   its
course        the aërial currents derived from the same source;”
             as
        he adds, “there are few vortices                  whirlpools
                                                                             to or

to  run into “vortices” with the aérial              ones,   belongs        Dr.                              to
Hare, not                   the ocean, we can but partially observe

unobstructed             on

      with reference to the Whirlwind Theory of Storms.                                   359
the relative equality of motion in the parts generally main
tained,     Isee not how the unimpeded movements of this
 denser and nearly non-elastic fluid are to produce vortices
 equal in number or magnitude to those which occur in the
 inferior layers of an elastic aerial current, moving on or near
 the surface of the earth, over obstructions and inequalities,
and with other disturbing conditions almost innumerable. Of
 Dr. Hare's views of aqueous vortices it is unnecessary to speak;
                                           I
 but there are mariners, if remember their statements aright,
 who can give him an account of the frequency of ocean or
gulf-stream vortices, somewhat different from that which he
advances. Whenever a stream or current of water of moderate
depth moves over an unequal bottom, there is found no lack
of vortices, of various forms and dimensions, some of which
exhibit both upward and downward movements, often of some
considerable velocity.
    In the American Journal, Dr. Hare doubts if a whirlpool
ever takes place without a centripetal force resulting from a
vacuity.        I
              see not how this doubt can militate against my
views of vortical action; but I have myself seen many hun
dreds of such whirlpools or vortices, and have occasionally
watched their developments with much interest.
    After commenting on certain arbitrary conditions of                              “op
posing or unequal forces” in the atmosphere, Dr. Hare de
sires to be informed how “unequal or opposing forces are
generated in the atmosphere;” producing sometimes whirl
winds of unmeasured violence (19–20).            It may be readily
seen, that aerial currents of unequal temperature and velocity,
superimposed one upon another, and                        all
                                                moving over       sur               a
face of   unequal character and with frequent elevations, and
subject also         to

                                      adjacent currents, must often
move unequally and            unconformable directions; thus un

circuits,   ofvarious magnitudes and activity; some             which           of
may occasionally become extended and spin                      uprighton       an

   It is an error to allege that I have “admitted” a fact such
as is here stated. On the contrary, in careful explorations
made on foot, through an aggregate extent of more than fifty
miles of the tracks of various tornadoes, have never met with             I
such “a fact,” or combination of facts, as Dr. Hare describes.
In all the cases I have met with in which trees have fallen
one upon another, if their tops pointed in opposite or nearly
opposite directions, these directions have never been parallel
to the course pursued by the tornado, but always in directions
more or less transverse to the same; and I consider the op
posing allegation as one of the chief errors of my opponents.
   The trees which have fallen in directions which are more
or less backward from the course pursued by the tornado, are
almost invariably found on the left side of the track erterior
to the line of           its
                      aris.     But few                         of

364                  Mr. Redfield's Reply to Dr. Hare,
it should be observed, that the sketch of prostrations in the
orchard, which is included in fig. 3, is evidently on a more
reduced scale than that given in the plan of the building;
otherwise the buildings must be of size sufficient nearly to
have covered the orchard.            This change of scale may cause
some confusion unless particularly noticed.
   That the velocity and consequent force of the whirling
movement of the tornado is maintained by the direct pressure
of the surrounding atmosphere, rather than by the “suction.”
which has been alleged by Dr. Hare, I can readily conceive;
but that the “transient forces of a whirlwind” of this charac
ter are generally found to be “tangential” to                   axis, which

   Dr. Hare     appears        concede,     that my   survey       this tor          of
nado shows effects which accord with whirlwind action; but

   Dr. Hare thinks it singular, that should have declined          I
noticing the “insuperable difficulties” of the hypothesis of “a
central and non-whirling course in the wind of the tornado,”
to which I have alluded in bringing forward facts and induc
tions which seem to contravene this hypothesis.      He states,
also, that “the advocates of the disputed hypothesis are not
aware of any such difficulties,” and intimates the propriety
                                                                                                 º

He adds, “Now supposing the water                have risen        de  to                             by  a

as a known cause of storms. My cursory explanations of the
action of a whirlwind or tornado, even as shown up by Dr.
Hare, are, in my view, better suited to the observed facts of
the case than any which he or Mr. Espy has offered.
  I   do not solicit for my views even that “smallest import
ance” which is denied them in the mind of my critic; but the
attention with which he has treated them, on both sides the
Atlantic, does not appear to agree well with the disavowment.
 With the facts before him which are shown in my survey of
the tornado, and also with the numerous observations made
in great storms, which I have published, it is vain to pretend
that my views of their rotation are either “abortive,” or
                                   I
founded only in imagination. . am not conscious of having
“built” or indicated any “theory,” views, suggestions or
explanations of storms or whirlwinds which have not been
based on observations of my own and facts otherwise ascer
tained, sufficient in my view to warrant them, the “unequal
and opposing forces” even included; although I have not                 al
ways urged these facts upon the attention of my readers, ha
ving not unfrequently reserved them for more appropriate oc
casions.    Hence my alleged proofs have been chiefly confined
to the progressive course and rotative action developed in
storms, which last, strangely enough, has been so pertina
ciously denied by Mr. Espy, and now by Dr. Hare.
    My opponent next attempts to show, that “a deficit of
pressure about the axis” of a whirlwind “consequent to the
resulting centrifugal force, could only cause a descending
aérial current, while it could not tend in the slightest degree
to carry solids or liquids aloft.” (29–30.)          I
                                                    was also sur
prised to find this hypothetical downward current in the midst
of a whirlwind alleged as a necessary condition, on former oc
casions, by Mr. Espy.         Ifthe allegation be true, it must be
easy to show that the ascending currents in chimneys should
become inverted; for, so far as simple gravitation is concerned,
it can make little difference whether the rarefaction be me
chanical or calorific.
    But the ascending effects in the interior of a whirlwind have
 been too often witnessed by myself and others to require dis
 cussion.   Indeed, it would almost seem that the objectors had
been   precluded   from all opportunities for correct observation.
 There are numerous cases, however,        in   which the upward
 movement   of  the objects elevated cannot     beseen     the cen

 “matter” or “fluid mass” will not quicken as it approaches
 the centre, unless as resulting from a centripetal force “caused
 by suction at the axis.” (31–32, Amer. Journ. xlii. p. 146.)
    A constant centripetal force I have already recognised on
 this as well as former occasions.     But this by no means re
 quires or produces a direct centripetal course in the moving
 air which yields to       influence.   its

 Electricity is not wind, nor water, nor vapour, but an impon
 derable matter or effect, which is not known to exert any con
 stant mechanical force or action upon the efficient currents of
 the atmosphere. “Thunder and lightning, and convective
discharge,” are but momentary or transient exhibitions of
electricity, producing no visible effects upon these currents,
whatever may be their agency in restoring the disturbed equi

 has been done within the last few years on the theory of the

 subject, from the feeling that could add little to the impetus
 which research had acquired in the able hands of Professor
 Powell and others, and from the firmest reliance on their zeal
 and desire for the advancement, not of their own views, but
 of science itself. The appearance, however, of a new writer
 in the field, whilst                 I
                         hail it with real pleasure, compels me to
 take my part, if not in what is yet to be done, at least in
 keeping alive a due attention to what at present has been ef
 fected.    I confess, too, that I am further influenced to the
 present step, by the words with which your correspondent
 closes his paper: —“I believe also that the result of this se
 cond approximation may be made use of to prove that the
 hypothesis of finite intervals cannot be correct.”     I shall not,
 however, digress from my path to anticipate what may be
 the weight of the forthcoming objection to the hypothesis of
 finite intervals, but shall confine myself strictly to the follow
 ing points:—
    1. To state what is the precise hypothesis I have myself
admitted, and refer to the conclusions based on                                    it.

present purpose that              I direct
                                     attention simply to that form of
the hypothesis which       I gave   in my treatise on ‘The Theory
 of Heat.”      From the    difficulty   of accounting for the want of
 dispersion in a vacuum, I was led to attribute to the imme
 diate presence of the material particles, an influence on the
 velocity of transmission, exerted in a two-fold manner:—1. b
  their vibrations along with the particles of aether: 2. by the
 actions which they put in play, or rather (which is really the
 same thing) exclude, through the particles of aether which
 they displace (Arts. 161, 162).
       f the two hypotheses now mentioned, the former leads to
 a very satisfactory explanation of the phaenomena of disper
 sion, provided the difficulty which is alluded to can be got
 over. That this can be done, M. Cauchy endeavours to show
 by calculations based on a certain assumed law of force. But,
 even if it cannot, the latter hypothesis, which arises out of the
 former, leads very simply to the desired conclusion, inasmuch
 as it introduces into our equations of motion a term depending
 on the action of the aether which would occupy the place of
 a material particle, in addition to other terms similar to those
 which apply to a vacuum. It happens that the form of the
 result deduced from the second hypothesis differs in no ma
 terial respect from that which arises out of the first (Theory
 of Heat, p. 154).
     2. We shall be able to ascertain the exact nature of Mr.
 O'Brien's hypothesis, as well by an examination of the equa
 tions which result from the supposition that the particles of
 matter are absolutely fixed, as from the more general equa
 tions.    We are desirous, indeed, of avoiding                incidental      all
 remarks relative      to
                       the correctness        the equations

 376         Prof. Kelland on the explanation of Dispersion.
 Cauchy's Erercices, for by turning to the following page we
 find that equations (26.) (which give the values of the con
 stants) render equations (23.) in Mr. O'Brien's notation the
 following:—
           d” a                        dº a                                d” a          d?    &

                           * Tris).
 Thus the difference between the medium and a common
 elastic medium is only this, that the particles of aether are at
 tracted by the particles of matter. Now the same hypothesis pre
 cisely is made by myself in my memoir “On the Motion of a
 System of Particles," p. 244. But as I have adopted the law of
 force varying inversely as the square of the distance, the quan
 tity C vanishes. The effect of such a term, however, I felt clearly
                                                     ...
 to be needed, and accordingly, I restored it in my “Theory of
 Heat’, p. 153, by the consideration stated above. The equa
 tion which is there obtained is nearly the same as one of Mr.
 O’Brien's equations, and the                from it appears to
 me the very same, in form at least, as his.     The expression
 which I obtained for the square of the velocity of transmission
 is this:—

 der.   The first            is,
                       that the velocity   propagation       geof                             is     in
 neral different for transversal and for direct vibrations. Here
I  cannot help observing that       much        desired that
                                                 it   is                  to   be                         an

LVI.        On the Velocity            of    Propagation of Radiant Heat.                           By
                               Baron        J.von WREDE*.
This  investigation    founded on the principle, that if the
                                       is
  heat and light in the solar rays move with different velo
cities, they must show an unequal aberration; and conse
quently the luminous and thermal images of the sun in a tele
scope cannot overlap each other completely, but must be se
parated in a direction parallel to the ecliptic. Hence the tem
peratures of the eastern and western edges of the sun's                                             lu
minous image (i.e., of the disc we view) cannot be equal. In
order to discover this difference, the author attached the fol
lowing apparatus to the eye-end of a 10-foot telescope mounted
parallactically, and which apparatus he laid before the phy
sical section.                          -
      Toone end of a brass tube inserted in the telescope he at
tached a four-sided brass box in such a manner, that its cen
tral line could, by means of a graduated circle, be placed at a
certain measurable inclination to the plane of the declination
circle passing through the optical axis of the telescope. In
this box he placed a small thermopile (thermokette) composed
of bismuth and antimony bars, their points of verticality
(läthstellen) being in one straight line, and in such a manner that

380          Baron Wrede on the Velocity of Radiant Heat.
then the pile was placed to the east of the telescopic axis, and
the intersecting point of the two threads was brought over the
western edge of the sun's disc. It follows from above, that
in this position the eastern edge of the disc was a tangent to
the line passing through the points of verticality of the pile.
   In this position was the apparatus allowed to remain unin
terruptedly for five minutes by the aid of a screw attached to
the parallactic stand. The position of the galvanometer at
tached to the pile was next observed, and noted for every
semi-oscillation *. The average of these thirty galvanometri
cal determinations gave, therefore, a measure of the tempera
 ture at the eastern edge of the sun's disc. The box was then
 turned round 180°, and the experiment continued in the same
 manner, only that now the eastern edge fell on the crossing
 threads, and the western edge touched the pile.
    This experiment was repeated several times, the pile being
after every time approximated one screw-length nearer to the
vertical thread by turning the micrometer-screw once com
 pletely round.     Hence each pair of such observations could
 independently of the others decide the question, whether heat
 and light possess an equal or a different velocity of propaga
tion, and which of these is the greater.
    To obtain a quantitative, measure of the difference of the
 two velocities, it was necessary to compare             all
                                                    the observations
together.     By expressing through interpolation the tempera

the sun's disc was higher than that at the western edge. The
regularity in the quantitative determinations by this one set
made it extremely improbable that the observed difference of
temperatures at the eastern and western edges were owing to
errors of observation.    By the other set (which consisted like
wise of six pairs of observations, and whereat the telescope was
reversed in order to eliminate that cause of error), the results
were without exception in favour of the higher temperature
of the eastern edge, although the quantitative determination
did not exactly observe the same regularity that the first set
did. But this regularity was not to be expected, partly owing
to the sky being not free from small clouds, and partly by a
stronger breeze causing sometimes an agitation of the ap
paratus.    Although hitherto the requisite number of observa
 tions has not been made in order to solve the problem com
pletely, yet the author thinks it extremely probable, from the
 already made experiments, that heat has a greater aberration,
 and consequently a less velocity than light.
    The average result of these two sets gives the displacement
 of the thermal image of the sun from the luminous disc equal
 to 0-28 turns of the screw.       As each of these = 1-1 19th

  perty     being decomposed by
          of                        metals.  When sulphuret
of cacodyl is heated in contact with mercury in a large vessel
to 200° or 300°C., the mercury becomes covered with a stra
tum of sulphuret of mercury, without any apparent disen
gagement of gas.    The fluid which condenses in the vessel
gives off fumes and takes fire of itself in air, if the heat has
been continued long enough, and the temperature sufficiently
high.   This process             is,
                        however, not available for the exhibi

As zinc, however,               effects the reduction                 of the chloride with
the greatest facility, and as no further decomposition takes
place in the chloride of zinc forined,                            I
                                                  have in my experi
ments     exclusively   used this metal for the isolation of the
radical.
    Notwithstanding that the reduction appears so easy, still,
as it is very difficult to prevent subsequent decomposition in
repeating the distillation and crystallisation of a substance
which is as inflammable as the vapour of phosphorus, I think
it necessary to enter into further details regarding the method
of producing        it.

blowpipe. It is exposed to the tem-
perature of 100° C. for three hours,
in a water-bath. The zinc is readily
§
dissolved without any evolution of
   s, and the solution becomes of a
        colour. On cooling to 50° C.
large cubic crystals are formed,                                        b
which are redissolved           by  heating.
These crystals are probably a com
bination of chloride of zinc and chlo
ride of cacodyl.         When the zinc
is no   longer   acted   upon   at 103°C., the contents of the bulbs
appear converted into a dry mass of salts, which, upon an in
crease of temperature to 110° or 120°C., melts into an

   The trifling difference  between the quantities found and the
calculated quantities, arises probably from the impossibility                                                      of
obtaining this compound free from oxygen.             the results                         If

relative condensation which the compounds of this radical
present, exactly agree with those of inorganic or simple                                                                   ra
dicals. This circumstance has given a weight to the theory
of the compound radicals which the law of substitution could
not reach. But this, in connexion with the phaenomena of
substitutions, does not advance the idea of organic radicals be
yond the limits of a hypothesis.   The proof of their reality is
connected with three other   conditions, viz. on their isolation,
on the direct formation of their compounds, and on the actual
agreement of the density of their simple elements with their
theoretical density. All these conditions are fulfilled in regard
to cacodyl: it may be isolated, it enters into direct combina
tions, and it has the density required if the laws of condensa
tion of the inorganic elements are valid for organic bodies, as
may be observed by the following statement:-

                                                         Radical.
    The relative condensation   the gaseous compounds           of                                                          of
cacodyl and the transformations which they undergo, give
a great degree    probability    the theory
                                   of         organic ra            to                               of

                              of the Cacodyl            Series.                    387
dicals, which is now rendered perfectly incontrovertible by
the power of this radical to form directly the compounds
from which it was separated.            The whole series of com
pounds already considered can be formed either in the                              di
rect or in the indirect way, and the conditions under which
this happens are precisely those observed with regard to the
metals. The indirect action of oxygen, as well as the action of
most of the oxidizing agents, occasions an increase of tempe
rature in the formation of both the oxide and the acid of this
radical; and from the first, by the action of hydracids, we
obtain the corresponding combinations with sulphur, selenium,
tellurium, chlorine, iodine, bromine, and cyanogen. By the
treatment of the so-formed chloride with chloride of copper,
chloride of platinum, chloride of palladium, &c., certain dou
ble chlorides are formed, which I intend to refer to hereafter.
When the radical is dissolved in nitric acid, and nitrate of
silver is added, a very considerable precipitate is produced in
the form of regular octahedral crystals, consisting of a combi
nation of the latter salt with oxide of cacodyl, which appears
to act the same part as constitutional water in salts. A solu
tion of corrosive sublimate occasions the immediate formation
of an oxychloride in the form of fine silky crystals, composed
of 1 atom of oxide of cacodyl combined with 2 atoms of chlo
ride of mercury.
    Oxidizing agents are not the only bodies which act in a
direct manner; other combinations are also formed in the
same way. Sulphur in small quantities is acted upon by the
radical, being dissolved by          of it,
                                   and forms        clear solution pos
sessing  all      properties      sulphuret        cacodyl,   of a

metals, and sulphuretted hydrogen with acids. Upon the ad

formed, which       solid, and soluble
                     is                    aether; from which latter

                                                  acids, gives hydro

333                  Professor Bunsen on the Radical
nature   of this decomposition, pure chloride of cacodyl    was
digested with zinc in a distillation tube, until the whole solu
tion was converted into a white mass of salt; the heat was
then increased by means of an oil-bath to 200° C.; a perfectly
clear fluid distilled over. When at this temperature nothing
further passed over, the heat was increased to 220° C. and
then to 260°C.        It appeared to me dangerous to attempt
any further decomposition by increasing the temperature; the
attempt was therefore given up at this point.
    After the apparatus was cool and the receiver taken off,
there was no perceptible smell of any gaseous product.          The
substance which distilled over was again sucked up into a fresh
distillation tube containing zinc, and by means of a continued
digestion the last traces of chlorine were separated. The di
stillation was effected by means of an oil-bath.      When at the
temperature of 100° C. nothing more came over, the receiver
                                                        all 1.)

mentioned, and again sucked         into        to up

         Carbonic acid formed . . . 2.0           2-0      2-0
These trials exactly agree with a compound in which the
combination with the carburetted hydrogen in the cacodyl
gives                4 volumes of vapour of carbon,
                   12 volumes of hydrogen,
condensed into 6 volumes.
    I was at first induced to suppose that a similar decomposi
tion of cacodyl took place as in the case of cyanide of mer
cury, as the action of this gas with chlorine did not agree with
the action of any of the compounds from which this mixture
of gases could in any manner arise; but the uncommon con
densation, the essential circumstance in this case, appeared
little to support this view.      I have therefore continued the
examination, and found that the burning with chlorine arises
from the presence of a small quantity of a volatilizable com
pound of arsenic, which does not separate from the mixture,
and which is at the same time the cause of the small stain of
arsenic, which, on burning this gas in oxygen, remains on the
side of the eudiometer.        The true nature of this gas, given
                                         º
out   by heat from    cacodyl, is shown by the action of fuming
sulphuric acid. This absorbs nearly one-third, and leaves
behind an inodorous gas, burning              blue, which is not   al
tered by chlorine in the dark: in the direct rays of the sun,
however, as Melsens has shown of the gas of the acetates and
of marshes, it is condensed into oily camphor-like odorous
bodies, in the state of small white radiating crystals. From a
eudiometrical analysis of this gas, it appeared to be pure
marsh gas. I found
             From the volume examined . . . 19-2

             Carbonic acid formed     . . . . . . . 21.8
    There can, therefore, be no doubt that the carburetted hy
drogen, C. He, formed on the decomposition of cacodyl at a
high temperature, is not separated as such, but that there are
formed under these circumstances, two volumes of marsh gas
and one volume of olefiant gas, viz.

The examination of the gas not absorbed by the sulphuric
acid confirms this view of the question; as one volume and a

                              of the Cacodyl              Series.                           391
half of the pure     gaseous mixture, which contains one volume
of   olefiant gas, and two volumes                    (CH,)        of marsh gas, must,
in   fact, upon burning with three and a                       half volumes of oxygen,
  produce two volumes of carbonic acid.
     Whilst the absence of arsenietted hydrogen and free hy
  drogen decidedly proves that the first is not to be considered
 as a constituent element of cacodyl; the conclusion may be
 drawn, at the same time, from these appearances of decom
 position, that if the radical C. He can exist independently, it
 is most unstable and is decomposed much below a red heat.
     Among the products of the decomposition of cacodyl, there
 is one substance which I have mentioned several times, and
 to which I have given the arbitrary name of erytrarsin. I shall
 now consider this substance, as it is in close connexion with
 the foregoing substances.      I have not hitherto succeeded in
 obtaining any quantity of this remarkable substance.           It is
 formed as a secondary product in the formation of chloride of
 cacodyl, sometimes in a great and sometimes in a small quan
 tity. It is also deposited upon the distillation of oxide of ca
 codyl with water. Upon conducting the vapour of cacodyl,
 or oxide of cacodyl, through tubes slightly heated, this sub
           [.
 stance is produced in large quantities by an imperfect com
 bustion;         obtained in this manner, it is always contami
nated with arsenic, from which it is impossible to separate                                 it.
 The substance next made use              preparing
                                                of

                                      the retort.   The precipitate
became during the distillation                   of
                                           thick consistence, which

The rational constitution of this compound                                         can only be       con
jectured.  As cacodyl in combination with oxygen undergoes
 the same decomposition at a higher temperature as in an un
 combined state, it follows that erytrarsin may be considered as
 the oxide of a ternary radical, which can be distinguished
 from cacodyl only by                        its
                               containing three times      much                                as

          attended with great danger and many difficulties.

oxidized chromic  acid, or the oxide of chromium formed, com
bines with the sulphuric acid and potash immediately as it is
produced, no injurious effect can arise from diffusion between

LIX.    On a new Class of Cacodyl Compounds containing Pla
          tinum.     By Professor BUNSEN of Marburg+.
     a former paper I have endeavoured to prove, from the
IN  numerous instances of substitution presented by alcarsin,
that this substance contains a ternary radical, composed of
arsenic united to a carbo-hydrogen (C, HG + As,), and en
tering into composition with elementary bodies like a metal,
in a manner not hitherto observed. This opinion has been
confirmed by my subsequent experiments, and may be consi
dered of considerable importance in the question of compound
radicals.    The chloride of this radical is reduced by those
metals which decompose water, at a temperature not exceed
ing that of boiling water; the free radical separating in the
form of a clear aethereal fluid, which oxidates in the air with
more rapidity than potassium, and produces two degrees of
oxidation by     itscombustion, namely,                      oxide,  an
                                                 byan

both   of which can         be
                           again  reduced     deoxidizing   agents.
The analogy between cacodyl and the metals extends still
further; for that radical unites directly with the non-metallic
elements, forming substances                of             are pro
                                                                   of as

   By mixing an alcoholic solution of chloride of platinum
with a similar solution of chloride of cacodyl, a precipitate of
 a reddish-brown colour is obtained, which, when washed with
 alcohol and reduced to powder, becomes yellowish-red, and
 is inodorous. When this powder is heated, it melts into a clear
 yellow gummy mass, gives off hydrochloric acid and vapours
 smelling of chloride of cacodyl, and leaves behind a gray-co
 loured arseniuret of platinum.             Both the chlorides of pla

    The   elementary    analysis  of the chloride of   cacoplatyl,  dried
at 110°C., was made by means of oxide of copper in a com
bustion tube, the free space left in the tube being filled with
turnings of copper*.        In a second analysis, chromate of lead
was   used;   the results were the same:—

The chlorine     was estimated by heating the compound to             red
ness with caustic lime.         1-0873 gramme of substance gave
O-580 chloride of      silver,  or 0.0225 silver; by direct precipi
tation from the solution by nitrate of silver, from 0.987 of sub
stance only 0°353 chloride of silver, or 0 1405 silver was ob
tained. The estimation of the platinum and arsenic is attended
with some difficulty, from the circumstance that chloride of
cacoplatyl is not perfectly oxidized by nitric acid. 0.850
gramme was therefore heated in a combustion tube, with a
mixture of 1 part of carbonate of soda and 3 parts of chlorate
of potash.        he contents of the tube, after digestion with
water, left a quantity of arseniuret of platinum.              The solu
tion, which was coloured yellow by a little of the double chlo
ride of platinum and potassium, was thrown on a filter, and
the arsenic containing platinum again collected. This last
was dissolved in aqua regia, and some silicic acid derived from
the combustion tube separated.            The fluid, freed from silicic
F.
acid, and evaporated to dryness, was again dissolved in weak
alcohol, and gave 0-752 gramme chloride of platinum and
                Besides this, 0-018 platinum was obtained by
   eating a quantity of sulphuret, formed by transmitting through
the solution a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen.                The fluid,
when filtered, was made use of for obtaining the quantity of
arsenic; it was freed from alcohol by boiling, deoxidized by
sulphurous acid, and precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen.
 It gave 0.458 of sulphuret of arsenic, from which, by oxidation
           É.
with nitric acid, 1-254 of sulphate of barytes was obtained.
    * This            is necessary, lest some chloride of copper be carried
into the chloride of calcium tube with the watery vapour; when metallic
copper is present, a basic chloride of copper is formed, which is not
volatile.

 The agreement between the carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine
 found, and the numbers obtained by calculation, proves with
 out doubt that the following empirical formula, C, H, As, Pt
 Cl O, is correct. It appears certain that this compound con
 tains an atom of water, not as water of crystallization, but in
 another form, for the compound may be heated to 164° C.
 without decomposition.        At that temperature the colour is
 changed to a citron yellow, and an atom of water is given off,
 which however is reacquired when the substance is boiled with
 water. 0.9767 loses, by 210°C., 0.037, and no more, although
 the temperature is raised to 240° C.          The compound con
 tains therefore 3.79    per cent. of water,  which corresponds to
 1 atom,  and can be    replaced   by 1 atom of ammonia.
                      Bromide     of Cacoplatyl.
    This compound is formed when a hot solution of the chlo
 ride of cacoplatyl is mixed with bromide of potassium; the
 crystals obtained are redissolved and recrystallized twice.       |
 They possess great similarity to the chlorine combination,
and form small yellow needles by the quick cooling of the
aqueous solution; but when the solution is allowed to cool
gradually, the crystals formed are large, well-shaped, and co
lourless.   They are pretty soluble in hot, but only sparingly
soluble in cold water. They have a feeble acid reaction, are
inodorous, but possess a decidedly disagreeable arsenical
taste, which is bitter and astringent, and remains long on the
palate, suggesting alcarsin. At 120° C. they lose their water
and become yellow.        At 240° C. this compound begins to be
decomposed, becoming gray at that temperature; and when
the heat is increased to 246° C. it melts into a black foetid
mass.    At a higher temperature it takes fire in the air, and
burns like tinder, leaving the arseniuret of platinum in shining
scales.   The analysis of this compound is equally simple with
that of the preceding chlorine compound, and is made by
combustion with oxide of copper; the anterior part of the
tube being filled with copper turnings.

                                   Iodide       of Cacoplatyl.
  The yellow precipitate which iodide of potassium forms
with chloride of cacoplatyl is this iodide. By mixing the two
solutions, boiling hot and tolerably dilute, the iodide separates
in the form of glistening scales of a silky lustre, resembling
the iodide of lead.      It possesses nearly the same degree of
solubility in water as the last-named substance.
   The iodide differs from the other compounds of cacoplatyl

   To prepare   this compound, a solution of 20 parts of the chlo
ride of cacoplatyl,   dried at 100° C., is boiled with 12:17 parts
of dried sulphate of silver till the solution is not rendered tur
bid by salts of silver or chlorine.     The filtered fluid is evapo
rated in vacuo over     sulphuric  acid till crystallization begins.
At this degree of concentration a trace of the chloride of sil
ver, which had remained dissolved, is precipitated. The chlo
ride of silver is separated by filtration, and the solution again
evaporated in vacuo and over sulphuric acid, till the greater
part of the salt is deposited. The salt is purified by pressing
it between folds of bibulous paper. Thus prepared it has the
form of white hard crystalline grains, which appear, under the
microscope, to be prismatic.         This salt is inodorous, but
possesses a bitter and astringent taste, which after a time sug
gests a relation to the cacodyl compounds.         It does not deli
quesce, nor is it decomposed by contact with air.           It may be
heated to 160° C. without       injury;  a few   degrees   higher                       its
colour becomes gray, then black, giving off vapours smelling
of  cacodyl, and, lastly,     takes fire and burns like amadou,

and this water can be replaced by oxides of metals.      we                                       If
remove this atom of water in the formula, we have remaining
one atom of oxide of platinum, and one atom of cacodyl,
which will explain the formation of these compounds in the
simplest manner.    The rational expressions may be thus
given:-
 For the anhydrous chlorine compound         Pt O Ka + Cl
 For the hydrous      - - -      - - -   H O Pt O Ka + Cl
 For that containing ammonia . . . . . N.H., Pt O Ka + Cl
 For the oxide . . . . . . . . . . . . . HO Pt O Ka + O
 For the sulphate . . . . . . . . . . (HOPtC Ka-FO) SOs
  The nature of this composition proves that the power of
inorganic acids to unite with certain organic bodies, without
losing their power of saturation, is not alone possessed by
acids, but that bases have also the same property; for in the
present case, the oxide of platinum bears a relation to the
oxide of cacodyl similar to that which sulphuric acid does to
benzoic acid in sulpho-benzoic acid.      In the latter, the ben
zoic acid is as little indicated by reagents as the oxide of pla
tinum in the cacoplatyl; and as the double acid referred
to neutralizes only one atom of base, so the double base in
question saturates only one atom of acid, or that quantity
which the quantity of oxygen in the oxide of platinum indi

     Acomparison of this new class of compounds with that
discovered by Gros and Reiset, will afford another reason for
admitting the constitution which has been assigned to them.
Reiset has rendered certain the existence of a body, composed
of the elements of 1 atom water, 2 atoms ammonia, and 1 atom
oxide of platinum, which does not lose      atom    water when     its            of
it enters into combination with    oxygen  acids, and contains,

it for some considerable time to the

The diluted sulphuric acid employed
has a specific gravity of 1231; and
                                                                     r
this may be obtained by mixing 1
measure of the concentrated acid with
4 measures of water: I find these
proportions better than any others
for obtaining a speedy and liberal supply of hydrogen gas.
    It is generally considered that the zinc of commerce con
tains arsenic; I may here observe, however, that                  have ex          I
amined many specimens both of English and foreign zinc du
ring the last two or three years, and when the sulphuric acid
employed was free from arsenic I could never get any indica
tions of that metal by means of the apparatus just described.
It will be presently seen how minute a quantity can be de
tected when really present in zinc.
    The first set of experiments was made on alloys of zinc
and arsenic.
    200 grs. of zinc were placed in the hydrogen apparatus. I
may just state that             all

very large and abundant arsenical stains were obtained.                                          In
this experiment, therefore, rather less than one part              arsenic         of
was   alloyed   with 200    parts    zinc.     of
    200 grs.       of of
                  zinc were melted         new crucible and quarter

alloy was cast, broken up, and placed            the apparatus  in     be                   as
fore: abundant arsenical stains were obtained             porcelain.      on
   In  this experiment there was rather less than one part                                       of
arsenic       800 parts
              to                 of
                             zinc.
   400   grs,      of
                 zinc were melted and         grain      arsenic stirred
                                                            4             of

in;   scarcely any  of the latter was lost by volatilization. This
alloy was cast and divided into eight parts equal by weight.
Three of these parts gave abundant arsenical stains in the hy
drogen apparatus: here the proportions are one and a half
part of arsenic to 1500 parts of zinc.
    Two parts out of the eight were    fused with 400 grains more
zinc, cast and divided into five equal parts by weight; two
out of the five parts were placed in the hydrogen apparatus;
very faint but characteristic arsenical stains were obtained;
here the proportion of arsenic to zinc was four parts of the
former to 20,000 of the latter, or one part to 5000. This ap
peared to be the minimum quantity capable of being detected
in the apparatus.
  . The next experiments were for the purpose of ascertaining
the minimum quantity of arsenious acid which could be de
tected in the apparatus.      The zinc employed was from a dif
ferent   sample  to that used in the first set, and was previously
well tested and found incapable of affording any stains.
    2.24 grs. of recently sublimed arsenious acid were dissolved
in sixty measures of water; the quantity of metallic arsenic  -
 = 1.69 gr.
    Half a measure of the solution, when placed in the hydro
gen apparatus with zinc and sulphuric acid, gave several
strongly marked arsenical stains; the quantity of metal was
therefore = 01407.
    One-third of a measure of the solution gave several faint
but characteristic arsenical stains; the metal = -00988.
    One-sixth of a measure of the solution gave only two or
three very faint stains; the metal = -00469. This was the
minimum quantity.
    The next experiments were made upon alloys of antimony
and zinc.
    200 grs. of zinc were-fused and 1 grain of antimony stirred
into the fused mass; the alloy when cold was introduced into
the hydrogen apparatus, together with diluted sulphuric acid;
large and abundant antimonial stains were obtained.
    200 grs. of zinc were fused and 2 gr. of antimony stirred
into the fused mass; the alloy when cold was placed in the
apparatus; abundant antimonial stains were obtained: the pro
portion in this case of antimony to zinc was as 1 to 1000.
    400 grs. of zinc were fused and 4 grain of antimony stirred
in ; the alloy was divided into eight parts; one of these parts
 was again fused with 200 grains of zinc, and the alloy thus ob
 tained was placed in the apparatus; abundant and character
 istic antimonial stains were obtained: the proportion of an
 timony to zinc in this case was as 1 to 5000.

406              Dr. Brett      on detecting minute quantities
  One out of the eight parts just referred to was fused with
500 grs. of zinc, and 150 grs. of this alloy were placed in the
apparatus; several distinct antimonial stains were obtained:
the proportion of antimony to zinc in this case was as 1 to
11,000.
   One out of the eight parts was fused with 600 grs. of zinc;
150 grs. of the alloy, yielded in the apparatus a very few
small but sufficiently characteristic antimonial stains: the pro
portion of antimony to zinc in this case was as 1 to 13,000.
This appeared to be the minimum quantity which could be
satisfactorily detected in an alloy of zinc and antimony.       I
then proceeded to ascertain the minimum quantity of anti
mony which could be detected by these means; in the form
of sesquioxide of antimony well crystallized tartar emetic
was used.
   5.24 grs. of transparent well crystallized tartar emetic equal
to 2:23 grs. of sesquioxide of antimony = 1.88 metallic anti
mony, were dissolved in 60 measures of water.
   Half a measure placed in the hydrogen apparatus gave
very distinct antimonial stains; the quantity of metal in this
case was   = -0156 gr.
     One-third of a measure under similar circumstances gave
distinct stains, small in size, and approximating in appear
ance arsenical stains: the quantity of metal in this case was
 = 01044 gr.
    One-sixth of a measure under analogous circumstances
gave stains very small, and two or three only in number: the
quantity of metal in this case was = -0.0522 gr.         This ap
peared to be the minimum quantity capable of being detected
by such means. . .                                  -
    The colour of the flame when    antimony  is present  in quan
tity sufficient to produce large and dark stains does not differ
materially from that observed when arsenic is present, both
possessing a bluish tint, more distinct, however, in the case of
arsenic; very small quantities of arsenic render the flame blue,
but when the quantities of antimony approach the minimum
the blue colour is not observable.               ºhe
                                           mere hydrogen flame

phaenomena may             be
                        noticed when antimony         present, but

made manifest upon white porcelain until the lapse           some  of

so as not to allow one prematurely to assert the absence of
the metallic bodies. It is also of importance to be aware that
 the deposition of metallic stains, both in the case of antimony
 and arsenic, may go on for a considerable time; I have col
 lected such stains on clean white porcelain for a quarter of an
 hour or twenty minutes, even when the quantities of metal or
 its  oxide present have been small. This form                    apparatus             of

 that the French historical writers had grossly misinterpreted
 Fernel's account               of

 made     itappear from his own words that                 those historians      if

        Prof. De Morgan on Fernel's Measure of a Degree.                                                        409
Fernel himself, published at Paris in 1526, two years before
the Cosmotheoria : it is likely enough that he corrected the
proofs of the former about the time when he made the measure
of a degree which is described in the latter. In this Monalo
sphaerium (leaf 25, page 2) I found Fernel's own geometrical
Joot,  marked on a line extending down the page, divided into
four palms, one of which is divided into four digits, one of
which is divided into four grains.         Fernel's words on it are,
“Caeterum virga quaedam mensoria omni molimine nobis de
ligenda est,” mensurarum diversitate locupletatáž.                “Hac
quippe duce faciliore negotio in omnes provehemur opera
tiones; magnoque usui futura, si quintupedalem quantitatem
toti concesseris.” The title of the line is Figuratio pedis geo
metrici. Fernel's geometrical foot is then the line thus figured
plus an allowance for the shrinking of the paper.
    Before       I
              give the measure,                           I
                                      point out what it ought to be
nearly, from Fernel’s own description of his step. The ave
rage step of a man is 30 English inches, or very near to                                                             it:
Fernel says that five                   of
                            his paces make six geometrical paces.
At 60 inches         pace,

whence the geometrical pace should                    inches, and the    be       50

                                                                                                to

give him an inch and a half more, he should have been as
signed an inch and a half less.
                                          I
    There is somewhere in Paucton, but have not any note of
the place, a surmise that the geometrical pace was about 4}
 Roman feet. This surmise seems to have arisen out of the
difficulty he found in otherwise reconciling the metrological
statements of the middle ages.       A pace of 4; feet (Roman)
would have been 52 inches        English, answering to Fernel's
geometrical pace.
    It is not necessary for me now to give the results of the
                          I
further inquiry which made into the writings of the metrolo
gists and cosmographers of the sixteenth century:    I will merely
mention two things which struck me.            George Agricola,
whose work on weights and measures was several times pub
lished in the first half of the century in question, uses words
which seem to imply that measures absolutely derived from
the human body were in use in commerce, though his ex
pressions are not conclusive: he is followed by several others.
Antonius Nebrissensis, whose work on Cosmography was pub
lished at Paris in 1533, asserts that his own foot and his own
pace (he being, as he says, a man of moderate size) were the
measures actually used by geographers, and coincided with
the Roman measures. He mentions two places in Spain, the
distance of which was known in Roman miles from the Ro
man itineraries, between which he had paced to ascertain this
point.     So that Fernel seems to have used a less measure than
even the geographers of his time; and the difference can
not be easily explained unless the supposition of Paucton be
adopted.      It is hardly to be thought that Fernel laid down
an arbitrary measure for himself.      His own words, that the
standard was to be selected “omni molimine,” imply the con
trary, for molimen means difficult endeavour. Neither, had the
measure been one of his own invention, would he have failed
to repeat the configuration in his Cosmotheoria. That he omitted
to do so was his “luck,” and the misfortune of Picard, Cas
sini, Montucla, Lalande, and Delambre, all of whom, as Mr.
Galloway truly states, took it for granted that he used the
Paris foot of his time; to which add, without, as far as ap
                                    I
pears, thinking it necessary to make a single inquiry about
the usages of that time.
   The imagined good fortune of Fernel has acted unfavour
ably upon opinion as to the measure of Norwood, which comes
also very near the truth, and was performed in a manner which
shows, that, like more modern observers, he laid himself out
for luck, by taking care to give every error equal chances of
being positive and negative. With such a measure as that

               Determination     of the Orbits of Comets.       411
of Fernel,    and a supposed result so near the truth, it was not
difficult to attribute to hazard the success of another operation
of a somewhat similar kind. But those who attend to the
subject, and whom I am able to convince that Fernel's result
was on the wrong side of 54 miles, instead of the right side of
69, will perhaps take another look at the mode pursued by
Norwood, in which case         I  am inclined to think they will be
able to  satisfy  themselves,    that instead of rowing in the same
boat as   Fernel,  with luck for the steersman, he is well entitled
to have his conclusion considered as the result of such skill
and patience as could not have led to any other.

LXII.     Inquiry respecting a correction requisite in the working
    of Dr.   Olbers's method     of determining   the Elements of the
    Orbits  of Comets.      By R. TEMPLETON, Esq.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical       Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
      AVING       read over with much interest the method of
       determining the elements of the orbits of comets by Dr.
 Olbers in the last volume of your Magazine for 1835,           Ise
lected from Lieut. Stratford's Ephemeris of Halley's three posi
 tions, intending to familiarize myself with the practical work
ing of the method, but a difficulty met me at the onset. It will
be remembered that this comet was detected early in August,
 when its distance was about twice the radius of the earth's
 orbit; observations were afterwards made when it was only
 one-eighth of this quantity, and again when it had nearly ac
 quired the same amount.            Now in combining these obser
 vations, the omission of an allowance for the time elapsed
 since the comet had actually the positions observed, would        in
 troduce an error of a quarter of a minute in right ascension,
 and of half this in declination, which, however small or mo
 dified by errors of observation, ought not to be neglected; I
 wish in consequence to be informed by some of your Cor
 respondents through the medium of your valuable Journal,
 whether it has been usual to apply a correction —8"125
 to the time of observation after the first approximation admits
 of tolerably accurate values of the curtate distances being ob
 tained.

   The albumen derived from various morbid secretions was
also analysed by the same methods; from the fluid of hy
drocele and of ordinary ascites; from pus (the ashes of which
contained a little iron); from a congestive abscess. The ana
lytical results per cent. were identical with those for normal
albumen already given.

   As the compounds of protein do not admit of our deducing
any positive rational formula for protein, Liebig proposes the
empirical formula Cas Hog Ng Ola, which gives a per cent.
composition coinciding with the results of the above analyses.
   Having thus determined the composition of the funda
mental materials of the animal organization, Dr. Scherer
proceeds to examine the secondary tissues.      These are merely
to be considered as   products of animal  life,  and are not met
with in vegetable structures, whereas the former class exist
equally in both departments of organized nature. The sub
stances to be analysed were obtained in the condition of
greatest anatomical purity, and carefully freed from        inter     all
mixed fat, &c.      by
                   such chemical means        were least likely

alter their own texture. Although such textures are not ana
tomically homogeneous, but under the microscope still show

traces of the presence of nerves and blood-vessels, yet these
could not be supposed to modify their composition in any
important degree, as their quantity is excessively minute, and
their composition not very different from that of the tissue
under examination.

                                                                    G.S.
                           PHYSICAL GEOLOGY.
IT     is not long since, in the Transactions of the Cambridge Phi
     losophical Society (Vol. IV., 1838), we rejoiced to see a mathe
matician of such high authority as Mr. Hopkins, in a paper en
titled “Researches in Physical Geology,” adopting this term as one
of acknowledged and deserved acceptance in our momenclature, and
to find him asserting, “that we are now arrived at that stage of
geological science, in which we are able to recognize certain well
defined geological phaenomena distinctly approximating to geometri
cal laws,” and following up this assertion by the first example of a geo
logical investigation conducted on principles supplied by mathematical
analysis. The apparent irregularities which the disturbances of the
globe seem at first sight to present, being thus reduced under the do
minion of mathematical calculation, we hail in this paper the com
mencement of a series of physical deductions, explanatory of the law
of parallelism, which is so constantly observed in the case of mineral
veins, faults, and anticlinal lines; and referring this law to a mecha
nical cause, demonstrable by the test of exact geometrical proof.
    We have recently witnessed another investigation of this high
order, respecting the necessary relations between observed phaeno
mena and the physical cause to which they owe their origin, in a
communication to our Society by Mr. Hopkins “On the parallel lines
of simultaneous elevation in the Weald of Kent and Sussex*."             In
this highly philosophical paper, he shows that these lines exactly
correspond with the deductions of mathematical theory, resulting
from the hypothesis of the elevation having been caused by an ex
pansive force acting from below upon stratified rocks, within the
nearly elliptic area of the Wealden formation, in the S.E. of England,
and the Bas Boulonnais.
    Prepared with the geometrical results of theory as an antecedent
basis of his observations, and introducing this new and most efficient
auxiliary as a fundamental element in the machinery of Descriptive
Geology, he has added to the views of preceding observers a ma
thematical precision, which forms the commencement of a new
method of demonstrative investigation, more exact than has been
hitherto applied to problems of such universal extent as those re
lating to the causes that have produced the movements of stratified
rocks in every portion of the globe.
    Assuming theoretically the application of an expansive force
acting uniformly upwards within an elliptic area, he finds that the
longitudinal fissures thereby produced would nearly coincide with
the outlines of the ellipse, forming cracks that are portions of smaller
concentric ellipses, parallel to the margin of the larger ellipse; and
that these longitudinal fissures would be numerous, and parallel to

                            these fundamental deductions from theory, Mr.
Hopkins finds            an

                               a      near    Petersfield;   the latter pervade
many minor longitudinal ridges                 the same   district,

obvious    in   the well-known transverse valleys that intersect              right                     at
angles the chalk escarpments                        of

ing the only outlets               of
                               the nine rivers that take their origin within
the ellipsoid area            of
                           the Weald.
    Many       ofthe minor transverse valleys that intersect the minor lon
gitudinal ridges, give origin            perennial springs, which are thrown
                                                   to

valleys owe their origin intercept the progress                the subterranean of

 the direction       oftheir natural joints.

 Boulogne through the area                         of

   Mr. Hopkins has also arrived at similar conclusions respecting
the longitudinal and transverse fractures which he has investigated
in the mountain limestone and coal formations of Derbyshire; com
mencing, as in the present instance, with a theoretical investigation
of the mathematical results of expansive forces acting from beneath,
and comparing these results with observations on the longitudinal
fissures and transverse fractures examined by himself in Derbyshire,
and with the answers returned by practical miners in that district
to a series of printed questions as to facts which theoretical calcula
tions had indicated as probable, and which have been fully verified
by the answers thus obtained.
   In these Memoirs of Mr. Hopkins on the Wealden district, and
on Derbyshire, we have the first instances of the geological investi
gation of any portion of the earth for the express purpose of exem
plifying a theory founded on the solution of a mechanical problem;
the results he has obtained in the coincidence of the phaenomena
with the mathematical theory by which they have been tested, have
been remarkably approximate, and make us feel that the time is
arrived when the investigations of geology have begun to exalt
themselves beyond the exquisite and delicate investigations of               Mi
neralogy, and the grand and universal laws of co-existence that give
dignity and beauty to Palaeontology, into those lofty regions of
General Physics which connect them with the most sublime demon
strations of Astronomy.
   It may be seen, by reference to the Ordnance Geological Survey
of Cornwall, that the elevations and depressions of the older slate
rocks in the West of England have been attended by numerous
parallel fissures and transverse fractures, similar to those in the
Weald of Kent and Sussex. In the mining districts of Cornwall,
particularly near Redruth, these rents and fissures are known in             all
their various and curious details, from their having been excavated
in search      of
               the metallic ores which they contain. The main direc
tion  of these fissures being east and west, they are intersected, like
those      the south-east
          in                    of
                              England,         by
                                          transverse fractures         or
                                                                   cross
courses, running nearly north and south.        Both these systems           in
Cornwall obviously result from the same mechanical laws which
have not only caused transverse fractures       intersect the longitudi

gitudinal valleys on the south side of the central axis of the
Wealden elevation, namely, the Arun, Adur, Ouse and Cuckmere

give exit to five rivers formed in longitudinal valleys on the north
side of the same central axis of the Weald, namely, the Wey, the
Mole, the Darent, the Medway, and the Stour.
     An objection has been sometimes raised to the theory which at
tributes the existing position of inclined strata to elevation, grounded
on an assumption that the same relative positions of the strata in moun
tains and the valleys adjacent to them may have been caused by the
subsidence of the lower parts of the strata into the basins, as by the
elevation of those portions which now occupy the highest place; but
these objections are overruled by mechanical and mathematical
reasons, arising from observation of the relative positions of the dis
located strata on each side of the “upcast dykes" or faults that
run parallel to these assumed lines of elevation; namely, that the
dislocated strata, in almost                all
                                 cases, occupy the place which        up                              an
ward movement would have          given     them   respectively

side   ofthe fault, and which they could not have received from                                                a

 plain of the chalk.
    Mr. Martin traces the most northerly and greatest of these anti
 clinal lines from the vale of Peasmarsh, between Guildford and
 Godalming, along the entire base of the North Downs, eastwards
 to the sea at Folkstone, and westwards to Farnham, Alton, and
 Popham Beacon, where it terminates in the high flat dome or table
 land of chalk. The most southerly anticlinal line extends from Green
 hurst, near Steyning, eastward to Lewes, and along the base of the
 escarpment of the South Downs to East Bourne and Beachey Head;
 and westwards by Midhurst and Petersfield to the Downs of East
 Hampshire, through which it emerges in valleys of elevation at East
 and West Meon, and in the valley between St. Giles's and St. Cathe
 rine's Hill at Winchester. The central anticlinal line of the Wealden
 he traces westward from Hazlemere to Liphook, Selbourne, and Can
 dover near Arlesford, and Beacon Hill near Amesbury.
     The anticlinal elevation of the valleys of Wardour, Warminster,
 and Pewsey, after advancing some miles eastward into the chalk,
 terminate in the high table-lands of Salisbury Plain and the North
 Hampshire Downs, which form a great flat dome of elevation be
 tween the counties of Sussex, East Somerset, and North Wiltshire.
    Mr. Martin considers many of the higher crests and ridges that run
 in an eastern and western direction above this elevated plain, to be
 due to saddle-shaped elevations on one or other of the great lines of
fracture that attended the upward movement of the chalk.                 In the
 details of his paper he confirms and extends the observations of
 Mr. Mantell and Dr. Fitton, upon the very interesting district which
 forms the subject of their common investigations*.
    * In his Geological Memoir on a part of Western Sussex, Mr. Martin
 put forth in   1828 some judicious remarks, showing, on the theory of de
rangement and denudation, that the Weald of Kent and Sussex, as well as
the London and Hampshire Basins, had a common origin in a system of
elevatory movements posterior to the formation of the tertiary strata.       He
considers that the strata which compose these basins, and were originally
horizontal, suffered great disruption in the act of forming basins, either
by the elevation of the sides or subsidence of the central portions of each
basin; that in this operation deep and extensive fissures were formed in
certain parts of the strata thus disturbed, analogous to those we see in
the elevation and cracking of the flour which covers the fermenting nucleus
of dough in a baker's trough ; that the great undulations of the strata are
not due to original deposition, but result from subterraneous movements,
attended by enormous pressure.          Mr. Martin also makes some judicious
observations on the too-prevalent habit of using the term chalk basin in a
manner that seems to imply local depressions peculiar to the site of each
so-called basin, forgetting that the chalk itself (although it forms a very
convenient and obvious geological horizon) is only an intermediate layer
in a succession of basin-shaped strata; and contends that as the forma
tions superincumbent upon and subjacent to it have a conformable dis
position, it is just as correct to call them London clay, or greensand, or galt
basins, as chalk basins.      Again he observes, respecting the deposits of the
basin of Paris, that their occurrence elsewhere in horizontal and appa
rently undisturbed positions, indicates the strata above the chalk to be of

   We may congratulate ourselves on the advance that has been
made during the past year, by the extension of our knowledge as
to the existence of the Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous
systems over large districts of the continent of Europe. In my last
address I endeavoured to explain the reason why the old red
sandstone formation, which occupies so very extensive a place in
 England, had been scarcely anywhere recognised on the Continent;
namely, because we had                  till
                                lately failed even     our own country       in                                      to
refer  to this system those extensive slaty forms             which, both           of      it,
here and upon the Continent, had been referred             the grauwacke             to
of  the Wernerian series, and had applied the name           old red sand                of

   In following out these strata to the E.N.E. the authors were
astonished at the vast flexures, first laid down by Won Buch and
Hoffman, and since more elaborately made out by Von Dechen and
Erbreich; and perceived that the shales become more crystalline and
slaty, and charged with mineral veins, and the limestones assume
 the state of marble or highly ferriferous rocks; these strata are also
abundantly interrupted by ridges of Trap and frequently inverted,
the carboniferous and Devonian deposits plunging under the older
Grauwacke or Silurian rocks.
   Our authors also found that the Devonian strata reappeared in
irregular troughs among the Silurian Grauwacke (often with in
verted inclination) in various parts of Nassau; many of the lime
stones, particularly on the river Lahn, being identical, both in
structure and in coralline remains, with the beautiful marbles of
Babbacombe, Torquay, and Plymouth.           In many parts of this re
gion the strata are in a highly mineralized condition, copper and
lead ores, as well as the more prevalent iron mines, occurring at
intervals; whilst numberless eruptive rocks diversify the surface;
and the strata, particularly those of the Devonian age, alternate
with a peculiar stratified contemporaneous trap-rock called “Schaal
stein,” the more schistose varieties of which contain Devonian fossils.
The various mineral waters of Nassau are supposed to be due to the
last expiring effects of the same causes which produced, in former
times, the numerous eruptions of Greenstone, Porphyry, and other
igneous rocks.
   The quartz rock of the Taunus mountains, the southern limit of
the region they examined, is considered to be an altered deposit of

tingen is undoubtedly true mountain-limestone, and the calcareous zone
 which passes from W.S.W. to E.N.E. by the towns of Elberfeldt and
 Iserlohn. Now although at a first glance the physical features of the
country seemed to favour this view (which was indeed adopted in the new
map of Von Dechen), the close examination of the authors detected, that
whilst the Ratingen limestone contained the fossils of the carboniferous
system, that of Elberfeldt and Iserlohn was charged with different types,
most of which exist in the lower limestone of Devonshire. Having assured
themselves, therefore, that there was an error in the works of previous
observers, they returned to Ratingen, and following the carboniferous
limestone eastward along         its

 The authors next institute a comparison of the formations of
Westphalia and Nassau with those of Liège, the Ardennes, and
Eifel   on the left bank     of the Rhine.            Starting        from the country
around Liège, which M. Dumont                has rendered classic by his               illus
trations and his map, Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison confirm the
views of that author, and bear testimony to the great value of the
method employed by him in bringing into symmetrical condition
that highly tortuous and convulsed tract. They admit that he has
most successfully demonstrated the replicatures of the different
members of the Carboniferous and infra-carboniferous systems, and
established on clear physical evidence, the fact that whole basins
have been inverted.      They differ from him, however, in the compa
rison he has made between the older rocks of his own country and
those types of classification which the authors have established in
the British Isles. In his table of comparison, M. Dumont supposes
that the Old red sandstone of England has no equivalent in Belgium,
and that the formations which there occur beneath the Carbonife
rous limestone (his terrain anthrawifere) are the equivalents of the
Silurian system; our authors show that the psammites, schists, and
limestones next below the coal-field and carboniferous limestone of
Liège are the exact equivalents of the series which in Westphalia
represent the Devonian system. The fossils are the same as those
of Elberfeldt, Paffrath, and Devonshire. These beds also contain
fishes of the genus Holoptychius, which Agassiz has identified with
types of the old red sandstone; and on                 all
                                                 these grounds,        well       as         as
by complete lithological and stratigraphical passage into the over
lying carboniferous group, our authors establish that the terrain
anthrawifere      of
                   D'Omalius and Dumont                    is,

  Mr. Murchison's      recent journey over large tracts of Russia was
intended to test the accuracy of the new classification of the palae
ozoic rocks upon a still wider scale than any to which it had been
applied.    Believing from the works of Strangways, Pander, and
Eichwald, that some members of these formations occur near St.
Petersburgh, and prompted by the suggestions of M. Von Buch,
that the threefold succession of Carboniferous, Old red, and Silurian
systems would be found to prevail in Livonia and North-western
 Russia, Mr. Murchison, accompanied by M. E. de Verneuil, has
made during the last summer a most extensive and instructive tour
 in Russia. The principal results of this journey were offered to the
 Geological Section of the British Association in September last at
 Glasgow, showing that the Silurian rocks occupy several islands in
 the Baltic and large parts of Livonia and Courland, and range by
 St. Petersburgh to the W.N.W. On the south they are overlaid by
 a great red formation which was formerly supposed to be the New
 red sandstone on account of                its
                                     saliferous and gypseous beds, but
 which  is  now  proved      to       be
                               the Old red sandstone        containing the     by
 Ichthyolites which characterize that deposit       the British Isles; these

 of   Russia has not only confirmed the palaeozoic classification         the                       of
   Carboniferous, Devonian, and Silurian systems, but has given new

 of the Old red sandstone have been shown       occupy     the Conti to                  on

 tails the steps that led him to infer from zoological evidence alone,
 that they were of an intermediate age between the Carboniferous
 and Silurian rocks.
    Mr. John Phillips had already observed the resemblance between
 many of these Devonian shells and those of the Mountain-limestone,
 and Mr. De la Beche had long ago noticed the position of the Tor
 bay limestones to be incumbent on strata of Old red sandstone; and
 in 1839 suggested that their organic remains would seem to indi
 cate relations to this formation.      The cause of the obscurity that
overhung this subject arose partly from the absence of any evidence
 from superposition, in consequence of the insulated place which
 these rocks occupied in the south of Devon; and partly from the
non-existence, until a recent period, of any extensive catalogues of
the organic remains of the Mountain-limestone and Silurian systems
with which these fossils of South Devon might be compared.
    In 1837 Mr. Lonsdale had ascertained, from an extensive colla
tion of the shells and corals of the south of Devon with those of the
 Silurian system supplied in the catalogue of Mr. Murchison, and
of the Carboniferous system in that of Mr.            J.
                                                       Phillips, that a large
proportion of the Devonian fossils presented a character interme
diate between those of the formations which lie above and below
the Old red sandstone; and therefore concluded that the strata in
which they are found must be subordinate parts of this intermediate
formation. The suggestion was adopted by Mr. Murchison and Pro
fessor Sedgwick in 1839, and at once shed forth a new and brilliant
light that has rapidly dispelled the darkness in which the slate rocks
of this extensive formation had, until this discovery of Mr. Lons
dale, been involved.       The first application that was made of this
new instrument of identification to the continental rocks led to the
immediate solution of the difficulties that had attended the attempts
of preceding observers to ascertain the equivalents of the English
series in the districts adjacent to the coal-fields of Liège and in the
Bas Boulonnais; and we have already noticed the vast extent to which,
during the past year, a similar identification has been carried in the
Rhenish provinces and in Russia.
    We should, however, not forget, that, by the recent examination
of Russia, the distribution of fossil animals has been found to be
materially connected with mineral conditions; for Mr. Murchison
and M. de Verneuil have shown us, that with the resumption of                    its
red and green characters, the vast Old red system                that empire

                                     ORIGIN OF COAL.
     In the early part of last year     some very interesting papers came
before us    tending   to throw   light  on the obscure and difficult ques -
tion of the formation of coal.
    Mr. J. Hawkshaw, having communicated to us in June 1839 a de
scription of several large fossil trees found in a cut on the Bolton Rail
way, near the Dixon-fold Station, five miles and a half N.W. of Man
chester, standing immediately upon a thin bed of coal perpendicularly
to    its
        surface, has added       statement
                                 a                        of
                                                 further facts, confirming his
opinion that these trees grew          the place
                                          in      and position where they are
now found. His reasons are          grounded       observationson    made near               he
the shores       of
                 the Caribbean sea,                  on

only the bark unbroken and hollow, like            empty mould an      foundry;                 in
the form     of this bark remains      perfect  after the interior      reduced              is a

                                                                             it

it  appears from effects now proceeding             tropical climates, that the

    Mr.     J.   E.
                 Bowman also has endeavoured               prove that coal hasto
been formed from         plants  which   grew        the       on
                                                          present areas        the                        of

 cessive intervals submerged, and covered                 sediments, which acby

in   the production        of
                            each bed        coal.  of    this manner   In  would                     he
 explain the uniformity              in

                                                   individual coal beds over
 very large areas.        He further admits, that other trees, branches,
and leaves, may have been drifted from the neighbouring lands, and
scattered through the beds                of
                                      shale and sandstone, whilst they were
in  process      of

by fine-grained sandstone.           Mr. Bowman considers the trunks                                           of

fossil trees in the coal formation, which are thickened at their base,
and terminate in large expanding forked roots, to have been dicoty
ledonous, whilst the monocotyledonous trees maintain throughout a
nearly uniform thickness, and their roots probably consisted of an
assemblage of succulent fibres; and argues, that if beds of coal were,
like modern peat bogs, the accumulated remains of many genera
tions of vegetables that grew upon the spot, they may, during such
process of gradual accumulation, have afforded a surface adapted
for the growth of the trees in question. He attributes the fact of
the roots standing above the upper surface of the coal, as we some
times see the roots of fir-trees above the surface of peat, to the
shrinking of the vegetable matter in which they grew, and considers
the actual thickness of each bed of solid coal to be about one-third
that of the vegetable mass from which it has been derived”.
   Mr. W. E. Logan has also communicated to us a series of minute
results of extensive examinations made by himself, and in many
cases confirmed by Mr. De la Beche, on the character of the beds
of clay immediately below the coal seams in South Wales, from
which it appears that immediately beneath every bed of coal in
that extensive district is a substratum, called the underclay, varying
in thickness from six inches to more than ten feet; and that this un
derclay so universally and inseparably accompanies nearly a hundred
seams of coal throughout South Wales, that the collier seldom finds
coal where this substratum is wanting: it is usually a fire-clay, con
taining sometimes an admixture of sand, and near Swansea passes
into a hard, fine-grained, siliceous sandstone. This never-failing sub
stratum of the coal is everywhere characterized by the exclusive
presence of innumerable remains of Stigmaria ficoides, the stems of
which are often of great length, and usually parallel to the plane
of the bed, and more abundant near the top than the bottom of
the underclay.     From each of these stems there proceeds a series
of very long and narrow leaves, forming an entangled mass, which
traverses the fire-clay in every direction and to great distances:
fragments of the stems of Stigmaria occur in other parts of the coal
formation, but in the underclay alone are the long thin leaves at
tached to them. In 1818 the Rev. H. Steinhauer published in the
American Philosophical Transactions, vol. i. p. 273, a similar ac
count of the occurrence in the English coal formation near                 Brad
     *   I
         wish to correct an error in my Address of last year (Phil. Mag., vol.
xvii. p.  512), where it is stated, that the place of the roots of the upright
trees discovered in the Bolton Railway was immediately under a thin bed
of coal; the fact           is,
                         that they were            all
                                             above this coal: the difference     is

vertical range to which the leaves extended. Mr. Logan has traced
them in a vertical direction seven or eight feet from the stem, and
more than twenty feet horizontally *, and concludes that it is im

He further supposes the Stigmaria to be the plant of which fossil
coal is mainly composed.

coal-field has been conducted.    We may assume the areas now co
vered with coal to have been extensive flats and estuaries, receiving
at intervals, during seasons of flood, large deposits of silt and sand,
interspersed with leaves and broken branches and trunks of trees,
drifted down with the detritus of not far distant lands. We may
conceive large portions of the surface of these sedimentary deposits,
after the cessation of the floods by which they were respectively
transported, to have become the site of broad and shallow ponds
or lagoons, which were speedily filled with a matted mass of floating
stems and leaves of Stigmaria, to the exclusion of             other plants,  all
in the same manner        the social plant, Stratiotes aloides, now crowds
                               as

                                                   in                   filled                 is

 ive subsidences, have been so reduced below the level of the water,
 as to make them the receptacles of alternating deposits of sand and
 clay (now converted to strata of sandstone and shale) between the
 several beds of incipient coal. During these processes, successive
 series of lagoons may have covered large portions of each last
 formed drift; and every lagoon becoming the site of a renewed
 growth of Stigmariae, may thus continuously have been laying the
 foundation and nourishing the materials of future beds of inestima
 bly precious fuel. '
    In the case of beds of coal that alternate with marine deposits, it
 has been suggested that extensive subsidence of the estuaries on
 which lacustrine and terrestrial plants were growing, may have re
 duced these estuaries below the level of the sea, where the sub
 merged strata of vegetable matter became covered with beds of en
 crinal limestone and other marine sediments; and that as these re
 ceived upon their surface further sediments of sand and mud
 drifted by land-floods into the salt-water, the estuaries were gradu
 ally filled up, and again converted into lagoons, upon which a re
 newed growth of lacustrine and land plants forthwith began to ac
 cumulate the materials of other beds of coal.
    Both in the marine and the freshwater strata that alternate with
the coal-beds, we appeal to the three same intermitting and alternate
processes of subsidence, drift, and vegetable growth; the subsidence
being in the former case to a depth below the level of the sea, in
the latter case to a depth which left the last-formed strata in a po
sition to become the site of vast swampy flats and shallow lagoons.
In both cases intermitting accumulations of the earthy materials of
the strata over the subsided districts are referred to the transport of
sand and mud by powerful land-floods over areas which by subsi
dence had acquired a place that made them receptacles of the de
tritus of distant mountains; as we now see vast sheets of sediment
transported from the Rocky Mountains and spread over the great
flats and vast estuaries of the Red River, the Missouri, and the
Missisippi. The regions on which these ancient alternations of salt
water and fresh-water deposits were going on, must in the mean
time have presented extensive surfaces that were periodically os
cillating between small distances above and below the level of the
Sea.
   The concentric rings of growth which may be counted in a trans
verse section of the large coniferous trees whose roots are found
resting on the upper surface of a coal-bed, may be quoted as evi
                                                                      of of of
dence of the time during which it was fixed in this          itsplace
growth; and   as such trees may probably     befound   on the surface
many successive beds    in  the section ofa  coal-field, each stage
trees affordsa  chronometer   by which we may calculate the number
of years that intervened between the growth       of
                                                   each bed      of
                                                                 coal.
  In  the Newcastle collieries, after the excavation   ofthe coal, short
trunks of  trees drop down frequently from the roof         ofthe mine,
leaving vertical cavities, which the miners call pot-holes; these trees
probably grew upon the surface     of the vegetable mass    bywhich the

                                     Geological Society.                                           483
coal has been formed; and the occasional assemblage of large num
bers of cones and seed-vessels of the same species, e.g. of Lepido
 strobus and Trigonocarpum, upon one spot, seems to indicate that they
 dropped into their present place from the trees on which they grew.
     Should the above hypotheses be correct, we may expect to find
 corresponding differences of organic structure on microscopic exa
 mination of the vegetable remains in the lower and upper portions
 of many beds of coal; and the attention of observers may at this
 time be profitably directed to the examination of thin slices of coal,
 carefully selected from different regions of the same bed, for the
 purpose of ascertaining whether differences exist between the com
 ponent vegetables of the upper and lower regions of individual
 strata, sufficiently obvious and constant to justify us in referring the
 lower region of certain strata to a sub-aqueous, and the upper re
gion to a sub-aerial origin. Should an entire bed of coal exhibit
no other vegetable structure than that of Stigmaria, it may be
 inferred that these plants had not so far filled up the lagoon in
 which they grew, as to convert it to a sub-aerial swamp, before fresh
 floods of water from the land overwhelmed these sub-aqueous ve
getables with sand and silt. Should we find another coal-bed with
 out any Stigmaria, and interspersed through                 whole vertical ex
                                                                      its
 tent with Calamites and other sub-aerial plants, indicating             swampy          a
soil, we may conclude that the vegetables which formed this bed                                     of
 coal grew upon humid and swampy flats adjacent                   lagoons; and
                                                                             to

rounded fragments of coal in certain grit beds of the coal forma:
tion, from which we learn that some of the older beds of coal had
assumed an indurated state before the deposition of the more re
cent strata of this great formation, the total thickness of which in
South Wales is 12,000 feet. At Penclawdd, on the Bury river near
Swansea, Mr. Logan first found, in 1839, a rounded pebble of can
                                                                       the
nel-coal in a bed of clay; he subsequently discovered that in
Pennant     grit  of  Kilvey Hill,  near  Swansea,  there are  many   con
glomerate beds containing pebbles of coal, intermixed with sand
and pebbles of ironstone, and very rarely with boulders of granite
and mica-slate.       The pebbles are chiefly of common bituminous
 coal; two only have been found composed of cannel-coal, the only
 seams of which known in the lower coal-measures are 2000 feet
 below the Pennant grit. Mr. Logan believes that coal-pebbles oc
 cur throughout the whole mass of the Pennant sandstone, the thick
 ness of which is 3000 feet, but he has seen no such pebbles in the
 lower coal-measures.
     Mr. Buddle has lately found similar pebbles of coal in the Pen
 nant grit of the Forest of Dean.

     January   11,  1841–The Rev. Thomas H. Porter, D.D., read a
 paper “On the Deposits of Gravel in the Neighbourhood of Dublin.”
     After detailing the facts commonly known as to the stratified beds
  and ridges of limestone gravel, lying over the great central limestone
  region of Ireland, and the continuance of deposits containing a large
  proportion of rounded pebbles and stones of the same material, over
 the granite and other primitive rocks to the eastward of the limestone
  country, it was argued that there were clear indications of a great
  diluvial action from west to east, by which the surface of the limestone
  was reduced to its present level, and the remains of its upper portions
  spread over the limestone region itself, and carried eastward to the sea.
  The occurrence of similar calcareous deposits in the seaward glens and
  valleys of the Dublin and Wicklow mountains for some miles south,
  and on their sides to a considerable height, was ascribed to the cur
  rent of the same deluge, sweeping the transported substances over the
 lower parts of the mountain range, and then turning southwards along
  the sea coast, after passing the north flank of the mountains. Similar
  facts, but in an inverted order, from south to north, have been observed
  towards the southern flank, in the County Wexford.
      It was urged, that the subsiding waters of this inundation, rushing
  down the valleys, and meeting below with the main current on the
  plains, would throw up those ridges along the sides of the hills, and
  on the flats beneath; of which a remarkable example is presented in
  the glen of Ballynascorney (through which the Dodder descends
  from the Dublin mountains), and in the gravel hills in front of that,
 from Tallaght to Crumlin.
     The direction assumed in this paper for the diluvial current agrees
  remarkably with that assigned by Professor Phillips as the cause of
  the distribution of the Shapfell boulders over the north-east of Eng

land.  A conjecture was proposed as to the possible occasion of such
a movement of water over the country. The limestone tract was evi
dently formed under the sea.    Its elevation may have been connect
ed with the last great convulsion, which determined nearly the pre
sent form of the surface. Great disturbances are seen at Killiney,
the Scalp, &c., to have attended the appearance of the granite, and
even to have followed that period, affecting the granite itself.      Many
parts of the Irish coasts present such abrupt terminations towards
the sea, as to indicate either a violent raising of the island from a
continuous tract at the bottom, or a sudden sinking of an extent of
dry land around the present surface. Either of these events would
create immense commotions in the waters.
   Reference was made in the course of this argument to the theory
of Professor Agassiz, respecting the supposed evidence, that glaciers
once existed in the mountains of this island, and produced, as moraines,
some of the accumulations of mountain debris commonly attributed
to the agency of water. This theory having been pushed so far by
some eminent British geologists as to have almost every ridge of
gravel and stones unhesitatingly called a moraine, it was urged, that
their principle could not be applied here at least, since the limestone
abounding in the deposits of the glens could never have been brought
down by ice from mountains in which no limestone rocks exist. It is
but justice to Professor Agassiz to state, that he did not ascribe the
limestone gravel ridges at Ballynascorney to a glacier, but professed
to find the traces of one higher up the course of the stream.
   Against the glacier theory, in general, it was maintained, that evi
dences of a glacier having existed in any locality must be derived
from the existing form of the ground; and that, therefore, no con
siderable change of the surface could be admitted, since the time
when the moraines were imagined to have been thrown up. More
especially, no deluge could have taken place since their formation;
for in that case the moraines must have been swept away. Hence
they must be supposed to have existed between Noah's flood and the
commencement of the historical periods. This interval, it was con
 tended, would not allow time for their formation and disappearance.
    A gradual change of the temperature of the whole northern hemi
 sphere would be at variance with the fact established by geologists, that
 the heatof the earth's surface had been formerly much greater than now.
    Had the degree of cold necessary for the formation of glaciers been
 owing to a greater elevation of this entire country,         sinking      its
                                                                          its         to
 present level must have been attended with convulsions and floods,
 which could scarcely have failed               to

      His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin having taken the Chair, the
   President continued the reading of Dr. Robinson's Paper “On the
   Determination of the Constant of Refraction by Observations with
   the Mural Circle of the Armagh Observatory.”
      The author remarks, that the problem of astronomical refraction is
   embarrassed by two causes of error. The differential of the refraction
   is obtained by supposing the atmosphere to consist of spherical shells
   concentric with the earth; and the integral of this, by assuming
   some mathematical relation between the height above the earth and
   the corresponding density of the air.         He shows that the first of
  these cannot be rigorously true; and that the relation between den
  sity and height, besides being unknown in general, may be expect
  ed to vary with the latitude. He therefore considers all existing re
  fraction tables as approximations which require correction for each
  individual observatory.
      For about 74° from the zenith, the refraction is independent of the
  law of density, and requires only an exact knowledge of the air's re
  fractive power; this, however, has not been yet obtained with suffi
  cient accuracy by direct experiment, and therefore must be deduced
  from astronomical observations.          At greater zenith distances some
  constitution of the atmosphere must be assumed, and if its expression
  contain a sufficient number of arbitrary constants, the resulting re
  fraction can always be made to represent with sufficient exactness
 what is actually observed. As, however, neither the formula of Bes
  sel, nor that of Ivory, very readily admits such modifications, Dr. R.
 used the method given by the late Bishop of Cloyne, in the twelfth
 volume of the Royal Irish Academy's Transactions, which, however,
 he has extended to 85° zenith distance.
     If the atmosphere be supposed of uniform temperature the refrac
 tion has been computed by Kramp; it is found greater than the truth.
 If the density be supposed to decrease uniformly as the height above
 the surface increases, the refraction is given by Simson; it is nearly
 as much in defect as the other in excess, and it is found that their
 mean is very near the truth.                     If,
                                       then, the differential equation      re            of

 observatories; but Dr. R. has given the result of such a trial. He
 used the declinations of Mr. Johnson (St. Helena Catalogue), and,
 in many instances, those of Mr. Henderson at the Cape, and by 241
   observations from 77°53' to 84° 40' he found for p. 57-586; but
   conceives the result obtained from the northern stars decidedly pre
   ferable, and has used it alone in computing the tables which are
  given at the end of the paper.
      His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin communicated some obser
  vations “On the Leafing of Plants.”
      It is well known that there is a diversity in the times of leafing and
  shedding in individual trees of the same species; e.g. hawthorn, syca
  more, horse-chestnut, beech, &c., sometimes as much as a fortnight;
  and the earliest in leaf are also the earliest shed, the same individuals
  keeping their time every year. Hence the question, whether this di
  versity arises from the “separable accidents” of soil, situation, &c.,
-or whether from “inseparable accidents” which constitute what
  physiologists call varieties?
      An experiment was tried by grafting an early hawthorn on a late,
  and vice versa. The scions kept their times (about a fortnight's dif
  ference) as if on their own stocks; thus proving that it was a case
 of “seedling variety.”
     Many other such varieties are known, not only of apples, peaches,
  &c., but of wild trees also, differing in shape of leaf, form of growth,
 colour and size of fruit, &c., and also time of ripening. It was there
 fore to be expected that there should be the like in respect of times
 of leafing.
     This may throw some light on the question respecting “acclimat
 ing.”      It may be, that species may be brought to bear climates ori
 ginally ill-suited,—not by any especial virtue in the seeds ripened in
 any particular climate, but—by multiplying seedlings, a few of which,
 out of multitudes, may have qualities suited to this or that country,
 e.g. some to cold, some to drought, some to wet, &c.
     In some cases, a plant's beginning to vegetate later may secure it
 from spring frosts, which would destroy a precocious variety; in
 others, earlier flowering may enable a tree to ripen fruit in a climate
 in which a later would be useless, &c.
     Further, the experiment shows that the common opinion respecting
the commencement of spring vegetation,-the rise of the sap from
the roots, through the trunk and branches to the twigs, is ground
less; since a scion of an early variety, on a late stock, will be in leaf
while the stock is torpid.

The alumina contains a little oxide of iron; and it also contains a
trace of chlorine, which also exists in the elaeolite of Ilmengebirge.
   The formula, according to this analysis, is
                       N3 Si + 3 Al Si + Ca C.
   The cancrimite is thus a combination of elaeolite with carbonate of
lime, as the sodalite is a combination with chloride of sodium.—

         ANALYSIS OF HAüYNE.         BY M. F. WARRENTRAPP.
   Haüyne is found in small and large grains in the porous basalt of
Nieder-Mendig, near Andernach on the Rhine.         When this mineral
is treated with hydrochloric acid, it soon becomes evident that a me
tallic sulphuret is decomposed, and it is important to ascertain the
proportion of sulphur; to effect this the powdered mineral is put
into a retort connected with a Woulfe's apparatus containing a solu
tion of chloride of copper, and hydrochloric acid is to be poured upon
the mineral previously moistened: the hydrosulphuric acid expelled
precipitates the copper from the chloride in the state of sulphuret.
When this operation is over, the solution remaining in the retort is
diluted with water, and the silica is separated in the usual way, and
the sulphur, using the requisite precautions, is determined by the
quantity of sulphuret of copper obtained. The chlorine is ascer
tained by decomposing a small portion of the mineral with nitric
 acid; the sulphuric acid is precipitated by chloride of barium.
    The results obtained were the following:—

 ON THE PRODUCTS OF THE ACTION OF POTASH ON INDIGOTIN
                                    —chrysani Lic Acid.”
   M. Fritzsche states that when indigotin    treated with      hot                  is                         a

between two bricks from the excess of the alkaline solution, be
treated with water, traces of unaltered indigotin are precipitated,
and there remains in solution a salt of potash containing a new acid,
which the author has named chrysanilic acid; when the chrysanalate
of potash is decomposed by an acid, the new acid is precipitated in
red flocculi. The author has examined the compounds which it forms
with bases, and has submitted them to analysis; he does not, how
ever, consider his analytic results as satisfactory; but he has ascer
tained that 0-250 gramme of indigotin yielded 0.203 gramme of the
acid; that is to say, more than 80 per cent: when chrysanilic acid
is treated with dilute sulphuric acid, it yields a bluish red liquor, which
deposits a crystalline body of a blackish blue colour, and retains in
solution a new acid, which the author calls anthranilic acid. This acid
                                                                          air

who has been an ironmonger for nearly fifty years, and by him the
lock was pronounced such as was frequently brought to be re
paired about the time of his commencing business.       The bolt is
round; the key must have been without a pipe, similar to a door
key, and the form of the lock is different from that now made.
   The complete preservation of the lackering—a circumstance in
itself worth notice—has led me to suppose that the lock was nearly
new when the formation around it commenced.

450          Mr. Milward                  on the Action        of Light on Revolving Discs.
the most perfect image will be equal to the duration of the
effect of a wave of light on the retina.
    3. We will begin by directing our attention to the effect of
a continuous light upon revolving wheels. In this case we may
consider the successive changes through which the surface
passes until it comes again into the situation which it at first
occupied, as constituting an infinite number of positions whose
differences are indefinitely small, i. e..that a whole revolution
comprises an infinite number of such positions.       The action
of a continuous light, on the contrary, is made up of a series of
successive waves of appreciable length, and separated by a
definite though exceedingly small interval.        Now a small
number of waves of light acting successively will affect the
same nerves of the retina, or nearly so, and thus produce either
the same image, or one differing from it merely by being at
tended with a certain amount of confusion; and thus will act
in the same manner as though the representations on the disc
were confused in their outline. During the time of the dura
tion of this small system of waves, the disc will pass through
a small portion of a revolution which we will represent by
         1                       -                                   - --              -        -

the retina            at

lution, and neglect the modifications arising from the fact, that
the image       the result
                      is                        of
                                several successive waves.             there            If
fore the images thus impressed upon the retina remained only
during           an
             indefinitely short space        time, each position would
                                                                of

                       the eye, and the wheel would               distinctly       be
seen  during       motion. its We    know,    however,    that such      not                        is
the case; each image impressed upon the retina remains
there for      appreciable length
                   an                    time, during which the wheel

In proportion arise.
   It is on these principles that a popular toy has been con

pleasing manner.        It consists of two circular discs, on one of
which are    represented    figures, or other objects, in various po
sitions; while the other, which is larger, has a number of small
holes pierced at equal intervals around                 circumference.         its

cause     easily

 certain number              of

                                        very short duration.             evi                   It   is
 dent that we     may   consider the experiment            resolving itself    as
 into that    oftwo discs facing one another, and revolving simul

 As the second disc revolves, few images mth positions pass

must produce a clear image on the retina, which will of course
 convey no idea of motion, we shall immediately perceive’
from the experiment in question, that the duration of the elec
tric spark does not exceed the period of revolution of the disc
through an exceedingly small space (that is through the mth
part of a revolution); and if it can be proved that the electric
fluid passes through a definite space during the exceedingly
short duration of the light, it follows that it moves with a ve
locity bearing a known relation to that with which the cir
cumference of the disc describes the mth part of a revolution.
It will be seen, however, that by this experiment nothing more is
proved than that the duration of the light is exceedingly short.
The main point depends upon the consideration of the actual
and definite motion of the fluid during that short duration;
               I
and this apprehend cannot be proved by the spark from a
Leyden jar; for though that spark evidently arises from the
motion of the fluid, we have no proof at all that the fluid has
moved during the interval for which the spark is in existence,
and it is upon this point that the value of the experiment
must depend.
   The case is different when the electric discharge takes place
in the form of a stream of light; for here we have good rea
son to believe that the fluid causes a succession of sparks
along the line of            its
                        progress; and consequently that      has de
                                                                                  or it
scribed the space between the first and last spark,         the two
extremities       the apparent stream, during the collective dura
                    of
tion     of
         the continuous light.        therefore such If  light pro            a
duces the same effect         the spark as   the Leyden jar when
                                                          of
tested        by
              the   wheel,  we have   high    presumptive evidence
that the fluid has moved     through  the  length     the apparent       of
stream      light, while the disc has described only the mth part
              of
of   a   revolution.    same Thethe case with    flash

        The cause         of

 acts as a test, when the unassisted powers of vision are inca
 pable of appreciating the interval between the sparks.
    Let us first consider the case in which the disc appears sta
 tionary.    By referring to our previous principle, that a spark
 of very short duration produces a clear image of the disc, as
 reflecting only one mth position, we may consider the effects
 produced by a succession of such sparks, the intervals be
 tween which are definite and equal: and here it is evident that
 each spark reflects an image to the eye which will be se–
 parated from that which succeeds                      the space through
                                                                       it,   by
 which the wheel passes during the elapsed interval”. Now                                                       if
                            be
                     exactly equal
                                                          it to
 this interval                             the time         which the disc          in
 performs          an
                 entire revolution,          evident that each spark
                                                               is                                               as
it   isproduced will reflect the same image                the eye, and             to                         al

 the interval between the sparks being exactly equal                         the                          to
time      in
           which the wheel revolves.               the second case,     In                                     it

          successive    positions,    separated         the small    quantity  by

equal      the lapse               of
                          time between the successive sparks. The
cause     of todistinctness depends not only upon the principles
                  its
which influence         disc     slow motion, viz. the small number

                                                      a                      by                                 of
confusion        decreased,
                   is          and also the    disturbing      effect        the                          of
optic muscles,                by
                       which the eye spontaneously follows the re
volving image, but also upon the advantage                    the length               of                       of
time   elapsing    between the    sparks    (and therefore between the
formation          of
                 the images), which permits the effect                the last                    of

another; thus diminishing the confusion. Thus                          the se                     in
cond case, the velocity                     of
                                  the wheel being greater than the
interval between the sparks, the effect becomes that                    slowly                    of  a
revolving wheel, whose motion             direct.          is
    By the same reasoning              evident, that

IN the

question which has claimed the attention of philosophers from
the time of the discovery of Torricelli, and has not hitherto
received a solution; it is therefore with much diffidence that
I  attempt to give an explanation of this phaenomenon.           think,                    I

 must, by the laws of hydrostatics, press upon and displace the
 lighter; and a current will be established from the poles to
 the equator.
    “This difference of gravity becomes less as we ascend from
 the surface, and at a certain point is neutralized; while, on the
other hand, the elasticity which is equal at the surface varies
with the height, and the barometer stands higher at equal
elevations in the equatorial than in the polar column, and, at
some definite height, must more than compensate the unequal
 density of the lower strata, and occasion a counter flow from
the equator to the poles.”
    The calculations of the opposite forces of density and of
elasticity, which Professor Daniell has given, it is not neces
sary here to repeat; but he adds, “As we have calculated
that those currents, with such respective degrees of force, are
the consequence of the equal height of the barometer                 over              all

    It is in some measure already accounted for in the preceding
 remarks, because the south wind, that which depresses the
 barometer, coming from warmer regions, brings with it a larger
 quantity of vapour than              decreasing temperature will sup
                                                its
 port, and consequently          precipitation takes place.

 north wind, coming from colder climates,                  comparatively            is
 dry; and thus the barometer rises when the weather                    fine,                        is
and falls when            the

                                is
    But the connexion here noticed cannot               wholly explained     be

                                     it                              south                         a

in proportion to the amount of the decrease, which we find
 in winter to be to that in summer nearly in the ratio of two
to one, and accordingly the force of the wind varies nearly in
 this ratio also; whilst the proportionally increased difference
 in the densities of atmospheric columns of different latitudes,
 affords greater scope for elevations and depressions in their
 relative heights, and consequently for variations in their press
 ure; and thus increases the extent of the oscillations of the
 barometer.
    The lines marking the oscillations of the barometer, coincide
 in direction for great distances. For a confirmation of this
fact   I must refer to those drawn or graduated lines inserted at
 the end of Professor Daniell's ‘Meteorological Essays,’ which
are selected from the volumes of the Ephemerides of the
 Meteorological Society of the Palatinate.
    It is clear that any elevation or depression of the atmo
 sphere must be communicated by the flowing of the upper
current to great distances, both in the direction of the meri
dian by the proper course of this current, and laterally by the
rotation of the earth; and from this it occasionally happens,
that fluctuations in the height of the barometer are caused by
circumstances occurring at a distance from the place of obser
vation.      Thus in December 1821, the height of the baro
meter at Tottenham, near London, was 27-83 inches on the
 24th ; and though windy weather prevailed at the time, yet no
storm of wind of any consequence succeeded this great de
pression, but a like state of the barometer was extensively ob
served at the same time on the Continent, and very tempest
uous weather attended it far to the south of our island%.
    The deviations of     these lines from the mean, decrease to
wards the     equator.
    The oscillations of the barometer in the more southern
latitudes, which are merely communicated from northern
parallels, will of course decrease in extent with their distance
from their origin; and in those originating near the tropics, in
which latitudes the differences of temperature are so much
less, and so much less exposed to irregularities than in those
nearer the poles, that much less variation in the heights of at
mospheric columns can take place in the former than in the
latter, the fluctuations of the mercury will be proportionally
slight.
    The extent of the oscillations of the barometer below the
mean height diminishes, and the extent of those above the
mean increases, from the temperate to the polar regions. The

to that between 40° and 30°, viz. 0-051 foot is again predo
minant, although in the former regions the difference of
height is much greater than in the latter; showing that those
causes which tend to counteract the centrifugal force are much
modified in different zones, as must evidently be the case by
such circumstances, as the relative proportions of easterly and
westerly winds; an easterly wind being, we may suppose, when
flowing towards the equator, in some part of                course                    its           an

ASingminute anatomy is now become more generally interest
       than formerly, and begins to assume the character of
 an extensive and comparatively accurate science, so as to
give a new complexion to some of the most important questions
 in physiology and pathology, and to enable us to submit many
old doctrines to a more exact scrutiny than most of our classical
 anatomists had the means of employing, it appears to me that
 considerable advantage might arise if different independent
observers would more frequently publish a brief yet clear ac
count of the results of their inquiries.        Hence      propose to        I
communicate      occasionally   to the  Philosophical   Magazine,   a
series of short notes on the ultimate structure of various ani
mal tissues and on the elementary forms which occur in the
fluids, taking the descriptions in                    all

smaller than the pale globules of the blood; and, as        have                       I
noticed in the Appendix to Gerber's Anatomy, the same fact
is observable in the mammalia. Yet the descriptions given
since Hewson's time of the lymph-globules of birds have
always been drawn from the pale globules of their blood.
   The distinguished inquirer just mentioned states that the
particles of the fluid of the lymphatic glands of birds are oval,
like the nuclei of their blood-corpuscles.   In the Philosophi
cal Magazine for February 1840, I gave an account of the
lymph-globules of the Musk Deer, from which it appears
that these scarcely differ in size from those of man, not
withstanding the blood-discs of this little ruminant are the
smallest at present known; and although the Camelidae have
oval blood-corpuscles, I found that the globules of the thymus,
of the lymphatic glands, and of the pus of these animals, had
the usual circular figure, and nearly the same size as the cor
responding globules in other mammalia”.         It was to be ex
pected therefore that the lymph-globules of birds would pos
sess a similar form, and this I have lately ascertained to be
the case. The annexed figure represents particles from the
Magpie,       all which are magnified exactly

482                 Mr. Gulliver's      Contributions to the
 servable to the same degree in the pale globules of the blood of
 these two classes.       The account of the chemical characters of
 the lymph-globules of mammalia, as given in the Appendix to
  Gerber's Anatomy, is generally applicable to the corresponding
 globules of birds. Professor Wagner observes, that the che
 mical properties of the pale globules of the blood and the nuclei
 of the blood-discs of birds and reptiles are identical. This
 appears to be true in most respects; but in certain experiments
 the two kinds of particles seem to me to be differently affected
 under precisely the same treatment. Thus the nucleus of the
 blood-corpuscle is not so prone to change in drying as the
 lymph-globule.          The former, whether exposed in recent
 blood by acids, or in dry blood by the moisture of the
 breath, may be quickly dried, and the form of the nucleus
 thus completely preserved, on the slip of glass used to make
 the observation; while the lymph-globule after similar treat
 ment, and even if dried without any addition, becomes either
 faint, tumid, or misshapen. Certain saline solutions too, which,
 in a few hours, either injure the shape of the lymph-globules
or render them almost invisible, do not act so remarkably on
the nuclei of the blood-discs.
    The pale globules noticed in this paper are those well-known
white and slightly granular corpuscles which are generally
seen at once very plainly in the blood, as they appear, under
certain adjustments of the object-glass, with a distinct and
dark circumference.          But there are other pale particles in
the blood.      Some of these are isolated, and agree in               reall
spects with the globules        ofthe lymphatic juice, being smaller,
often rather fainter and with           less definite contour than the
                                        a
pale globules first mentioned.              In

   These measurements, excepting No. 5, were obtained from
the particles of adult birds at different seasons.        The lymph
globules in most of the above-named species, do not differ
much in magnitude; and it is possible that further observa
tions may show as much variety in the size of the globules of
any one bird, especially if examined at different periods and
compared in growing and mature specimens. In a few instances
from one to five of the globules were seen to be inclosed with
granular matter in a cell, the diameter of the latter varying
from 1-2600th to 1-11 14th of an inch.           If the lymph-globule
be regarded as a cell-nucleus, of course the smaller rounded
particles which it frequently contains will be nucleoli.        Some
times from two to six of these may be observed in one lymph
globule, in which case they are very minute; and it is not
unusual to see a single central and larger nucleolus varying
from a quarter to half the size of the lymph-globule.
LXXII. A        Reply to some Observations of Professor Kelland
   in the Philosophical Magazine for May 1842.             By the Rev.
   M. O’BRIEN, late Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge*.
           observations made by Professor Kelland upon my
THE    paper published in the Philosophical Magazine last
March, are calculated,        I think, to produce an impression,
that I have done     nothing     more than he has already done in
his memoirs in vol. vi. of the Camb. Phil. Trans, and his
* Theory of Heat.”        This imposes upon me the disagreeable
task of  defending    myself   in the following manner.
   I  shall briefly state how far I have pursued the same course
as Professor Kelland, and in what we differ.
   I  have made use of a notation similar to that employed by
Prof. Kelland; I have assumed that the particles of aether
are acted upon by those of matter; and I have employed the
equations of M. Cauchy, viz.
# - sm{f()            8 & -- }/02-0,            a rºyº     tº sº),
                    *  Communicated    by the Author.

   So far as this          I
                    lay no claim to originality, nor has Pro
fessor Kelland any right to do so either.
   After this there is not a single step we have taken alike.
Professor Kelland's equations and results are essentially dif
ferent from mine; and not only do we differ, but we are dia
metrically opposed to each other, so that if one of us be right
the other must be wrong altogether.
  I  lay claim to originality in the following particulars, viz.
  I  have arrived at a result never obtained before, namely,
that dispersion must arise from the direct action of the parti
cles of matter upon those of aether.     This result is denied by
Professor Kelland.
  I  have obtained by a simple process, the equations

  Ross has described, it will be necessary to follow the land to
  its northern limit, which will determine its connexion with or
 separation from the land to the eastward.          If separated from
 that land, and the dividing sea proves of any extent, the grand

  Pacific is at once solved.                        --

Coppermine and Great Fish river were delineated, in both
instances, in less than six weeks of boat navigation.              More
over, the form and aspect of the unsurveyed lands are pecu
liarly favourable for ensuring complete success. In the contem
plated survey, there are two western coasts and one bay which
from past experience will almost for a certainty be found free
of ice,—the only obstruction really to be dreaded in the pro
secution of northern geographical research.              There were no
obstructions of importance in tracing the west coast of Green
land, the western coast of Cockburn Island, or the various
extensive bays which indent the polar coast. Sir Edward Parry
has pointed out this important feature in the geography of
North America in the Narratives of both his second and third

in the Duke of York's Bay of Southampton Island, “Scarcely
a piece of ice was seen in any part; and the appearance of the
beach, on which were no                                masses, showed
that here, as in all other well-sheltered harbours or inlets in
the Polar Seas, little or none had ever found access, except
that which is found in           it,
                               and which the annual process           dis                     of

It must be evident to the most careless observer that my
proposed wintering is situated on a height of land, as the op
posite courses of the Fish river, the tributary to the Great
 Fish river, and other streams demonstrate. Under these cir
cumstances, however slight may be my pretensions to the

title of a naturalist, should be sorry to have it supposed that
I  am so ignorant of the habits of fishes as to look for them in
the sources of rivers during the inclement season.     It is in the
lakes and not in the sources of rivers that I should seek for
the finny tribes.

sufficiently elucidated the subject. Some obscurities, however,
in a part of Dr. Kane's late paper seemed to make it desirable
that some of his results should be confirmed before being
finally adopted, and at the suggestion of Professor Liebig                                      I
undertook the re-investigation of this subject, and performed
it in his laboratory.
   Instead of the Roccella tinctoria I employed in my experi
ments the lichens that grow on the basalt rocks of the Vogels
berg in Upper Hessia, where they are collected for the pur
pose of preparing a dye from them. These lichens were                                          all
crustaceous and belonged            the genera Lecanora, Urceo

been formed. The same effect was brought about instanta
neously when the solution was boiled.                 In order to observe
the process more clearly, I dissolved a quantity of lecanorin
in baryta water in the cold. The solution, on being boiled
or allowed to stand, deposited a great mass of pure carbonate
of baryta. The liquid was filtered rapidly, and the excess of
 caustic baryta precipitated by a stream of carbonic acid : on
 slow evaporation it yielded large prismatic crystals of a sub
stance which possessed characters in every respect identical
with those of orcin. It had an extremely sweet taste, was ca
pable of being volatilised without change and without leaving
any residue, gave a deep blue colour when dissolved in am
monia and exposed to the air, struck a blood-red colour with
nitric acid, and precipitated a solution of basic acetate of lead.
 Lecanorin thus is converted by the action of alkalies into
orcin and carbonic acid, in the first instance, this decompo
 sition always preceding the formation of colouring matters.
 The same decomposition is produced by the carbonated alka
lies, by long boiling with water and by dry distillation, the
heavy vapour mentioned above as being produced by heating
lecanorin to decomposition, being vapour of orcin.
    The composition of lecanorin is expressed by the formula
Cls Hs Os. The results of the combustions which                    made of         I
it admit of no other interpretation. All attempts to determine
its   atomic weight           by

play.   It occurred  to me that it might be the lactate of urea,
instead of pure  urea, which is taken up; and upon comparing
the formulae for  hippuric acid, benzoic acid, and the lactate of
urea, it appeared that one equivalent of lactate of urea minus
three eqs, of water, gave exactly the requisite elements for the
conversion of 2 eqs, of benzoic acid into 2 eqs, of hippuric
acid. , 2 eqs, of benzoic acid + 1 eq. of lactate of urea = 2
eqs, of hippuric acid + 3 eqs, of water.

    Now the urea has by M.M. Cap and Henry been found to
exist in human urine as lactate, and the separation of the
elements of water is a change which might be expected to
take place in the system under such circumstances. The ben
zoic acid merely taking up the lactate of urea, and throwing
off water, is certainly a more probable occurrence than the
destruction of such a stable compound as uric acid.
    In analyses for the quantity of lactate of urea, according to
                                          I
the method of Cap and Henry, found that although I could
not obtain it in crystals, yet the quantity in a syrupy state was
much reduced after taking the benzoic acid, and the same ap
peared on forming nitrate of urea from it... I obtained 14 grs.
less of urea in 4 ounces of urine when the benzoic acid had
been taken. In another experiment I obtained 17 grs. less of
urea when 30 grs. of benzoic acid had been taken; this is a
greater loss than can be accounted for by the formation of the
hippuric acid; but this can be referred to the urine, from some
accidental circumstance, being of nearly as high specific gra
vity in this case as when the benzoic acid had been taken.
 30 grs. of benzoic acid, swallowed, usually increased the spe
 cific gravity of the urine from four to six-thousandths.
    From these results two inquiries suggest themselves:—1st,

    In a paper formerly read to the Society, the author had investi
 gated an analytical expression for the precession of the pole of the
 earth, on the hypothesis of the earth's being composed of a hetero
 geneous solid shell inclosing a heterogeneous fluid; and showed that
  its amount, deduced from that hypothesis, could not agree with                                                             its
 actual observed amount, unless the ellipticity           the interior surface                of

                                     the inner surface (assuming always
 that the earth was originally fluid) depends            the thickness      the              on                      of

   2. The following paper was read:—“Contributions       to Terre
strial Magnetism,” No. III. By Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A.,
F.R.S.
  In this memoir, the author gives      a detailed account of the obser
 vations on the magnetic intensity made at sea by the officers of the
 Erebus and the Terror on their passage from England to Kergue
len's Land; the unreduced observations transmitted to the Admiralty
by the Commanders of these ships, Captain James Ross and Captain
 Crozier, having been placed in his hands for that purpose.
    The first part of the paper relates to the observations made be
tween England and the Cape of Good Hope; and the second, to
those made between the Cape and Kerguelen's Land.               These ob
servations, made at various stations, are given in the form of tables;
and their accordance with the isodynamic lines drawn from Mr. Dun
lop's observations, contained in the first number of the author's con
tributions on this subject, is pointed out.
   Jan. 27.-The following papers were read, viz.-
    1. “Barometrical Observations made at Yarmouth, Norfolk, on
the 21st of June and 21st of September 1841.” By Arthur Utting,
 Esq.   Communicated by Captain Edward J. Johnson, R.N., F.R.S.
   2. “On the Anatomy and Physiology of the Decidua.”              By Ro
bert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
   In this paper, the author describes some appearances which he
has observed in the structure of the human decidua, and which ap
parently prove that the circulation of the maternal blood in the
ovum is carried on during the early months of gestation, chiefly by
the different layers of this membrane, and the cells of the chorion.
He has been led by his observations to the belief, that the veins of
the uterine decidua convey blood from the decidual cavity into the
veins of the uterus; and that, in          probability,  all
                                                           current    ma  a                  of

                      is      flowing   from the cells       the chorion,     of
through the decidua reflexa, into the decidual cavity.

ascribes to the presence of opake white salivary matter as one of                                                   its

 them, the author gives a sketch of the perturbing causes, such as
 oceanic evaporation, mountain ranges, and other local influences; he

 COAL IN SICILY, NEW ZEALAND, NEW HOLLAND, BORNEO, SOUTH
              AMERICA, AND KERGUELEN's LAND.
     At   a time when steam    navigation is assuming a character of in
calculable   importance     to the world, the discovery of coal in any
maritime   position   in distant regions that lie upon the great commer
cial highway    of nations,  demands the attention of          whose duty                 all                       or

    Mr. Tradescant Lay has also laid before us a notice of the ex
istence of coal, or valuable lignite, in the island of Borneo: should
a large supply of it be found in this island, it may become a station
of inestimable value for effecting intercourse by steam between
China, India and Australia, and the great islands of the Malay             Ar
chipelago.
    It              recent accounts from Valparaiso, that an abundant
supply of good coal has lately been obtained at Talcahuano, with
which the steamer Peru has made a successful voyage to and from
 Copiapo".
    We have just learnt from Captain James Ross that good coal has
been discovered in Kerguelen's Land in the Southern Ocean.
                                IGNEOUS   ROCKS.
    We have, from the Rev. D. Williams, an account of a mass of trap,
intersecting the mountain limestone, red marl and lias at the W. end
of Bleadon Hill, on the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It resembles in
its character that of Hestercombe, on the flank of the Quantoc
 Hills N.W. of Taunton, and is the first discovery of trap connected
with the line of elevation of the Mendip chain. This protrusion of
trap is attended by a remarkable fault, which brings the edges of
bent strata of lias into contact with those of mountain limestone.
Mr. Penistone has also supplied an instructive section of this cut
ting.     The nearest known trap rocks to the Mendips are that of
Hestercombe in the Quantoc Hills just mentioned, and that near
 Tortworth and Berkeley.
    In a paper on the Isle of Madeira, Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill has
supplied,   I believe, the first geological description of this island, the
structure of which has long been a desideratum to geologists. Little
    * As no more coal is in process of formation, and our national prosperity
must inevitably terminate with the exhaustion of those precious stores of
mineral fuel which form the foundation of our greatest manufacturing and
commercial establishments, I feel it my duty to entreat the attention of
the legislature to two evil practices which are tending to accelerate the
period when the contents of our coal-mines will have, been consumed.
The first of these is the wanton waste which for more than fifty years has
been committed by the coal-owners near Newcastle, by screening and burn
ing annually in never-extinguished fiery heaps at the pit’s mouth, more than
one million of chaldrons of excellent small coal, being nearly one-third
of the entire produce of the best coal-mines in England. This criminal
 destruction of the elements of our national industry, which is accelerating
by one-third the not very distant period when these mines will be exhausted,
 is perpetrated by the colliers, for the purpose of selling the remaining two
thirds at a greater profit than they would derive from the sale of the entire
bulk unscreened to the coal-merchant.
    The second evil is the exportation of coal to foreign countries, in some
of which it is employed to work the machinery of rival manufactories, that
in certain cases could scarcely be maintained without a supply of British
coals. In 1830, 1,431,861 tons were exported, and in 1840, 1,592,283 tons,
of which nearly one-fourth were sent to France. An increased duty on
coals exported to any country, excepting our own colonies, might afford
a remedy.     See note on this subject in my Bridgewater Treatise, vol. i.
p. 535.

and lakes formed upon and within the glaciers.          He also investi
gates the action of modern glaciers in polishing and producing striae,
ridges and furrows, and rounded bosses resembling wool-sacks
(Roches moutonnés of De Saussure and Roches bosselées of Hugi), on
the surface of the hardest rocks over which they pass; and also in
grinding to the state of pebbles fragments of rocks that are forced
along their bottoms, and in transporting to great distances large
blocks of stone interspersed through the substance and poised upon
the surface of morains.
   Within the records of history the lower terminations of many gla
ciers have varied considerably, and the morains left by them in the
valleys show the extent to which the ice has descended in times
comparatively modern.       Agassiz has recognized the association of
similar  residuary  phaenomena    not only in valleys of the Alps below
the level of the    present  glaciers, but along the whole south-east
flank of the mountains of the    Jura, which run parallel to the Alps at
the distance of  fifty miles on the north-west side of the great valley
of Switzerland. He finds on the Jura limestone, at various heights,
from the level of the Lake of Neufchatel to three thousand feet, evi
dences from which he infers that glaciers descending the great
valleys of the Alps have extended across the entire valley of Swit
zerland over the lakes of Neufchatel and Geneva (then converted
into ice), until their course was stopped and deflected in directions
parallel to the Jura by the obstructing barrier which this mountain
chain presented. These evidences consist, 1st, in erratic angular
blocks of the granite of Mont Blanc, and other rocks from the high
Alps, lodged on the south-east face of the Jura in insulated positions,
and frequently upon banks of sand and gravel analogous to the mo
rains now forming in the Alps; 2ndly, in the frequent occurrence of
polished surfaces, striae and furrows on the Jura limestone, similar to
those now produced at the bottom of existing glaciers; 3rdly, in the
coincidence of these striae with the direction in which a glacier from
the Alps would have been deflected by the barrier presented to it
by the Jura, and their non-coincidence with the slope of these moun
tains; 4thly, in the existence upon the polished surfaces of the Jura
limestone of funnel-shaped cavities (couloirs), and small indentations
similar to the lapiaz we see daily forming at the bottom of glaciers
by small and temporary cascades descending through cracks and
chasms of the ice.                                        -
   M. Agassiz contends, that this quadruple series of phaenomena,
which are common to the south-east slopes of the Jura, and to the
bottom of existing glaciers in the Alps, is inexplicable on any
theory of aqueous action apart from ice; and still further argues
that the concurrent appearance of similar phaenomena in other re
gions of the world justifies the inference that these also have been
the site of glaciers. He moreover infers, that very large portions of
the now temperate regions of the globe have for a long period been
enveloped with a winding-sheet of snow and ice.
   In November 1840, the evidence of the existence of glaciers in
Scotland and the north of England has been brought before us in

                              Geological Society.                         517
  three communications:      the first detailing the observations of M.
  Agassiz and Dr. Buckland       conjointly during a recent tour in Scot
 land; the second recording Dr. Buckland's observations in Scotland,
  Northumberland,     Cumberland and Westmoreland;               and the third
 containing evidences of glacial action collected by Mr. Lyell in
 Forfarshire and the valley of Strathmore.
     The phaenomena in Scotland, wherein M. Agassiz and Dr. Buck
 land recognized the evidences of glacial action, consist in the union
 of rounded, polished, striated and furrowed surfaces with morains
 and transported blocks, analogous to the similarly associated phaeno
 mena upon the Jura and in the Alps. They are described in the six
 following localities. 1st, the morains on the summit level of the road
between Inverary and Loch Awe: 2ndly, the rounded, polished and
striated surfaces of granite near the water's edge at the ferry of Bun
 awe, and the morains adjacent to it near Mucairn: 3rdly, the polished
and striated surfaces of granite, between high and low water, at
the ferry of Ballahulish on Loch Leven: 4thly, the rounded, po
lished and striated surfaces, accompanied by morains, in Glen Roy
and the valley of the Spean; from the position of which they infer
that the lake, to which many writers have referred the origin of the
parallel roads of Glen Roy, was caused by two glaciers descending
from Ben Nevis across the valley of the Spean, in the same manner
as in 1818 a temporary lake was formed by a barrier of ice in the
Val de Bagnes above Martigny; and as at this time, a barrier formed
by the glacier of Miage protruding across the Allée Blanche is the sole
cause of the Lake Combal, which would immediately be left dry like
Glen Roy, should any cause remove the protruding barrier of the
glacier of Miage”; a fifth locality, in which there is the same con
current evidence of morains loaded with transported blocks, and of
rounded and polished surfaces on the sides and bottom of a moun
tain valley, occurs near Sir George Mackenzie's residence at Coul,
at the south-west base of Ben Wevis: the 6th and last locality visited
conjointly was the site and neighbourhood of the town of New
Aberdeen, where the polished surface of the granite had been no
ticed by Dr. Fleming, and where remodified detritus of morains
forms the hillocks of gravel between the town and the sea on the
north side of the estuary of the Dee, and cliffs of gravel and till or
boulder clay occur on the south of the same estuary.
    In another communication Dr. Buckland records his observation
of similar phaenomena in the valley of Strathmore; in the highland
valleys of the Tay and Tumel; on the north-east shoulder of Schie
hallion; in the high pass of Glen Cofield, between Taymouth and
Strathearn; in Glen Lednoch and Glen Turret, on the north of
Comrie; on the sides of Loch Earne; and in the valley of the Teith
between Loch Katerine and Doune.
    In the lowland districts he notices also the occurrence of rounded,
polished and striated surfaces upon the top of the basaltic rocks
of Stirling Castle, on the north face of the Castle Rock at Edin
burgh, at Blackford hill, on Calton hill, the Costorphin hills, and

 other hard trap rocks near Edinburgh, many of which have been de
 scribed and attributed to diluvial action by Sir James Hall.
    In Northumberland Dr. Buckland describes an immense accu
 mulation of morains, or detritus of morains, at the east base of the
 Cheviots, near Wooler; and in the lake districts of Cumberland
 and Westmoreland he found the sides of many mountain valleys
and gorges, by which the waters of these lakes have their exit to the
adjacent plains, to bear marks similar to those produced by glaciers,
 viz. rounded, striated and polished surfaces, accompanied by the
accumulation of mounds of gravel and erratic blocks in the low
i.
countries subjacent to them.
    Mr. Lyell has read a paper on the evidences of the action of ice
in Forfarshire, and has re-examined that county in order to satisfy
himself whether the boulder formation of the district, which he had
             regarded as the effect of drift-ice on submerged land, might
     explained by the agency of ice acting on land already elevated
above the sea. This latter conclusion he is now inclined to adopt,
believing that it is favoured by the mounds of transported materials
bearing the form of morains, and for the most part unstratified,
which occur on the sides of almost every valley in the Grampians, and
sometimes across the glens at right angles, and almost blocking them
up. He finds this opinion further confirmed by the local distribution
of rocky fragments, and the evidence of their descent from higher
to lower levels; and, lastly, he thinks that the rarity of organic re
mains in the till or boulder clay lends support to the same view.
He mentions several deep lakes in the Grampians in Forfarshire, on
the lower sides of which enormous accumulations of mud, gravel
and angular blocks are strewed, which are derived from precipices
on their higher side; these materials would have filled up the lakes,
unless we suppose them to have been formerly occupied by ice.
    The effects of drift-ice in producing alternations of stratified and
unstratified deposits, and in causing curvatures in strata of sand and
gravel, while underlying beds remain horizontal and undisturbed,
                                    i.
were treated of last year by Mr. Lyell in a paper on the mud-cliffs of
Norfolk. But in Forfarshire the         or unstratified matter containing
boulders and angular blocks, is found everywhere underlying the
stratified sand and clay; had the whole deposit been accumulated
under water, we might have expected alternations; Mr. Lyell there
fore conjectures that the older till may have been formed in great
part when the glaciers were gradually advancing over the country,
at the period of the first coming on of a colder climate, and that
  ortions of the morains may have become subsequently stratified
in temporary lakes, or during floods in those valleys where stratifi
cation is observable.
    Another feature in the distribution of the transported materials of
Forfarshire and Perthshire is a continuous stream, from three to three
and a half miles wide, of boulders and pebbles, traceable from near
Dunkeld by Coupar and the south of Blairgowrie into Strathmore,and
thence in a straight line through the lowest depression of the Sid
law hills from Forfar to Lunan Bay, a distance of thirty-four miles.

 No great river follows this course, but it is marked everywhere
 by lakes or ponds, which afford shell-marl, swamps, and peat-mosses,
 commonly surrounded by ridges of detritus from fifty to seventy
 feet high, consisting in the lower part of till and boulders, and in the
 upper part of stratified beds of gravel, sand, loam, and clay, which
 in some instances are curved or contorted; the form of the included
 spaces is sometimes oval, sometimes quadrangular.              No organic re
 mains have been found in the         surrounding   ridges, but they resemble
 greatly in form the mounds of detritus which may once have con
 stituted the lateral, transverse, or medial morains of a great glacier.
     Mr. Lyell compares the chain of this part of the Grampians to
 the Alps, the parallel chain of the Sidlaw hills to the Jura, and
 Strathmore to the great valley of Switzerland; and the resemblance,
 he says, is increased by the occurrence in Strathmore and on the
 Sidlaw hills of blocks derived from the Grampians. He is of opinion
 that the agency of ice moving upon dry land may account for many
 appearances which are inexplicable on any other hypothesis, and that
 this theory must not be rejected because it fails to remove at once
 every obscurity; especially as various other geological causes, such
 as oscillations of level in the land, the temporary submergence of
portions of it during the supposed glacial period, and the action of
 drift-ice, may        all
                      have co-operated with glaciers        produce the boul

situated eleven degrees further           the south, can present but

of  Scotland might present an island “almost wholly covered with
everlasting snow," having each bay terminated by ice-cliffs, from
which great masses yearly detached would transport fragments of
rocks to distant regions; and infers, that as in other parts of the
world there are conditions in which ice becomes a motive power,
such conditions may also have existed in our latitudes.
   Mr. Murchison has also proposed to explain the dispersion of
erratic blocks now resting on beds of clay and sand containing recent
species of arctic shells over large districts in the interior of Russia,
by supposing “that they had been floated in icebergs, which break
ing loose from ancient glaciers in Lapland and the adjacent tracts,
were drifted southwards into seas which have been since laid dry."
He further suggests, that icebergs loaded with detritus may, by grating
upon the bottom of these seas, have produced the parallel striae and
polished surfaces on the rocks over which they were drifted; and con
cludes with admitting so much of the glacial theory as to allow that
in former days glaciers probably advanced further to the south, and
occupied many insulated tracts, and to a much greater extent than
at the present day.

ary Geology (August 1st, 1840), that parallel striae and furrows,

of this kind that have come under my observation, the surfaces                             have
 only been cut off transversely and ground smooth, like the shores
 of the present seas; but they have no such parallel striae as those
 which are of general occurrence beneath diluvium or drift"; nor
 have large erratic blocks from distant regions been found mixed with
the gravel of any of the older conglomerate rocks.
   One great cause of the difference of opinion between the dilu
vialists and the glacialists, is the exclusiveness with which each
party would insist upon the agency of the cause which they respect
ively adopt: the diluvialist apparently errs in refusing to admit the
agency of glaciers in mountain valleys that are below the existing
limits of ice and snow; whilst Agassiz may have erred in urging too
far his theory of expansion as the great locomotive power of glaciers
over regions whose surface is too little inclined to admit their pro
gression by the force of gravity; a middle way between these two
extreme opinions will probably be found in the hypothesis, that large
portions of the northern hemisphere which now enjoy a temperate
climate have at no very distant time been so much colder than they
are at present, that the mountains of Scotland, Cumberland, and
North Wales, with great part of Scandinavia and North America,
were within the limits of perpetual snow accompanied by glaciers;
and that the melting of this ice and snow was accompanied by
great debacles and inundations which drifted the glaciers with their
load of detritus into warmer regions, where this load was deposited
and re-arranged by currents at vast distances from the rocks in
which it had       its
                   origin.   The contest will probably         settled,   be               as   in
most cases        extreme opinions and exclusive theories, by
                  of                                                      com          a

     About this time he was much interested in the discovery of large

years  Mr. Bright undertook the special care and superintendence
of this machine. The results of this register were peculiarly valuable
in establishing the diurnal variation of the tides. When a machine
of   much superior construction was, after the lapse of three years,
erected at the Hotwells, the original gauge at Ham Green became
useless, and was removed.          The new gauge is under Mr. Bunt's im
mediate care in       operation   as it was in construction, and his unre
mitting observations have already been rewarded by experimental
proof of a very important general law, so recently announced, that
it is possible I may be the first to give the intelligence to many of
those who hear me, viz. that the variations of atmospheric pressure,
as indicated by the barometer, exert a regular and very considerable
influence on the height of high water in the Avon; an increase of
atmospheric pressure, by which the mercury was raised one inch,
producing a depression of fourteen inches in the height of the
Water.

unaware          of

unjustly the earlier geologists have been charged with too great in
clination     depart from the ordinary laws
                 to                              nature: “In     specu    of                         all

                               of                      observation has               or
brought within the sphere           our knowledge.”  of     remarkable                It   is

    he says, “may be formed in the stratifications of a mountain, as
    well as in a chemist's laboratory.”
        His treatise ends with two chapters on the probable effects of the
    decomposition of different classes of rocks on the nature and ferti
    lity of soils; being an attempt to apply geology to agriculture. He
    is the father of American, much more than Smith is of English,
    geology; and American geology is especially important, because in
    America and in Russia we have two of the largest classes of forma
    tions, the Silurian and Carboniferous, developed at the distance of
    half an hemisphere. We may, with good cause, congratulate our
    selves that this comparison will shortly be consummated by the
a   distinguished author of the “Silurian System, whom we have this day
    elected to be our President for the ensuing year.
       In 1822 Mr. Maclure published some speculative conjectures on
    the probable changes that may have taken place in the geology of

                   ON IODINE IN COMMERCIAL NITRIC ACID.
           LEMBERT      observes, that among the substances which render
       *the nitric acid of commerce impure, there is one which has not
been hitherto suspected, but which is not unimportant, namely, io
dine. The following are the means by which its presence was de
monstrated, for the first time, in purifying nitric acid: in order to ob
tain pure concentrated nitric acid, M. Lembert takes the nitric acid
of commerce, adds nitrate of silver to           and allows it,       remain for             it   to
some days; then pours off the clear acid, adds           equal weight       con
                                                                           an                                of
centrated sulphuric acid, and distils the mixture.           On one occasion
in  concentrating the sulphuric acid remaining                 the retort, and       in
when this was nearly completed, violet vapours appeared, and after
wards crystals           of
                     iodine were formed         the tube used
                                                           in            refrige                   as   a

  The reaction is represented by the following equation:
      2 Br K + 5 Br 4- Ph 4-6 HO = PHO3, KO-H-6Br H.
When bromine is replaced by iodine, and the alkaline bromide by
the iodide, an abundant and regular disengagement of hydriodic
acid is obtained:                 it is requisite merely to raise the temperature
slightly.—Ibid.

named Mosandrite by Erdmann after Mosander, the discoverer of
lantanum.     It is a silicate and titanite of oxide of cerium and lan
tanum.     It is sparingly found on Lammanskarett, accompanied by
albite, aegirine, titaniate of iron, and violet-coloured fluor spar. It is
partly crystallized in flat obscure prisms, partly compact, with a dis
position to a columnar separation.        It has one distinct and several
indistinct cleavages; the first has a glassy and waxy lustre, the latter
a resinous lustre. The colour is dark reddish brown, in thin splinters
a transparent bright red; gives a grayish brown powder, and is as hard
as fluor spar; specific gravity 2-93

                                          2.98. Before the blowpipe gives
out much            which has neither an acid nor alkaline reaction.
On heating it becomes of a red yellow colour, easily fuses before
the blowpipe with intumescence into a brownish green shining bead;
is easily dissolved in borax, giving an amethystine-coloured bead,
which in the reducing flame is yellow, quickly becoming colourless.
It is more difficultly soluble in salt of phosphorus, leaving a residue
of silica. In the reducing flame it imparts to the glass the colour
of oxide of titanium. Produces with soda on platina a green colour.
Mosandrite is entirely decomposed by hydrochloric acid, leaving the
silica undissolved; when heated, chlorine is given off, and the colour
of the solution changes from dark red to yellow. The quantities
of the component parts are not yet determined; they consist of silica,
titanic acid, oxide of cerium and lantanum, oxide of manganese,
lime, a little magnesia, and potash and water.         It consists princi
pally of the four first ingredients.

                                   MR. LONSDALE.
    We regret to hear that the Geological Society of London will
shortly be deprived of the services of their invaluable Curator and
Librarian, Mr. Lonsdale.              Intimately connected as we have been for
many years with this Society, we can well appreciate the sorrow
which this announcement has caused to all the members,                                 who
thoroughly estimate the high qualities of this eminent person, and
entertain the deepest gratitude for the devotion and unrivalled skill
with which he has, during the last thirteen years, arranged their
collections and conducted the publication of their volumes. Mr.
Lonsdale's retirement, we are grieved to say, is occasioned solely by
the state of his health : and to this notice of the loss which the
Geological Society is very soon to suffer, we shall only add our
hope, that a naturalist and man of letters may be found competent
to succeed him as editor of the Geological Transactions*.
    * Upon this subject we believe that application may be made to the                 Pre
sident and Council of the Society at Somerset House.

LXXVIII.        On a Re-arrangement of the Molecules of a Body
      after Solidification. By Robert WARINGtoN, Esq.”
       AVING     occasion lately to prepare some alloys of lead
       for the purpose of lecture illustration, I was much sur
prised at an alteration taking place in the arrangement of the
particles of one of these alloys, as shown by the appearance
of the surfaces of fracture after the metal had assumed the
solid form. The alloy experimented on was that known as
Newton's fusible metal, composed of 8 parts of bismuth, 5 of
lead, and 3 of tin. On pouring this alloy in the melted state
on a marble slab, and breaking it as soon as solid, and when
it may be readily handled, the exposed surfaces were found
to exhibit a bright, smooth, or conchoidal metallic appear
ance, of a tin-white lustre; and the act of disjunction at one part
will, frequently, cause the whole to          into   number     fly
                                                                 frag         a                       of

588   Mr. Warington         on a Re-arrangement                   of the Molecules, &c.
communicates itself to the surface before the fixing and cool
ing.”. The alteration in the internal arrangement of the par
ticles, as proved by the surfaces of fracture, is not however
noticed, and the explanation is defective, as it supposes the
interior not to have assumed the solid state until the evolution
of the heat occurs. If such were the case it would be seen on
breaking it in the first instance. The phaenomena can only
be accounted for by admitting a certain degree of mobility
among the particles, and that a second molecular arrange
ment takes place after the metal has solidified; this may arise
from their not having assumed in the first state that direction
in which their cohesion was the strongest.
    That a very marked and extraordinary alteration in the
characters and properties of various substances arises entirely
from this change in the position of their component particles,
effected either by the communication or abstraction of heat after
solidification, there can be no doubt. And these changes are
applied to many very important purposes in the arts and ma
nufactures; such as the hardening and tempering of steel, the
rolling of commercial zinc, and rendering that metal perma
nently malleable, the annealing of glass, and a variety of other
uses, particularly in crystallization, which might be adduced.
    The following experiments were made to ascertain to what
extent the emission of latent heat takes place. The melted
alloy was poured in a perfectly fluid state on the bulb of a
thermometer placed in a small platinum crucible, having a
capacity equal to about 70 grain measures of water, and stand
 ing in a vessel of cold water or mercury.      The thermometer
 surrounded by the solidified metal and crucible was removed
 from the cooling medium before it had reached         stationary              its
 point, and the greatest decrease              of
                                        temperature noted. The
 heat then rose rapidly again, and the maximum effect was
 registered.    The fusing point               of
                                       the alloy was 202° Fahr.
 the following  results were obtained:—

   In a platinum crucible of larger size the effects were not so
marked, 34° Fahr. being the greatest difference obtained;
this of course would arise from the greater bulk of the melted
metal not exposing comparatively so large a surface to the
cooling medium.
LXXIX.        On the Constitution of the Sulphates as illustrated
    by late Thermometrical Researches.   By Thomas GRAHAM,
    Esq., F.R.S., &c. *
     ROF.    Hess and Dr. Andrews both apply the results of
      their late inquiries respecting the heat evolved in combina
tion+ to test the accuracy of a view of the constitution of dou
ble and acid salts which was published by myself, and arrive,
it is remarkable, at opposite conclusions.
   The view in question, I may first state, taking the example
of double and acid sulphates. Crystallized sulphate of magne
sia, and the double sulphate of magnesia and potash,         have         I
represented thus:–
                MgO, SO, (H O) + 6 H O,
                MgO, SO, (KO, SO) + 6 H O;
considering the latter salt to be derived from the former, by
the substitution of sulphate of potash for that single atom of
water, which is found to be much more strongly attached to
the sulphate of magnesia than the other six. This atom of
water, which is not basic water, was formerly named saline
water, to indicate that it is replaceable by a salt;    presence   its
being considered       provision
                         a            sulphate
                                          in             of
                                                    magnesia for
the formation       of
                    double salts.    The water and sulphate                    of
potash are therefore looked upon          equivalent
                                               as       the con    in
struction      of
              the two salts;  and the substitution            of
                                                      the salt for
the water might therefore          reasonably expected
                                     be                     occur        to
without the evolution of heat.
     In
      accordance with that statement, Dr. Andrews finds that
no heat evolved
          is          in on
                      mixing solutions          of
                                          sulphates    magnesia  of
and  potash,  nor    the formation      any    of
                                             other double salt.
On repeating the experiment found also
                                    I                  no
                                               heat nor change
of temperature      on
                   mixing the solutions, although     change     a             of
gºth   of adegree Fahr. would have been distinctly indicated
by  my thermometer.
   Possibly, however, the double salt may not immediately                      be
formed, and hence          no
                       change          of
                                   temperature              at

sulphuric acid being converted into bisulphate, while the other
portion is diluted by the displaced water of the first portion,
and thus heat evolved.
   On performing the direct experiment, which M. Hess ap
pears to have neglected, using a saturated solution of sulphate
of ammonia, and sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1-256,                                               I
obtained, on mixing, 5.4° of cold instead of any heat. But
on diluting the sulphate of ammonia with a volume of water
equal to that of the dilute acid, a fall of 1-12° occurred. De
ducting this from the former, there remains a fall of 3.88° due
to the combination of the two salts, sulphate of water with
sulphate of ammonia.       But this may be explained. The                                             bi
sulphate of ammonia formed is an anhydrous salt, unlike the
double sulphate of magnesia and ammonia, which carries along
with it     all

                       a                                           mag                       of

in the combining       this water with the sulphuric acid.

   In assigning the donation of the Wollaston Fund to                                        Mr. Morris,
the President thus expressed himself:—
     MR. MoRRIs,
   The Council of the Geological Society have awarded to you the
proceeds of the Wollaston Fund during the past year, to assist you
in preparing for publication a table of British Organic Remains, in
which you have been for some time engaged, and which, from the
specimens laid before us, we believe will be of very great service in
promoting the accurate study of Geology.      The value of the table
of the late Mr. Woodward has been acknowledged; but his prema
ture death having prevented him from enlarging                sphere      our     its                as
science   advanced,     new and much more
                          a                      comprehensive      work has
been urgently demanded.          am happy that the task
                                          I                     meeting our             of

diligent research and        competent acquaintance with Natural His
                                a

                 in                                                       the                        of

ously, but expending       liberally upon the very fitting occasion which
                               it
your ability and research have called forth.
   To which Mr. Morris replied,—
    SIR,--I cannot sufficiently express my grateful thanks            the So                   to
ciety for the unexpected compliment that has this day been conferred

dicate the desiderata to be accomplished, must make himself master
of numerous foreign works. An active observer cannot well exe
cute such a task. On the other hand, if your President should simply
review the last year's proceedings of our own Society, he will but
poorly serve you, for our abstracts make you well acquainted with
the prominent facts and opinions of the authors. I will, therefore,
adopt a middle course, and without attempting a complete sketch of
the progress of geology, or tiring you with a dry analysis of our
performances, permit me to select for your consideration what con                                     I
sider to be the chief subjects of present geological interest, whether
foreign or British, and so class them that their bearing upon the
advance of our science may at once be seized.           in so doing                 If                         I
should fail to illustrate points which some of you may consider to
be better suited to this address than those which I bring before you,
I trust you will recollect how brief is the season during which                                                I
have been able to detach myself from my own line of inquiry, and
how imperfectly, therefore, I have been able to study the works of
my contemporaries.
                               OBITUARY.
   Before we enter upon the consideration of the progress of geo
logy, let us pay our homage to the memory of those deceased Fel
lows who laboured to promote our science.
   On this occasion we have to mourn over one whose genius has
won for himself an imperishable name.       By the purest feeling of
the beauties of nature, by the manly simplicity of his character, and
by his sterling good sense, CHANTREY was led to his peculiar excel
lences as an artist.     Admiring him for his unrivalled excellence in
art, we geologists loved him also for the endearing qualities of the

   Sir Francis Chantrey was a member of our Council, a frequent
attendant both at our social meetings and in the rooms of the

 bias of his mind shines forth in his splendid bequest to the Royal
 Academy.        Persuaded (from whatever cause arising) that art is not
 appropriately encouraged in our country, he has decreed that Bri
 tish genius shall no longer droop for want of enlightened assistance.
 His munificent endowment of native art is Chantrey's proudest monu
 ment, and must, indeed, produce effects far beyond the portals of
 our national gallery.        But whatever may be the ultimate effect of
 this patriotic bequest, we must gratefully admire the spirit which

honourably associated with that of the early school of Scottish mine
ralogists. Every geologist who has had occasion to visit the West of
Scotland, found in his house a hearty welcome, and in his beautiful
museum much instruction respecting the vast variety of simple mine
rals in which that region abounds.             At the meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Glasgow, he
filled the office of one of the local secretaries, on which occasion he
was untiring in his exertions, and unbounded in his hospitality, whilst
 he was of signal use in cementing the bonds of kind feeling between
 his countrymen and the men of science who came among them as
 visitors.     Having been informed that Mr. Edington's minerals must
 be disposed of, I beg to express my hope that a collection so choice,
 and so highly esteemed by mineralogists, may find some enlightened
 purchaser worthy of          its
                                contents.

     It   was long after a true principle  of classification, founded on the
succession of     organic   life,  had been applied to the tertiary and
secondary rocks, that the same method was used to work out the
order of the oldest strata in which the remains of animals have been
discovered.      My own efforts, directed for several years to this end,
have been so distinctly recognized by those whom I now address,
as establishing a step by which the relative age of the older fossili
ferous strata has been subsequently developed, that I ought to apolo
gise for offering, on this occasion, even the shortest historical sketch
of the process by which we have arrived at our present palaeozoic
classification.     Some statement seems, however, to be called for,
now that the      subject  is passing into many hands and into various
countries.     Having    satisfied myself, after a labour of eight years,
that I had amassed                      all

facts which pointed to the same conclusions. In a part of Cumber
land, Mr. James Marshall had established the presence of Silurian
deposits, where it was formerly supposed still older rocks prevailed.

shown us that                all

  552       Geological Society: Anniversary Address, 1842.
   do justice to one of our own countrymen, Mr. Austen, the value
   of whose researches in Devonshire you have had previous oppor
  tunities of estimating.       I have recently seen a MS. table prepared
   some time since     by   this able geologist, but the use of which he
   has  liberally granted  to Mr. Morris, who is preparing that general
  synoptical view of British organic remains, the publication of which
  you have resolved to encourage".
      In remote countries, the palaeozoic classification of Silurian, De
  vonian, and Carboniferous types has been extended, by my com
  panions and myself, from Russia in Europe into Asia, and, may I
  add, that an inspection of some fossils of the far-distant Altai leads
  me to conclude that the examination of that chain will afford the
  same results?      Though our own naturalists have not yet penetrated
  to  Pekin,  the Russian Major of Engineers, Kovanko, has acquainted
  us with the existence of an extensive coal-field not far from that
  metropolist; and if time and the wear and tear of life permit, I
  despair not of planting the Silurian standard on the wall of China,
 by approaching it through the country of our old allies.
     Again, Southern Africa and the South Seas have afforded their
 quota of Silurian fossils, but above                           all
                                              other foreign countries, North
 America appears              rich
                               to    be

                                                    in            Of this fact
                                                                  of

in the Geological Society of London”.
    In estimating the progress of inquiry in this department of
geology in our own country, the recent work of Professor Phillips
upon the Palaeozoic fossils of Devonshire and the adjacent tracts
claims our special attention, not only on account of the talent
which he has shown in describing many new forms, but also on ac
count of the classification which he suggests. We are already sig
nally indebted to this author for inquiries in various departments of
geology, and especially for his volume upon the organic remains of
 the Carboniferous Limestone.          Without the previous existence of
 that  work,  there  might   have been some difficulty in asserting that
 the Silurian        is,whole,

life                            of Saurians is to be taken as the limit
       as the earliest appearance
of one vast geological division, we must exclude the magnesian lime
tone from the older series, and Mr. Phillips's proposed extension of
the term Palaeozoic cannot be sustained. Adopting this principle of
the vertebrata as our guide, we may go on to say, that the true Silu
rian type ceases in the ascending order at that band of rocks which,
in truth, forms the very uppermost layer or summit of the Silurian
strata, in which the lowest order of vertebrata or fishes first appear,
and then having ascended through another vast series, loaded with
peculiar ichthyolites, we may announce a new aera in the magnesian
limestone or zechstein, where we meet in the Saurians with another
and higher class of the animal kingdom, wholly unknown in the                                                 in
ferior beds.       It was, I beg to say, on this principle that I formerly
proposed to divide the strata of England into seven great systems,
 as expressed in the small map of England which accompanies the
 map of the Silurian region.          I do not assert that this general classi
 fication of the British geological series should be preferred to that
 of Mr. Phillips. He may contend that the universally distributed
 mollusk affords a more useful horizon line than any class of the
 higher order of animals.                   I
                                    merely state the case, and hope fairly,              I
 to show that whether geographical terms be ultimately adhered to
 or rejected,        all
                     nomenclature founded solely upon our present know
 ledge    of  the distribution         animal and vegetable life, must

                                         such hypothesis, but         simply based   is

 name for the types he had worked out, will not permit the labours
 of his friend to be submerged, and thus seem to convey to foreign
geologists the idea, which is indeed far removed from the truth, that
 there are any real differences between his views and my own on this
important subject.                                           I
                       In terminating these considerations, beg geo
logists to recollect, that  I never entertained the idea that the local
types around Ludlow and Wenlock would be found applicable in
detail to strata of the same age in distant places; on the contrary,
having shown that even within a very limited radius such subdivi
sions varied with varying conditions, it was a leading and constant
object of my work, to demonstrate that the broad divisions of Upper
and Lower Silurian alone, could be maintained as terms of distant
and foreign comparison.
   There are two short communications by Mr. Lyell on the older
rocks to be noticed. The first is on the strata between Aymestry
and Wenlock, in which he dwells on the assistance to be derived
respecting the amount of dislocation in strata, by attentively no
ticing the deviation from a vertical position of the inclosed corals;
but he adds that great caution should be used to distinguish between
those specimens which may have been torn from their position with
reference to the horizon while growing and inverted, and those which
have lost their original mode of growth by subsequent dislocation of
the strata. From the known habits of recent corals, Mr. Lyell also
infers that the Silurian strata must have undergone successive de
pressions during their accumulation, as beds of Polyparia belonging
to the Wenlock limestone are overlaid by many hundred feet of
sedimentary matter. In the second communication Mr. Lyell offers
some remarks on a series of fossils from the neighbourhood of Chris
tiania, and he infers from the evidence they afford, that the lime
stone to which they belong is of the age of the Lower Silurian rocks;
and on similar grounds he places the limestone of the island of Lan
goen, one of the highest beds of the country, in an intermediate
position between the upper and lower Silurian rocks, constituting
a passage from the one to the other.
   The last memoir which has been read before us on the British
Palaeozoic rocks, relates to their development in a part of West
moreland, and is from the pen of Mr. D. Sharpe; and I rejoice to
see so clear and systematic a workman enlisted in the survey of the
older rocks.    Agreeing on some essential points with Professor
Sedgwick and Mr. James Marshall, particularly in reference to the
superior and inferior limits of the Upper Silurian group, this author,
who had previously made himself acquainted with the best types of
the Silurian rocks, conveys to us additional details of this interesting
tract, in which he has distinguished upon a map the Upper Ludlow
rocks, as characterized by many fossils, from an inferior slaty for
mation which lies between them and calcareous bands charged with
Lower Silurian fossils. Dividing this intermediate formation into
three sub-groups (by only mineral characters however), he gives to
the whole the local name of “Windermere Rocks,”—a term which
I  understand he only uses until by the discovery of fossil evidences

558            Geological Society: Anniversary Address, 1842.
he may be able to refer these beds to their proper Silurian equiva
 lent.    If I were allowed to judge from the experience of one visit
 to a    part  of the country described by Mr. Sharpe, in which I
 found Orthoceratites in mountains marked by him as “Winder
 mere Rocks,” and also from his own showing, that these rocks are
 included between types of the higher portions of the Upper and
 Lower Silurian strata, such intermediate formation must be on the
 parallel of the Wenlock strata, which in many parts of the Silurian
 region, as well as in the North of England—(i. e. wherever the
 subdividing limestone and fossils are suppressed) can only be recog
 nized under the general term of lower members of the “Upper Silu
 rian Rocks.” As Mr. Sharpe proposes to revisit the country, and
 to extend his researches from Westmoreland into Lancashire and
 Furness, he will have ample opportunity of confirming or rejecting
 my surmise.      In regard to that portion of the memoir which points
 out the existence of many faults and anticlinal lines, I am not pre
 pared to say to what extent they accord with the previous obser
 vations of the great geologist of the lake country, Professor Sedg
 wick, or of his precursor, Jonathan Otley.
   I  would now speak of a work which has recently appeared, entitled
 “The Old Red Sandstone, or New Walks in an Old Field.'                  From
 a  pretty accurate  acquaintance   with the tracts from which Mr. Miller
 has taken his title, I can assure you that the walks of this author
had been little trodden, and that his claims to originality are very
just. It is impossible to peruse his pages without delight in tracing
how the strong mind of Mr. Miller has enabled him to rise step by
 step from the stone quarry of his, and I may add my own, native
 county Ross-shire, to a place in literature and science which few
 reach, even with        all
                        the support derived from            an

or   without admiring the    ability  with which this unassisted observer
 first succeeded      putting together the dislocated fragments
                     in                                                     the         of

  Pursuing the inquiry in the ascending order, the long period
which is specially marked by the presence of gigantic reptiles is
now before us. It commences with the magnesian limestone (the
Zechstein and associated rocks), and terminates with the cretaceous
system. In this wide field Professor Owen has taken the lead as a
 palaeontologist, and will shortly lay before the world the results of
 his researches into the extinct Saurians of our island.                   Of this
 work I cannot      speak,  but from the        knowledge    we   possess  of Pro
 fessor Owen's consummate acquaintance with comparative anatomy,
 and of his wonderful ability in detecting the minutest character in
 masses of bones obscured by matrix and mutilated by accident, we
 may anticipate that this work will enjoy the proud distinction of
 becoming a text-book with every natural philosopher in every part
 of the world. The points of this great inquiry to which he has
 called our attention during the last year, are the teeth and ske
 letons of five species of his newly-formed genus Labyrinthodon,
 found in the new red sandstone of Warwick; the whole of which,

twenty-five years, he has so much enriched our science, and which
have obtained for his name so high a place in the volumes of the
great Cuvier, as to render any eulogium on my part superfluous.
Valuing as I do the arduous labours of a man, who, like Dr. Mantell,
has occupied the few leisure hours at his disposal, first in discover
ing, next in dissecting from their stony bed, and lastly in describing
the specimens; I am bound to observe that such merits deserve, as
they have obtained, the highest praise which working geologists, like
ourselves, can offer. In thus estimating, however, the value of Dr.
Mantell's researches, I must be permitted to say (and in the most
friendly spirit), that whilst I understand the propriety of the motive
which led him to communicate his last memoir on the Iguanodon
to the same Society to which he had addressed his first account of
that Saurian, I regret that he should not have communicated to our
selves other palaeontological memoirs, the consideration of which, I
must say, pertains particularly to the Society over which        preside.                   I

writings of the first mathematicians, physiologists, and chemists of
the age, so long will it maintain                 its

   bone-bed described by Mr. Strickland contains not only fishes, many
   of which are of new species, but also many shells, some of which are
   supposed to be of forms intermediate between those known in the lias
   and the keuper. In this case, therefore, we are probably in the same
   position as the inquirer into the Palaeozoic rocks, who stands upon
   the beds of passage from the Silurian into the Old Red or Devonian
   rocks before adverted to. In both cases, when he finds forms which
   belong to the inferior and superior systems, whether he may draw
   his boundary line above or below these equivocal strata, seems at
   first to be of small importance; for, as with the progress of research,
   we must expect to find an infinite number of strata which contain
   fossils indicating a transition from lower to higher formations, so
   must the lines of separation which geologists set up between forma
   tions be liable to undergo small alterations.    Adhering, however, to
   the belief, that in the sequel those limits will most prevail which are
   most made to depend on great changes in animal economy, I think
  that the conclusion of Sir Philip Egerton, as based on the existence
  of the fishes with heterocerque tails, must lead us to place the “bone
  bed” as the uppermost limit of our New Red System, or in other
  words, as the last-formed stratum in which such ichthyolites appear.
       A point connected with an important previous deduction has been
  determined by Mr. Strickland in a cutting of the Gloucester rail
  road.     The period at which the Lickey trap rocks were erupted,
  is now proved by actual sections to be that which from colla
  teral circumstances had been surmised by myself. By observing
 that the New Red Sandstone of the Upper Lickey lies unconform
 ably upon a mass of Red Sandstone, Mr. Strickland has demon
 strated that the disturbance and elevation of the ridge took place
 after the deposit of the Lower New Red Sandstone, and anterior to
 the accumulation of the New Red, properly so called.          In this fact
 some geologists may see an additional reason for classing the Lower
 (New) Red Sandstone with the coal-measures, both having partaken
 of the same elevatory movements. Though such a consideration
 alone ought not to guide us in classification, the facts so recently
 put forward by Professor Sedgwick of the prevalence of plants of
 carboniferous species in this red sandstone, both in Cumberland and
 in Warwickshire”, and the similar data, which I ascertained in Staf
 fordshire, Shropshire, &c., may eventually lead us to consider all the
 sandstones beneath the magnesian limestone as naturally connected
 with the carboniferous aera, a view which my last researches in Rus
 sia have also led me to adopt. In this respect, indeed, the deposit
 agrees well with the rothe-todte-liegende of foreign authors, which,
like our Lower Red Sandstone, contains both carboniferous plants,
and occasional thin seams of coal.
      From Mr. Trimmer we have received an account of the true geo
logical position of the Cucullara decussata, verifying that which was
originally assigned to it by Mr. Webster, and confirming the just
ness of Mr. Parkinson's opinion, that the species is distinct from the

    An   important     addition to our knowledge of the relations of the
 Tertiary rocks of Europe proceeds from the pen of Mr. Lyell. On
 comparing the fossils of the Faluns of the Loire with those of the
 Cotentin, and again, by a comparison of both with the crag of Suf
 folk, Mr. Lyell has corrected a view which he had formerly adopted,
 that these deposits were not formed during the same epoch.                          By
an attentive examination of different tertiary localities in Normandy,
some of which seem to have escaped the notice of former obser
 vers, he has ascertained the existence of many of the true Suffolk
 crag fossils in deposits extending southwards as far as Sainteny.
 He then describes the Faluns, properly so called, at Dinan, Rennes,
 Nantes, Angers, Doué, Sevigné, and the tracts S. and S.E. of Tours,
in some of which the great abundance of corals and echinoderms,
and the small number of mollusks, present a perfect analogy to the
white or coralline crag of Suffolk, though the fauna is quite distinct
in species from the fauna of the coralline crag. From the existence
of a number of detached points of Faluns, Mr. Lyell infers that a
large part of France, now drained by the Loire and                                its
                                                                           tributaries,
was submerged during the Miocene period.                      Finally,       convinces he
himself that        allthe shells     of these French deposits belong               one        to
group, and that they are really contemporaneous with the crag                                        of
Suffolk, though there may             beshades               of
                                                       difference                in

our science is sure to profit from such a revision as our associate
will be enabled to present to us. He has indeed already given us
an earnest of his future communications, first in a letter to Dr. Fit
ton, on the older deposits in the state of Pennsylvania          and cites
evidences in one tract confirmatory of the theory of terrestrial and
lagoon origin of coal-beds, which was pointed out by Mr. Logan,
who, having led the way in this inquiry, is now extending it
in America.      Notwithstanding      the real value justly attached to
these views, which have been supported by the labours of Mr. De la
Beche, and which received an ample illustration in the last discourse
of Dr. Buckland, I must caution geologists against applying this
theory generally to               all

   When we consider the short period which has elapsed since these,
the very minutest secrets of our solid strata, have been revealed to us,
and by how few inquirers they have been studied, we may well admire
the results. At the same time, seeing the great difficulties attending
the study of these minute bodies, and the possibility that a certain
amount of error may arise from the examination of such of these
organisms as are imperfect under very high magnifying powers,                                                        I
quite coincide with your late President, that we ought not to adopt
too rapidly         all

                                 the microscopists, however we must
cordially thank them for the steps they are endeavouring                                                            to

568       Geological Society:    Anniversary Address, 1842.
directed by men of scientific discernment and zeal, who can well de
scribe and appreciate the value of such a collection.
     I
     rejoice in the formation of these provincial societies, being con
vinced that they will work out details of great ultimate value; and
whatever may be the objections to free trade among nations, I have
no hesitation in proclaiming the benefits of free trade in geology,
because I know that our own volumes have risen in value, and
our ranks have swelled in numbers, with the birth and growth of
our younger friends and rivals.
                  FOREIGN GEOLOGISTS-PRUSSIAN SCHOOL.
   Let us now consider the progress which our science has been re
cently making on the continent of Europe.
   The visit of the King of Prussia to our country upon the auspi
cious occasion arising out of the birth of our future Sovereign, was
marked by an event most gratifying to our feelings.     To testify to
His Majesty your sense of his gracious and warm patronage of the
cultivators of geology, and “to prove that Fnglish geologists can
never forget the deep obligations they owe to the land which has
produced a Humboldt, a Von Buch, and an Ehrenberg”,” you elected
His Majesty a Fellow of the Society. The condescension with which
His Majesty subscribed our obligation book, and the interest with
which He examined our collections within these walls, will be remem
bered by us with just pride.     Attended by the great philosophical
traveller whose researches have opened out the widest fields to the
inquirers in every department of Natural History, we who have drunk
at the fountains of knowledge poured forth by Humboldt, must in
deed rejoice in the day when our veteran associate appeared in our
halls as the chosen friend of the Prussian monarch.   Honour be to
the King who has the wisdom and discernment to attach such a man
to his person and his fortunes! Any effort of mine to do justice on
this occasion to the eminent services which Baron A. von Humboldt
has rendered to science, would be both presumptuous and misplaced;
but I must seize this opportunity to assure you, that if his valuable
life should be prolonged for a short term, the public will be fur
nished with convincing proofs that his brilliant mind can yet
confer on us the choicest gifts.         Let others more competent to
the task dwell on the     high merits of his inquiries into the distribu
tion of terrestrial  magnetism    and various branches of physical sci
ence which have       already  appeared,    or are nearly ready for the
press, in a stupendous work embracing nearly              all
                                                          natural know
ledge;    be   for us, however,
              it                     toestimate the skill with which       he
has developed, and the power with which         he  has applied the laws
of  climatology and physical geography     to  explain many problems       in
the earth's structure.
    Having myself been favoured with the perusal          of
                                                          some pages       of

tions to illustrate the memoir on the Rhenish provinces by Professor
Sedgwick and myself.        You must not, however, Gentlemen, judge
of the very high merits of the original from the reduced skeleton
map which we publish, and I beg you to consult the former as one
of the most valuable documents of this nature yet offered to the
public, particularly in the elaborate delineation of every variety of
 igneous, metalliferous, and metamorphic rocks, in a region so stri
 kingly replete with them. Silesia has also occupied much of the time
 of M. von Dechen, in some districts of which he has marked the
 existence of bands of carboniferous limestone as distinguished from
 the Devonian, Silurian, and older members of the palaeozoic series.
    Oeynhausen, the old associate of Von Dechen, and so well remem
 bered by many of us, has recently bored in search of salt springs
 through upwards of 1000 feet of lias near Pyrmont, a fact which
 ought to teach us great caution in estimating what may be the
 maximum thickness of deposits.          In our own country, the accu
 rate method which Mr. De la Beche employs to test the thick
 ness of deposits, will eventually give us, I trust, close approxima
 tions to the facts; and I learn from him that some of the ancient
 strata (the carboniferous for example) which have been accumu
 lated in basins are enormously more thick than we had supposed,
 whilst others extending, like the Old Red Sandstone, over wide
 areas in lofty escarpments, will not prove to have those dimensions
 we had assigned to them. When, indeed, we consider that                                       all
 shales, sandstones, &c. were once nothing more than the blue and
 black, and red mud,                or
                            sand which occupied the bottom         seas              of        in

  whole of these observations by a general transverse section from the
  sea of Azof to the Baltic. Although we carried with us into Russia,
 what may be called the geological key of that great country, by which
 the chief subdivisions and relations of these rock masses have been
 established, let me say that Russia herself contains naturalists and
 geologists who would rank high in any land.            In palaeontology,
 Eichwald and Pander have already largely contributed to our know
 ledge; the first, by numerous local works, and recently by his illus
 trations of the Silurian strata in the Baltic provinces of Russia; the
 latter, by his very original researches into the fossils of the same
 strata, the lithological characters and detailed relations of which
 were first given by our own Strangways. Professor Asmus of Dörpat
 is about to enrich us, as I have already stated, with a most curious
 and elaborate work on the fishes of the Old Red or Devonian system.
     The great steps, however, which Russia is now making in field
 geology and stratigraphical arrangement, are owing to the clear and
 well-defined view of this subject which has recently been adopted
 by the Imperial School of Mines at the suggestion of the energetic
chief of their staff, General Tcheffkine, who, under the orders of
the enlightened Minister, Count Cancrine, has taken the surest
means of advancing practical geology, and of rendering many
officers of his corps well acquainted with our subject; not only by
adopting the suggestions of those qualified to judge respecting the
formation of geological maps, but by so increasing the fossil collec
tions of the Imperial School of Mines, that it is now furnished with
 many illustrations of the sedimentary deposits of the empire, even
 from the remotest parts of the Altai and the countries bordering on
China. It will be my duty and pleasure very shortly to bring before
your notice the names of many officers of the Russian corps of Mines,
whose labours were of material use to myself and associates in our
distant explorations; but I cannot resist naming at once Colonel Hel
mersen, the inspector of the establishment, who whether he be viewed
as a physical geographer, a geologist, or as a writer, has rendered most
valuable service to Russia by his luminous and attractive descriptions
of the structure and outline of various parts of the empire, including
the most remote tracts. I beg also to refer you to the five published
volumes of the School of Mines, as works containing much excellent
matter, and highly creditable both to the government which pro
moted their publication, and to the officers whose memoirs they con
tain.
    In the mean time, besides what is doing on the Neva, a periodical
work on Russia has appeared at Berlin under the title of ‘Archiv für
Wissentschaftliche Künde von Russland, by the enterprising travel
ler A. Erman, of which two parts are published.       Together with va
rious memoirs on    physical geography,  history,  language,  antiquities,
and physics, the editor has added a sketch of the recent advances in
the geology of Russia, and illustrates his views by the publication of
a small outline map of the empire. In the estimate of the geological
steps in Russia which various labourers have accomplished, I rejoice
to see the name of our countryman Strangways placed where it ought

division of rocks, and they have distinguished the subdivisions                   by
conventional     signs,  in a similar manner to that        employed     in the map
of the Silurian region and Mr. Greenough's map of England. The
advantage of this certain method of showing the relations which
exist between the different parts of the same formation, is now
thoroughly recognised.
   Under the modest title of explanation of the map, the authors
will publish three quarto volumes, of which the first only has yet
appeared, and judging from this specimen we have a right to con
clude that they will form one of the most splendid and useful works
ever executed on the geology of a great country.                     In the intro
ductory chapter of the published volume the general principles of
the science are admirably given, and the succeeding chapters are
occupied by descriptions of the “Massif central de la France:
Presqu'ile de Bretagne, Ardennes : Vosges: Montagnes littorales du
Departement de Var: Terrains Houillers.”                   The authors have di
vided their descriptions into great geographical regions, beginning
with the most ancient formations; and I cannot resist expressing
how much pleasure it has given me to see that these eminent men
have adopted the divisions and nomenclature which have been
proposed for the palaeozoic rocks of England.                In the other volumes
the authors will describe the more recent formations, reserving for
the conclusion, the account of those parts of France where the ele
vated and dislocated sedimentary deposits present problems most
difficult of solution, and which continue to raise doubts in the
minds of the best and most experienced observers.                     In their de
scription of the rocks, the authors, faithful to what may be called
the “natural method,” have classed together                                 all
                                                               those which appear

the fossils of France in the order of the formations.    He has com
menced this vast undertaking by publishing during last year 139
plates, and upwards of 500 pages of text, on the Cephalopods of the
Chalk. It is only necessary to glance over the figures, to perceive
the care with which the different parts of the fossils are delineated.
I particularly recommend to your notice the new genera, named by
M. d'Orbigny “Ancyloceras” and “Toroceras,” and which added
to the “Crioceras,” recently introduced into the science, increase
that infinite variety of forms in which the great Ammonite family
expanded, previously to         total disappearance from the living

White Chalk; and he estimates that in this triple succession of de
posits, the Ammonites gradually decrease according to the numbers
seventy-five, forty-two, and twenty-seven, to disappear finally with
the uppermost chalk or Maestricht beds, and before the tertiary
epoch.
    The total number of determined species of Ammonites in the great
cretaceous system of France is 144, according to M. d’Orbigny, and
with the exception of three, which are common to the Gault and
the Upper Greensand,                     all
                              the other species are divisible into groups,

 the flanking and lower mountains, and even the strata                       which                      on               it

  posed into the lower countries.          M. Necker believes that when these
  ancient glaciers existed, the Alps were considerably higher than                                                       at

 of   Mont Blanc have been lowered very considerably                         our own                    in

great pre-existing diluvial deposit, which had been accumulated in
the radiating valleys during a period of great disturbance, anterior
to the existence of glaciers in that latitude.    Describing (like M.
Necker) one of these “trainées” as having a continuous length of
fifteen leagues, he infers that such a mass could never have been
deposited by a glacier proceeding from mountains of no greater alti
tude than the Alps. Arguing that glaciers are merely the condensed
or central portions of vast accumulations of snow, forced downwards
into the gorges by increasing volume from above, the chief novelty
of M. Godeffroy's work is contained in the opinion, that in advancing,
these bodies of ice cut through the ancient diluvium or drift, just
as a plough-share cleaves the soil (“presso tellus consurgit aratro”
being his motto), and threw up some portions into lateral moraines,
as well as pressed before them others to form terminal moraines.
To the crystalline and mechanical changes which the snow has
undergone in            its
                   passage into solid ice,   attributed much     isthe                           of

have obstructed the road-ways or passes of our ancestors. Thus is
the supposed anomaly explained without recurring to any change
of climate".
   In that part of our own country to which the glacial theory has
been applied, Mr. Charles Maclaren, already known to you by ex
cellent geological treatises, has recently published a well-condensed,
small work explaining the views of Agassiz.               The phaenomena of
glaciers and the general doctrines derived from their study being
explained, Mr. Maclaren proceeds to analyze those cases of trans
ported detritus in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh to which the
theory had been supposed to apply.
   A year and a half only has elapsed since Professor Agassiz and
Dr. Buckland seemed to think, that this district was as rich in
proofs of the action of glaciers as many other parts of Scotland
which they visited, and as I happened to witness the efforts of my
predecessor in this Chair to attach Mr. Maclaren to his views, I
must be permitted to direct your attention to the practical results
at which this gentleman has arrived, in some prominent cases.
   Observing blocks of greenstone on Arthur's Seat, which, from
their peculiar structure, must have been transported from Salisbury
Craigs, a lower hill, and separated from the former by an abrupt val
ley, Mr. Maclaren infers, that if the present surface of the land be
argued upon (and in                all
                              questions     glaciers thisof    postulate), nei        is

                                         The Glacial Theory.                                                     583
surfaces of the Braid Hills, first pointed out by Sir James Hall,
and which the great chemical geologist attributed to a powerful
rush of waters. When I visited the low ridge in question with Dr.
Buckland and other friends*, my conviction was that these grooves,
though then attributed by Dr. Buckland to glacial action, are due
neither to that agency, nor to any rush of waters, but are simply
the result of the changes which the mass of the rock underwent,
when it passed from                       its
                                 former molten                          or

uncovered surfaces of the schistose Silurian rocks, and shows satis

   Unlike Mr. Bowman, Dr. Buckland has not confined his views of
the action of glaciers to Scotland, but applies them largely to the
North of England and to Wales.               He has recently endeavoured to
satisfy us, that the rocks on the sides of the chief valleys in the lat
ter country which open out from a common centre of elevation are
striated, worn and polished in the direction of the present water
courses, and these he conceives to be evidences of former glaciers,
which filled up             all

blocks and boulders were transmitted.
    My own belief, Gentlemen,          you know, has been, that
                                                         as              far                                by
the greatest quantity                of
                             boulders, gravel, and clay distributed over

  far-transported materials. It was the association of these testacea
  with foreign blocks in the central counties of England which first
 led me to attach a new and substantial value to that view of glacial
 action which had been so well advocated by Mr. Lyell before Pro
 fessor Agassiz came forward with his great terrestrial and general
 theory.  I   am bound to say that wide researches during the last two
 years have strongly confirmed my early views".        I could not travel
 in the autumn of the year 1840 around the shores of the highlands
 of Scotland, without being convinced that the terrace upon terrace,
 presented on the sides of some of the great valleys, and often high
 upon the sea-ward hills of the bays opening out to the ocean, were
 nothing more than the bottoms of former seas and estuaries which
 had been successively desiccated.
   I   coincide, therefore, entirely with Mr. C. Darwin in his very in
 genious explanation of the probable formation of the parallel roads
 of Glen Roy (Phil. Trans., 1839, p. 39). Since then that excellent
 observer has borne out similar views in a paper read before our
 own Society.      In this memoir, estimating the different changes of
the sea and    land, and showing to what extent the solid strata were
depressed, whose relative histories he thus reads off, he traces the
shingle beds from the edge of the sea, where they are in process
of formation, to considerable heights inland; and estimating how
blocks were transported from the great Cordillera within, or not
long before the period of existing sea shells, he explains the far
transported boulders by their being carried to the spots where they
lie in vessels of ice. The melting of these icebergs he conceives to
have been the chief agent in forming such masses of clay, gravel,
and boulders, as constitute the “till" of Scotland, whilst the con
fusion and contortion of their imperfect strata is considered by him
to be necessarily due to the grounding of icebergs in the manner
formerly suggested by Mr. Lyell. To the same powerfully disturb
ing agent he attributes the general absence of organic remains in
these deposits; and, lastly, he infers that it is much more probable
that the great boulders were transported in icebergs detached from
glaciers on the coast, than imbedded in masses of ice produced by
the freezing of the sea.
    M. de Verneuil and myself had previously brought before you
some new results, arising from our first expedition to Russia.       We
endeavoured to show the utter inapplicability of the Alpine glacial
theory to vast regions of Northern Russia, though the surfaces of
the rocks are scored and polished, and far-travelled blocks occur
throughout a wide area in isolated groups, because much of this
detritus has travelled over extensive tracts of low country, from
which it has ascended to levels higher than the sources of           ori
                                                                   its
gin.     Hence we inferred, that the onward persistent march (in
many parts up-hill)   of a   body   ofglaciers, having    front
                                                             a    of

sea shells       of an arctic character, that the “terra firma” to which
some   of the blocks had been transported, had been the bed of the
Northern or glacial Sea at the period of this transport.        We then
attempted to explain how the parallel striae and polishing of the
surface of rocks of unequal altitudes was reconcileable with the
submarine action of ice, by supposing that ice floes and their de
tritus might be set in motion by the elevation of the Scandinavian
continent, and the consequent breaking up of great glaciers on the
northern shores of a sea which then covered          the flat regions            all                            of
Russia; and we further stated our belief, that the bottoms          these                             of
icebergs, extending      great depths, must have every here and there

stranded upon the highest and most uneven points             the bottom                      of

rock, the lower surface                of

glacier, would grate along and score and polish the subjacent mass;

submarine hills, and why (in Russia                            at

than half a mile from which the soundings were at 318 fathoms deep,
and upon a bed of blue soft mud. Here then the geologist is pre
sented with abundant matter for speculation. Volcanos in the midst
of eternal polar snow and glaciers, with seaward faces as wide as
some of the continental tracts, which, from the striae and polish on
their surface, and the wide dispersion of blocks and detritus, are sup
posed to have been affected by former terrestrial glacial action.
 Whilst, however, we have here the proof that existing glaciers ad
 vance some few miles into the sea, we are also informed that the ice
ceases suddenly against an ocean 2000 feet deep, and thus we are
 led to conclude that many glaciers, which may formerly have extend
ed themselves into the sea, had a length, the extent of which, whether
like this antarctic example, or those which have been measured
 in the Alps, was proportioned to the altitude of the ancient moun
 tains against which they rested. By the same reasoning we may
 infer that the striae and polish of rocks, or accumulation of coarse
detritus, and large blocks which are only to be observed in places
 far beyond the limits that are now established between mountains
and their dependent masses of ice, cannot be due to the advance of
former solid glaciers, but must rather be referred, as I have argued,
to the floating away of vast packs and icebergs liberated from cen
tres of congelation.
    But besides the submarine operations now in action, and which may
serve to explain most of our ancient phaenomena, it has been shown
that in Russia and other cold countries there are several actual sub
aerial processes, by which large blocks are accumulated at different
heights by the expansion of the ice of rivers, or have been piled up
by the glacial action of former lakes, when at much higher levels",
leaving lines of coarse angular blocks.
   I  desist, however, in this place from entering further into the many
features under which the existing agency of ice may be viewed apart
from the results of the movements of glaciers.         More than enough
has indeed     already  been said: for so    long as the greater number
of  practical  geologists of Europe   are opposed  to the wide extension
of a terrestrial glacial theory, there can be little risk that such doc
trine should take too deep a hold of the mind. But whilst we may
have no fear of this sort in Europe,       Ihave lately read with regret
certain passages in the Anniversary Discourse of Professor Hitch
cock of the United States. In North America, striated, scored, and
polished surfaces of rocks, proceeding from N. to S. for vast di
stances, occupy, it appears, at intervals a breadth of 2000 miles, and
are seen on hard rocks at       all levels from the sea-shore     heights
                                                                  to
of  3000 and 4000 feet.       Professor Hitchcock tells us, that these
phaenomena and the accumulations           of
                                           gravel and blocks had always

  monstrate what he now seems to believe, that the great mass of the
 continent of North America was formerly covered with ice, he must
 first prove that it was not at that period below the level of the sea;
 but as yet no facts are before us to lead us to doubt that the great
 accumulation of detritus and the transport of blocks did take place
 beneath the waters in that country.       In justice, however, to this
 author, it must be said, that in expounding the glacial theory he
 ingenuously acknowledges the great difficulty of believing that solid
 masses    of ice 3000 to 4000 feet thick, covered the whole region;
  that no action of a glacier will explain the persistent striation of the
  surface of an entire continent from N. to S., and that the direction
  of the boulders and the striae is to a great extent up-hill. When
  these and many other difficulties shall have been carefully weighed,
  our transatlantic friends may be disposed to modify their views, par
  ticularly when they find that the existence of glaciers in Scotland

                          The Glacial Theory.                       593
Buckland abandons, to a great extent, the theory of Agassiz, and
admits fully the effects of water as well as of ice, to account for
many of the long-disputed phaenomena.         Whilst this admission in
volves the concession for which we have been contending, viz. that
the great surfaces of our continents were immersed, and not above
the waters when by far the greater number of the phaenomena on
the surface of rocks was produced, I reject for those who entertain
the same opinions as myself, the simple division into “glacialists”
and “diluvialists,” into which Dr. Buckland has divided the com
batants on this question; for to whatever extent the former title
has been won by Agassiz and himself, we who have contended for
the submarine action of ice in former times, analogous to that which
we believe is going on at present, can never be merged with those
who, under the name of diluvialists, have contended for the rush of
mighty waves and waters over continents.        Besides glacialists and
diluvialists, my friend must therefore permit me to call for a third
class, the designation of which    I leave to him, in which some of us
desire to be enrolled who have advocated that modified view to
which the general opinion is now tending.
    The other point to which I allude, and bearing at once on this
view, is a discovery which our Librarian has just made without
quitting the apartments which he so truly adorns. In the Ameri
can Journal of Science for the year 1826, Mr. Lonsdale has de
tected a short, clear, and modest statement, entitled “Remarks on
Boulders, by Peter Dobson,” which, though little more than one
page in length, contains the essence of the modified glacial theory
at which we have arrived after so much debate. First describing
in a few lines the manner in which large boulders, weighing from
ten cwt. to fifteen tons, were dug out in clay and gravel, when
making the foundations for his own cotton factory at Vernon, and
seeing that it was not uncommon to find them worn, abraded, and
scratched on the lower side, “as if done (to use his own expression)
by their having been dragged over rocks and gravelly earth in one
steady position,” he adds this most remarkable sentence:—“I think
we cannot account for these appearances, unless we call in the aid of
ice as well as water, and that they have been worn by being suspended
and carried in ice over rocks and earth under water.” To show
also that he had read much and thought deeply on this subject,
Mr. Dobson quotes British authorities to prove, that as ice-floes
 constantly carry huge masses of stone, and deposit them at great
distances from their original situation, so may they explain the trans
portation of foreign boulders to our continents.
    Apologising therefore for having detained you long, and for
having previously too much extended a similar mode of reasoning,
I  take leave of the glacial theory in congratulating American science
in having possessed the original author of the best glacial theory,
 though his name had escaped notice; and in recommending to you
the terse argument of Peter Dobson, a previous acquaintance with
which might have saved volumes of disputation on both sides of
the Atlantic.

 transport of boulders, the striation and polish of rocks, and the ac
 cumulation of superficial detritus, we cannot quit the glacial subject
 without avowing our obligations to Venetz, Charpentier, and Agassiz,

                  the last, for having brought the agency

= evil; Leo = evil; Virgo = evil; Libra = good; Sagittarius

said to neutralize their influences.
   “In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Lon
don”, Dr. Ward has given an account of a date in Arabic numerals
found on a stone in Ireland, which he considered to belong to the
twelfth century. Professor Peacock, however, in his History of
Arithmetic, has ably confuted this conjecture.
    “The Liber Niger of Christ Church, Dublin,        is said to contain “a
curious treatise on arithmetic, exhibiting the state of that science
before the introduction of Arabic numeralst.’ I much question the
accuracy of this statement, and should be rather inclined to think
that it is merely an account of the numbers of algorism, so common
in manuscripts of this class. The same volume also contains a trans
cript of the French poetical treatise entitled Imago Mundi, one of
the most curious unpublished scientific tracts of the middle ages.
This latter treatise is now in the progress of publication, by the His
torical Society of Science.
   “But by far the most curious document that I have met with re
lating to the early science of Ireland, is a manuscript in the posses

After this  rule,  follow those of multiplication, division, and progres

in the old  arithmetic,   it may be necessary to state, that a digit is any
number below      ten,  an article is ten, or any multiple of ten, and that
all other numbers are composites, or composed of an article and
some digit. My friend Mr. Wright gives it as his opinion, that this

this Bissextile yere, 1612, composed with a three fould Kallender
generally calculated for this Kingdom of Ireland, and will also serve
very well for alle the Northe and Northweste partes of England.’
William Bourne also, who flourished at the same time, and greatly
distinguished himself by his mechanical inventions, was a native of
Ireland.    To these two we may add Nathaniel Carpenter, an Eng
lishman   by birth, but who resided in Dublin early in the seventeenth
century, and left behind him treatises on geography and optics.       A
copy of this latter work is still preserved in MS. in the Library of
 University College, Oxford".
    “With Molyneux, in more recent times, the science of Ireland
rose to a level with that of surrounding nations, and the names
Ponce, Boyle, Petty, and Ashe+, serve to fill the complement of the
seventeenth century. In January 1684, Molyneux suceeded in form
ing a Philosophical Society at Dublin, on the plan of the Royal
Society of London. The first meeting of the Society took place on the
28th of January 1684, when Sir William Petty was chosen Presi
dent, Dr. Charles Willoughby Director, and Molyneux undertook
the combined offices of Secretary and Treasurer.       November 1st,
All Saints' day, was chosen for the anniversary of the Society. On
the 1st of November, 1684, Sir William Petty was re-elected Presi
dent, Molyneux as Secretary, and William Pleydell, Esq., Treasurer.
On the 2nd of November, 1685, Lord Viscount Mountjoy was elect
ed President, George Tollet, Esq., Treasurer, and St. George Ashe
Secretary.    In this year Molyneux retired from actual office, but
retained his place on the Council of the Society.       On the 1st of
November, 1686, Lord Viscount Mountjoy was re-elected President,
George Tollet, Esq., Treasurer, and Edward Smyth, Secretary.
   “The preceding particulars are taken from the original Minute
book of the Society preserved in the British Museum, MS. Addit.
4811 t.    The last entry in this book is the account of the General
Meeting of 1686, and this would lead us to suppose that the Society
was dissolved at this period, although Dr. Hutton assures us, that it
was not broken up till 1688$.
   “From MS. Addit. 4812, it appears that in the year 1707, an
attempt was made to re-establish the Society, but its success was not
of any long duration, and this MS. contains a register of the philo
sophical papers read before the Society, from August 15th, 1707, to
March 11th, 1708. The Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, presided over the Society at this revival.
   “In 1686, Molyneux printed at Dublin his Sciothericum Telesco
pium, containing a description of the structure and use of a telescopic
dial invented by him.    In the British Museum is preserved the au
thor's own copy of this volume, enriched with numerous MS. notes

their history, more especially astronomy.
