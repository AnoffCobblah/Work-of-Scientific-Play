          the
               important subject of investigation in the chemistry
              ocean  is the nature and quantity of the atmospheric
gases dissolved in it.     These are extracted by boiling in name
in an apparatus recently described by acobsen     J  and at the end
                                                             'I',
of the operation are obtained hermetically sealed in glass tube,    a
in which they are capable of inde<U+FB01>nite preservation.      Although
it  would be absurd to waste time in making necessarily imper
fect analyses of valuable specimens at sea, which are capable of
being kept and analyzed with the greatest accuracy on shore, still
cases might occur during      three years’ voyage where
                                 a                         would be     it
very desirable to make an approximate analysis of specimen of       a
gas, not necessarily proceeding from sea-water, but, for instance,
from hot springs or volcanoes on shore.
    The <U+FB01>rst desideratum for such an apparatus for use on ship
board appeared to be freedom from           mercurial trough. All
                                                 a
existing apparatus, besides having this source of inconvenience,
were far too large and cumbrous to be at all suited to the modest
allowance of laboratory space available on board ship.        What
seemed to give most promise of success was in some way or
other to adapt the original Ure’s eudiometer to the purpose.
The form of apparatus <U+FB01>nally adopted           that represented in
                                                      is

and instructions, by Dr. Geissler, of Bonn ; and it is needless to
add that as a piece of glass workmanship it is a chef-d’wuvre.
   Before describing                   it,
                               may be as well to state the objects
                                         it
sought to be attained, when the motives in the design of the
various parts will be more apparent, and the measure in which
they ful<U+FB01>l their end more correctly appreciated.
    First of all, the size of the instrument must be reduced to                                    a
minimum       nor must its shape be so eccentric as to interfere with
               ;
its being packed into        reasonable space of symmetrical form.
                                        a
Again, when packed         must be safe against rolling, and be easily
                                   it
unpacked and mounted, and as easily dismounted and packed
away again.         wished further to be able to use eudiometrical as
                    I
well as absorptiometrlcal methods, using in the latter liquid re
agents.    The necessity for        special gas-analysis room had to
                                                a
be dispensed     with;  and,  as  before  mentioned, the use of   mer                     a
 curial trough was to be avoided.          The advantages secured                             it
 the peculiar way of packing, so that the case in which                                       is by
 packed when out of use forms its support, and            working tray       a
 for saving spilled mercury      when   in  use, were not contemplated
 from the beginning, but suggested themselves only after the
 glass work was <U+FB01>nished, as until then the form and size of the
 case could not be determined on.         It was made for me Messrs.              is by
 Kemp    and  Co.,  of Edinburgh       and   the workmanship
                                                    ;          in every
Way satisfactory.
   The apparatus consists essentially of two U-tubes.      The one,
which according to precedent we may call the “ laboratory tube,”
is wholly of glass the other (the eudiometer) has the legs of
                              ;

                  an india-rubber tube of suitable length.    These
are af<U+FB01>xed to mahogany boards            and    which <U+FB01>t into the

       Mr. J. Y. Buchanan      on an Apparatus  for   Gas-analysis.   3
    ‘Vhen in use the parts A and B are screwed to the back of one
wing of the box, A with one and B with two screws (x, .z', a").
The back of the box carries four nuts, so that A may be <U+FB01>xed to
it  close up to the end of the box and with the stopcock y pro
jecting over the side, leaving     a space between A and B, the ob
ject   of  which  will he explained further on.
     The different parts of the apparatus will be best explained by
 describing the manipulations occurring during the analysis of a
 gas as well as those necessary for introducing the gas into the
 apparatus. But <U+FB01>rst we must describe the capillary part of the
 apparatus between the eudiometer g and the laboratory tube m.
 The part belonging to A is shown separately in two sections,
 <U+FB01>gs. 2 and 3. The stopcock a has two tubes—the one a<U+FB01>'ord
 ing direct communication upwards between the two portions of
 the capillary tube shown in <U+FB01>g. 3, the other communicating
 through the prolongation of the stopcock with the air,' shown
 in <U+FB01>g. 2. b, c, and d are ordinary stopcocks pierced to the same
 bore as the tubes they connect.        The capillaries of A and B are
 connected by a piece of indie-rubber vacuum tubing.          This tube
 is 0003 metre diameter in the bore; and the thickness of its_
 walls is likewise 3 millimetres. The stopcock d communicates
 with the air through the cup e. Vl’hen the instrument has
 been set up as in <U+FB01>g. 1, it is <U+FB01>lled with mercury by pouring in
 at the open legs of A and B, all the stopcocks being open, so
  that <U+FB01>nally the mercury rises a little way up in the cup e. The
  apparatus being full of mercury, the gas to be analyzed is intro
  duced into it either through the opening, 7, ofthe stopcock a, or,
                                                              f
  if it is contained in a sealed tube, by interposing it at between
  the two parts A and B, A being for that purpose shifted to the
  further end of the box, and the two ends of the tube in which
  the gas is collected connected by vacuum-tubing, <U+FB01>lled with
  mercury, with the ends of the capillaries of A and B. The pres
  sure in one side of the apparatusis now reduced, either by
  running mercury from A by means of the stopcock y, or by
  lowering the movable leg p of B. When the points of the tube
  are broken the gas rushes into the parts of the apparatus where
  the pressure is least, its place being supplied by mercury from
  the other side. The stopcocks are then closed, the tube full of
  mercury removed, the parts A and B reunited byf, and the ana
  lysis proceeded with. When the gas is to be admitted throughv
  a, an india-rubber tube is connected at 7 and <U+FB01>lled with mercury
  by opening a, as in <U+FB01>g. 2, and running mercury through it.
 The point of the collecting-tube, having previously been touched
  with the <U+FB01>le, is pushed into the india-rubber tube; the other end
  having also receiVed a stroke of the <U+FB01>le, is immersed in a cylin
  der full of mercury and the lower point broken o<U+FB02>" against the

bottom. The mercury immediately rises in the tube; and by
supplying its place in the cylinder and reducing the pressure in
A or B, as the case may be, the whole or part of the gas may
be transferred to the instrument.       Of course in all these cases
the indie-rubber    tubes  must be  moistened   inside with solution
of corrosive sublimatc.
    The gas, having been introduced in one way or the other, is
brought all into the eudiometer q, mercury being allowed to run
over from A into q until the whole capillary part, down to where
it joins the eudiometer at g, is full of mercury.        q is a short
eudiometer with a scale of only six divisions, like the measuring
tube in Frankland’s apparatus*.        It is immersed in the cylinder
   which    <U+FB01>lled with water.     The legp      divided into millime

             Electrodes in the Galvanic Arc of Light.                7
character; and it is just this series which has led to extraordi
narily surprising results.   Grove placed in the arc of light a
positive electrode of zinc over against a negative one of platinum,
and in his experiments took into consideration only the disinte
gration which took place at the former.     Now this zinc electrode
was of such dimensions, and the intensity of the current so regu
lated, that the air should not occasion combustion of the massive
electrode, but only of the <U+FB01>ne particles thrown o<U+FB02>' from it.    The
air present was an isolated quantity; and thus the amount of
zinc thrown 011' could be calculated from the oxygen consumed,
provided that all the disintegrated zinc, and this only, was oxi
dized. Grove believed that now every thing had been approxi
mately <U+FB01>tted to the conditions of this experiment, and concluded
 from his results (which did not differ excessively from one an
other) that the quantity of zinc disintegrated was equivalent to
that of the hydrogen occurring in a simultaneously inserted vol
tameter.
   The supposition herein expressed, of a surprising connexion
between disintegration and electrolysis, has not, to my know
ledge, been followed up by other investigators.       Indeed the dif<U+FB01>
culty  of satisfying, even  in some   measure,  the  conditions   which
Grove sought to realize in his experiment is extraordinarily great ;
and this circumstance may very well have prevented the repetition
of the experiments, as it seems adapted not to permit too much
reliance on his data. It must further be said that the idea which
Grove pursued in these experiments rested on erroneous assump
tions.    Namely, Grove thought that, if the electricity of the
current could only effect its passage between the electrodes in
combination with electrode-substance, then the quantity of elec
tricity corresponding to a de<U+FB01>nite current-intensity would pro
bably always determine the transport of a de<U+FB01>nite quantity of
substance of the electrodes.      But, leaving altogether out of con
sideration the decided improbability of the law of condition
herein contained, the electrode-substance        thrown off and that
transported betWeen the electrodes are quantitatively quite dif
ferent. Van Breda’s experiments have shown, and it will like
wise be found in what follows, that only a portion of the disinte
 grated substance takes the path to the opposite electrode, while
 another portion <U+FB02>ies about in all directions.          Grove’ s experi
 ments, however,    are independent   of this point  of  view; for they
would indeed express the quantity, not of the transported, but
of the disintegrated zinc.
    Independently, therefore, of the reason which induced him to
 make his experiment, it remains an open question whether there
does not exist a simple connexion between_the quantity of active
electricity (that is, the intensity of the current) and the quantity

of particles subjected to the action of disintegration, perhaps as
signi<U+FB01>ed by Grove’s experiment.           Only it would be desirable to
approach this question less indirectly and under the necessity of
observing fewer conditions.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, it seems requisite to produce the luminous
arc in a medium not chemically proportioned, between two che
mically different electrodes, and by weighing and quantitative
analysis of the electrodes to be clear about the amount of disin
tegration.     The loss of weight of an electrode during an experi
ment, increased by the quantity of foreign metal taken up by                        it,
would express the amount of substance which               has thrown off.

I  took some pains to make experiments of this kind in hydrogen
gas; but, with the battery        I  employed (5O Grove’s elements of
the usual size), only     a   very imperfect arc of light was obtained
in hydrogen, and     I    did not arrive at any very exact results.
    I  therefore replaced the hydrogen surrounding of the elec
trodes   by  as nearly perfect     a vacuum as possible, in which the
arc is  obtained with decidedly greater facility.         The electrodes,
screwed upon strong iron rods, were led through two large caout
chouc stoppers, which tightly closed the two ends of               strong   a
 cylinder such as    is   used for lamps.    A glass tube with       glass  a
cock was also passed through one of the corks, and, for the pur
 pose of exhausting the cylinder, was connected with             Geissler
                                                                        a
air-pump.       The   air  in  the cylinder was  thus  reduced  to    or        1   2
 millims. pressure.        The electrodes were placed at an average
 distance of    1 millim.     At the commencement         introduced the

jar. Meanwhile       it  appeared that the operation could be as well
performed       by
                 taking advantage of the elasticity of the caontchouc
and bringing the electrodes together              bymomentary pressure

with the hands. They spring asunder again immediately, before
a  perceptible quantity of hydrogen         developed in the voltameter
                                             is
through which the current simultaneously passes; and thus the
 bright arc   is instantly formed with the <U+FB01>ne metallic dust <U+FB02>ying
in all directions towards the sides of the cylinder. This spirting
of metallic dust-particles (which, as said, directly commences)                     is
 characteristic for this, that the are constitutes the only interme
 diuin between the in every other respect separated electrodes,
and therefore proceeds in the manner desired.
  There    is series of metals which show themselves the least
                a

one, from which, with somewhat continued action of the cur

rent, large portions readily melt o<U+FB01>‘ and s0 render dif<U+FB01>cult the
determination of the quantities really separated in dust.   thus            It

On this account I con<U+FB01>ned myself at <U+FB01>rst to the investigation of
iron, nickel, and copper.
    In the experiments with these metals the results showed not
the remotest approach to regularity in respect of the quantities
disintegrated.      I content myself with bringing forward a few
experiments and remarking only that the electrodes formed cylin
ders rounded at the fore end, of at most 4 or 5 grammes Weight.

10          M. H. Herwig      on the Disintegration of the
   Negative electrode iron, lost 5'5 milligr. iron, took up 1 mil
ligr. copper.
   The longer of these experiments had to be performed with
short intermissions, in order not to heat the electrodes to fusion.
As very small quantities were in question, the chemical analysis
was of course cautiously e<U+FB02>'ected, and was only applied to the
super<U+FB01>cial layers of the electrodes, these being the only ones
concerned.     Since, in spite of the extreme rarefaction of the air
in the cylinder, a few small portions on the electrodes (especially
the particles of other metals precipitated upon them) were some
times found to be oxidized, this slight content of oxygen had to
be taken into account in the analyses.       Although under these
circumstances the numbers given present little uncertainties, yet
they cannot be adected with gross errors ; and therefore we have
in them a satisfactorily approximate representation of the pro
portions.
   Therefore these proportions are perceived to be absolutely
irregular. Even when the same metals are employed respectively
for the positive and for the negative electrodes in dilferent expe
riments, they give sometimes equal loss at both electrodes, some
times more at the positive, and sometimes more at the negative
electrode. There is likewise visible no connexion with the amount
of hydrogen simultaneously developed.        The only regularly oc
curring circumstance in these, as in all my experiments, was,
that the heating of the positive electrode was always the quickest,
and it was the <U+FB01>rst to become red-hot; but this circumstance,
in the case of two electrodes of the same kind, is universally
known.
   Now, it seems, a cause can at once he adduced which contains
a partial explanation of this irregularity.   The experiments above
given show that, although a brisk scattering of the disintegrated
metallic particles in all directions always takes place, and in con
sequence of this a more or less dense precipitate of powder is
always seen on the neighbouring sides of the cylinder, yet a not
inconsiderable portion of the metal lost by one electrode may often
be found on the other.       Such portions of the foreign metal are
<U+FB01>rmly   melted  to  the electrode  on which they are seated.   Now,
supposing an experiment in which this has taken place continued,
doubtless one of those portions might again be subjected to
disintegration, since it is situated in the front, the part most
affected by it ; and thus the act of disintegration would have been
employed more than once upon the same metallic particles.
That such a behaviour actually played a part in the experiments
here discussed is shown by several observations.       For example,
in experiment 1    the  3 milligr. of copper taken up by the iron
electrode was not on its surface, but under a thin layer of iron,

                Electrodes  in the Galvanic  Arc of Light.            11
 which had evidently, therefore, come later, doubtless thrown
 back again from the copper electrode, as the iron electrode itself
 was certainly not heated to fusion.       It is thus seen that an elec
 trode, under the circumstances present in these experiments,
 may take up again already-disintegrated metal and subject it to
 a fresh disintegration.      Consequently the numerical results of
 all such experiments are completely illusory.
     More success could perhaps be expected from an arrangement
 in which chemical alterations of the disintegrated metal are
 taken advantage of to avoid repeated disintegrations ; and this
 comes nearer to Grove’s experiment.         If in experiments in air
 the powdered metal were completely oxidized and thus pre
 sented no mechanically conducting connexion with the rest of
 the electrode, this purpose would perhaps have been attained.
 But determinations according to this method have not only the
 dif<U+FB01>culty experienced by Grove, namely that oxidation readily
 takes place also on the mass of the electrode, but also one of an
exactly opposite nature; and even this makes them as ill adapted
 as the previous determinations to answer the question proposed.
 That is to say, in general the whole of the disintegrated sub
 stance of an oxidable electrode is not actually oxidated in air,
 but the oxidation extends more towards the circumference of the
 arc of light, while pure metal readily passes in its interior.
    On this   I have made various experiments, and will only cite
one case, which speaks distinctly.         I placed two electrodes of
nickel opposite each other in air, and caused the are to pass
over, during which 60 cub. centims. of hydrogen were developed
in the voltameter.      Both electrodes obtained an oxidized layer,
which with a little care could be very well separated clean from
the metal.      After this the positive electrode gave a loss of weight
of 4 milligr., and the negative one of 13 milligr.        But the posi
tive electrode showed in front a projecting piece of pure metal
parted off from the rest of the electrode by a <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>ssure.             I
sprung it off at the <U+FB01>ssure, and found that it had been seated on
a fully oxidated base. This piece had therefore <U+FB01>rst arrived
thither during the experiment, and, indeed (since neither elec
trode had once become red-hot), from the opposite electrode.          It
was, however, oxidated only on the outermost surface ; through
out its interior was pure metal: it amounted to 6 milligr.
    It is thus just as little possible to measure in this way. Also
an arti<U+FB01>cial blast of air or oxygen into the arc would hardly give
serviceable experiments.
    It may therefore certainly be maintained generally that no
experiments can answer our question in which both electrodes
take part in the disintegration.      We must accordingly endeavour
to take away the cooperation of one of the electrodes.         For this .

12           M. H. Herwig      on the   Disintegration of   the
I   have tried the following     means, and ascertained           its perfect
utility.
   For one electrode I took a large, thick plate of copper; for
the other, in order to have a metal not oxidable in air, a knob
of pure silver.   The latter was screwed on an iron rod, which,
wrapped round with a spiral spring, was passed through a thick
caoutcliouc cork, which bore three insulated supports running
from the sides of the rod.     If the copper plate was touched with
the feet of these, the silver knob could, by a screw-arrangement
on the iron rod, be brought as near to the plate as was desired.
It was then only necessary to press the head of the iron rod
 (which at the same time contained the polar wire), in order by a
very brief contact between the silver knob and the plate to intro
duce the luminou arc.        The spiral spring immediately jerked
the silver knob back   to its previous position.
   The arc thus produced, which was maintained very perfect
with a battery of 36 Grove’s elements, I now carried over conti
nually new points, by holding the caoutchouc cork in my hand
and making the three insulated supports glide over the plate.
In this manner the end of the arc was always formed by a fresh
point; so that, on the part of the silver that had once gone
over, repeated action was not possible.    With respect to the cop
per itself, it was to be expected that nowhere would any material
disintegration take place; for the heating was distributed more
uniformly over the considerable mass of the entire plate, which
never became so hot that the band could not have been held for
a long time in contact with it.     Indeed the result was this—
that never was the slightest trace of copper found on the silver
knob, and scarcely anywhere on the plate was a layer of cu
preous oxide to be perceived, which otherwise very readily forms
on heated copper.      The copper, then, remained substantially
intact; and thus the conditions prescribed for the experiment
were ful<U+FB01>lled.
    The one-sided disintegration of the silver electrode in these
experiments manifested itself in a form a little complicated.
First, following the course of the arc, a stripe of bright metallic
silver was sharply impressed into the copper; but this was suc
ceeded by a rather thin layer above and on each side of           and it,
more or less impressed, of black powder, which, cautiously re
moved from the plate and analyzed, proved to be          silver-com
                                                            a
pound, probably    an oxide.   This  powder,    it
                                                seems, forms    at the
periphery of the arc, and consequently where the air has access.
It therefore deposited on the plate sidewards of the proper
     is
course of the arc, and of course, moreover, where at each moment
the arc itself has preceded     it,
                                 consequently above the stripe of
 metallic silver.  Where, however, the arc      interrupted
                                                 is               sud-by        .

denly moving the silver knob away from the plate, it does not
make its appearance; there metallic silver alone is to be seen.
Precisely the same powder is seated, at the commencement of an
experiment, on the knob itself; but it vanishes there, and does
not appear again, as soon as the knob approaches a red heat, by
which it is reduced to the metallic condition. It is not an im
probable conjecture that this oxidation of the silver is to be
ascribed to the presence of ozone in the voltaic are produced in
air; and therein may be seen a further argument for the
opinion entertained probably by the majority of physicists—
that in the voltaic arc the movement of the electricity is not
brought about exclusively by the transport of the substance of
the electrodes, but that a partial leap of the intervening layers
of gas takes place, analogous to the induction-spark                                          1'.
    Now the quantity of the silver that goes over in this way (that
is, the disintegrated powder) can be settled       simply weighing              by
it, since no permanent oxidation of the knob itself takes place.                                            I
obtained thus, with two silver knobs of from         to   grammes                   5         6
weight,   the following results in the order given :—

   My <U+FB01>rst   researches relative toa theory of magnetic force were
published    in a  communication    consisting of Parts I. and II.
contained in the numbers       of the  Philosophical Magazine for
January and February 1861. The account of the source of
terrestrial magnetism given in articles 27—30 of that commu
nication agrees for the most part with the views          I hold at
the present time, especially as regards the explanation in art.
 27 of the generation of magnetic streams of the tether by the
 impulses it receives from the component atoms of the earth in
 their rotation about the earth’s axis.     Also  Iconsider it to be
 correctly asserted in art. 33 that no recognizable magnetic cur
 rent results either from the motion of the earth in its orbit, or
 from that due to the motion of translation of the solar sys
 tem in space.    This assertion, however, is partly dependent on
 facts of observation, no independent theoretical reason being
 there given for it.
    Some discussion of the essential principles of the hydrodyna
 mical theories of magnetic force, and of other physical forces,
 will be found in the Philosophical Magazine for April 1861
(p. 250).
    Two papers in the numbers of the Philosophical Magazine
for February and March 1863 treat (1) of the zodiacal light;
(2) of the analogous phenomenon of a uniform luminous arch
seen at night across the sky, and symmetrically disposed about
the ecliptic; (3) of diffused nocturnal luminosity.        These phe
nomena are considered     to  give  ocular evidence of the existence
of solar and terrestrial magnetic streams.
    In my work ‘ On the Principles of Mathematics and Physics’
 (published in 1869), the Theory of Magnetic Force occupies
pages 604—676, including, in pages 613—618, a theory of ter
restrial magnetism.      In discussing the source of the earth’s
magnetism     I have there maintained, in contradiction to an [m
sustained assertion in art. 28 of the before-cited communica
tion, that the earth by its motion does not carry with it any sen
sible amount of the aether.        It is,however, to be said that no
distinct account    given in that work of the respective e<U+FB01>'ects of
                   is
the orbital and rotatory motions of the earth in generating
magnetic streams.
     With the view of making the hydrodynamical theory of mag
netism more complete,   I    subsequently went through    a   new dis
cussion of its mathematical principles, which    is   published in the
Philosophical Magazine for June 1872.           Lastly, in
                                                         a    work en
titled “ An Essay on the Mathematical Principles of Physics,”
produced in the present year,    I    have brought under revrew the
whole of the hydrodynamical theory of magnetism, and          in  such
manner that as little use as possible      made of analytical symbols.

   In arts. 120—122 and 130—132 of this publication, theoretical
   reasons are given for concluding that little or no magnetic
   effect is attributable to the earth’s motion of translation, and
   that terrestrial magnetism is almost wholly due to streams gene
   rated by the rotation about its axis.   For the sake of conveni
   ence,  I propose to reproduce here the reasoning by which these
   conclusions are there arrived at, previously to adding other con
   siderations con<U+FB01>rmatory of them.      As the writings above enu
   merated suf<U+FB01>ciently indicate the way in which the hydrodyna
   mical theory of magnetism accounts generally for magnetic force
   by the action of steady streams of the aeth'er, it will only be ne
  cessary for the present purpose to investigate the mode of gene
  ration of those steady streams by the agency of which the prin
  cipal facts of the proper magnetism of the earth may admit of
  explanation.
      It must <U+FB01>rst be mentioned that the philosophical principles    I
  have so long advocated forbid making any other hypotheses
  respecting atoms and the aether than those   I  have frequently had
  occasion to enunciate in this Journal.       Accordingly it will be
  supposed that the earth consists wholly of inert spherical atoms
  of constant form and magnitude—that they are held in positions
  of equilibrium by atomic and molecular forces, which are only
  modes of action of the aether itself, which is assumed to be the
  source of all active force, and to press always and everywhere
  proportionally to its density—and that consequently the aether
  at rest has the same density within the earth as in the space
 outside.     Moreover it is supposed that the occupation of space
  by the <U+FB01>nite atoms is very small compared with the intervening
  spaces, even at the earth’s centre, where the atomic density is
 greatest.
     Considering, <U+FB01>rst, the motions which the atoms impress on the
 aether by reason of the earth’s orbital motion, we may at once
 infer from Poisson’s solution of the problem of the simultaneous
 movements of a ball-pendulum and the surrounding air, the
 motions of the aether which will be produced by any single atom;
 and since the motions due to different atoms, as being steady
 relatively to the positions of their centres, may coexist, we may
 conclude on the hypothesis that the proportion of space occu
 pied by the atoms is very small, that the total motion is quam
prowime the sum of all the motions caused by individual atoms.
 Also since, according to that solution, just as much <U+FB02>uid <U+FB02>ows
backwards as the atom displaces by its forward motion, it fol
lows that during the time the earth is moving over a portion of
its orbit equal to its diameter, a quantity of <U+FB02>uid crosses the
transverse plane which is tangential to its surface in the <U+FB01>rst and
last positions, equal to the quantity which would just <U+FB01>ll the

                 Source   of Terrestrial Magnetism.                17
space occupied by the atoms.      Hence, if we supposed this quan
tity to <U+FB02>ow in that interval in a uniform concentrated stream
                                                                         an. , iimmea—w
through a circular aperture of radius equal to that of the earth,
it might readily be shown that the ratio of its velocity to the
velocity of the earth is two thirds of the ratio of the space occupied
by the atoms to the earth’s volume.        This ratio, by hypothesis,
is extremely small; and therefore it would not be contradictory
to the theory to <U+FB01>nd that but little magnetic effect is due to
tetherial currents at the earth’s surface produced by the orbital
                                                                         Mn",
motion.
  The motions      resulting   from the composition of all those
severally impressed by   the  atoms  will evidently be symmetrical
with respect to an axis passing through the earth’ s centre in the
direction of the motion, and ful<U+FB01>l at the same time the condi
tion that just as much fluid enters at the following hemispherical
surface as issues at the preceding one.       The total motion re
lative to the position of the earth’s centre at any time will con
sequently be a circulating motion ; and a plane through the centre
transverse to the direction of the earth’s motion will be crossed
by the 're<U+FB02>uent streams at right angles.     The disturbances of a
magnet’s   declination by  these  currents would   have two maxima
and two minima in the course of a revolution of the earth
about its axis. Like effect would result from the earth’s motion
of translation due to the motion of the solar system in space.
    But no variations of magnetic declination subject to a re
gular law of this kind have been detected by observation, ex
cepting one of very small amount traceable to the influence of
the moon.     It follows, therefore, that experience con<U+FB01>rms the
foregoing theoretical inference, that the currents generated by
the earth’s motions of translation have little or no magnetic
effect.
   It will appear from a consideration of the foregoing argu
ment that the earth, conceived to consist of discrete atoms, is
incapable, by reason of the resistance arising from the inertia
of the unlimited mass of the eether, to impress either in its
interior or its immediate neighbourhood, motions whereby any
portion of the aether could be permanently transported across a
given <U+FB01>xed plane.     The only possible motions are those neces
sary  for vacating  and  <U+FB01>lling up the spaces successively occupied
by  the  atoms  in their onward course, which motions, as we have
seen, are not recognizable by any magnetic effects, and may
therefore be supposed to be extremely small compared with the
earth’s velocity.    The case is otherwise with respect to the
streams due to the earth’s rotation, the generation of which
may be conceived of as follows.
   As the resultants of the movements immediately impressed on
                                                              '

18                   Prof. Challis’s Theory of     the
the aether by the revolution of the atoms about the earth’s axis
are circular, there will be no such re<U+FB02>uent streams due to the
inertia of the general mass of the aether as those produced by
the earth’s motion in its orbit.        In fact, so long as there is any
relative circular motion between the aether and the atoms, the
latter will continually impel the aether, till the relative motion is
reduced to zero.       It may therefore be inferred that in the ulti
mate or steady state of the motion, the circular motion of the
aether within the earth is the same as that of the atoms by which
it is immediately impressed.            This circular motion will, by
 reason of the centrifugal force, operate upon the aether external
to the earth; and the condition of steadiness requires that the
external aether should partake of a certain amount of circular
motion decreasing with the distance from the axis of revolution,
in order that the whole tendency of the centrifugal force trans
versely to the axis may be counteracted by the inertia of the sur-'
rounding mass of the aether.            In short, if we conceive to be
impressed     on the  earth  and the   aether  a motion equal and con
trary to the earth’s     orbital motion, the result of combining this
motion of progression with the circular motion would be a com
posite spiral motion of the aether having always at the same
points the same relations to the <U+FB01>xed centre of the earth. Hence,
the earth being now supposed to move, this spiral form of steady
motion would be capable of travelling uniformly through space
in company with the earth.          (See a discussion of this kind of
motion in the article on the theory of magnetism in the Phi              ’
losophical    Magazine for June 1872.)
    But it is evident that this rotatory-motion will tend to draw
the aether from the axis equally in all directions in any given
transverse plane, and thus to cause the external aether to rush in
 at the polar parts to supply any partial vacancy which the cen
 trifugal force might produce.        If, however, the circumstances of
 the earth were in all respects symmetrical with respect to the
 equatorial plane, these tendencies would just counteract each
 other, and no currents, other than the circular movements,
 would be generated ; for the circulating currents which the in<U+FB02>ux
 at one pole would produce of itself would be just neutralized by
 those due to the in<U+FB02>ux at the other, and in. consequence the
 in<U+FB02>ux at each would be stopped.          But because the circumstances
 of  the solid  and  <U+FB02>uid  parts of  the  earth are not symmetrical with
 respect to the equatorial plane, there will be a differential action
 due to the centrifugal force, whereby streams will be produced
 which, as satisfying the necessary condition of circulating, will
 be permanent relatively to the earth.          The direction of the <U+FB02>ow
  will be determined by the circumstances which violate the con
  dition of symmetry; and it is therefore reasonable to suppose,

                 Source   of Terrestrial Magnetism.                 19
 since there   is  a preponderance    of land in the northern hemi
 sphere, and the currents are always towards the positions of
 greatest atom-density, that they will <U+FB02>ow out of the northern
 parts and, after circulating, enter into the southern parts.     This
 is uniformly taken to be the direction of the earth’s currents in
 my hydrodynamical theory of magnetism.
    Accordingly the positions of greatest e<U+FB02>iux and in<U+FB02>ux, although
 they cannot be far distant from the earth’s poles, will be partly
dependent on the distribution of land and water.            It is thus
 consistent with the theory to <U+FB01>nd that in the northern hemi
 sphere there are two positions         of maximum intensity—one,
 which at present appears to be the principal one, in a high lati
 tude of the North-American         continent, and the other a little
 north of the Asiatic continent.       There is not the same geogra
 phical  reason   for two positions  of maximum in<U+FB02>ux in the south
 ern hemisphere; and, in fact, observation has hitherto only de
 termined that, if there be two, they cannot be far apart.       Hence
 the theory at once accounts for the circumstance that, of all po
 sitions on the earth’s surface, the magnetic intensity is greatest
 in the neighbourhood of the south pole.         For the total in<U+FB02>ux is
 necessarily equal to the total e<U+FB01>lux ; and consequently the in<U+FB02>ux
 is intensi<U+FB01>ed in that quarter, either because there is but one
 position of maximum intensity, or, if there be two, becausethey
 are near each other.      The foregoing comparisons of the theory
 with facts of observation are con<U+FB01>rmatory of the view taken of
 the nature and source of terrestrial magnetism.
    It will be seen that this theory attributes the generation
of terrestrial magnetic streams altogether to impulses given to
the aether by the earth’s atoms in motion, and that it would be
much corroborated by any independent evidence of the actuality
of this action between atoms and the aether.          Now it happens
that such evidence is obtainable by reference to the explanation
                                                   I
of certain phenomena of aberration, which have given in the
Number of the Philosophical Magazine for April 1872, inasmuch
as that explanation depends on an impulsive atomic action of the
very same kind as that which has been under consideration, as
will appear from the following argument.
    The aberration of light is simply due to the circumstance that
whereas the pointing of a telescope, as instrumentally determined,
is in the direction of the straight line joining the optical centre
of the object-glass, or object-mirror, and a certain <U+FB01>xed point in
the <U+FB01>eld of view, the actual course of a ray from the <U+FB01>rst point
to the other deviates from that line by reason of the earth’s
movement in the interval occupied by the passage of the ray. The
deviation is in the direction towards which the earth is moving;
and its angular amount is measured by the ratio of the earth’s

              velocity, resolved perpendicularly to the line of pointing, to the
              velocity of light.   Now the communication above cited contains
              an account of experiments made with telescopes the tubes of
              which were partly <U+FB01>lled with a transparent <U+FB02>uid, the object of
              this arrangement being to ascertain what effect would thereby be
              produced on the amount of aberration.           confess that      I
                                                                             fully                      I
              expected,   on  account  of the longer time  occupied by   the pass
              age of the light between the two points owing to the retarda
              tion caused by the <U+FB02>uid column, that the amount of aberration
              would by this means be increased.      But two independent sets of
              experiments, one by M. Hock with the telescope pointed to a
              terrestrial object, and the other by the Astronomer Royal with
              the telescope directed to 'y Draconis, have proved conclusively
              that the passage of the light through the <U+FB02>uid column does not
              sensibly alter the amount of aberration.    By parity of reasoning
              the aberration is unaffected by transmission of the rays through
              the lenses of the telescope.    At the end of the aforesaid commu

is propagated at the same rate.    Consequently the rate of pro

        Obviously the question of the best resistance of the galvano
     meter is only independent of the resistance of the battery (so
     long at least as this is a quantity of relatively <U+FB01>nite magnitude)
     when balance is nearly established, and is not so generally       e.         (i.
     away from balance as well as at balance) as Mr. Heaviside’s
     equations would imply.
         It to be observed, however, that to proceed directly to <U+FB01>nd
            is
     the resistance of the galvanometer which makes its magnetic
     effect a maximum at balance (when no current passes through

the galvanometer) is a merely mathematical problem destitute
of physical meaning.        Clearly the proper procedure is <U+FB01>rst to
prove that there exists a general maximum when balance is not
established, dependent on the resistances of the four branches
and on the resistance of the battery, and then to <U+FB01>nd to what
condition this converges as we approach balance and becomes
equal when we reach balance.
     From the second of the above equations we <U+FB01>nd that the ge
neral maximum is given by
    _
E_(a+b)(c+d)         +                         (ad-bar
                       (0+b+c+ll){(a+c)(b+d)+(a+b+c+dlf},
        a+b+c+d
 which, as balance is approached,         rapidly converges towards the
condition
                         E:      (a+b)(c+d)_
                                 a+b+c+d
     This is the general useful solution, since it is only near ba
 lance that it is of practical importance that the condition of
 maximum sensibility should be ful<U+FB01>lled; and we notice that it is
 independent of the battery resistance.
     The resistance of the battery has been supposed to be of <U+FB01>nite
 magnitude compared with the other resistances in the bridge.
 If,  however, the resistance of the battery be inde<U+FB01>nitely large
 compared with the sum of the four resistances in the bridge,
 then the condition
                            _    (a+b)(c+@
                                 a+b+c+li
 holds universally, i. e. is independent of whether balance is nearly
 established or not.      (Such a case could, of course, only occur
 in the physical laboratory.)
     Again, if the battery resistance be inde<U+FB01>nitely small compared
  with the sum of the four resistances in the bridge (as in measu
  ring the “insulation ” of a well-insulated telegraph-wire), we see
 that the condition
                            E:      ac

 is universally true, i. e. is independent of whether           balance  is
 nearly established or not.
     Of course when balance is nearly established the two condi
 tions become identical.
      Bridges for testing telegraph-lines         are almost invariably
 wrongly arranged. It can be proved* that when the galvano

meter resistance is greater than the battery resistance (a condi
tion which should always be ful<U+FB01>lled in testing telegraph-lines),
the galvanometer should be made to connect the junction of the

 I   N vol. xxxvi. of the Philosophical Magazine (p. 117), and in
      the Number for September 1873 (p. 247), Mr. Moon has

hydrodynamical researches are founded on differential equations
which are really the same as those employed by Mr. Earnshaw,

expression, and should consequently lead to the same results.
This identity indicates that the two mathematicians have argued
correctly, although by different processes, from the same princi

28       M. A. F. Sundell      on the    Electromotive and Thermoelectric
ples, which, as certainly in the one case as in the other, are the
commonly received principles of hydrodynamics.       It is therefore
logically impossible that any argument against those principles
can be drawn from Mr. Moon’s reasoning or his results, inas
much as the reasoning has no other basis to stand upon.
     I
     think it right to add that            I
                                     have advanced the foregoing
argument only as an argumentum ad hominem, intended to show
that, even admitting Mr. Moon’s premises and his reasoning, no
conclusion can be drawn therefrom contradictory to the princi
ples of hydrodynamics.       My reason for making this statement
here is that        I
                  have repeatedly, in' this Journal and elsewhere,
asserted that        I
                   cannot accept either the equation (1) or the
equation (4)   as  a  true hydrodynamical equation—not because
the principles  on   which these equations rest are untrue, but be
cause they require to be supplemented.       At the same time can             I
admit the truth and the importance of the equations p=f(p, o)
and F(p, p, u,'v, w)=O, considering them to be necessary for
completing the analytical principles of hydrodynamics. Expe
riment can establish the truth of the equation 12:an only for
<U+FB02>uid at rest, whereas by means of these equations it can be shown
to be legitimate to assume the same equation to hold good for
<U+FB02>uid in motion.                      _
   Having given these explanations I think it needless to pursue
the subject at greater length, and accordingly shall decline enter
ing upon any further discussion.

        Forces  of some Metallic Alloys in Contact with Copper.             29
took, in the beginning of the year 1872, a similar investigation
of various alloys. The present memoir contains the results, the
investigation having been carried out in the physical laboratory
of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm.
      1. M. Edlund’s method is based on the proposition, de
 duced from the mechanical theory of heat, that a galvanic cur
rent going through an electromotor calls forth in it an absorp
 tion or production of heat proportional to its electromotive force,
 according as the current is in direction the same as or opposite
 to that generated by the electromotor itself *. Hence the rela
 tive quantity of the electromotive force is obtained by measuring
 the amount of heat absorbed or produced.                 The phenomenon
 also indicates, as is readily seen, the direction of the current ex
                                                '
 cited by the electromotor.
      The air-thermometer constructed by Professor Edlund for the
 measurement of the quantities of heat in question is fully de
 scribed in his memoir; consequently it will be suf<U+FB01>cient here to
 mention only the principal parts of this apparatus.                Two per
 fectly equal cylinders of thin sheet copper communicate through
 a horizontal glass tube of 2'5 millims. internal diameter.               Into
 both cylinders, through open tubes which enter the middle points
 of their ends, the same combination of two metals in the shape
 of wires or rods is inserted in such wise that the place of contact
  is in the centre of the cylinder. The tubes are lined internally,
  to half their length, with wood, to prevent contact between the
  cylinder and the wire. Communication between the outer air
  and that of the cylinder is then completely cut off by pouring
  into the tubes a melted mixture of equal parts by weight of wax
  and rosin.      The two wires are inserted in the circuit of a gal
  vanic current in such a manner that, when the current in one
  of the wires goes from metal A to metal B, the second wire is
  passed through by the current in the opposite direction, from
  B to A. Hence arises at the one place of contact a production,
  at the other an absorption, of heat. The tri<U+FB02>ing difference
  hereby produced between the temperatures of the air in the cy
  linders occasions the displacement of a column a few centimetres
  long of liquid in the tube, a mixture of alcohol and water of sp.
   gr. 0'9 which acts as an index.         If the current be reversed, a
   cooling ensues in the cylinder in which there was previously a
  heating, and vice versd, by which the index is moved towards the
                     '
  opposite side.       The displacement towards the one side or the
  other ceases as soon as equilibrium is restored between the heat
  given off by each cylinder through radiation and conduction to

The positions in which the index becomes stationary are read o<U+FB02>'
a millimetre-scale <U+FB01>xed to the glass tube.               The magnitude of the
de<U+FB02>ection is given by the difference between the numbers read

to a difference of temperature of 00002 Cels.
     Each combination was tried with three different intensities of
current. From the de<U+FB02>ections the quantity or was calculated,

 The combination of each two of the three current-intensities
 gave a value of ,8; in the calculation of a the arithmetic mean
  of the three values were inserted in equation
      Professor Edlund, in nearly all his experiments, made use of
  two copper cylinders silvered on the outer side.                These cylinders
  proved   now   to be  no   longer   air-tight;    and   therefore     in the pre
  sent investigation     two   others, unsilvered, also employed by Ed
  lund in some experiments, were used.
      Waiting till the displacement ceases, before reading-off the
  position of the column of liquid, makes the labour very tedious.
  This method is not always practicable, because the index has
  mostly a motion of its own, independent of the temperature
   variation to be measured, the cause of which will be subsequently
   stated.   Professor Edlund therefore made his experiments after
   the following method.          The position of the liquid column was
   read off at the end of each three quarters of an hour; and then
   the current was reversed.            The effect of the peculiar motion
   (which   could  be  taken    as  uniformly    accelerated or retarded) was
   eliminated    in  the   following     manner.       The correct de<U+FB02>ection,
   corresponding to the quantity of heat developed or which had
   vanished at the place of contact, was obtained from three de<U+FB02>ec
   tions observed in immediate succession, by taking the arithmetic
   mean of the <U+FB01>rst and third, and then the mean of this mean and
   the second de<U+FB02>ection.          In order to save time, Professor Edlund
   performed the reading in some experiments every quarter of an
   hour. Although the temperature of the cylinders had not in so
   short a time arrived at equilibrium, yet the deflections thus ob

        Forces of some Metallic Alloys in Contact with Copper.         31
tained may be employed, because the values of a which were
calculated from them are, as Edlund has shown, proportional to
those furnished by the readings after 45 minutes.              By special
experiments, which shall in due time be given, it was ascer
 tained that there was this proportionality even when the unsil
 vered cylinders were employed.          Hence in the present investi
 gation, except where otherwise stated, the readings were every
 where taken every quarter of an hour.
     As essential parts of the apparatus the double cylinders made
 of metal sheet and <U+FB01>lled with water must be mentioned, the
 mantles, which protected the copper cylinders against the varia
 tions of temperature in the observation-room.          Those employed
 by M. Edlund were made of zinc.           During the experiments the
 oxidating action of the water had covered the inner sides of the
  mantles with a thick layer of hydrate of zinc, which obstructed
  the passage of the heat developed in the air-thermometer into
  the water.    Thereby was produced an elevation of temperature
  in the annular layer of air between a cylinder and its mantle;
  and because this rise of temperature was not equally great for
  both cylinders, the column of liquid in the glass tube was put
  in the above-mentioned continuous motion towards one side.
  To remove this a means was tried which is indicated in M. Ed
  lund’s memoir.       New mantles were procured, of the same di
  mensions as the old, but of sheet brass and electroplated with
  silver on the side presented to the water*. These were <U+FB01>lled
  with distilled water. With this arrangement the continuous
   motion almost entirely disappeared; only towards the end of the
  investigation did it show itself in a slightly higher degree. The
  reason for  it, however, did not lie in the mantles; for the dis
  placement in question vanished again when an experiment was
  made with the silvered cylinders. Probably one of the unsilvered
  cylinders had undergone    a    change, so that  it   gave up the heat
  with greater   or less velocity  than  the other.    On  account of the
  continuous displacement, the de<U+FB02>ections given in the following
  are in every case calculated, according to the method before
  mentioned, from three de<U+FB02>ections observed in succession.
      2. The galvanic current was generated by pile of from two
                                                      a
   to four Bunsen’s elements; and in the circuit, besides the wires
   in the cylinders, rheostat,
                     a             a  tangent-compass,     and a commu
   tator were inserted.    The alloys, except the German silver, were
   cast ina  mould of gypsum, in cylindrical rods of about 16 cen
   tims. length and   2    millims. thickness.      These were soldered
   with tin to copper wires    1    millimetre thick, which had been
   drawn out of chemically pure, galvanically precipitated copper.

32     M. A. F. Sundell    on the Electromotive  and Thermoelectric
In   the    alloys commercial (impure) metals were employed.
During the investigation it was observed that both the electro
motive and the thermoelectric force diminished as the time pro
ceeded.      This diminution, especially remarkable immediately
after casting, depended doubtless on physical (perhaps also che
mical) molecular changes in the alloys.         As the electromotive
force was usually determined immediately after the casting, but
the thermoelectric not till some days subsequently, one could
not be sure that both determinations corresponded to the same
molecular state of the alloys.        It was consequently necessary
with most of the alloys to repeat the experiments.          This later
investigation was effected perhaps six weeks after the <U+FB01>rst ; and
the same pair of wires was employed.          As it could be assumed
that at the end of this time the molecular changes had for the
most part ceased, and since also the determination of the ther
 moelectric force was now taken immediately after the ascertain
ing of the electromotive force, the values of the two forces thus
 obtained correspond to the same molecular state and are compa
 rable with each other.
    3. The determination of the thermoelectric force was effected
 in the following manner.       The copper wire which was soldered
 to the alloy was bent, near the soldering, twice at right angles,
 and so made parallel to the alloy at a distance of about 2 cen
 tims.     The soldering was inserted in a test-tube, which was im
 mersed in cold water, whereby the place of contact was cooled
 7—10° C. below the temperature of the room (15—180 0.).          The
 free ends of the wires were joined to the ends of the galvano
 meter-wire by means of binding-screws ; these were surrounded
 by a wooden case, the ends of which were perforated for the
 wires to pass through.       The difference of temperature of the
 places of contact was ascertained by two exactly similar very
  sensitive thermometers.     The bulb of one of them was put close
 to the place of contact in the test-tube, that of the other near
 the binding-screws in the box ; and then the mouth of the test
 tube and the perforations of the box were stopped with cotton
 wool, in order to prevent currents of air.        After the contacts
 had acquired the temperature of the air surrounding them, the
  two thermometers and the de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer were
 read of]? simultaneously several times at brief intervals.       The
 galvanometer     was furnished with  the usual mirror-reading.   The
 conducting-power, measured by means of an inducing magnet,
  could be modi<U+FB01>ed by a rhe0stat interpolated in the circuit.
    4. We come now to the narration of the observations.          The
 experiments made at the later determination of the electromotive
  and thermoelectric forces will be given in full.      Of the experi
  ments <U+FB01>rst made the results only will be stated, in order to render

       Forces    of some Metallic Alloys in Contact with Copper.        33
 conspicuous the in<U+FB02>uence of the molecular changes.             In the de
nomination of the combinations we shall always place <U+FB01>rst the
 name of that substance to which the positive galvanic current at
the place of contact must go in order to produce a cooling. The
electromotive force of the combination generates therefore a cur
rent which at the contact-place goes from the last-named to the
<U+FB01>rst-named body.         The same direction always resulted also for
the thermoelectric current at the hotter place of contact.            We
may therefore regard the <U+FB01>rst-named body as the electropositive,
and the last-named as the electronegative constituent of the com
 bination.
                               Iron-copper.
    For the purpose of being able to compare the electromotive
force of the alloys with that of the unmixed metals, the combi
 nations iron-copper and copper-bismuth (in fact, the wires of
these combinations already used by M. Edlund) were <U+FB01>rst tried.
The determination of the electromotive force of the combination
iron-copper gave the following result :—

about the diminution of the electromotive and thermoelectric

    In order  to verify the presence of the alteration in question,
 special  experiments     were made with this alloy.      Three rods were
 cast at the same time, and soldered to copper wires.               Two of
 these pairs of wires were inserted in the air-thermometer.              In
 the following days the electromotive force was determined, and
 also simultaneous       thermoelectric      experiments made with the
 third pair of wires.

    Consequently both forces diminish in nearly the same propor
 tion.   The alteration proceeded most quickly directly after the
 casting, the diminution being already sensible aftera few hours.
 It might be supposed that the galvanic current (which,         well                   it   is
 known, calls forth both temporary and permanent changes in the
 conducting-wire)      the cause of the phenomenon here observed.

 although they had lain several weeks unused, as well as Experi

 exposed to the in<U+FB02>uence of any stronger current than the ther

 dering.    It must also be remarked that the diminution of the
 electromotive force cannot be ascribed to any change of structure
 of the copper wire, because this had been drawn avery long time
 before the experiments.

 arranged according to the magnitude of the electromotive and
 thermoelectric forces, in such wise that a preceding, electroposi
  tiVe, is opposed to a succeeding one, the following series are ob
 tained, in which the numbers give the relative values of these
 forces on contact with copper.                In the composition of the series,
 only the values obtained in the later determinations are taken
 into account.

     Consequently a metallic alloy, like the pure metals, takes the same
position in  the electromotive as in the thermoelectric series.              Because
the thermoelectric current at the hotter place of contact has the
 same direction as the galvanic current produced by the electro
 motive force in action there, this force is augmented by the heat
ing.     These results hold only for temperatures below +30° 0.,
above which the temperature did not at any time ascend during
the experiments.

The mean value, if the last number          be excluded,  =1-06; and
the deviations from the mean, which at the most amount to only
6 per cent., may be attributed to errors of observation.             The
last quotient may reasonably be looked upon as not comparable
with the rest.      The combination copper and 32 bismuth 3 anti
 mony, in consequence of its great electromotive force, produces
in the cylinders of the air-thermometer considerable variations
of temperature on the reversal of the current; and therefore it
is possible that the equations employed in the calculation of at,
 having been deduced 0n the hypothesis that the temperature
 variations in the cylinders are only moderate, furnish for this
 combination a value of a which is not comparable with those for
 the rest of the combinations.       This supposition is con<U+FB01>rmed by
 the circumstance that the quotients appear to increase with the
 electromotive force.       Hence we believe we are justi<U+FB01>ed in as
 suming that the ratio between the thermoelectric and the electro
 motive force of the alloys investigated is constant and equal to the
 ratio for the iron-copper and copper-bismuth combinations.
     Lastly, let us mention as another result of this investigation
 the remarkable constant diminution of the electromotive and
 thermoelectric forces which was observed in the bismuth-tin
 alloys.     Of the pure metals, bismuth seems also to undergo
 such a change.       Taking into consideration the known fact that
 the thermoelectrical condition of solid conductors is extremely
 sensitive to molecular changes (for example, slight impurities or
 a relative displacement of the molecules by mechanical treatment,
 as tension, torsion, pressure, &c.*), it seems very probable that
 the phenomenon in question is connected with some molecular
  alteration.    By rapid solidi<U+FB01>cation in the casting-mould free
 crystallization of the alloy is prevented, and a state of tension is
 produced, from which the molecules strive to free themselves.
  Simultaneously, chemical changes may take place; either the
 constituents of the alloy may enter partially into chemical com
  bination with one another, or combinations that were formed in
  the casting may again fall as<U+FB01>nder.
      Similar molecular changes have been previously observed in
  some bodies.      it is known, for instance, that the freezing-point
  of an ordinary thermometer rises a little in the course of time
  in consequence of the diminution in volume of its bulb. A
  similar phenomenon was observed by M. Edlund in 1857, when
  readjusting three gauged measures of the Swedish Kanne. The

volume of these measures, which were made of glass, was most
accurately determined by F. Rudberg in the year 1833 at 100
cubic decimal inches ; M. Edlund, however, found the volume
of all three vessels perceptibly less, thereby proving a perma
nent structural alteration in the glass, which in twenty-four
years had brought about a sensible lessening of the volume of
these measures.     Finally we will mention the transformation of
the arti<U+FB01>cially produced monoclinic crystals of sulphur into an
aggregate of minute rhombic crystals, the passing of arsenic acid
from the amorphous state into the crystalline form, and other
phenomena of this kind well known in chemistry.
    It is probable that the bismuth-antimony alloys are subject to
a change similar to that undergone by the bismuth-tin alloys,
although the effect of it on the electromotive force may be too
little to become apparent during the proportionally brief time of
the present investigation. Whether all solid conductors are
thus altered when subjected to mechanical treatment, and to
what extent the alteration is accompanied by modi<U+FB01>cations of
their other physical properties (as density, capability of con
ducting heat and electricity, &c.), may be brought to light by
future inquiries.

  VII.   On a simple Condensing Collector for Frictional Electrical
                Machines. By SAMUEL Ronnn'rs, Esq.*
           prime conductor of a frictional electrical machine is
THEone       armature of a condenser, the air being the dielectric,
and the more or less conducting objects in the neighbourhood
constituting the second armature.        This obvious consideration
suggests the form of a collector suitable for developing the full
length of spark which the machine is capable of giving. Winter’s
ring aims at an enlargement of the conductor with as little dis
sipation as possible, and requires accurate and expensive work
manship. The exterior armature remains irregular and variable
in the extreme; and we depend on the extent of the intervening
dielectric for rendering the e<U+FB02>'ect of these irregularities small.
If  we control the form of the exterior armature as well as that
of the interior one, we really make an arti<U+FB01>cial condenser or
Leyden battery, though the dielectric may still be air.          I revert
then to the old form of apparatus, in which, for medical pur
poses, the prime conductor was superseded by a Leyden jar ;.
but as my object is not to accumulate a large quantity of elec
tricity, but to produce long and frequent sparks, to obtain, in
fact, the ordinary phenomena of a prime conductor armed with
a ring and charged to a high potential, my Leyden jar is of
minute dimensions; and in this consists what          I  conceive to be
the novelty.     The result of my experiments was so satisfactory
that   I venture to communicate it.      The apparatus is very effec
tive, of insigni<U+FB01>cant cost, and may be applied to any machine at
once.                                                                     .
    For  a small machine   with  a cylinder 6 inches in diameter and
 8 inches long,   I take a glass tube $5 inch in diameter and 13
inches long, hermetically sealed at one end. A <U+FB01>ne copper
 wire, gauge 25, is inserted; and a piece of paper 2% inches broad
 is wrapped four or <U+FB01>ve times round the closed end. The open
 end with a little wire projecting is to be applied to the prime
 conductor ; and the outer coating must be in good electric con
nexion with a metallic ball by means of a similar wire twisted
 once round the paper.      I  obtained in this way brilliant zigzag
 sparks 4% inches in clear length.
    The charge of the tube at a given potential depends _on the
 interior surface of the tube, and in part on the exterior surface,
 as well as on the wire and coating.        Hence a tube of T36 inch
 diameter and % inch bore will give a spark of considerable
volume, which may occasion a disagreeable shock.                We can,‘
however, modify     the effect  inde<U+FB01>nitely;  and   this  is a great ad
vantage of the arrangement.        The  outer  coating _may be made

 The interior wire should not quite reach the end of the tube,

 and forming the exterior coating, caused speedy rupture by
 spontaneous discharge.       After several failures, the arrangement
 above described enabled the tube to bear a high charge without
 damage.
    We may, however, with some advantage dismiss the conduc
 tor (which is commonly ill adapted to retain electricity at so
 high a potential), and substitute for it a long open tube mounted
 at one end with points and at the other with a brass knob, the
 points and knob communicating through the tube by a <U+FB01>ne
 wire.    I constructed a collector of this kind with a portion of
 a barometer-tube     of T36 inch diameter and           inch bore, 19
 inches long, and coated near the middle with tinfoil for 1 inch.
 This worked remarkably well, giving sparks 4 inches long ; but
 a little additional length and a somewhat larger bore would be
 an improvement.       For a large machine a piece of steam-gauge
 tubing    would  be  suitable.   The stem which carries the tube
 may be metallic, or of wood     with a wire passing along it.
    I  observed that the full power of the machine was not yet ex
 hibited, and therefore made a wooden point-holder supported by
 a glass stem.     In the upper surface is an aperture in which,
 with a cork, a Leyden tube can be <U+FB01>xed in an upright position.
 A piece of wire twisted about the outer coating (which may be
 of paper rubbed with plumbago) communicates with a metallic
 knob. We may also <U+FB01>x the closed end of the tube in the aper
 ture and connect the interior wire with the metallic ball.        The
 free electricity on the covered surface of the tube is thus got rid
 of to some extent.     This apparatus enabled me to obtain <U+FB01>ne
 sparks in air between balls over 5% inches apart.         The electri
city, however, was frequently discharged over the glass of the
cylinder; and it seemed that the limit allowed by the conditions
of the insulation was nearly attained.        I believe this result is
remarkable for so small a machine.
    The apparatus is so simple, compact, and effective that it
should certainly be associated with every frictional electrical
machine. Leyden jars are made use of in connexion with Holtz’s
machine with wonderful success; but the smallest           I have seen
are altogether too large for ordinary machines, and, as         I have
said, the pith of the matter is that the condenser must be charged
and discharged frequently at the highest potential the machine
can give.     Of course it is desirable to varnish the tubes and
otherwise take the usual precautions.

 VIII.      On the Molecular Changes that accompany the Magnetiza
      tion  of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt. By W. F. BARRETT, Professor
      of  Physics  in the Royal College of Science, Dublin *.
        HE    magnetization of iron is accompanied by certain mole
           cular changes in the metal which are well known to phy
  sicists.    The object of this paper is an endeavour to extend our
  knowledge of some of these changes.           Further inquiry in this di
  rection seems to be needed as presenting one avenue of approach
  to a better insight of what may be termed the “ molecular archi
 tecture
            ” of a
                    magnet.
      The wonderful transition of iron from an ordinary to a magne
  tized condition makes no alteration in the appearance, the tem
  perature-1', the weight, or the total bulk of the iron; but it is
 associated with the changes alluded to, which are brie<U+FB02>y as
 follows :—
      lst. The act of magnetization causes a slight increase in the
  length, and a corresponding diminution of the breadth of an iron
  bar—a fact discovered by Mr. Joule in 1842, con<U+FB01>rming the
  previous observations of MM. Gay-Lussac and Wertheim, that
  there was no alteration in the total volume of the iron.             This
 elongation, however, does not occur when the iron is submitted
 to a de<U+FB01>nite longitudinal strain ; and when the strain is still
 greater, the iron invariably shortens when magnetized.
      2nd. A sound is'emitted by the iron on magnetization and
 again on demagnetization.           This was revealed by Mr. Page in
 1837, and studied by many physicists subsequently.                 In iron
 wires the sound or clink seems composed of two distinct noises,
 one of which intensi<U+FB01>es by a moderate strain, but is destroyed
 and the whole sound enfeebled by a still higher strain.
      3rd. M. Wiedemann has proved that an iron wire hung in the
 centre of a helix and twisted is more or less untwisted when a
 current traverses the helix and magnetizes the wire.              M. Mat
 tencci has shown that twisting a magnet lessens its force, but
 stretching a magnet slightly adds to its power}: ; and according
 to M. Guillemin, a strip of iron bent by its own weight is partly
 straightened     by magnetization.
     4th. The conduction of heat in magnetized iron is greater
 across than along the magnetic axis—a fact discovered by Dr.
 Maggi, and enlarged by Sir W. Thomson, who has shown that
    '   Communicated by the Author, having been read before the British
Association at Bradford, September 1873.                        ~
    1' Nevertheless it is stated that repeated magnetization  and demagneti
zation raises the temperature of an iron bar.
    I   A re<U+FB01>ned and capital method of exhibiting this is described by Mr.
Gore in the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society

52        Prof. W. F. Barrett on     the    Molecular Changes that
its precise analogue is to be found in the conduction of electri
city in magnetiZed iron and nickel.
    5th. A bar of wrought iron is more easily magnetized in the
direction of its <U+FB01>bre ; and steel once magnetized in a given di
rection and then demagnetized, is more readily magnetized in
its <U+FB01>rst direction than in any other—a fact <U+FB01>rst pointed out by
M. Marianni, and recently again observed by M. Jamin.
     Lastly, it is well known that mechanical blows aid the assump
tion of magnetic power in steel, but tend to lessen and can even
 destroy it when assumed; and the same also is true of heat,
which no doubt acts in a similar way, viz. by lessening the co
hesion of the particles of steel.
    All these facts may be embraced under the assumption <U+FB01>rst
made by M. Dela Rive, that magnetization is expressed by a
de<U+FB01>nite movement, or a marshalling of the molecules of iron—
the placing, as Dr. Tyndall puts      it,
                                        of their longest dimensions end
to end.      Now iron  is  not the only magnetic body.        Nickel and
 cobalt share the magnetic properties of iron to              avery high
 degree; and to    a    much less extent the metals chromium and
manganese are also magnetic.         If, then, magnetization an act    is
associated with an altered structure of iron, we should expect
to <U+FB01>nd    a  certain correspondence to iron in the properties of the
other magnetic metals.        That this      the case,
                                             is          is
                                                         I  think shown
 by   the paper which has preceded this, “ On the Relationship of
the Magnetic Metals” *.
I      was anxious to try further whether the molecular disturb
ances found on magnetizing iron were also exhibited                    by
                                                                    nickel
and cobalt.        One would    of course    expect  to   <U+FB01>nd  analogous
changes in these bodies; but        I    am unaware that they have
hitherto been examined.
    Messrs. Johnson and Matthey very kindly lent me an extremely
<U+FB01>ne bar of nickel and one of cobalt.          Both bars are cylindrical,
a  little over 9   inches long and   1 inch in diameter.      Though as
pure specimens as they can be rendered commercially, the co
balt  I   <U+FB01>nd contains      avery appreciable amount of iron; the
removal of which body, as chemists well know,                 ismatter of
                                                                   a
the utmost dif<U+FB01>culty.
    The relative magnetic powers of these two bars deserves                      a
moment’s       consideration.    Nickel       invariably ranked above
                                             is
cobalt in the scale of magnetic metals, Faraday and others
placing   it  next to soft iron.   But the bar of nickel have used,
                                                              I
when submitted to the same magnetizing current as the cobalt
bar, exhibits far less portative force than the cobalt.          It re      is
markable that the iron impurity contained           in
                                                    the cobalt     able to
                                                                       is

    accompany   the  Magnetization of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt.       53
mens    I have met with, has very slight retentive power when
magnetized, whereas the cobalt has a high degree of coercive
force.
                                  I.
     Enclosing either of the bars within a helix of wire, a sound
was emitted as soon as an interrupted current traversed the
helix. The sound with cobalt was far the more powerful of
the two, and was even more pronounced        and more metallic than
 with a corresponding bar of iron. This       fact, I believe, has not
 been noticed before.       It is easy to obtain these sounds by
 merely using the coil of an electromagnet and drawing the ter
 minal of the battery wire over a coarse <U+FB01>le in a distant room.
                                  II.
     In order to examine whether the metals lengthened by mag
 netization,  I had a special apparatus made for me by Messrs.
 Yeates, of Dublin and London.        The instrument is a modi<U+FB01>ca
 tion of the arrangement used by Dr. Tyndall, and described by
 him in his ‘Researches on Diamagnetism’ (p. 240). Instead
 of being mounted vertically, the iron bar in my instrument is
 placed horizontally within the coils of apowerful electromagnet.
 One end of the bar is rigidly pressed by the end of a micro
 meter-screw, which is mounted on a sliding bras support that
 (can be adjusted to any length that the bar under experiment
 may be.     The other end of the bar presses against a system of
 levers, by which the least motion of the bar is largely multiplied.
 On an axle moved by the last lever a mirror is <U+FB01>xed; and upon
 this a beam of light is thrown, the re<U+FB02>ected image being received
 on a distant scale.     The whole is mounted on a <U+FB01>rm mahogany
 base rather more than a metre long.        The momentary warmth
 of a lighted match against the iron bar drives the re<U+FB02>ected image
 through 2 or 3 feet of the scale.
     The arrangement is shown in <U+FB01>g. 1.        The soft iron bar,   I  I,

is    mounted on the supports        S, S, passing   through the helices
M, M', and abuts against the system of levers, which is shown
enlarged in <U+FB01>g. 2.         A micrometer-screw N drives the bar into
close contact with the stud P (in <U+FB01>g. 2).            The brass work sup
porting N slides along the woodwork, and can be <U+FB01>rmly clamped
to suit any length of the bar under experiment; the supports
for the bar and for the helices also slide, so that the current can
be sent round the bar at various positions.           It was found neces
sary to employ wedges within M, M', to keep the bar from the
lateral motion which occurred when the helices were animated.
The connexions with the commutator C and the battery are
 evident.     Fig. 2 shows the lever-frame with the front plate of.
 I), D are the screws of the pillars which hold the frame together.
The <U+FB01>rst lever A is connected to the second B by the cross
piece C ,' to the second. lever is attached the counterpoise
weight to, replacing the spring originally used. To the long
arm of B is fastened a silk thread, which passes round a grooved
wheel to the spiral brass spring ss; the tension of the spring
can be regulated          turning the milled screw g ; by this means
the mirror m canby e adjusted to any convenient position. The
 vertical scale on which is cast the re<U+FB02>ected ray 1' (<U+FB01>g. 1) is not
shown.
      But the dif<U+FB01>culties in the way of making determinations
with this instrument were far more than I had even anticipated.
The experience of the faults of one instrument led to the con
struction of another, which, though yielding better results, would
 at times perpch me by the most anomalous behaviour.                 On exa
mination, these anomalies were traced to the hair spring which
held the mirror in position ; being of steel, it became magnetized
by the current and was displaced accordingly. This was removed
and a <U+FB01>ne spiral copper spring substituted.             The <U+FB01>rst results    I
obtained with this improved apparatus showed that the cobalt
and iron behaved in a similar manner; each displaced the light
in the direction of elongation 6'5 divisions of the scale on mag
netization; but with the nickel no action whatever was observed.
 Increasing the battery power to twenty cells of Grove, a barely
 discernible movement took place in the direction of elongation.
 The very concordant results of two or three days’ work seemed
 satisfactory ; but unfortunately little reliance is to be placed in
them, owing to the fact that         I discovered at their close a serious
source of error had been introduced through the inductive action
on an iron pin fastening the levers, by which a disturbance was
caused every time the current circulated round the helices.                 I
 have had lately the apparatus entirely remade, and hope to work
 at the subject again 3 meanwhile I am endeavouring to procure
 a purer specimen of cobalt*.

                                      III.
     I  have now to allude to the deportment of iron when raised
 to a high temperature.        Mr. Faraday has shown, in the last page
           ‘
 of   his    Experimental Researches,’ that a moderate degree of heat
  does not alter the magnetic capacity of iron, but diminishes the
  magnetic force of nickel and increases that of cobalt.               At a
  greater    elevation  of temperature   it is well known   that nickel <U+FB01>rst
  loses   its ordinary magnetic character, then iron, and <U+FB01>nally co
  balt. But Mr. Faraday has also stated                  2343—2347) that
  though the magnetism of iron, nickel, and cobalt, as ordinarily
  exhibited, disappears at a high temperature, yet a feeble mag
   netic state remains, however exalted the temperature may be.
      Some time ago several specimens of very tough <U+FB01>brous iron
  were shown to me that had been obtained directly from cast iron
  by bringing high magnetic power to bear upon the latter metal
  when in a molten state. The process, which was patented, was
                                                          ’
  thus popularly described by the ‘ Athenaeum                for April 20,
  1867 :—“ The experiment has been tried at one of the leading
 iron»works in Shef<U+FB01>eld, and with complete success. The mode
 of operation, as roughly described, is to place a <U+FB01>xed electromag
 net opposite an opening in the side of the furnace, to excite the
  magnet by means of a Smee’s battery, so that the magnetism thus
  evoked may act upon the molten metal. The effect is surprising;
  the metal appears to bubble and boil, the melting is expedited,
  which cconomizes fuel; and the quality of iron is so much im
  proved that for toughness and hardness it can hardly be equalled.
  It appears that some, if not all, of the impurities which remain
  after the ordinary process are eliminated by the use of mag
 netism.”        The scheme is so opposed to the ordinary views re
  garding the inertness of molten iron to magnetism, that any
  physicist must be naturally incredulous at this report, and would
 expect the patent to meet with the oblivion it has received.
 Nevertheless is it not possible, from Mr. Faraday’ 5 experiments,
 that some magnetic effect, not of translation but of direction,
  may be impressed on the molecules of molten iron? This is an
  inquiry to which I hope shortly to give more attention.
 iron wire by magnetization might be made in the following manner :—
 Two soft iron wires were stretched on a monochord; round one wire, and
 nearly its whole length, a helix was coiled, leaving free space for the
  stretched wire to vibrate within.       The wires were tuned to perfect
 unison; I then hoped that when the current animated the helix and so
 magnetized one wire, beats would he heard, owing to the diminished
 tension of the magnetized wire and, hence, unequal rate of vibration of the
two. But I cannot say positively that such was the case. The experi
ment, however, was made under unfavourable circumstances, and needs re
petition. With an optical representation of the combined vibration of the
two wires a better etfect might be anticipated.

56                       Notices respecting New Books.
   The resumption of magnetic power by iron after being raised
to bright incandescence is thus described by Mr. Faraday :—
“ The intensity of the force did not appear to increase until the
temperature arrived near a certain point 3 and then, as the heat
continued to diminish, the iron rapidly, but not instantaneously,
                                                                                     .L-lnmi‘H‘L.

    An author who takes in hand to write a book on the Elements
of Geometry labours, however, under peculiar disadvantages. His
work will be compared with a high standard ; and mistakes which
might have passed without notice in other subjects will be chal
lenged in this.     Besides, as there are strong—we do not say con
clusive—reasons      against the substitution of a new work for the
recognized    text-book, it will be expected that the author shall pro
duce something substantially di<U+FB01>erent and distinctly better.           A
writer who attempts to produce a synthetical Compendium of the
Elements of Geometry substantially di<U+FB01>erent from and distinctly
better than the <U+FB01>rst four books of Euclid, undertakes a task of
no ordinary dif<U+FB01>culty ; and, if we may judge from the preface
to the third edition, Mr. Wilson is more aware of this than he
was a few years ago.           To intersperse the text with remarks
and to add deductions are nothing to the point—notes and de—
ductions to Euclid are already in existence.           Nor is it much
 more to the point to make minor changes. Very many of Mr.
 ‘Vilson’s changes fall under the latter head. For instance :——the
 treatment of Parallels by Playfair’s method; the proofs of Euclid,
 I. 8, I. 24, III. 26, 27, 28, 29 (Wilson, pp. 28, 29; 27; 112—120),
 and others; the grouping of the propositions; the separation of
 Problems    from   Theorems &c.     It may be questioned whether      in
 this there is on the whole improvement; at all events it is im
 provement of no great importance.        To set against this there is a
 great deal which seems to us quite the reverse of improvement;
 and though we cannot exhaust the subject, we will go into details
 on three points.
     (1) Mr. \Vilson makes two classes of axioms—general and geo—
 metrical.    Now, of course, it is true that such propositions as “if
 equals be added to equals the wholes are equal” are applicable to
 other than geometrical magnitudes; but then the application pre
  supposes notions which the student of geometry may or may not
 possess. It may be true that when equal quantities of heat are
  added to equal quantities of heat the wholes are equal ; but the stu—
  dent of geometry has nothing to do with this ; he may not be able
  to understand what is meant by equal quantities of heat; and ac
  cordingly to him the axiom means that if equal angles or lines or
  areas are added to equal angles or lines or areas, the wholes are
  equal.   The axiom, in fact, is to be construed with regard to geo
  metrical matter.    The like is true of the other so-called general
  axioms—at least as they stand in Euclid ; and consequently there
  is nothing gained by the division.    When we go further, however,
  and see what Mr. Wilson includes in the list of General Axioms,
  we cannot help suspecting the existence of some confusion of
  thought.    Here are two of the general axioms :-—-“ (3) If equals be
                                            “(7) If it is known that If”
                                                                     ‘
  added to equals the sums are equal.”
  A is B then C is D,’ it follows that ‘If C is not D then A is not B.’
  Now the former of these, as above remarked, relates to the matter
  of geometry} and where necessary Euclid quotes it amongst the
  premises of his reasoning, just as he would any other antecedent

     theorem.           The latter is merely a logical rule, and relates to the
    form of the reasoning.     The following remark will put in a clear
    light the impropriety of classing (3) and (7) together under the
     same head.   If it is right to rank as seventh amongst the axioms
     of geometry the rule that “ a conditional proposition may be con
    verted by negation,” then the rule that “a universal af<U+FB01>rmative
    proposition can only be converted by limitation” ought to be ad
    mitted into the list; and in fact it would be hard to say what rule
    of deductive logic could well be omitted*.
      It is one thing to make here and therea remark on the form of the
    reasoning employed in proving this or that proposition, and another
    to erect a rule of logic into an axiom of geometry: the latter con
    fuses things that di<U+FB01>er; the propriety of making the former is a
    matter of opinion. Considering, however, that elementary geometry
    should be taught to rather young boys, we are strongly inclined to
    think it best to keep the rules of logic out of sight, or at least that
    they should be noticed, if at all, in the oral instruction of the
    teacher, and should not form a substantial part of the text-book.
    It must be remembered that when we are concerned with given
    matter we reason correctly, or can be shown to have reasoned in
    correctly without explicit reference to the rules of logic.       In a
    book of geometry, therefore, logical rules are extraneous matter,
    and as such are nearly certain to be treated inadequately, if admitted
    at all.  Mr. Wilson illustrates this remark by devoting a page and
    a half to the conversion of propositions (pp. 3, 4) ; but he notices
    only conditional propositions, and his reason for doing so is that
    “if A is B then G will be D is the type of a theorem,” although
    his own enunciations often take a different form       g. Theorems 1.,    (a.
    VI., X.,        850.).
       Mr. Wilson  has four enunciations under the head of Geometrical
    Axioms.   Two of them run thus :—“ (2) Two straight lines which
    have two points in common lie wholly in the same straight line.
                                                                       ”
    (3) A <U+FB01>nite straight line has one and only one point of bisection
    (p. 9). The former of these       true axiom; the latter admits of
                                            is   a
    proof, and      therefore
                       is        theorem assumed to be true merely as
                                     a                                                              a
    matter of convenience.      Suppose Euclid had assumed the <U+FB01>rst eight
    and had begun his reasoning with the ninth proposition; his subse
    quent reasoning would have been una<U+FB01>ected             but surely    ;would             it
    have been an abuse of language          he had classed together as axioms
                                                 if
    “ Two                                                  “ The
            straight lines cannot inclose     space,” and
                                                     a            angles at the
    base of an isosceles triangle are equal.”       Yet this     just the sort  is
    of thing which Mr. Wilson has done.
       (2) On coming to the de<U+FB01>nitions,         may be well to notice that in
                                                      it
    de<U+FB01>nition we have to do with nothing but the meaning of words.
    It follows that there must be some words which are incapable of
    de<U+FB01>nition, and whose meanings must be arrived at by             direct ap          a
-
    peal to the intuitions of sense—t0 experience, in fact.        There may
                                                                              ”
    be good reasons for saying that       linea   “length without breadt
                                                           is                                   ;
                                                                              ”
    but   it  hardly
               is       de<U+FB01>nition, as the words contained in

 and “ breadth”) cannot be understood without a previous know—
 ledge of the meaning of the word line.        Compare the de<U+FB01>nition of
 a line with that of a square—“ a four-sided <U+FB01>gure which has its
 sides equal and its angles right angles;” and the difference is at
 once apparent : in the former the de<U+FB01>nition is performed by means
 of words of an equal order of dif<U+FB01>culty, in the latter by means of
 an analysis of the name into others simpler than itself.          Mr. Wil—
 son is plainly not contented with Euclid’s de<U+FB01>nition ; but he does
 not mend matters by giving the de<U+FB01>nition of a line thus :——“Aline
 has position but neither breadth nor thickness.”          The fact is that
 the dif<U+FB01>culty cannot be got over. There are many words of which
 we all know the meaning, but which we cannot de<U+FB01>ne : such words
 as red or blue are instances; and so are a point, aline, a super<U+FB01>cies,
 an angle.     Mr.Wils0n’s account of a straight line is quite a curious
 instance of how nearly a writer may get to a distinction and yet
 miss it. He tells us :-—“ Def. 5. A straight line is such that any one
 part must, however placed, lie wholly on any other part if its ex
 tremities are made to fall on that other part.”         This is plainly a
 property   of  a straight  line, or rather of two   straight lines, not a
 de<U+FB01>nition; it is in fact the second geometrical axiom with its
 wording slightly altered. If a de<U+FB01>nition is to be attempted at all,
 it would be hard to produce a better than the old one—“ A straight
 line is that which lies evenly between its extreme points ;” but, of
 course, the word evenly as much requires de<U+FB01>nition as the word
 straight. Mr. Wilson adds to his de<U+FB01>nition the remark, “A stretched
 string suggests the notion of straightness, which is in fact incapable
 of elucidation” (p. 6). If he had said that “a string stretched
 between two points suggests the notion of a straight line, a term
 which is in fact incapable of de<U+FB01>nition,” we should have entirely
agreed with him ; but as to the notion of a straight line (or straight
 ness) being incapable of elucidation, that is quite another point.
The notion is elucidated in Whewell's ‘ Philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences,’ vol. i. pp. 96, 97, as Mr. Wilson will <U+FB01>nd on reference.
    (3) We have hitherto dwelt only on axioms and de<U+FB01>nitions. We
 will now advert to a fault wEich pervades the whole book, though
want of space compels us to consider it with regard to only a single
instance.    The fault is impatience of the restrictions of Elementary
Geometry; the instance is the treatment of angles. Euclid, as is
 well known, does not recognize any angle which might not be an
angle of a triangle.     There seems good reason for this : the notion
of an angle that the learner brings with him to the subject is that
of a knee or corner; to make him thoroughly familiar with the no
tion and able to. reason upon it correctly is enough in the <U+FB01>rst
instance, and the more as the notion is fully suf<U+FB01>cient for all the
requirements of the <U+FB01>rst four books. Mr. Wilson thinks other
wise ; and so to angles right, acute, and obtuse he adds the “ straight
       ”                                           “ re<U+FB02>ex          ”
angle     [one of two right angles] and the                  angle     [one
greater than two right angles].        Now, in the <U+FB01>rst place, he uses no
term to denote merely an angle less than a “ straight angle ;” con
sequently he always terms such an angle simply an angle; in other

  60                Notices respecting New Books.
 words, throughout the greater part of the book Euclid’s restriction
 is tacitly reimposed, and this even in cases where, if the considera
 tion of re<U+FB02>ex angles is to be thought advisable at all, we should
 have expected to see them noticed.     E. g. Cor. p. 49 [Euclid I. 32,
 Cor. 2] is expressly limited to any convex polygon; Ex. 2, p. 39,
 Ex. 5, p. 40 are not always true if the quadrilateral has a reentering
 angle. We raise no objection to this but want of consistency.       Se
 condly, with regard to the “re<U+FB02>ex angle,” it is merely said to be
 greater than two right angles. Now take any Euclidic angle and
 denote it by 9; are we to understand by the corresponding re<U+FB02>ex
 angle 21r—0 or 2n1rj_-0? If the former, here is a restriction much
 more arbitrary than Euclid’s ; if the latter, we have a conception
 proposed to a beginner which is well known to be one presenting
 great dif<U+FB01>culty to those who are beginning Trigonometry and have
therefore made some progress in Mathematics.          Mr.Wi1son has an
 “ axiom ”
            which asserts that “ an angle has one and only one bisec—
tor ;” but upon these terms here is an angle A O B which has one,
 or one of two, or two bisectors, according as AOB means some
 one, or any one, or all of the series 2n1ri-0.    Thirdly, with regard
to the “ straight angle.” A boy comes to his teacher with the no
tion that an angle is something resembling a corner of a square or
triangle; and without delay his teacher introduces him to a notion of
 this kind:—Draw a straight line A B and take in it any point C ; at
0 there are two straight angles, one on each side of the line—indeed
as many as we please, for there is no occasion to restrict ourselves
to a single plane. He comes with a notion that an angle is some
thing between two straight lines that meet at a point, and he is
taught without delay that he has only to draw aline an inch long
and put a dot upon it to produce an in<U+FB01>nite number of angles.
This may be all very well for the teacher; but what is it for the boy ?
Not only, however, is it of more than doubtful expediency to put
the notion of a straight angle before a beginner, but Mr. Wilson
does it in a way which looks as if he had hardly considered all the
consequences that ought to follow from its introduction.       We will
try to explain what we mean. It might perhaps be contended that
the theorem “ all straight angles are equal” needs distinct proof;
though it is not easy to see what the theorem would add to the
axiom, “ two straight lines, which have two points in common, lie
wholly in the same straight line.” Now Mr. Wilson does not deem
it necessary to give a formal treatment of this theorem ; but he does
deem it necessary to do what is much more surprising.         He gives
Theor. I. “ All right angles are equal to one another.”      Theor. II.
“ If a
        straight line stands upon another straight line it makes the
adjacent angles together equal to two right angles.”        Theor. III.
“ If the
          adjacent angles made by one straight line with two others
are together equal to two right angles, these two straight lines are
in one straight line.” From Euclid’s point of view this would be
very proper ; but from Mr. Wilson’s point of view a right angle is
only half a straight angle. Now let us try the effect of writing in
these theorems, half a straight angle for right angle, and straight

angle two right angles.            We then    see that the object          of Theorem     I.
is to prove that the halves of straight angles are equal, e.                  2'.   it   is   a
particular case of Axiom 5. Mr. Wilson might just as well have                                a
theorem to prove that the halves of equal straight lines must be
equal.  The object of Theorem II. to prove that
                                              is    a straight line   if
divides straight angle into two parts, the two parts are together
         a
equal to    straight angle. With regard to Theorem 111., we remark
            a
that straight angle

              so that the point to be proved   that a straight line and

more fully the history  '

cell; and, in fact, we convert it into a small silver tray full of crys
tals of the same metal which rise in projections to the very surface.
The copper plate lies horizontally under           it,
                                                separated,      need be,

The vertical part of the copper plate, from           little above the
                                                         a
liquid to the bend, should be varnished; otherwise solution prin
cipally takes place there, which causes the horizontal part of the
plate to drop 01f.      Holes are made in the silver tray with the
view   of shortening the communication between the air-surface and
the copper plate and of facilitating the movements of the salt in
solution.    The solution itself may be contained in shallow trough
                                                             a
or saucer, and the Whole arrangement will be somewhat as in the
sectional view here given :—
   That dissolved oxygen      isabsolutely necessary for this chemical
change has been already shown; but       it was interesting to measure
by a galvanometer the di<U+FB01>erence of the currents obtained by means
of an ordinary, that is aerated, solution of copper nitrate, and one
from which the air had been separated to the greatest possible ex
tent.   A Thomson’s galvanometer was employed, which had              a
resistance of 2631'5 units at 18°'3 C.        Two cells were prepared
with vertical plates  and   alike  in all respects, except that the one
contained an ordinary     6per cent. solution of copper nitrate, and
the other a  similar solution which had been deoxygenized by the
means described in our former paper.          Another experiment was
made with  a  di<U+FB01>erent pair of cells and an 11 per cent. solution.
It was necessary to use the 1-99 shunt; and the following were
the amounts of de<U+FB02>ection :—

     The contrast is evident.      That the deoxygenized solution does
  give a de<U+FB02>ection at all is due partly to the dif<U+FB01>culty of excluding
  air, and partly, perhaps, at <U+FB01>rst to the oxygen condensed on the
  surface of the silver plate. The effect due to the water itself is in—
  appreciable.                                 .
     From the nature of the reaction it might be expected that the
  current would gradually diminish on account of the using up of
  the dissolved oxygen in the neighbourhood of the silver; such a
  diminution always does take place, at least after the <U+FB01>rst few vi
  brations of the needle.
      It might be expected, too, that when the amount of action has run
  down considerably, the mere moving of the liquid so as to bring
  fresh parts of the solution against the silver would augment the
  currents.     It does so.
      The same might be predicted from stirring up the crystals of
  silver in the tray so as to expose new surfaces. This also was found
  to be the case.
      And, again, it might be anticipated that if the wire were discon
  nected for a time so as to allow the oxygen to diffuse itself from
  other parts of the solution, and the connexion were made, the cur—
  rent would be found as strong, or nearly so, as before. That also
  is true in fact.
      A cell with the plates connected by a wire was placed under a
  bell-jar full of air over mercury.       The mercury gradually rose
  inside, as might be expected from the absorption of the oxygen in
  the air.
      The necessity of oxygen and the avidity with which it is taken
  up are both illustrated by the following experiment :—Two cells
  with horizontal plates were prepared alike in every respect, except
  that the <U+FB01>rst was <U+FB01>lled with a solution simply deprived of oxygen,
  the second with a solution through which a stream of carbonic-acid
  gas had been passed for some time. The <U+FB01>rst was placed in the
  air, the second in a vessel from which the air had been expelled
  by allowing carbonic-acid gas to <U+FB02>ow into it for an hour or two.
     The de<U+FB02>ections obtained were as follows, the 1-999 shunt being
  used and the temperature being 13°'7 C :—

    As the cell in an atmosphere of carbonic-acid gas showed consi
derable action, in fact nearly half as much as that in the air, each
cell was short-circuited for 23 hours, with the expectation that
any oxygen in the closed vessel would be used up ; and, indeed, the
most prominent crystals of silver in the cell in carbonic—acid gas
became reddened, while a cuprous deposit extended over the whole
of the crystals in the other cell.         When, however, the short wires
were removed        and   the  galvanometer interposed, the cell in the air
gave a de<U+FB02>ection       of  136,  practically the same as before, but that
in carbonic-acid gas,      instead   of showing a great decrease, rose to 80.
It   was  then    found    that  the   vessel containing the latter slowly
admitted     air;   so the   contents   were swept out by a fresh stream
of  carbonic-acid    gas,   and it was  made properly air-tight. After con
nexion by    a short   wire   for  3 days the galvanometer indicated a de
<U+FB02>ection of 20, that of the cell in the air being 110, temperature
10° C.      As this showed a very great reduction of the chemical
action, carbonic-acid gas was again passed through the vessel for
an hour or two ; and after a connexion of two more days the" in
dication of the galvanometer was only 3, while the other cell gave
115, the temperature being now 10°‘5 O. The action, therefore,
was at last reduced almost to nothing; and the original fault in
the experiment brought out, perhaps more clearly than would other
wise be seen, how eagerly the solution will absorb even minute
quantities of oxygen from the surrounding gas.
    An important point to determine was the best strength of the
copper nitrate solution.         Six per cent. was generally preferred, for
two reasons :—<U+FB01>rst, it gives about the maximum of elfect—a solu
tion four times as strong gives less than half the de<U+FB02>ection, and
 a solution only a quarter as strong gives only two thirds; secondly,
 a stronger solution than this 6 per cent. is apt to produce a deposit,
 not of pure cuprous oxide, but of a subnitrate, which was supposed
 to clog up the silver crystals to a greater extent.
    Another point investigated was the best proportion between the
 areas of the metallic surfaces.          Experiments were made with ver
 tical plates, in which the silver was kept at a uniform size and
 the copper was diminished by covering it more and more with
 varnish; and another set was made in which the copper remained
 the same, while the silver plate was reduced.
    The results may be thus exhibited :—

    The increase, therefore, of the silver or negative metal causes
an almost proportionate increase in the chemical action.               This,
doubtless, arises from the necessity of oxygen, and explains the
 value of the large surface exposed by the silver crystals in the tray.
    The effect of heat on the action of this cell was examined; it
increases the action              thus an arrangement which gave a
                         greatly:
de<U+FB02>ection of 40 at 20 C. gave one of 250 at 50° C. ; and the aug
mentation was observed to be much more rapid in the higher than
in the lower portions of this range of temperature.
    If the formula given above for the reaction be a true one, it
follows that every atom of copper deposited on the silver in the
state of suboxide must be compensated by an atom of copper dis
solved from the copper plate.      This was proved quantitatively. In
a cell that had been in action for a week the loss of the copper
plate was 0391 grm., while the suboxide deposited on the silver
was found to be equivalent to 0398 grm. of metallic copper.             This
deposit of suboxide, though it soon forms apparently a complete

  covering to the silver, does not greatly diminish the action ; it is
  probably porous, besides being itself a conductor of electricity.      In
  some cases we have found it deposited in crystals sufficiently large
  to be seen by the naked eye, and which are shown by a magnifying
  glass to be regular octahedra.
      The internal resistance of this battery, as might be expected, is
  small.                    1
      The electrolytic power of the current was examined. One cell,
  the plates of which were about two inches in diameter, was found
  suf<U+FB01>cient to decompose such metallic salts as the nitrates of copper,
  silver, or lead, copper sulphate or stannous chloride, in aqueous so
  lution, when platinum was used for the negative electrode, and for
  the positive the same metal as existed in the salt experimented
  on.     Six cells were suf<U+FB01>cient to decompose dilute sulphuric acid
  slowly and dilute hydrocloric acid pretty quickly, copper electrodes
  being employed.
       The theoretical interest of this battery lies mainly in the fact
  that it di<U+FB01>ers essentially from every other galvanic arrangement,
  inasmuch as the binary compound in solution is incapable of being
   decomposed either by the positive metal alone or by the two
   metals in conjunction; it cannot serve, in fact, as the liquid ele
  inent of the circuit without the presence of another body ready
   to combine with one of its constituents when set free.
       Grove’s gas—battery is essentially different from ours if the oxygen
   and hydrogen condensed on the platinum plates play the part of
   the two metals ; but it closely resembles ours if hydrogen acts
   the part of the positive and platinum that of the negative metal;
   the dilute sulphuric acid, a hydrogen compound, will then be ch
   composed on account of the simultaneous presence of the oxygen,
   which can combine with the liberated hydrogen.            Viewed in this
   manner Grove’s gas-battery is only a special case of the general
   reaction which we have described in our previous paper; and the
   formula will be :—
       Before contact,

    it is an approximation    towards   a constant   air-battery.  Should  it
'
    ever come into use elsewhere than on the lecture-table, it will
    probably be in the form of a combination of zinc and copper, with
    an aerated solution of zinc chloride; for that arrangement has an
    electromotive force six times that of thearrangement we have more
    particularly studied, and about three quarters that of a Daniell’s
    cell. The numbers representing the diiference of potential between
    the two metals, which were actually obtained by means of an elec

    Chloride of zinc is preferred to the sulphate, as it oifers less
 internal resistance, and a solution of 20 per cent. is recommended
 as about the best conductor*.            A single cell of this description is
 capable of decomposing dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acid when'
 copper electrodes are employed.           The two metals might be arranged
 as in a Daniell’s battery; the zinc would of course require no amal
 gamation ; and the whole might be left for weeks or months without
 any attention.       The oxide of zinc produced generally falls to the
 bottom of the vessel, and may be separated whenever it is thought
                                                                                         ’

    The power is thus obtained at a minimum of expense; for the
 oxygen which combines with the zinc costs nothing.                       Such a battery   _
 would appear to be specially adapted to cases where the galvanic
 current has to be frequently broken, as in telegraphy; for at each
 period of rest it renews its strength by the absorption or diffusion
 of more oxygen from the air._

    The following communication was read :—
    “On the Condensation of a Mixture of Air and Steam upon
 Cold Surfaces.”        By Osborne Reynolds, M.A., Fellow of Queen’s
 College, Cambridge.
    1. The object of this investigation is to ascertain how far the
 presence of a small quantity of air affects the power of a cold sur-i
 face to condense steam.          A priori it seemed probable that it might
 retard condensation very much ; for when pure steam comes up to a
 cold surface and is condensed, it leaves an empty space which is im
mediame <U+FB01>lled with fresh steam; so that the passage of the steam
up to the cold surface is unobstructed, and if the surface could
carry off the heat fast enough, then the rate of condensation would
be unlimited.       If, however, the steam is mixed with air, then, as
the mixture comes into contact with the cold surface, the steam will
be condensed and the air will be left between the fresh steam and
the cold surface; so that after condensation has commenced that
surface will be protected by a stratum of air, and fresh steam will
have either to displace this or pass through it before it in turn can
be condensed.
    2. This question, besides its philosophical interest, has important
practical bearings on the steam—engine.                                   ,
    First. If the quantity of air mixed with the steam aifects the
rate at which it condenses, then the ratio which the pressure of air
bears to the pressure of steam in a condenser will materially affect
                  * On the authority of Mr. Herbert MacLeod.
                                         F  2

68          Royal Society    :—Mr. O. Reynolds   on the Condensalion
its ef<U+FB01>ciency: this is particularly important with reference to the

madam-condenser.
   Second.         If
               air prevents the condensation of steam, then by send—
ing air into the boiler of a high-pressure engine, the condensation
at the surface of the cylinder will be prevented, which, if allowed
to occur, becomes a source of great waste; for when the steam
comes into a cold cylinder it condenses, heating the cylinder and
leaving water, which will again be evaporated as soon as the steam
escapes ; and this, in evaporating, will cool the cylinder.  By pre
venting this, the mixing of air with the steam would effect the same
object as the steam-jacket, only in a more ef<U+FB01>cient manner ; for the
heat communicated to the steam in the cylinder from the jacket is
not nearly so e<U+FB01>ective as that which is communicated from the
boiler, in consequence of the steam in the cylinder being at a lower
temperature than that in the boiler.
   3. The experiments for this investigation were, by the kind per—
mission of Dr. Roscoe, carried out by Mr. Pasley, a student in the
Chemical Laboratory of the Owens College; and               I
                                                       beg to tender
him my best thanks.
  4. In making these experiments two objects were particularly
kept in view :—
  First. To ascertain if there is a great di<U+FB01>erence in the rate of
condensation of pure steam and a mixture of steam and air—to
ascertain in fact whether pure steam condenses at an unlimited
s   eed.
  pSecoml. To ascertain if (and according to what
                                                     law) the e<U+FB01>ect of
 air on the condensation increases as the proportion of air to steam
 increases.
    5. Of these two undertakings the <U+FB01>rst is much the most di<U+FB02>icult.
The rate of condensation of pure steam is so great that it is prac
tically impossible to measure it; and to institute a comparison be
tween this and the condensation of a mixture of steam and air is
like comparing the in<U+FB01>nite with the <U+FB01>nite. It is practically impos
sible to keep any'surface cold when an unlimited supply of pure
steam is condensed upon           it,
                                so that under such circumstances the
quantity of pure steam condensed        limited by the power of the
                                            is
surface to carry off the heat. The best method of obtaining             a
quantitative result seems to be by introducing suf<U+FB01>cient cold water

    6. The presence of hot water in the <U+FB02>ask with the steam very
much assists in ascertaining the rapidity of condensation.      When
there     no hot water in the <U+FB02>ask, the condensation by the injected
water      is is
           only a question of time; the gauge will come to the same
point whether the condensation        quick or slow, the only differ
ence being in the speed at which
                                        it is
                                      will rise—a di<U+FB01>erence not easy
to appreciate, especially when the motion         is
                                                  quick.   But   ifhot
water     present, then as the steam in the <U+FB02>ask
           is                                          condensed
                                                       is          it   is
replaced by fresh steam from the water, and the interval between
the condensation and the consequent ebullition          the only time
                                                        is

         of a Mixture of Air and Steam upon Cold Surfaces.             69
 allowed for the creation of a vacuum; the vacuum which is attained
 in the interval will therefore depend on the rapidity of condensation.
 The interval will be very short ; and the better the vacuum the
 shorter it will be; so that unless the condensation is very sudden,
 there will be but a slight reduction of pressure.
     If, however, the condensation is really instantaneous, a perfect
 vacuum may exist for an instant.    Hence, when there is water in the
 <U+FB02>ask, the rapidity of condensation  is indicated by the height to which
 the gauge rises, instead of the speed with which it rises; and this is
 much easier to estimate.
     7. The apparatus employed in making these experiments con
 sisted of a glass <U+FB02>ask <U+FB01>tted with a mercurial vacuum-gauge and
 pipes for admitting water and air, or allowing steam to escape.
     The <U+FB02>ask and all the pipes were freed from air by boiling ; and
 when all the air had been driven out the pipes were closed, the lamp
 removed, and the <U+FB02>ask allowed to cool until the gauge showed a
 slight vacuum; the water-pipe was then opened and a few drops
 of water allowed to enter and fall through the <U+FB02>ask; as they did
 so the mercury rushed up the gauge and, by its momentum, above
 the point for a perfect vacuum, showing that the condensation was
 instantaneous.      Immediately afterwards the gauge fell nearly to
 its starting-point.    Next, the <U+FB02>ask was allowed to cool and a little
 air was let in (about equal to half an inch of mercury in the gauge,
 or about a sixtieth of the volume of the <U+FB02>ask). The lamp was
 then replaced, and the operation was repeated as before ; this time,
 however, as the cold water entered the mercury did not rush up
 the gauge, but rose slowly a small distance and there remained.
     8. This experiment shows, therefore, that there is a great diifer
 enee in the rates at which pure steam and steam with air condense
 on a cold surface, so great in fact that the speed with pure steam
 must be regarded as nearly in<U+FB01>nite.
     9. To compare the various {feats of dij'erent quantities of air, two
 methods have been used, which may be described as follows :—~
    I. A surface—condenser is formed within the boiler or <U+FB02>ask, so
 that the steam may be condensed as fast as it is generated. Then,
 when a <U+FB02>ame of a certain size acts on the boiler, the e<U+FB01>ect of the
 air is to cause the pressure of steam in the <U+FB02>ask to increase. This
 method is founded on the assumption that the rate at which steam
 will conden'se at a cold surface is, cwteris parilms, proportional to
its pressure—an assumption which is probably not far from the truth.
    H. With the samev apparatus as in method I. the rate of conden
sation is measured by the quantity of water condensed in a given
time, obtained by counting the drops from the condenser, the pres
sure Within the <U+FB02>ask being kept constant.         This method does not
involve any assumption; but the conditions for its being accurate
are such as cannot be obtained; for not only must the temperature
of the condenser and the temperature of the steam remain constant,
but the pressure of the steam must also remain constant, and if the
two former conditions are ful<U+FB01>lled the latter cannot be ; for the
temperature of the steam will be the boiling-point of the water in

    70           Royal Society          :—Mr. O. Reynolds   on the Condensation
    the <U+FB02>ask ; and if this is to remain constant, the pressure of air and
    steam mustbe constant, and therefore, as the pressure of the air in—
    creases, the pressure of the steam must decrease.       This variation of
    pressure is not very great; and its eifect may be allowed for on the
    assumption that the condensation is proportional to the pressure of
    steam.    This is accomplished by dividing the drops by the pressure
    of the steam.
       These methods, neither of which, as it appears, is rigorous,
    seem nevertheless to be the best; and fortunately the law which
    the e<U+FB01>ect of the additions of air follows is of such a decided cha
    racter as to be easily distinguished; and the two methods give
    results which are sufficiently concordant for practical purposes.        _
        10. The apparatus employed in these experiments consisted of a
    glass <U+FB02>ask, in which a surface—condenser was formed of a copper
    pipe passing in and out through the cork.           This pipe was kept
     cool by a stream of water, and was so <U+FB01>xed that all the condensed
_   water dropped from                   it,
                               and the drops could be counted.     The <U+FB02>ask
    was freed from air by boiling; the volume of air passed into the
     <U+FB02>ask could be accurately measured; and ample time was allowed
     for the air in the <U+FB02>ask to produce its effect before more was admitted.
        For the experiments according to method 1., the <U+FB02>ame under the
     <U+FB02>ask and the stream of water through the condenser were kept con
     stant from <U+FB01>rst to last. For those made according to method 11.,
     in one case the stream of water was kept constant, and in the other
    it  was altered, so that the effluent water was kept at a constant
    temperature.

method, in which the pressure within the <U+FB02>ask remained constant,
whilst the <U+FB02>ame and condensation were reduced as the air was ad—
mitted.        In this experiment the rate at which the water passed
through      the   condenser was constant from <U+FB01>rst to last, and conse
quently    the   temperature of the e<U+FB02>luent water varied with the con
densation.
     Table   III.   shows the result of an experiment, also made accord
ing    to  the    second   method, but in which the quantity of water
<U+FB02>owing through         the  condenser was so varied that the temperature

 power of the air to diminish condensation, then they will be in—
                                                                  i
 versely proportional to the quantity of water condensed, i. e. what
 would have been condensed if the pressure and other things had
 remained constant.         Hence the numbers in the column            should
                                                                    3

 be proportional       to the numbers in the column            in Tables    II.
  and   III.
      In order to compare the results of these experiments, the results
  in  each Table have been multiplied by a common factor, so that
  they may be the same when the pressure of air is one tenth that of
  the steam.       Thus the numbers in the                in Table    I,  have

  been multiplied      by 2000, and numbers under           in Table  II. by7._
  The result of the experiments thus reduced are shown in the curves
  1, 2, 3.
      The point of no air might have been chosen as the point in which
  the curves should coincide; but, as has been previously explained,
  the results under such circumstances are to be taken as indicating
  the power of the condenser to carry off the heat. Had it been
  possible to keep the condenser cool, then there is reason to believe
  that there would have been no limit to the condensation of pure
   steam, and that the true form of the curves is like that shown by
   the dots.
      Although the curves do not 'coincide, yet they are all of the same
   form, and the difference between them is not greater than can be
   accounted for by the disturbing causes already mentioned.              They
   all show that the e<U+FB01>ect of air begins to fall off rapidly when its
   pressure amounts to one tenth that of the steam, and that when
  it amounts to about one fourth that of the steam the admission of
   more air produces scarcely any e<U+FB01>ect.

   14. O'omlusvbm.-—The     conclusions to be drawn from these expe
riments are as follows :—
   1. That    small quantity of air in steam does very much retard
                        a
its condensation upon         cold surface; that, in fact, there
                                      a                             no        is
limit to the rate at which pure steam will condense but the power
of the surface to carry o<U+FB01> the heat.
    2. That the rate of condensation diminishes rapidly and nearly
uniformly as the pressure of air increases from two to ten per cent.
that of the steam, and then less and less rapidly until thirty per
cent.    reached, after which the rate of condensation remains nearly
                   is
constant.                                ‘
   3. That in consequence of this e<U+FB01>ect of air the necessary size of               a
surface-condenser for       steam-engine increases very rapidly with
                                    a
the quantity of air allowed to be present within it.
   4. That by mixing air with the steam before          used, the con
                                                                    it   is
densation_at the surface of a cylinder may be greatly diminished,
and consequently the ef<U+FB01>ciency of the engine increased.
   5. That the maximum effect, or nearly so, will be obtained when
the pressure of the air        one tenth that of the steam, or when
                                        is
about  two  cubic feet of  air at the pressure of the atmosphere and
the temperature   60°  F. are  mixed with each pound of steam.

attention was called to a statement by Sir W. Armstrong, to the
effect that Mr. Siemens had suggested as an explanation of the
otherwise anomalous advantage of forcing air into the boiler of a
steam-engine, that the air may prevent, in a great measure, the
condensation at the surface of the cylinder.   It would thus seem
that Mr. Siemens has already suggested the probability of the fact
which is proved in this investigation.     am not aware, however, I
that any previous experiments have been made on the subject, and
therefore   I
            o<U+FB02>er these results as independent testimony of the cor
rectness of Mr. Siemens’s views as well as of my own.

 colnshire limestone.”    The object of the author was to show that                                   Mn_
these two limestones were distinct, and that while the former was of
 the Great Oolite period, the latter as certainly belonged to the
Inferior Oolite; and in citing evidence in proof of this position upon
stratigraphical and palmontological grounds, he gave a general ac—
count of the geology of the northern division of Northamptonshire,
illustrating his description by the exhibition of numerous fossils
gathered from the various beds and localities referred to.

is the surface rock; and intersecting valleys upon that line, and the

    The same sequence, with the occasional superaddition of the Great
Oolite Clay, was shown to be repeated upon the western escarpment
of the lac, at Glendon, Barford Bridge, near Rockingham, at Weekly,
and at Geddington (the Lincolnshire limestone increasing in thick
 ness at every advance), and to occur over and over again upon in
numerable escarpments in the counties of Northampton, Rutland,
 Lincoln, and York, offering unmistakable and incontrovertible evi
 dence of the true stratigraphical position of the Lincolnshire lime
 stone.
     The author described the section in the ancient quarries at Weldon,
 whence is obtained the highly reputed freestone of that name. He
 exhibited a diagram of the horizontal section from Rockingham, on
 the Welland valley (which marks to the north-west the line of divi
 sion between Northamptonshire and Rutland), through Weldon, by
 Oundle, and across the Nene valley into Huntingdonshire.                       It was
 shown by     this   diagram       that, although   the  Lincolnshire   limestone  has
 a thickness of some 30 feet at Weldon, it thins out very rapidly
 eastwards, being nowhere found within three miles of Weldon, and
 being altogether absent from the Nene escarpment at Oundle, which
 presents, with this exception, the whole series of beds from the
  Oxford Clay to the Upper Lias Clay inclusive.
     The author successively described sections in the Lincolnshire
 limestone z—at Kirby, where the equivalent of the Colleyweston slate
 is quarried, this'lbeing the extreme western point at which it has been
 found; at Dcene, Wakerley, Morcot (where the whole series from
 the Cornbrash to the Upper Lias inclusive occurs, the Lineolnshire
 limestone attaining to a thickness of 60 feet), Ketton (where the
 famous Ketton frecstone is quarried), and Collcyweston.                       At the
 last-named place         the    well-known    calcareo-arenaceous      slate has been
 quarried for more             than    350  years;    and   the   numerous    quarries
 occupy an area exceeding a mile in diameter. Here everywhere
 may be noted the position of this slate-bed, passing the Lincolnshiro
  limestone series, and immediately overlying the Lower Estuarine
  Sands.

 76                        Geological Society.
    Some three miles north-east of the Colleyweston slate quarries is
the high ground of the Stamford Open Field, the summit of which is
about 200 feet above the level of the river Welland.       In this one
hill-mass occur (and may be observed) the whole series of beds
from the Cornbrash to the Upper Lias inclusive, the Lincolnshire
limestone having reached a thickness of 75 feet, and being the most
important bed of the section.
    The limestone which occurs beneath the Great Oolite Clay and
above the Upper Estuarine series high up upon the escarpment of
 Stamford Field, occurs also, at a level some 100 feet lower, at Be
misthorpe, and at Danes’ Hill and Essendine, in cuttings of the
Great Northern Railway, the only record of the sections of which
is to be found in Professor Morris’s paper in the Society’s Journal
for 1853.     This limestone has not been considered to be Great
Oolite at all; but the author showed, by a comparison of the whole
group of fossils obtained from both beds, that this limestone was
identical with the Great Oolite limestone of the Northampton district.
    The author described the peculiar effect of a fault occurring
south of the Welland at Stamford, by which the Upper Lias capped
by the Northampton Sand has been thrown up to an elevation over
topping the town.      Upon a severed and subsided mass the im
portant suburb of St. Martin’s has been built, and a peculiar repe
tition of beds has resulted—Upper Lias, Northampton Sand, Colley
weston Slate, and Lincolnshire Limestone being in a double se
quence encountered upon an ascent of the escarpment.           The fact
was stated that the Colleyweston slate was found near the foot of
the escarpment (whence the beautiful Astropecten Cotteswoldiw, var.
Sulmfordensis,Wright,was     obtained by the author in 1853),and again
upon the summit of the escarpment, at a distance of one third of a
mile, at an increased elevation of 150 feet.   Other anomalous results
of the same fault, which extends some miles eastward, were described.
   The area of the old “Barnack Rag” quarries was referred to.
These were in work in the time of the Romans, but had been
exhausted for 400 years. The stone (Lincolnshire limestone) was
the building-stone over a large district in ancient times; and its
excellence was proved by time.
   The escarpment south of the Nene valley at Wansford presents
the same sequence as that of the Stamford F ieldHCornbrash to the
Upper Lias inclusive.     The railway-tunnel is excavated in the Lin
colnshire limestone.    East of this, at Castor and Water Newton,
and west of the same point at Elton, the Lincolnshire limestone thins
away, and the two estuarine series again come together in vertical
contact. Along the Nene valley towards Northampton the southern
escarpment presents the complete sequence of beds from the Oxford
Clay to the Upper Lias inclusive (minus the Lincolnshire limestone),
as far as Thrapstone.      Here the Oxford Clay and Cornbrash part
company and trend southward, the other members of the series
(Great Oolite Clay and limestone, Upper Estuarine, Lower Estuarine,
and ferruginous beds of Northampton sand, and Upper Lias) con
tinuing on to the Northampton district.
   The author contended that the stratigraphical and palieonto

                 Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles,       77
logical evidence combined to establish the position which he assumed
in his introduction—that the Great Oolite limestone of North
ampton was identical with what he considered was Great Oolite
at Stamford, and that the “ Lincolnshire limestone
                                                     ”
                                                        was a distinct
formation, and a member of the Inferior Oolite series.
   He had con<U+FB01>dence that he had shown that the series of beds in
the north-eastern portion of the northern division of Northampton
shire comprised all the beds between the Oxford Clay and Upper
Lias inclusive, including the Lincolnshire limestone—and that those
of the south-western portion comprised the same sequence, excluding
the I/incolnshire limestone.
   He considered that the Great Oolite Clay represented the Forest
Marble and the Bradford Clay of the West of England; that the
Great Oolite limestone was nearly equivalent to the Great Oolite of
Bath and the Cotteswolds, and to the upper beds of Minchiu
hampton ; that the Upper Estuarine might be nearly identical with
the Upper Plant Shale of Yorkshire, but more certainly with the
Stones<U+FB01>eld slate of Oxfordshire; that the Lincolnshire limestone
was nearly synchronous with the grey limestone of Yorkshire (In
ferior Oolite), and probably with the lower portion of the Am.
Humphriesianus zone of the west of England, but extending a little
below this zone; that the Lower Estuarine answered to the Lower
Plant Shale of Yorkshire, but had no representative in the west;
that the upper portion of the ferruginous beds of the Northampton
Sand was nearly upon the same horizon as the Glaizedale and Dogger
beds of Yorkshire and the Am. Murchisonw zone of the west; and
that the lower portion of the Northampton sand was represented by
the Am. opalinus zone and the Midford Sand.

 ON SOME PHENOMENA           or ILLUMINATION.       BY A. LALLEMAND.
          the e<U+FB01>ects of illumination observed in diaphanous bodies
ALL     traversed'by the light of the sun, either natural or polarized,
are readily explained if it be admitted that the vibratory motion of
the tether in penetrating the transparent medium, encounters a re
sistance in virtue of which the vibrations are propagated laterally
in such a manner that along any direction oblique to the incident
ray the motion of the sethereal particle represents the projection
of that of the sether on its passage from the luminous pencil, and
if, on the other hand,  it be also admitted that the molecules of the
medium, absorbinga portion of the via viva of the tether, vibrate in
their turn and propagate in the aathereal <U+FB02>uid the complex vibra
tions which constitute natural light; The illumination therefore
results from two effects superposed     ;and the light emanating from
it    formed of two sorts of rays the one sort, always of the same
     is                             :
colour as the incident rays, are polarized either partially or com
  letely, according as the incident pencil    neutral or polarized; the
                                             is
others, the refrangibility of which      often inferior to that of the
                                        is
exciting rays, have                  of natural light, and determine a
general property oftlggproperties
                          ies which has been called <U+FB02>uorescence.     1n

78‘             Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.
the case of opaque bodies this property corresponds to what is
                                 “ the
more usually designated by             proper colour of the body.”
    I have just said that <U+FB02>uorescence is a general phenomenon of
transparent bodies. In fact, by operatingon the purest liquids
(such, for example, as are obtained by condensing a gas like sul
phurous acid, cyanogen, &c.), it is proved that the illumination is
not extinguished when we look in a direction normal to the pencil
and to the plane of polarization of the incident light; or if we view
natural light through a double prism, one of the two images of the
luminous ray never disappears completely.          Nevertheless in study
ing under better conditions some crystallized substances,          I have
been able to recognize that quartz and rock-salt, when very pure,
exhibit not the slightest trace of <U+FB02>uorescence and are illuminated
very cleanly. To succeed in this experiment, it is necessary to po
larize a large pencil of solar rays with av Foucault normal-face
prism, and to concentrate it with a quartz lens cut parallel to the
axis, of 35—40 centims. focus.        The principal sections of the polar
izer and the lens are made to coincide ; and then their movements
are rendered conjoint.      If the pencil thus concentrated pass through
the quartz either in the state of an ordinary or of an extraordinary
ray, a very distinct white trail is observed in the plane of polariza
tion, which a Nicol completely extinguishes.          On looking in a di—
rection normal to the plane of polarization, there is no illumina
tion ; there remains not the least trace of <U+FB02>uorescence. When
the solar ray traverses the quartz along the optic axis, the disper
sion of the plane of polarization has for its result the giving equal
illumination around the ray, and polarization is complete only in a
direction normal to the pencil.       In this case chromatic illumination
should be observed, similar to that of sirup of sugar and all solu
tions with rotatory power; but with quartz it is not manifest;
indeed we know that the mixed tints, much weakened, all a<U+FB01>ect a
uniform grey tint which the eye cannot distinguish.             Very pure
rock-salt is illuminated also like quartz, and is not <U+FB02>uorescent.
    It is not the same with Iceland spar. All the specimens have   I
examined are illuminated with orange-red more or less brilliant;
but this coloured illumination is the same in the plane of polariza
tion and normal to that plane; it is not extinguished by a Nicol,
when the emergent rays, which necessarily undergo double refrac
tion, remain superposed. This red light is due solely to <U+FB02>uores—
cence; and the polarized illumination resembling that of quartz is
not appreciable.                             I
                      A peculiarity which must notice is, that when
the incident solar thread is not polarized and traverses the spar
rhombohedron so as to give two pencils well separated, the <U+FB02>uores
cence due to the ordinary ray appears more vivid and of a deeper
 red than that of the extraordinary ray ; at least this is whatI have
 distinctly observed in two strongly <U+FB02>uorescent specimens. The
 <U+FB02>uorescence of spar has besides been studied by M. Becquerel with
 the phosphoroscope; and        I only con<U+FB01>rm, by another method, his
 observations.    Colourless <U+FB02>uor—spar combines with more intensity
 the two distinct properties of quartz and of spar: it gives a white
 illumination, very bright in the plane of polarization, and a violet

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                        79
indigo <U+FB02>uorescence in the direction perpendicular to it. The three
crystallized bodies quartz, spar, and <U+FB02>uorine, viewed with respect
to the illumination, represent three types, to which all transparent
bodies may be referred.             To cite only one example, not yet re
marked, pure naphthaline dissolved in alcohol or recti<U+FB01>ed essence
of petroleum has a quinic <U+FB02>uorescence of avery bright indigo-blue.
 Spectral analysis of this light gives a very intense blue band ex
tending from the line G to H and dominating the other colours of
 the spectrum, which it also includes.
      I  must also mention the curious eifects obtained with prisms of
 chilled glass. The thread of polarized light which passes through
 them gives a luminous trace, white and partially polarized at cer
 tain points, while at others it is neutral and coloured yellowish
 green or bluish green, according to the <U+FB02>uorescence of the glass
  used.     Without entering into further details, it is seen that these
  e<U+FB01>ects depend on the double refraction which the ray of light
  undergoes, and on the direction of the plane of polarization of the
                                                                   -
  illuminating pencil.
       To complete these observations           I  'will add a few words on the
  photometric       experiments     by  which    I  measured the proportion of
  polarized    light  contained   in  the  rays   emitted    by a liquid illuminated
  by    a pencil  of  natural  light.    If the  liquid   were  not <U+FB02>uorescent, the
   polarization    would    be  total  when    we    look    normally in any plane
   passing   through     the axis  of  the   pencil,   if it be admitted, as    I have
   said above, that the trajectory of an sether particle on the visual
   line is not any thing else but the projection of the circle which is
   the envelope of all the ellipses with variable orientation which re
   present the motion of the set-her in a ray of natural light.
       The veri<U+FB01>cation of this law would present no dif<U+FB01>culty, if the
   inevitable <U+FB02>uorescence of the liquid did not add to the illumination
    a proportion of neutral light—constant, it is tme, but of which it is
    necessary to take account.
       I  operated as follows, with a photometer the general arrange
    ments of which reproduce those adopted by MM. Bernard and
    Edm. Becquerel.         1 view the illuminated pencil through a Nicol,
    of which the principal section is at <U+FB01>rst normal to it; and make            I
    its light equal to that received from a lamp into a prism with total
    re<U+FB02>ection after passing through two Nicols—the <U+FB01>rst movable, the
    second <U+FB01>xed, and their principal sections coinciding.                This done,    I
    extinguish    the  portion   of polarized   light    emitted  by  the  illuminated
    liquid by turning the <U+FB01>rst prism through 90°. In order to restore
    the equality of the lights, it is then only necessary to turn the
    movable Nicol througha certain angle, which serves to vary the in
     tensity of the light for comparison.
        Let a and a’ be the angles of rotation which have restored equa
    lity of the images when the pencil was viewed, <U+FB01>rst normally, and
     then in a direction making an angle (a with the axis of the illumi
                            f
     nating pencil. If denote the proportion of <U+FB02>uorescent light, and
     m the light totally or partially polarized which comes from the
     lateral propagation of the luminiferous motion, we shall have the
     following equalities     :-

Let it   be remarked that we may suppose m=1, and that the two
terms of the second ratio should be multiplied by the same factor
variable with or, since the light emitted varies with the depth of the
luminous thread, and this changes with the inclination. Elimina—

Without entering into the detail of the experiments and the pre—
cautions taken to realize the equality of the tints of the two images
(a condition without which the equality of the lights becomes illu—

  ON A PROCESS     FOR   VERIFYING THE   NODES    IN A SOUNDING PIPE.
                           BY M. BOURBOUZE.
    The nodes of vibration in pipes are the places where the air is
motionless, but where it undergoes alternate compressions and di
latations synchronous with the duration of the vibration.          They
are usually veri<U+FB01>ed by showing that a membrane covered with sand,
introduced into the tube, does not vibrate.
    M. Kosnig has contrived placing in the side of the pipe acapsule
closed interiorly by a <U+FB02>exible membrane, and through which circu
lates a current of illuminating gas, which is lighted. When the
pipe carries the compressed membrane, it alternately dilates the
current of carburetted hydrogen, and the <U+FB02>ame undergoes oscilla
tions which are ascertained by viewing them in a revolving mirror.
 This procedure is excellent, but does not lend itself to the projec
tions which are necessary in lectures.
     I replace these capsules by a simple membrane of <U+FB02>exible caout
 chouc, upon which       I <U+FB01>x a very light silvered mirror, so that it
 oscillates with the membrane.      Consequently, if the rays from a
 luminous point be thrown upon this mirror, and the image be pro—
 jected by a lens, the image will be seen to elongate, as in the expe
 riments of M. Lissajous, and frequently to be transformed into an
 ellipse.   It has its maximum of elongation when the mirror is at
 the node; it approaches immobility, and at length remains motion
 less, as the mirror is removed from the node to be placed on a loop.
     This membrane can be placed at the extremity of a Helmholtz
 resonator, or at the end of a caoutchouc tube <U+FB01>xed to the extremity
 of that instrument; and we can assure ourselves that the mirror
 vibrates when we produce in the vicinity a mixed sound containing
 the note proper to the resonator. _
     The new process replaces with advantage, in lectures and in re
  rearches of investigation, those which have till now been made use
  of.—C'omptes Rmdus (lc Z’Académie rles Sciences, vol. lxxvii. p. 1099.

time occupied.      A few further details were communicated to the
British Association at Brighton (Brit. Assoc. Report, p. 39). I
now propose to give the results of more recent experience in the
practical manufacture of gratings, as well as some theoretical
conclusions    which have been in manuscript since the subject
<U+FB01>rst engaged my attention.
   There are two distinct methods of copying practised by the
photographer—(l)         by means of the camera, (2) by contact
printing. The <U+FB01>rst, if it were practicable for our purpose, would
have the advantage of leaving the scale arbitrary, so that copies
of varying degrees of <U+FB01>neness might be taken from the same
original.    By this method     I  have obtained a photograph of a
piece of striped stuff on such a scale that there was room for
about 200 lines in front of the pupil of the eye, capable of show
ing lateral images of a candle; but       I soon found that the inhe
rent imperfections of our optical appliances, if not the laws of
light themselves, interposed an almost insuperable obstacle to
obtaining adequate results.
   However perfect a lens may be, there is a limit to its powers
of condensing light into apoint.        Even if the source from which

  the light proceeds be in<U+FB01>nitely small, the image still consists of
  a spot   of <U+FB01>nite size surrounded by dark and bright rings.                    That
  this must be so may be shown by general considerations without
  any calculations.         lfa lens is absolutely free from aberration,
  the secondary waves issuing from the different parts of its hinder
  surface agree perfectly in phase at the focal point.                    Let us con
  sider the illumination at a neighbouring point in the focal
  plane.       If the distance between the two points is so small that
  the difference of the distances between the point under consi
  deration and the nearest and furthest parts of the object—glass is
  but a small fraction of the wave-length (7x), the group of secon
  dary waves are still sensibly in agreement, and therefore give a
   resultant illumination the same as before.                At a certain distance
  from the focal point the secondary waves divide themselves into
  two mutually destructive groups, corresponding to the nearer
  and further parts of the object-glass.                There is therefore here a
  dark ring.         Further out there is again light, then another dark
  ring, and so on, the intensity of the bright rings, however, ra
  pidly diminishing.
       The radius 1' of the <U+FB01>rst dark ring subtends                 at the centre of

                          Theory   of Di<U+FB02>'raclz'on-gratings.                        83
above calculation, being founded on the supposition of entire
 freedom from aberration, both spherical and chromatic, is sub
ject in practice to a large modi<U+FB01>cation. In astronomical tele
scopes, where every thing is sacri<U+FB01>ced to the requirement of ex
treme de<U+FB01>nition at the centre of the <U+FB01>eld, the theoretical limit
is sometimes closely approached; but the case is very di<U+FB02>'erent
with a photographic lens.   In fact the very <U+FB01>rst thing it occurs
to a photographer to do, when he wishes to improve the de<U+FB01>nition,
is to contract the aperture of his lens by means of a stop—a
course which would be attended with the opposite result in the
case   of perfect object-glass, or eve'n a good astronomical tele
            a
scope. While, therefore, it might be too much to say that the
reproduction of 3000 lines in an inch by lens and camera is im
possible, the attempt to do so without very special appliances
appears in a high degree unpromising.          It would certainl
require a lens more than usually free from spherical aberration,

using approximately             homogeneous light.     It must be under

vering  a small space           with lines at the rate  3000 to the inch,

    The method of contact-printing, on the other hand,               free      is
from optical dif<U+FB01>culties.      The photographic <U+FB01>lm prepared on                     a
<U+FB02>at piece of glass (or other support) may be brought              mode    by
rate pressure in      printing-frame within

 moderately    small  and   the  rays  fall perpendicularly, the copy
rarely fails in de<U+FB01>nition, unless through some photographic de
fect. When direct processes not depending on development are
 employed, the unclouded light of the sun            is
                                                  necessary.    To avoid
too much diffused light,        usually place
                                   I            the  printing-frame on
the <U+FB02>oor of     a room into which the sun shines, and adjust its
position until the light re<U+FB02>ected from the plate-glass front                        is
sent back approximately in the direction of the sun.          Too much
time should not be lost in this operation, which requires no par
ticular precision.     Usually     cut off part of the extraneous light

 84            Lord Rayleigh        on the   Manufacture and
 necessary.    In an early stage of an investigation, when the
 causes of failure are numerous and unknown, it is best to exclude
 every thing that can possibly be supposed to be prejudicial.
 When the principal dif<U+FB01>culties have been overcome, it will be
 time enough to determine what precautions are necessary, ifthe
 question has not been already settled by accidental experience.
    In the case of developed plates there is more choice of lights
 in consequence of the higher sensitiveness.          I
                                                 have used success
 fully cloud or skylight re<U+FB02>ected horizontally from the zenith by
 a mirror through a hole of two or three inche     diameter in the
 shutter of      a darkened room,'the frame being set up in a vertical
  plane    at  a   few feet distance.    The principal objection to this
 plan is the dif<U+FB01>culty of estimating the exp0sure with proper pre
 cision—a dif<U+FB01>culty which is more felt than in ordinary photo
 graphy, as it is convenient to develop a good many copies at
 once.      On a really <U+FB01>ne day the image of the sun formed by a
 condensing-lens of short focus placed in the shutter (as used in
 diffraction experiments) constitutes a very convenient source of
 light.      As the exposure is only a few seconds, there is no dif<U+FB01>
 culty    in   dodging isolated clouds, whose progress may be
 watched from within by examining their image with a coloured
 glass.      When there is any haze, this method is not more satis
 factory    than    the other.
     With the more sensitive proersses arti<U+FB01>cial light may be em
 ployed.   I      have done a good many copies by the aid of a mode
 rator-lamp (without the globe) at two feet distance from the
 frame.       An Argand gas-<U+FB02>ame would probably be still better;
     The printing-frame   I       employ has a thick plate-glass front,
against which the original grating and the prepared plate are
 pressed by screws.           These are more under control than the
springs generally         used  in the common printing-frames. When
every thing is ready, the original is placed on the glass front of
the frame with the engraved face upwards, care being taken to
exclude all grit by means of a camel’s-hair brush.         The prepared
plate   is  then     placed  face downwards  on the grating, then a pad
to equalize the pressure (I have used one of india-rubber), and on
the pad the rigid back of the frame, on which the screws are
made to press with a moderate force. When the <U+FB01>lm is delicate,
care should be taken to place it in the proper position at once
without sliding.
   The two surfaces of the plate-glass front ofthe printing-frame
and the back of the original grating may be cleaned in the'ordi
nary way with a soft cloth or wash-leather; but the engraved
face of the grating requires more delicate treatment.   If touched
at all with a solid (wash-leather),   the greatest care should be
used.    I prefer to wash when soiled, with stream of water
                              it,                     a

 from   a tap, afterwards   <U+FB02>ooding it with pure alcohol and setting
 it up to drain and dry spontaneously.          Sometimes I have found
 nitric acid useful; but I always try to avoid the rubbing contact
 of a solid. These precautions have been so successful that, after
 several hundred copies have been taken, the originals have
 scarcely, if at all, deteriorated.                      ,
    For the support of the photographic <U+FB01>lm it is no doubt most
 satisfactory to use optically worked “parallel” glass. Ordinary
 glass would fail, for two reasons. In the <U+FB01>rst place it would ge
 nerally be impossible to secure a suf<U+FB01>ciently close contact in the
 printing.     But even if this dif<U+FB01>culty could be surmounted, the
 spectrum given by the copy would not bear the magnifying
 power which it is generally desirable to apply.              It is indeed
 evident that the glass support of the grating requires the same
 precision of workmanship as the object-glass of the telescope
 used in conjunction with it.
    Although ordinary glass taken at random is inadmissible,               I
 have done a great number of excellent gratings on selected
 pieces of patent plate.      In order to choose the best, lay theI
 plates  on  a table in such   a position that the bars of a window or
 skylight are seen re<U+FB02>ected in them.        Each bar appears in general
 double, one image corresponding to each surface.               By sliding
 the plate about, while the head is kept still, irregularities are
 easily detected by the shifting or curvature of the images. From
 a package of two dozen 5 x 4 plates as issued by photographic
 dealers, three or four, often lying together, may usually be se
 lected as <U+FB02>at enough for the purpose, or at any rate decidedly
 superior to the remainder.        It is worth notice that the object
 aimed at is <U+FB02>atness of the two faces, exact parallelism being of
 much less consequence; for it is evident that the interposition of
a truly worked prism of very acute angle would produce no evil
 result. A glass is therefore not to be rejected merely because
 the two images of the bar seen re<U+FB02>ected in it are decidedly sepa
 rated.    The question is rather whether this separation remains
 constant as the plate is moved about without rotation.              I have
never seen a piece of patent plate       that could  not   be  at once dis
tinguished from worked glass in the way described; so that the
 test is abundantly suf<U+FB01>cient for the purpose.          The more delicate
methods by which worked glass is examined would be less prac
tically useful.
    Whatever kind of glass be used, if the photographic process
be at all complicated, there is considerable economy of labour in
preparing comparatively large pieces, to be afterwards cut with
the diamond to the required size.           A 5 X 4, or even a 4% x 3%
plate will do very well for four gratings.         In the case of worked
glass economy is an object; but when patent plate is used                  I

86             Lord Rayleigh    on the  Manufacture and
should recommend 5x4 glasses, as a margin is convenient.
Even when, as in the collodio-chloride process to be presently
described, the plate for each grating is prepared separately, it is
convenient to perform the preliminary operations of cleaning
and albumenizing on larger pieces.            The cutting of prepared
plates requires a little care.     I place them face downwards on a
sheet of clean paper, make the diamond cuts on the back, and
then, before breaking, remove as much as possible of the glass
powder.      As it is important to prevent any grit from getting
 between the <U+FB01>lm and the engraved face of the original, I usually
 brush the surface with a large camel’s-hair brush kept scrupu
                                                    "
lously clean.
    In the preparation of the plates       I  have used a considerable
variety of methods.       The process with gelatine and bichromatc
 of potash described in my previous papers has decided advan
tages; but all my efforts to obtain a mastery of it have been
unavailing.     Plates prepared to all appearance in precisely the
same manner, and even at the same time, turned out differ
                                                                            '
ently, while modi<U+FB01>cations purposely introduced seemed to be for
the most part- without e<U+FB01>'ect.         It required a strong scienti<U+FB01>c
prejudice to hold the uniformity of nature in the face of so
much adverse evidence.        The uncertainty of this method is pro
voking,   as some  of  the  results are exceedingly good ; but      I gave
up my attempts sooner than I might otherwise have done in
consequence of the discovery of another method by which most
of the advantages of the gelatine process, namely simplicity of
 manipulation and brilliancy of results, might be attained with
 much less risk of failure.
    It is very possible that a photographer skilled in the employ
ment of gelatine might succeed where           I  failed.    In case any
 such should wish to make the attempt, I will mention a few
points that seemed important. The solution of gelatine should
 be carefully <U+FB01>ltered.       For thick liquids containing gelatine,
albumen, &c., the best <U+FB01>ltering material that I know of is tow.
 The tow should be cleaned from grease by boiling with soda and
 subsequent washing, and a small plugget of it pushed with mo
 derate force into the neck of the funnel. Some arrangement must
 be adopted for keeping the gelatine hot, or the operation             will
 hardly succeed.     It is important that the coat of gelatine should
 be even, for which object the glass must be free from grease,
 and the plate on which the prepared glasses are put away to set
 perfectly level.   Even then a good deal depends on the manipu
lation ; but this is soon learned. The uniformity of the coat may
 be tested by the colour when the plate is placed on a sheet of
white paper and examined in a weak white light.               By candle
 light the  colour of weak   bichromate    of potash   is scarcely visible.

                     Theory  of Difraction-gratings.                   87
The exposure may be from two to six minutes to the direct rays
of the sun.     I have not been able to detect any deterioration
when the plates were kept a few days in the dark before being
used.
    A photographer accustomed to either the plain albumen or the
Taupenot process will <U+FB01>nd it very suitable for gratings. The h'ard~
ness of the surface, which allows varnish to be dispensed with,
is a great advantage.      In my experiments with plain albumen,
the principal di<U+FB01>ieulty was the purely photographic one of avoid
ing stains.    It must be observed, however, that in actual use the
gratings are not seen in focus, and that excellent spectra may be
obtained from copies which a photographer Would be inclined to
 throw away at once as hopelessly faint and dirty.         The objection
to the Taupenot process is the trouble of preparing the plates;
 but this is much mitigated when the plan is adopted of prepa
 ring large pieces to be afterwards cut up.
     Among those requiring development, the tannin process is the
 one with which    I  have been most successful.      In order to coun
 teract the well-known tendency of the <U+FB01>lm to loosen, a prelimi
 nary coating ot' dilute albumen or gelatine is generally necessary.
 In the production of gratings the photographer must not be
 satis<U+FB01>ed with merely keeping the <U+FB01>lm on the glass; the slight
 est tendency to looseness must be considered highly objection
 able.    The plates are coated with Mawson’s collodion, excited
 in an ordinary silver-bath, washed <U+FB01>rst in distilled water and
 afterwards under the tap, and then immersed for a minute in
 a well-<U+FB01>ltered 15-grain solution of tannin.          011 removal from
 the tannin, they are set up cornerwise on blotting-paper to drain
 and dry.
     For the development of these plates I prefer a solution of gallie
 acid employed in a dish, though            I have obtained very good
 results by the ordinary method with pyrogallic acid.            Prepare
 the two following :—
             (1)   Gallic acid    .  .    .   .  100 grains.

     The dish used for developing should be of glass, and is best
  cleaned with a little strong nitric acid, which may be used over
  and over again.     The developing solution is prepared by mixing
  (1) and (2) in equal parts and diluting with water to half the

tion may take an hour; but much depends upon the exp0sure,
and still more upon the temperature.                 The proper point to
which to carry the development can only be learned by experi
ence; but the beginner is most likely to err on the side of excess,
 particularly if he uses pyrogallic acid.           If, as is desirable, the
<U+FB01>lm be creamy and thick, the spectra           of  a candle do not appear
 to advantage at this stage, in consequence of the unaltered iodide
of silver. For <U+FB01>xing, “ hypo” is the safest, though cyanide may
be used if the <U+FB01>lm will bear it.
    Tannin plates when <U+FB01>nished are hardly secure without var
nish ; but there is considerable risk of spoiling gratings in the
operation if an ordinary negative varnish be used.              The crystal
 (benzole)    varnish,  which  is applied    cold,   is much   easier to use
and gives adequate protection.

    But the process which am now most inclined to recommend
is that introduced by Mr. Wharton Simpson, and known as the
collodio-chloride process. The collodion, which may be procured
ready for use from Messrs. Mawson and Swan, of Newcastle,
consists of an emulsion of <U+FB01>nely divided chloride of silver held
in suspension by the dissolved gun-cotton, together with a care
 fully adjusted excess of free nitrate.         After a time the chloride
of silver is precipitated and the preparation becomes useless ; but
if properly mixed in the <U+FB01>rst instance, it will remain <U+FB01>t for use
for weeks or even months. In the production of gratings the
consumption is very small; so that, if required for this purpose
alone, it is well to order it in small quantities.
    In order to secure a proper adhesion, I have found a prelimi
nary coating of albumen absolutely necessary.               The white of an
egg beaten up with a pint of distilled water gives a solution of
suf<U+FB01>cient strength.       The plates, previously cleaned, are coated
in any way that may be found convenient, and then set up on
blotting-paper to drain and dry.              The principal precautions
necessary are to <U+FB01>lter the albumen very carefully and to work in
a room free from dust.        It will generally be convenient to pre
pare   a considerable    number     of plates at a time.        Though of
almost in<U+FB01>nitesimal thickness, the <U+FB01>lm of albumen produces a
ver marked effect. Without the albumen the skin of collodion
wilfusually come right away from the glass when washed under
the tap; with it the adhesion is remarkably good, and the <U+FB01>lm
so tough as even to bear rubbing with the <U+FB01>nger while wet.
    The plate is coated with collodion in the ordinary way, and,
after resting a few seconds, is dried by heat over a spirit-lamp
or otherwise.      After the plate has been made quite warm, it is
put   aside  in  the dark to cool and to absorb a certain amount of
moisture from the atmosphere.           This may take <U+FB01>ve or ten mi
nutes.     If  the plate is used too soon the result is unsatisfactory      ;

but, on the other hand, it will not do to leave it long enough to
become sensibly moist.          Something will probably 'depend on the
particular sample of collodio-chloride.
    The exposure required is about <U+FB01>ve or seven minutes to the
autumn sun.       On a hazy day something more may be required;
but if there are many clouds about, the experimenter, unless na
turally of a good temper, will do well to postpone his operations.
    On removal from the frame, the plates may be placed in a dish
of water until it is convsnient to <U+FB01>nish them.           They are <U+FB01>xed,
without any toning, in a dilute solution of hyposulphite of soda,
such as is used for paper prints, and then carefully washed.
The most effective washing is a combination of rinsing and soak
ing. My practice is to rinse the plates under the tap for half a
minute in order to remove the greater part of the hyposulphite
of soda, and then to allow them to soak for an hour or two in
water changed two or three times.              After a <U+FB01>nal rinsing the
plates may be set up to dry.
    Gratings <U+FB01>nished in this way give excellent de<U+FB01>nition, but the
spectra are rather de<U+FB01>cient in brilliancy.         This defect is of less
importance than might be supposed; for in order to see the
<U+FB01>ner <U+FB01>xed lines, sunlight is in any case indispensable, and with
sunlight there is usually illumination to spare.        Nevertheless, as
gratings   are likely  to  be  largely  used for the purpose of popular
illustration under circumstances where arti<U+FB01>cial light must be
employed, I am glad to be in a position to recommend a simple
mode of treatment by means of which the brilliancy of the spectra
may be materially enhanced.            For this purpose it is only neces
sary to treat the <U+FB01>xed and washed impression with a solution of
corrosive sublimate.        When the whitening effect is complete,
the plate must be again washed and then set up to dry.              Con
sidered as a photographic transparency, the grating is reduced
rather than heightened in intensity by this process.           The cause
of the improvement of the spectra will be touched upon presently.
These mercury-treated          gratings cannot be varnished without
sacri<U+FB01>cing   most   of  the   advantage of the method.       I have occa
sionally applied the same treatment successfully to tannin plates.
    When not in use, the <U+FB01>nished gratings should be kept in a
dry place and protected from dust and other atmospheric de
posit. For this purpose they may be put away wrapped in paper.
For a short time there is no objection to leaving them standing,
face inwards, against a wall ; but a better plan is to place them,
face downwards, on a <U+FB02>at and thoroughly clean piece of plate
glass.
    The originals from which 1 have hitherto taken copies are
three in number.        Two are by Nobert, and contain respectively
3000 and 6000 lines, in each case covering a square inch (Paris).

On   a casual inspection the second, apart from the greater num
ber of its lines, would be preferred as presenting a more even
appearance.     The 3000-line grating is divided into three parts,
giving spectra of differing degrees of brightness, corresponding
no doubt to a variation in the cut of the diamond or other stone
employed, a peculiarity which is faithfully preserved in the
copies.    But on actual trial it is found that the spectra of the
3000—line grating are much the best in respect of de<U+FB01>nition;
and the same difference is observed in the copies.            The supe
rior brillianoy of the closer-ruled grating is thus of little or no
advantage for the investigation of the solar spectrum.          In order
to make good use of      it,   ahigher degree of magnifying-power
 would be necessary than the de<U+FB01>nition of the spectra will hear.

grating can be seen on a screen.        By the second the aspect of
the plane of the grating can be judged of ; and when the line of
spectra is horizontal, it will be known that the lines of the gra
ting are vertical and parallel to the slit. As object-glass, I am
in the habit of using a single lens of about 24 inches solar
focus.    The eyepiece is a high-power achromatic, supplied by
Mr. Browning, and forms, with the object-glass, a telescope
of much higher magnifying-power than is ordinarily used in
spectroscopes.      Without a high power it is impossible to bring
out the full value of the grating. In order to obtain the best
 de<U+FB01>nition, it is necessary to adjust carefully the aspect of the
 object-glass ; and I <U+FB01>nd that the best aspect is not always the
 same.    It is possible that the performance of other optical in
 struments might occasionally be improved if means were pro
 vided for a slight alteration in the direction of the optic axis of
 one of the lenses employed.       The grating itself I usually place
 approximately in the position     of minimum deviation.
     The copies on worked glass by the ordinary photographic
 processes and by the modi<U+FB01>cation of the collodio-chloride last
 described rarely fail in de<U+FB01>nition.       With the original (3000)
 grating, or with the     copieg,
                                   I  can make out nearly, but not
 quite, all that is shown in Angstriim’s map.          With this grating
 the third spectrum is generally the mest serviceable.            When
 the picked patent plate is employed, there will generally be a
 proportion whose performance is less satisfactory, though few
  which would not give very fair results when tested by a low
 power only.      Some cannot be considered inferior to the worked
 glass, at least when  the object-glass is specially adjusted for them.
  In many cases the de<U+FB01>nition may be considerably improved by
  the use of a diaphragm in the form of alwrizantal slit, so placed
 that only the central parts of the lines of the grating are opera
 tive.   In respect of brilliancy, gratings may be more quickly
 judged of; it is suf<U+FB01>cient merely to examine the spectra of a
  candle placed in a dark room.
     The lines themselves are of course too close to be seen with
  out a microscope ; but their presence may be detected, and even
  the interval between them measured, without optical aid, by a
  method not depending on the production of spectra or requi

  phic copies containing    the  same  number   of  lines to the inch be
  placed in contact, <U+FB01>lm to <U+FB01>lm, in such a manner that the lines
  are nearly parallel in the two gratings, a system of parallel
  bars develops itself, whose direction bisects the external angle
  between the directions of the original lines, and whose distance in
  creases as the angle of inclination diminishes.        The cause of the
  phenomenon will be readily understood by drawing on paper two

     When examined under the microscope, the opaque bar on the
 copy, which corresponds to the shadow of the groove of the ori
 ginal,    is seen to be composite, being not unfrequently traversed
 along    its  length     byseveral <U+FB01>ne lines of transparency.         In one
 case, where the copy was on common glass, this e<U+FB01>'ect went so
 far that at certain parts of the grating the periodicity was altered
 by   each line splitting into two, the <U+FB01>rst spectrum altogether dis
 appearing.       In order to make this observation, the eye should
 be placed at the point where the pure spectra are formed and be
 focused on the grating.           The places in question will then ap

         GENTLEMEN,                                       January 11, 1874.
          R.  BROUGII, in         the last Number of this Journal, has
                                                                 “ On the best
           called attention to the fact that, in a paper
   Arrangement of Wheatstone’s Bridge,” in the Philosophical Ma
   gazine for February 1873,       I  did not start from the general equa
   tion for  the   strength  of  the   current through the galvanometer
   irrespective of a balance,     but  took that form which the expression
   assumes when at a balance.           In fact    I assumed (ad—be) to be
   inde<U+FB01>nitely small.       My reason for doing so was, that the ques
   tion was to <U+FB01>nd the best arrangement at a balance, the great
   object of resistance-measuring          being to yet a balance; besides
   which, the course      I adopted led to much greater simplicity and
   no less accuracy.
      To take the special case upon which Mr. Brough dwells, viz.
   to <U+FB01>nd the best resistance for the galvanometer.             This amounts
")
   to <U+FB01>nding the resistance external to the galvanometer; and when
   a balance is obtained, as the galvanometer and battery are conju

gate resistances, the resistance of the latter does not appear in
the expression for the resistance external to the galvanometer,
which is not in any way affected by the battery resistance.              Si
milarly   for    the  resistance   external    to the  battery,  which, at  a
balance,   is  independent    of  the  galvanometer    resistance.  I cannot
agree with Mr. Brough that to <U+FB01>nd the resistance in either case
at a balance is a mere mathematical problem destitute of phy
sical meaning; for it is only when at a balance that the problem
has any practical importance.
    As Mr. Brough most truly observes, most Wheatstone’ s bridges
are wrongly arranged.          An excellent example of this once came
under my notice.          A gentleman informed me he was about to
make a Wheatstone’s bridge, a great improvement, and very eco
nomical. Instead of using three separate sets of resistance-coils
 (a, b, c) he would use only one (0); for he would make a and b
equal to 0.        Mr. Harris’s arrangement appeared to succeed ad
mirably.      There   was no dif<U+FB01>culty whatever in getting a zero; in
fact there was always a balance, whether the line under examina
tion was long or short. There was only one drawback ; and that
was, the improvement          afforded no information whatever as to
the resistance of the line.

    P.S.—The condition that the galvanometer should connect the
junction of the two greatest with the junction of the two least of
the resistances, is necessarily complied with by the equations I
have given for the best arrangement with a given galvanometer
 and battery; else it would not be the best arrangement.

                                 Introduction.
             subjects have excited more interest and attention than
 FEWthe        cause of ocean circulation; and yet few are in a more
 imperfect and unsatisfactory condition, nor is there any ques
 tion regarding which a greater diversity of opinion has prevailed.
 Our incomplete acquaintance with the facts relating to the cur
 rents of the ocean and the modes of circulation actually in ope_
 ration, is no doubt one reason for this state of things.                But
 doubtless the principal cause of such diversity of opinion lies in

      Mr.     J.   Croll on   the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.          95
the fact that the question is one which properly belongs to the
domain of physics and mechanics, while as yet no physicist of
note    (if we except Dr. Colding, of Copenhagen) has given, as far
as
 I    know, any special attention to the subject.           It true that in
                                                               is

tinually    made    to such  eminent   physicists    as Herschel, Pouillet,
Buff, and others; but when we turn to the writings of these
authors we <U+FB01>nd merely          few remarks expressive of their opinions
                                    a
on the subject, and no special discussion or investigation of the
matter, nor any thing which could warrant us in concluding
that such investigations have ever been made. At present the
 question cannot be decided                   by
                                        reference to authorities.
                                                   a
    The various theories on the subject may be classed under two
 divisions: the <U+FB01>rst of these attributes the motion of the water to
 the impulse         the wind, and the second to the force
                    of                                               gravity
                                                                     of
 resulting from difference of density.          The latter may be subdi
 vided into two classes.       The <U+FB01>rst of these (of which Maury may
 be regarded as the representative)           attributes the Gulf-stream
 and other sensible currents       of the  ocean    to difference of speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity. The other class (at present the more popular of the
 two, and of which Dr. Carpenter may be considered the repre
 sentative) denies altogether that such currents can be produced
 by   difference of speci<U+FB01>c gravity*, and af<U+FB01>rms that there                   is   a
 general movement of the upper portion of the ocean from the
 equator to the poles, and         counter movement of the under por
                                        a
 tion from the poles to the equator.            This movement          attri
                                                                         is
 buted    to  difference  of  speci<U+FB01>c gravity between‘equatorial and
 polar water, resulting from di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature.
     The former theory        Iexamined at some length in           paper in
                                                                     a
 the Philosophical Magazine for October 1870, and the latter
 theory in     a paper in the same journal for October 1871.           Since
 then Dr. Carpenter has done me the honour, in                  a paper read
 before the Royal Society         to discuss at considerable length the
                                        1',
 various objections advanced                   by
                                       me to his theory. He has also in
 this memoir stated and explained his views on several points
 more fully than on former occasions.               He further restates at
 some length the various facts for which his theory              designed to
                                                                is

96            Mr.   J.   Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean- currents.
assumes to exist.                I
                          have also considered more in detail what
seem to me to be the radical defects of his theory, and have again
reviewed some matters regarding which he appears to have
slightly misapprehended the drift of my argument.              It was
shown on a former occasion that, if the heat received by the ocean
in intertropical regions were'distributed over the globe, not by
currents produced by the wind, but by means of a circulation due
to difference of temperature between equatorial and polar waters,
then there could be no secular changes of climate resulting from
variations in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit—because such
a mode of circulation would, as                     I
                                       have shown, tend to neutralize
the effects which would otherwise result from an increase of
eccentricity.                                   I
                  For this reason have been the more anxious to
prove   that  intertropical heat is conveyed to temperate and polar
regions by ocean-currents,        and not by means of any general
movement of the ocean resulting from difference of gravity.                    I
have therefore on this account entered more fully into that part
of the subject than              I
                          otherwise would have done.     Irrespective
of all this, however, the important nature of the whole question,
and the very general interest it excites, may be regarded as suf~
<U+FB01>cient excuse for the length of the present communication.
Circumstances over which                   I
                                    had no control have delayed its
publication for nearly    a year.
                          The Facts and their Explanation.
          I
  '
      “ have thought it desirable,” says Dr. Carpenter, “to deve
lope somewhat at length what                    I
                                    regard as the bearings of the
 results obtained by these inquiries upon the doctrine of a general
oceanic circulation sustained by difference of temperature. . . . .
As no similarly comprehensive examination has been made, so
far as        I
          am aware, by any other scienti<U+FB01>c inquirer, and as the
doctrine put forth on the subject by Mr. Croll is likely, if not
thus scrutinized, to command the unquestioning assent of those
who regard him as a high authority on the subject of oceanic
currents and their hearings on geological questions,         venture  I
to hope that the conclusion of its results as an appendix to this
Report Will not be deemed inappropriate” (p. 538).
    The Facts to be explained—He then commences by giving a
restatement of the facts for the explanation of which his theory of
a general oceanic circulation has been advanced. It is well known
that, wherever temperature-observations    have been made in the
Atlantic, the bottom of that ocean has been found to be occupied by
water of an ice-cold temperature.    And this holds true not merely
of the Atlantic, but also of the ocean' in intertropical regions               ‘a.
fact which has been proved                 by
                                 repeated observations, and more
particularly of late             by
                       those of Commander Chimmo in the China

      Mr.  J. Croll on the Physical   Cause of Ocean-currents.        97
Sea and Indian Ocean, where a temperature as low as 32° Fahr.
was found at a depth of 2656 fathoms.             In short the North
Atlantic, and probably the intertropical seas also, may be re
garded, Dr. Carpenter considers, as divided horizontally into
two great layers or strata—an upper warm, and a lower cold
stratum. All these facts I, of course, freely admit; nor am I
aware that their truth has been called in question by any one,
no matter what his views may have been as to the mode in which
they are to be explained.
    The Explanation of the Facts—We have next the explanation
of the facts, which is simply this :'——-The cold water occupying
the bottom of the Atlantic and of intertropical seas is to be ac
counted for by the supposition that it came from the polar regions.
This is obvious, because the cold possessed by the water could
not have been derived from the crust of the earth beneath:
neither could it have come from the surface; for the temperature
of the bottom water is far below the normal temperature of the
latitude in which it is found. Consequently             “ the inference
seems irresistible that this depression must be produced and
maintained by the convection of cold from the polar towards the
equatorial area.”     Of course, if we suppose a <U+FB02>ow of water from
the poles towards the equator, we must necessarily infer a counter
<U+FB02>ow from the equator towards the poles; and while the water
<U+FB02>owing from equatorial to polar regions will be warm, that
<U+FB02>owing from polar to equatorial regions will be cold. The doc
trine of a mutual interchange of equatorial and polar water is
therefore a necessary consequence from the admission of the fore
                                                     I
going facts. With this ezjolanalion of the facts need hardly say
that  I                        I
        fully agree; nor am aware that its correctness has ever
been disputed. Dr. Carpenter surely cannot charge me with over
looking the fact of a mutual interchange of equatorial and polar
water, seeing that my estimate of the thermal power of the
Gulf-stream, from which it is proved that the amount of heat
conveyed from equatorial to temperate and polar regions is enor
mously greater than had ever been anticipated, was made a con
siderable time before he began to write on the subject of oceanic
circulation *. And in my paper “ On Ocean-currents in relation
                                                   I
to the Distribution of Heat over the Globe” T, have endeavoured
to show that, were it not for the raising of the temperature of
polar and high temperate regions and the lowering of the tem
perature of intertropical regions by means of this interchange of
water, these portions of the globe would not be habitable by the
present existing orders of beings.

98     Mr.  J.  Croll on  the  Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
   The explanation goes further :—“ It is along the surface and
upper portion of the ocean that the equatorial waters <U+FB02>ow towards
the poles, and it is along the bottom and under portion of the
ocean that polar waters <U+FB02>ow towards the equator; or, in
other words, the warm water keeps the upper portion       '
                                                                  of the
ocean and the cold water the under portion.”                 With =this
explanation    I  to a great extent agree.         It is evident that,
in reference to the northern hemisphere at least, the most
of the water which <U+FB02>ows from intertropical to polar regions (as,
for example, the Gulf-stream) keeps to the surface and upper
portion of the ocean; but, for reasons which I have stated in
my last paper*, a very large proportion of this water must return
in the form of under currents; or, which is the same thing, the
return compensating current, whether it consist of the actual
water which originally came from the equator or not, must <U+FB02>ow
towardsZthe equator as an under current.          That the cold water
which is found at the bottom of the Atlantic and of intertropical
seas must have come as under currents is perfectly obvious, be—
cause water which should come along the surface of the ocean
from the polar regions would not be cold when it reached in
                                                                      , \
tertropical regions.‘                                           I
    The explanation hypothetical.—Here the general agreement
between us in a great measure terminates; for Dr. Carpenter is
not satis<U+FB01>ed with the explanation generally adopted by the ad
vocates of the wind theory, viz. that the cold water found in tem
perate and intertropical areas comes from polar regions as com
pensating under currents, but advances a hypothetical form of
circulation to account for the phenomenon.            He assumes that
there is a general set or <U+FB02>ow of the surface and upper portion of
the ocean from the equator to polar regions, and a general set or
<U+FB02>ow of the bottom and under portion of the ocean from polar
regions to the equator.        Mr. Ferrel (‘ Nature,’ June 13, 1872)
speaks   of that  “interchanging     motion of the water between the
equator   and   the  pole   discovered  by Dr. Carpenter.”     In this,
however, Mr.     Ferrel   is  mistaken; for Dr. Carpenter not only
makes no claim to any discovery of the kind, but distinctly ad
mits that none such has yet been made. Although in some of
his papers he speaks of a “set of warm surface-water in the
 southern oceans toward the Antarctic pole
                                                ” as being well known
to navigators, yet he nowhere af<U+FB01>rms, as far as I know, that the
 existence of such a general oceanic circulation as he advocates
has ever been directly determined from observations.                This
mode of circulation is simply inferred or assumed           in order to
 account for the facts referred to above.           “At present,” Dr.
 Carpenter says,
                     “ claim for it no higher character than that

of a good working hypothesis to be used as a guide in further
          ”
inquiry      (§ 16) ; and lest there should be any misapprehension
on this point, he cloes his memoir thus :—“ At present, as             I
have already said,     I claim for the doctrine of a general oceanic
circulation no higher a character than that of a good working
hypothesis consistent with our present knowledge of facts, and
therefore entitled to be provisionally adopted for the purpose of
stimulating and directing further inquiry.”
    I am unable to agree with Dr. Carpenter on this latter point.
It seems to me that there is no necessity for adopting any hy
pothetical mode of circulation to account for the facts, as they
can be quite well accounted for by means of that mode of circu
lation which does actually exist.       It has been determined from
direct observation that surface-currents <U+FB02>ow from equatorial to
polar regions; and their paths have been actually mapped out.
But if it is established that currents <U+FB02>ow from equatorial to polar
regions, it is equally established that return currents <U+FB02>ow from
 polar to equatorial regions; for if the one actually exists, the
 other of necessity must exist. We know also on physical grounds,
 to which   I  have already referred, and which fall to be considered
 more fully in a subsequent part of this paper, that a very large
 portion of the water <U+FB02>owing from polar to equatorial regions
 must be in the form of under currents.         If there are cold under
 currents, therefore, <U+FB02>owing from polar to temperate and equa
 torial regions, this is all that we really require to account for the
 cold water which is found to occupy the bed of the ocean in
 those regions.       It does not necessarily follow, because cold
 water may be found at the bottom of the ocean all along the
 equator, that there must be a direct <U+FB02>ow from the polar regions
 to every point of the equator.       Water brought constantly from
 the polar regions to various points along the equator by means
 of under currents will necessarily accumulate, and in course of
 time spread over the bottom of the intertropical seas.          It must
 either do this, or the currents on reaching the equator must
 bend upwards and <U+FB02>ow to the surface in an unbroken mass,
  Considerable portions of some of those currents may no doubt
 do so and join surface-currents ; but probably the greater portion
  of the water coming from polar regions extends itself over
  the <U+FB02>oor of the equatorial seas.     In a letter in ‘ Nature,’ Jan. 11,

  1872, endeavoured to show that the surface-currents of the
  ocean are not separate and independent of one another, but form
  one grand system of circulation, and that the impelling cause
  keeping up this system of circulation is not the trade-winds
  alone, as is generally supposed, but the prevailing winds of the
  entire globe considered also as one grand system.         The evidence
  for this opinion, however, will be considered more fully in the
  next part of this paper.

100     Mr. J. Croll   on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
   Although the under currents are parts of one general system of
oceanic circulation produced by the impulse of the system of pre
vailing winds, yet their direction and position are nevertheless
to a large extent determined by different laws.     The water at the
surface, being moved by the force of       the  wind, will follow the
path of greatest pressure and traction,—the e<U+FB02>'ects resulting from
the general contour of the land, which to a great extent are com
mon to both sets of currents, not being taken into account;
while, on the other hand, the under currents from polar regions
(which to a great extent are simply “indraughts” compensating
for the water drained from equatorial regions by the Gulf-stream
and other surface-currents)     will follow, as a general rule, the
path of least resistance.
    The Cause assigned for the hypothetical mode of circulation.—
Dr. Carpenter assigns a cause for his mode of circulation ; and
that cause he <U+FB01>nds in the difference of speci<U+FB01>c gravity between
equatorial and polar waters, resulting from the difference of
temperature between these two regions.         “Two separate ques
tions,” he says, “ have to be considered, which have not, perhaps,
been kept suf<U+FB01>ciently distinct either by Mr. Croll or by myself :—
<U+FB01>rst, whether there is adequate evidence of the existence of a
general vertical oceanic circulation; and second, whether, suppo
sing its existence to be provisionally admitted, a new causa can be
found for it in the difference of temperature between the oceanic
waters of the polar and equatorial areas” (§ 17).         It seems to
me that the facts adduced by Dr. Carpenter do not necessarily
require the assumption of any such mode of circulation as that
advanced by him.        The phenomena can be satisfactorily ac
counted for otherwise; and therefore there does not appear to
be any necessity for considering whether his hypothesis be suf
<U+FB01>cient to produce the required effect or not.
    An important consideration overlooked—But there is one im
portant consideration which Dr. Carpenter seems to have over
looked—namely, the fact that the sea is saltcr in intertropical
than in polar regions, and that this circumstance, so far as it
goes, must tend to neutralize the effect of difference of tempera
ture. It is probable indeed that the effect produced by differ
ence of temperature is thus entirely neutralized, and that no
difference of density whatever exists between the sea in intertr -
pical and polar regions, and consequently that there is no differ
ence of level nor any thing to produce such a general motion as
he supposes.          I
                This am glad to <U+FB01>nd is the opinion of Professor
\Vyville Thomson.

reliable data, it is my general impression that if we were to set
aside all other agencies, and to trust for an oceanic circulation
to these conditions only which are relied upon by Dr. Carpenter,
if there were any general circulation at all, which seems very
problematica], the odds are rather in favour of a warm under
current travelling northwards by virtue of its excess of salt, ba
lanced by a surface return~currcnt of fresher though colder arctic
water.” (‘ The Depths of the Sea,’ pp. 376 8a 377.)
    This is what actually takes place on the west and north-west
of Spitzbergen.       There the warm water of the Gulf-stream
flows underneath the cold polar current.         And it is the opinion
of Dr. Scoresby, Clements Markham, and Lieut. Maury that
this warm-water, in virtue of its greater saltness, is denser than
the polar. water.     Mr. Leigh Smith found on the north-west of
Spitzbergen the temperature at 500 fathoms to be 52°, and once
even 64°, while the water on the surface was only a degree or two
above freezing*. Mr. Aitken, of Darroch, in apaper lately read
before the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, showed experimen
tally that the polar water in regions where the ice is melting is
actually less dense than the warm and more salt tropical waters.
Nor will it help the matter in the least to maintain that differ
ence of speci<U+FB01>c gravity is not the reason why the warm water of
 the Gulf-stream passes under the polar stream—because if dif
 ferences of speci<U+FB01>c gravity be not the cause of the warm water
 underlying the cold water in polar regions, then difference of
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity may likewise not be the cause of the cold water
 underlying the warm at the equator; and if so, then there is
 no necessity for the gravitation hypothesis of oceanic circulation.
    There is little doubt that the superheated stratum at the
 surface of the intertropical scas, which stratum, according to
 Dr. Carpenter, is of no great thickness, is less dense than the
 polar water; but if we take a column extending from the sur
face down to the bottom of the ocean, this column at the equator
 will be found to be as heavy as one of equal length in the polar
 area.    And if this be the case, then there can be no difference
 of level between the equator and the poles, and no disturbance
 of static equilibrium nor any thing else to produce circulation.
     Under currents account for all the Facts better than Dr. Car
 penter’s Hypothesis—Assuming,          for the present, the system of
  prevailing winds to be the true cause of oceanic currents, it ne
  cessarily follows (as will be shown hereafter) that a large quan
 tity of Atlantic water must be propelled into the Arctic Ocean ;
 and such, as we know, is actually the case.            But the Arctic

102        Mr. J. Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
Ocean being, as Professor Wyville Thomson remarks, a well
nigh closed basin, not permitting of a free out<U+FB02>ow into the
Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean of the water impelled into          it,
                                               and the general ten
dency  of the winds being  to prevent  or  retard  the return of the
water into the Atlantic, the path of      least  resistance  for the
return currents must lie at      considerable distance below the
                                     a
surface.   A large portion of the water from the polar regions
no doubt leaves those regions as surface-currents but surface
                                                            ;         a
current of this kind, on meeting with some resistance to its on
ward progress along the surface, will dip down and continue its
course as an under current.    We have an example of this in the
case of the polar current, which   upon meeting the Gulf-stream
on the banks of Newfoundland divides—a portion of             dipping it
down and pursuing its course underneath that stream into the
Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. And that this under cur
rent  is
       a  real and tangible current, in the proper sense of the term,
and not an imperceptible movement of the water,            proved by
                                                                 is

ried southward with considerable velocity against both the force
of the wind and the Gulf-stream.
   Dr. Carpenter refers at considerable length          134) to Mr.
Mitchell’s opinion as to the origin of the polar current, which            is
the same as that advanced by Maury, viz. that the impelling
cause  is difference of speci<U+FB01>c gravity.     But although Dr. Car
penter quotes Mr. Mitchell’s opinion, he nevertheless does
not appear to adopt it; for in            90—93 and various other
places he distinctly states that he does not agree with Captain
Maury’s view that the Gulf-stream and polar current are caused
by difference of density. In fact Dr. Carpenter seems particu
larly anxious that    itshould be clearly understood that he dis
sents from the theory maintained            by
                                          Maury.    But he does not
merely deny that the Gulf-stream and polar current can be
caused      by
             difference of density  he even goes so far as to a<U+FB02>irm
                                       ;
that no sensible current whatever can be due to that cause, and
adduces the authority of Sir John Herschel in support of that
opinion z—“ The doctrine of Captain Maury,” he says,
                                                                 “ was
powerfully and convincingly opposed             Sir John Herschel;

who showed, beyond       all reasonable  doubt, <U+FB01>rst, that the Gulf
stream really has its origin in the propulsive force of the trade
winds, and, secondly, that the greatest disturbance of equilibrium
which can be supposed to result from the agencies invoked                  by
Captain Maury would be utterly inadequate to generate and
maintain either the Gulf-stream or any other sensible current”
(§ 92). This being Dr. Carpenter’s belief,        somewhat singular
                                                  it   is
that he should advance the case of the polar current passing
under the Gulf-stream as evidence in favour of his theory; for in

      _Mr.   .I.   Croll on   the   Physical Cause       of   Ocean-currents.         103
reality he could hardly have selected           case more hostile to that
                                                    a
theory.      In  short   it   is
                              evident that,       polar current impelled
                                                    if   a
 by   aforce other than that of gravity can pass from the banks of
Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico               distance of some thou
                                                     (a

                               a
and, at the same time, so powerful as the Gulf-stream,               could  it
pass much more easily under comparatively still Water, or water
<U+FB02>owing     in the same direction as itself.      And this be so, then
                                                                 if
all our di<U+FB02>iculties disappear, and we satisfactorily explain the
presence of cold polar water at the bottom of intertropical seas
without having recourse to ,the hypothesis advanced                    Dr.      by
Carpenter.
    But we have an example of an under current more inexplicable
on the gravitation hypothesis than even that of the polar cur
rent, viz. the warm under current of Davis Strait.
    There    is    strong current <U+FB02>owing north from the Atlantic
                   a
through Davis Strait into the Arctic Ocean underneath                 sur       a
face-current passing southwards in an opposite direction.           Large
icebergs have been seen to be carried northwards                       by
                                                               this under
current at the rate of four knots an hour against both the wind
and the surface-current, ripping and tearing their way with ter
ri<U+FB01>c force through surface-ice of great thickness.          (See Physical
Geography of the Sea, chap. ix. new edition, and Dr. A. Miihry
‘
   On Ocean-currents in the Circumpolar Basin of the N. Hemi
sphere.’)    A  current so powerful and rapid as this cannot, as Dr.
Carpenter     admits,be   referred to difference of speci<U+FB01>c gravity. But
even supposing that          could, still difference of temperature be

                                                                                 ,'
the current in question <U+FB02>ows in the wrong direction.            Nor will               it
help the matter the least to adoptMaury’ explanation, viz. that the
                                                     s
warm under current from the south, in consequence of its greater
 saltness,   is denser than the cold one from the polar regions.
 For the water of the Atlantic, notwithstanding its higher tem
      if
 perature,   is in consequence of its greater saltness so much denser
 than the polar water on the west of Greenland as to produce an
 under current of four knots an hour in the direction of the pole,
then surely the same thing to           certain extent will hold true
                                          a                                            in
reference to the ocean on the east side of Greenland.            Thus in
 stead of there being, as Dr. Carpenter supposes, an under-<U+FB02>ow
 of polar water south into the Atlantic in virtue of its greater den
sity, there ought, on the contrary, to be surface-<U+FB02>ow in conse

 quence of its lesser density.
    The true explanation no doubt          that the warm under current
                                              is,
 from the south and the cold upper current from the north are
 both parts of one grand system of circulation produced                the      by

    The wind in Ba<U+FB01>in’s Bay and Davis Strait blows nearly
 always in one direction, viz. from the north.              The tendency
 of this i to produce a surface- or upper current from the north

eurrent from the south.         The warm current from the Atlantic,
 taking   the  path  of least resistance, dips under the polar current
 and pursues its course as an under current.
    Mr. Clement Markham, in his ‘Threshold of the Unknown
 Region,’ is inclined to attribute the motion of the icebergs to
 tidal action or to counter undercurrents. That the motion of the
 icebergs cannot reasonably be attributed to the tides                  is,

meeting the Gulf-stream about the northern entrance to the

current which forms part of a general system of circulation pro
duced by the impulse of the winds cannot possibly be an under
current; for in the case referred to we have proof that the thing
is not only possible but actually exists.       This point, however,
will be better understood after we have considered the evidence
in favour of a general system of oceanic currents.
    Much of the dif<U+FB01>culty experienced in comprehending how
under currents can be produced by the wind, or how an impulse
imparted to the surface of the ocean can ever be transmitted to
the bottom, appears to me to result, to a considerable extent at
least, from a slight deception of the imagination.         The thing
which impresses us most forcibly in regard to the ocean is its
profound depth.       A mean depth of, say, three miles produces a
striking impression; but if we could represent to the mind the
vast area of the ocean as correctly as we can its depth, shallow
ness rather than depth would be the impression produced.            If
in crossing a meadow we found a sheet of water one hundred
yards in diameter and only an inch in depth, we should not call
that a deep pool, we should call it a very shallow pool. The pro
bability is that we should speak of it as simply a piece of ground
covered with a thin layer of water.        Yet such a thin layer of

for the ocean in relation to its super<U+FB01>cial area is as shallow as
the pool of our illustration.     In reference to such a pool or thin
<U+FB01>lm   of  water, we have   no dif<U+FB01>culty in conceiving how a disturb
ance on its surface would be transmitted to its bottom.       In fact
our dif<U+FB01>culty is in conceiving how any disturbance extending
over its entire surface should not extend to the bottom.        Now
if we could form as accurate a sensuous impression of the vast
 area of the ocean as we do of such a pool, all our dif<U+FB01>culty in
understanding how the impulses of the wind acting on the vast
area of the ocean should communicate motion down to its bot
tom would disappear.
    The known condition of the ocean inconsistent with Dr. Car
 penter’s hypothesis—Dr. Carpenter says that he looks forward
 with great satisfaction to the results of the inquiries which are
 being prosecuted by the Circumnavigation Expedition, in the
 hope that the facts brought to light may establish his theory of
 a general oceanic circulation; and he speci<U+FB01>es certain of these
 facts which, if found to be correct, will establish his theory.    It
 seems to me, however, that the facts to which he refers are just
 as explicable on the theory of under currents as on the theory of
 a general oceanic circulation.     He begins by saying,     “If  the
 views  I   have propounded be correct, it may be expected that
 near the border of the great Antarctic ice-barrier a temperature
 below 30° will be met with (as it has been by Parry, Martens,

106              Mr.   J.   Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
and Weyprecht near Spitzbergcn) at no great depth beneath the
surface, and that instead of rising at still greater depths, the
thermometer will fall to near the freezing-point of salt water
                                                               "
                                                                                   -
(§        39).
      Dr. Carpenter can hardly claim this                 as evidence   in favour of
his theory ; for near the borders of the ice-barrier the water, as
amatter of course, could not be expected to have a much higher
temperature than the ice itself. And if the observations be made
during summer months, the temperature of the water at the
surface will no doubt be found to be higher than that of the
bottom; but if they be carried on during winter, the surface
temperature will doubtless be found to be as low as the bottom
temperature.     These are results which do not depend upon any
particular theory of oceanic circulation.
   “ The bottom-temperature of the North Paci<U+FB01>c,” he continues,
“ will afford a crucial test of the truth of the doctrine. For since
the sole communication of this vast oceanic area with the Arctic
basin is a strait so shallow as only to permit an in<U+FB02>ow of warm
surface-water,   its deep cold stratum must be entirely derived
from the Antarctic area; and if its bottom-temperature is not
actually higher than that of the South Paci<U+FB01>c, the glacial stra
tum ought to be found at a greater depth north of the equator
than south of it
                   ”
                     (§ 39).
   This may probably show that the water came from the Ant
arctic regions, but cannot possibly prove that it came in the
manner which he supposes.
    " In the North Atlantic, again, the comparative limitation of
communication with the Arctic area may be expected to prevent
its bottom-temperature from being reduced as low as that of the
 Southern Atlantic” (§ 39). Supposing the bottom-temperature
of the South Atlantic should be found to be lower than the
bottom-temperature of the North Atlantic, this fact will be
just as consistent with the theory of under currents as with his
 theory of a general movement of the ocean. Indeed          fear that     I
 even although Dr. Carpenter’s expectations should eventually
 be realized in the results of the Circumnavigation Expedition, yet
 the advocates of the wind theory will still remain unconverted.
 In fact the Director of this Expedition has already, on the wind
theory, offered an explanation of nearly all the phenomena on
which Dr. Carpenter relies* ; and the same has also been done
by Dr. Petermann-l', who, as is well known, is equally oppoed
to Dr. Carpenter’s theory.       Dr. Carpenter directs attention to
the necessity of examining the broad and deep channel separating

Iceland from Greenland.          The observations which have already
been made, however, show that nearly the entire channel is co
cupied, on the surface at least, by water <U+FB02>owing southward from
the polar area—a direction the opposite of what it ought to be
according to the gravitation theory.        In fact the surface of one
half of the entire area of the ocean, extending from Greenland to
the North Cape, is moving in a direction the opposite of that
which it ought to take according to the theory under review.
The western half of this area is occupied by water which at the
surface is <U+FB02>owing southwards; while the eastern half, which has
hitherto been regarded by almost everybody but Dr. Carpen
ter himself and Mr. Findlay as an extension of the Gulf-stream,
is moving polewards.        The motion of the western half must be
attributed to the winds and not to gravity; for it is moving in
the wrong direction to be accounted for by the latter cause; but
had it been moving in the opposite direction, no doubt its motion
would have been referred to gravitation. To this cause the mo_
tion of the eastern half, which is in the proper direction, is
attributed*; but why not assign this motion also to the impulse
of the winds, more especially since the direction of the prevail
ing winds blowing over that area coincides with that of the water?
If the wind can produce the motion of the water in the western
half, why may it not do the same in the eastern half?
    If there be such a difference of density between the equatorial
and polar water as to produce a general <U+FB02>ow of the upper portion
of the ocean poleward, how does it happen that one half of the
water in the above area is moving in opposition to gravity?
 How is it that in a wide open sea gravitation should act so pow
erfully in the one half of it and with so little effect in the other
half? There is probably little doubt that the ice-cold water
of the western half extends from the surface down to the bot
tom.     And it is also probable that the bottom-water is moving
southwards in the same direction as the surface-water.             The
bottom-water in such      a  case would  be  moving  in harmony with
the gravitation theory; but would Dr.Carpenter on this account
attribute its motion to gravity? Would he attribute the motion
of the lower half to gravity and the upper half to the wind?
He could not in consistency with his theory attribute the motion
of the upper half to gravity ; for although the ice-cold water ex
tended to the surface, this could not explain how gravity should
move it southward instead of polewards, as according to theory
it ought to move.        He might af<U+FB01>rm, if he chose, that the sur
face-water moves southwards because it is dragged forward by the
bottom-water; but if this view he held, he is not entitled to

  af<U+FB01>rm, as he does, that the winds can only produce a mere sur
  face-drift.      If the viscosity and molecular resistance of water be
  such that, when the lower strata of the ocean are impelled for
  ward by gravity or by any other cause, the superincumbent
  strata extending to the surface are perforce dragged after them,
  then, for the same reason, when the upper strata are impelled
  forward by the wind or any other cause, the underlying strata
  must also be dragged along after them.
      If  the condition of the ocean between Greenland and the
  north-western shore of Europe is irreconcilable with the gravi
  tation theory, we <U+FB01>nd the case even worse for that theory when
  we direct our attention to the condition of the ocean on the
  southern hemisphere; for according to the researches of Cap
  tain Duperrey and others on the currents of the Southern
  Ocean, a very large portion of the area of that ocean is occupied
  by water moving on the surface more in a northward than a
  poleward direction.         Referring to the deep trough between the
  Shetland and the Faroe Islands, called by him the “ Lightning
  Channel,” Dr. Carpenter says,           “If  my view be correct, a cur
  rent-drag suspended in        the upper   stratum   ought to have a per
  ceptible movement in the N.E. direction; whilst another, sus
  pended in the lower stratum, should move S.W.”                 4-0).
      Any one believing in the north-eastern extension of the Gulf
  stream and in the Spitzbergen polar under current, to which               I
  have already referred, would not feel surprised to learn that the
  surface-strata      have a perceptible     north-eastward motion, and
  the bottom strata a perceptible south-westward motion. North
  east and east of Iceland there is a general <U+FB02>ow of cold polar water
  in a south-east direction towards the left edge of the Gulf
  strcam.       This water, as Professor Mohn concludes, “descends
  beneath the Gulf-stream and partially <U+FB01>nds an outlet in the
  lower half of the Farce-Shetland channel” *.

    Dr. Carpenter then refers to a point so obvious as hardly to
require consideration, viz. the effect which results when the sur
face of the entire area of a lake or pond of water is cooled. The
whole of the surface-<U+FB01>lm being chilled at the same time, sinks
through the subjacent water, and a new <U+FB01>lm from the warmer
layer immediately'beneath the surface rises into its place.    This
being cooled in its turn, sinks, and so on.    He next considers
what takes place when only a portion of the surface of the pond
is cooled, and shows that in this case the surface-<U+FB01>lm which
descends is replaced not from beneath, but by an in<U+FB02>ow from
the neighbouring area.
    “ That such must be the case,”                        “ appears
                                     says Dr. Carpenter,

                               am surprised that any person con
versant with the principles of physical science should hesitate in
 admitting     still more that he should explicitly deny it. But

\  Then,  in  order  to show the mode in which the general oceanic
circulation takes place, he supposes two cylindrical vessels, W
and   C, of equal size to be <U+FB01>lled with sea-water.     Cylinder,W re
presents   the   equatorial   column,  and   the water  contained in            it
has its temperature maintained at 60°; whilst the water in the
other cylinder          C,
                      representing the polar column, has its tempe
rature maintained at 30°          means of the constant application

the two cylinders at top and bottom; and the water in the cold
cylinder being, in virtue of its low temperature, denser than the                     -
water in the warm cylinder, the two colums are therefore not in
static equilibrium.      The cold, and hence heavier column tends
to produce an out<U+FB02>ow of water from its bottom to the bottom of
the warm column, which out<U+FB02>ow              replaced
                                               is              by

so repeatedly enter into the modus operandi of the matter? Who

general oceanic circulation, has been overlooked     physicists;     by
and it    with the view of developing his ideas on this subject
           is
that he has entered so fully and so frequently into the exposi

       The in<U+FB02>uence of the sun in heating the waters of the intertro
    pical seas     in Dr. Carpenter’s manner of viewing the problem,
                  is,
    of no great importance.     The ef<U+FB01>cient cause of motion he con
    siders resides in cold rather than in heat.     In_fact he even goes
    the length of maintaining that, as      power in the production of
                                                     a
    the general interchange of equatorial and polar water, the effect
    of polar cold     so much superior to that of intertropical heat,
                        is
    that the in<U+FB02>uence of the latter may be practically disregarded.
       “
         Suppose two basins of ocean-water,” he says, “connected
    by   astrait to be placed under such different climatic conditions
    that the surface of one      exposed to the heating influence of
                                   is
    tropical sunshine, whilst the surface of the other       subjected to   is
    the extreme cold of the sunless polar winter.       The effect of the
    surface-heat upon the water of the tropical basin will be for the
    most part limited (as     Ishall presently show) to its uppermost
    stratum, and may here be practically disreyarded‘l'.
       Dr. Carpenter’s idea regarding the ef<U+FB01>ciency of cold in pro
    ducing motion seems to me to be not only opposed to the gene
    rally received views on the subject, but wholly irreconcilable
    with the ordinary principles of mechanics.         In fact there are
    so many points on which Dr. Carpenter’s theory of          “ General         a
     Vertical Oceanic Circulation ” differs from the generally received
    views on the subject of circulation                       by
                                                 means of difference of

    what minutely into the consideration of the mechanics of that
    theory, the more so as he has so repeatedly asserted that eminent
-
    physicists agree with what he has advanced on the subject.
       According to the generally received theory, the circulation                                is
    due to the di<U+FB02>'erence     density between the sea in equatorial and
                              of
    polar regions.    The real ef<U+FB01>cient cause     gravity; but gravity

    the see were of equal density from the poles to the equator,
    gravity could eXercisc no in<U+FB02>uence in the production of circulai
    tion; and the in<U+FB02>uence which does possess   it      in proportion to
                                                                       is
    the difference of density.   But the difference of density between
    equatorial and polar waters       in turn due not absolutely either
                                           is
    to polar cold or to tropical heat, but to both—0r, in other words,
    to the di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature between the polar and equatorial
    seas.   This difference, in the very nature of things, must be as
    much the result of equatorial heat as of polar cold.       If the sea
    in equatorial regions were not being heated                       by
                                                      the sun as rapidly

rature betWeen them, and consequently the difference of density,
would be diminishing, and in course of time would disappear
altogether.       As has already been shown, it is a necessary con
sequence that the water <U+FB02>owing from equatorial to polar regions
must be compensated by an equal amount <U+FB02>owing from polar to
equatorial regions.         Now, if the water <U+FB02>owing from polar to
equatorial regions were not being heated as rapidly as the water
<U+FB02>owing from equatorial to polar regions is being cooled, the
equatorial seas would gradually become colder and colder until
no sensible difference of temperature existed between them and
the polar oceans.         In fact, equality of the two rates is necessary
to the very existence of such a general circulation a that advo
cated by Dr. Carpenter.            If he admits that the general inter
 change     of equatorial  and   polar water advocated by him is caused
 by the difference of density between the water at the equator
 and the poles, resulting from difference of temperature, then he
 must admit also that this difference of density is just as much
 due to the heating of the equatorial water by the sun as it is to
 the cooling of the polar water by radiation and other means—or,
 in other words, that it is as much due to equatorial heat as to
 polar cold.      And if so, it cannot be true that polar cold rather
 than equatorial heat is the “primum mobile ” of this circulation ;
 and far less can it be true that the heating of the equatorial
 water by the sun is of so little importance that it may be “ prac
 tically disregarded.”

 There   is,   according to Dr. Carpenter, another agent concerned
 in the production of the general oceanic circulation, viz. the
 heat derived by the bottom of the ocean from the crust of the
 earth (see     §§  20, ‘34"; also Brit. Assoc. Report for 1872, p. 49,
 and other places).         We have no reason to believe that the quan

     Circulation without Di<U+FB02>'erence       of Leach—There   is  another part
  of the theory which appears to me irreconcilable with mcchas

 penter says :—
    “ The force which will thus lift
                                        up the entire column of water
 in W is that which causes the descent of the entire column in
 C, namely the excess of gravity constantly acting in C,—the levels
 of the two columns, and consequently their heights, being main
 tained at a constant equality by the free passage of surface-water
 from W to C.”
    “ The whole of Mr. Croll’s discussion of this
                                                       question, how
ever,” he continues, “proceeds upon the assumption that the
levels of the polar and equatorial columns are not kept at an
equality, 8w.” (§ 30). And again,
                                         “ Now, so far from assert
ing (as Captain Maury has done) that the tri<U+FB02>ing di<U+FB01>‘erence
of level arising from inequality of temperature is adequate to
the production of ocean-currents,      I simply af<U+FB01>rm that as fast as
the level is disturbed by change of temperature it will be restored
by gravity” (§ 23). See also to the same e<U+FB01>'ect Brit. Assoc.

consideration    cannot take place without a difference of level,

polar column. The equatorial column is warmer than the polar
column because it receives more heat from the sun than the
latter; and the polar is colder than the equatorial column be
cause it receives less heat from the sun than the latter.           The
difference in the density of the two columns results from their
di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature; and the difference of temperature re
sults in turn from the difference in the quantity of heat received
from the sun by each.         Or, to express the matter in other
words, the difference of density (and consequently the circula
tion under consideration) is due to the excess of heat received
from the sun by the equatorial over that received by the polar
column; so that to leave out of account the super-heating of
the intertropical waters by the sun is to leave out of account the
very thing of all others that is absolutely essential to the exist

 ence of the circulation.     The water being assumed to be the
 same in both columns and differing only as regards tempera
 ture, and the equatorial column possessing more heat than the
 polar, and being therefore less dense than the latter, it follows,
 in order that the two columns may be in static equilibrium, that
 the surface of the equatorial column must stand at a higher
 level than that of the polar. This produces the slopeW C from
 the equator to the pole.     The extent of the slope will of course
 depend upon the extent of the difference of their temperatures.
 But, as was shown on a former occasion (Phil. Mag. for Oct.
 1871), it is impossible that static equilibrium can ever be fully
 obtained, because the slope occasioned by the elevation of the
 equatorial column above the polar produces what we may be
 allowed to call a molecular disturbance of equilibrium.         The
 surface of the ocean, or the molecules of water lying on the
 slope, are not in a position of equilibrium, but tend, in virtue
 of gravity, to roll down the slope in the direction of the polar
 column C. It will be observed that the more we gain of static
 equilibrium of the entire ocean the greater is the slope, and
 consequently the greater is the disturbance of molecular equi
librium ; and, vice versd, the more molecular equilibrium is
restored by the reduction of the slope, the greater is the disturb
ance of static equilibrium.     It is therefore absolutely impossible
that both conditions of equilibrium can be ful<U+FB01>lled at the same time
so long as a di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature exists between        the two
columns. And this conclusion holds true even though we should
assume water to be a perfect <U+FB02>uid absolutely devoid of viscosity.
It follows, therefore, that a general oceanic circulation without a
difference of level is a mechanical impossibility.
    In a case of actual circulation due to difference of gravity,
there is always a constant disturbance of both static and mole
cular equilibrium.      Column C is always higher and column W
always lower than it ought to he were the two in equilibrium ;
but they never can be at the same level.
    It is quite conceivable, of course, that the two conditions of
equilibrium may be ful<U+FB01>lled alternately.           We can conceive
column C remaining stationary till the water <U+FB02>owing from
column W has restored the level. And after the level is re
stored we can conceive the polar column C sinking and the
equatorial column W rising till the two perfectly balance each
other. Such a mode of circulation, consisting of an alternate
surface-<U+FB02>ow and vertical descent and ascent of the columns,
though conceivable, is in reality impossible in nature ; for there
are no means by which the polar column C could be supported
from sinking till the level had been restored.      But Dr. Carpen
ter does not assume that the general oceanic circulation takes

culation is constant.     He asserts that there is a “ continual
transference of water from the bottom of C to the bottom of W,
and from the top of W to the top of C, with a constant descend
ing movement in C anda constant ascending movement in W
                                                                    ”
(§ 29). But such a condition of things is irreconcilable with
the idea of “the levels of the two columns, and consequently
their heights, being maintained at a constant equality”         29).
   Although Dr. Carpenter does not admit the existence of a
permanent difference of level between the equator and the pole,
he nevertheless speaks of a depression of level in the polar basin
resulting from the contraction by cooling of the water <U+FB02>owing
into it. This reduction of level induces an in<U+FB02>ow of water from
the surrounding area; “and since what is drawn away,” to
 quote his own words, “is supplied from a yet greater distance,
the continued cooling of the surface-stratum       in the polar basin
 will cause a ‘ set of waters towards

                                            to be propagated back
 wards through the whole intervening ocean in communication
 with  ituntil    reaches the tropical area.”
                     it                          The slope produced
 between the polar basin and the surrounding area,        suf<U+FB01>ciently       if
great, will enable the water in the surrounding area to <U+FB02>ow
polewards      but unless this slope extend to the equator,
                 ;                                                will               it
not enable the tropical waters also to <U+FB02>ow polewards.          One of
two things necessarily follows     either the slope extends from the
                                                  :
equator to the pole, or water can <U+FB02>ow from the equator to the
pole without      slope.

he contradicts himself; and        he adopts the latter, he contra

   A   confusion       ideas in reference to the supposed agency of Polar
                             of
 Cold—It         seems to me that Dr. Carpenter has been somewhat
misled      by slight confusion of ideas in reference to the supposed
                 a
 agency   of  polar cold.   This    brought out forcibly in the fol
                                                 is
 lowing passage      from  his memoir     in the Proceedings of the ‘
 Royal Geographical Society,’ vol. xv.         54.          p.
     “Mr. Croll, in arguing against the doctrine of general                      a
 oceanic circulation sustained                        by
                                       difference of temperature, and

 agency of cold.”
    It here suppoaed that there are two agents at work in the

 heat, acting at the equatorial regions; and the other agent is
 cold, acting at the polar regions.                 supposed that the

of account altogether,—polar cold being the primum mobile 0f
the circulation.    It is supposed also that I have considered the
ef<U+FB01>ciency of one of the agents, viz. heat, and found it totally in
adequate to produce the circulation in question; and it is ad
mitted also that my conclusions are perfectly correct.        But then
I am supposed to have left out of account the other agent, viz.
polar cold, the only agent possessing real potency.             Had           I
taken into account polar cold, it is supp0sed that             I
                                                           should have
found at once a cause perfectly adequate to produce the re
 quired effect.
    This is a fair statement of Dr. Carpenter’s views on the sub
ject ; I am unable, at least, to attach any other meaning to his
 words.    And I have no doubt they are also the views which have
 been adopted by those who have accepted his theory.
    It must be suf<U+FB01>ciently evident from what has already been
 stated, that the notion of there being two separate agents at
 work producing circulation, namely heat and cold, the one of
 which is assumed to have much more potency than the other,
 is not only opposed to the views entertained by physicists, but
 is also wholly irreconcilable with the ordinary principles of me
 chanics.    But more than this, if we analyze the subject a little
 so as to remove some of the confusion of ideas which besets                 it,
 we shall <U+FB01>nd that these views are irreconcilable with even Dr.
 Carpenter’s own explanation of the cause of the general oceanic
 circulation.
    Cold and heat, considered as sensations, are very different
 things; but cold considered as          condition of
                                            a              body means
                                                            a
 only a   de<U+FB01>ciency   or absence  of  heat.   When     we  say, for ex
 ample, that the polar seas are colder      than   the  equatorial, our
 meaning    isthat the polar seas possess less heat than the equa
 torial. And when we say that the equatorial seas are hotter
 than the polar, our meaning of course likewise          that the equa
                                                          is
 torial seas possess  more  heat than  the  polar.   Or     we say that
                                                               if
the equatorial seas are hot and the polar seas cold, we mean
simply that both seas possess        certain amount of heat, the
                                          a
equatorial seas  having  more  than  the polar; or, judging them
 by our sensations, we call the one hot and the other cold.
   How, then, according to Dr. Carpenter, does polar cold im
part motion to the water? The warm water <U+FB02>owing in upon
the polar column becomes chilled                by
                                          cold, but      not cooled
                                                           it      is
below that of the water underneath; for, according      to Dr. Car
penter, the ocean in polar regions      as cold and as dense under
                                              is
neath as at the surface.   The cooled surface-water does not sink
through the water underneath, like the surface-water of        pond     a
chilled during      frosty night.
                     a              “The descending motion in
column     will not consist,” he says, “ in

being drawn of through an ori<U+FB01>ce at the bottom             29). There
is a downward motion of the entire column, producing an out
<U+FB02>ow of water at the bottom towards the equatorial column W,
which out<U+FB02>ow is compensated by an in<U+FB02>ow from the top of the
equatorial column to the top of the polar column C. But what
causes column C to descend?           The cause of the descent is its
excess of weight over that of column W.           Column C descends
and column W ascends, for the same reason that in a balance
the heavy scale descends and the light scale rises.         Column C
 descends not simply because it is cold, but because it is colder
 than column W.         Column C descends not simply because in
 consequence     of being  cold it is dense and therefore heavy, but
 because in consequence of being cold it is denser and therefore
 heavier than column W.         It might be as cold as frozen mer_
 cury and as heavy as lead; but it would not on that account
 descend unless it were heavier than column W.            The descent
 of column C and ascent of column W, and consequently the
 general oceanic circulation, results, therefore, according to Dr.
 Carpenter’s explanation, from the di<U+FB02>'erence in the weights of
the two columns; and the difference in the weights of the two
columns results from their dz<U+FB02>erence of density; and the differ
 ence of density of the two columns in turn results from their
 di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature.      But it has already been proved that
 the difference of temperature between the polar and equatorial
 columns depends wholly on the difference in the amount of heat
 received by each from the sun.         The equatorial column W pos
 sesses more heat than the polar column C, solely because it re
 ceives more heat from the sun than column C.            Consequently
 Dr. Carpenter’s statement that the circulation is produced by
 polar cold rather than by equatorial heat, is just as much in con
 tradiction to his own theory as it is to the principles of mecha
 nics.    Again, his admission that the general oceanic circulation
 “ cannot be produced
                           by the application of heat to the surface,”
 is virtually a giving up the whole point in debate ; for according
to his gravitation theory, and every form of that theory, the cir
culation results from di<U+FB01>'erence of temperature between equatorial
 and polar seas; but this difference, as we have seen, is entirely
owing to the difference in the amount of heat received from the
sun at these two places. The heat received, however, is “ surface
heat;” for it is at the surface that the ocean receives all its heat
from the sun ; and consequently if surface-heat cannot produce
the effect required, nothing else can.

                  I
meaning, presume, is that if the incline consist of any solid
substance, water will not <U+FB02>ow down it; but if it he made of
water itself, water will <U+FB02>ow down it.         But in M. Dubuat’s ex
periments it was only the molecules in actual contact with the
 solid incline that could possibly be retarded by friction against
 it. The molecules not in contact with the solid incline evidently
 rested upon an incline of water, and were at perfect liberty to
 roll down that incline if they chose; but they did not do so;
 and consequently M. Dubuat’s experiment proved that water
 will not <U+FB02>ow over itself on an incline of in 1,000,000.l                .
      A begging of the question at issue.—“ It is to be remembered,’
                         “ that, however small the
  says Dr. Carpenter,                               original amount of
 movement may be, a momentum tending to its continuance must
  be generated from the instant of its commencement ; so that if the
  initiating force be in constant action, there will be a progressive
  acceleration of its rate, until the increase of resistance equalizes
  the tendency to further acceleration.      Now, if it be admitted that
 the propagation of the disturbance of equilibrium from one
  column to another is simply retarded, not prevented, by the vis
   cosity of the liquid,          I
                            cannot see how the conclusion can be re
   sisted, that the constantly maintained difference of gravity be
   tween the polar and equatorial columns really acts as a vis viva
   in maintaining a circulation between them”           35).

    Supposed argument from the tides—Dr. Carpenter advances
 Mr. Ferrel’s argument in regard to the tides. The power of
 the moon to disturb the earth’s water, he aserts,                  is,

 to Herschel, only one 11,400,000th part of gravity, and that of
 the sun not over one 25,736,400th part of gravity; yet the
 moon’s attractive force, even when counteracted                     by
                                                                   the sun,
 will produce     rise of the ocean. But as the disturbance of gra

 the above,      ought
                  it      to  produce   circulation.
    It here supposed that the force exerted by gravity on the

 ocean, resulting from difference of temperature, tending to pro
 duce the general oceanic circulation,-is much greater than the
 force exerted on the ocean                by
                                      the moon in the production of the
 tides.   But     we examine the subject we shall <U+FB01>nd that the op
                  if
 posite is the case.      The attraction of the moon tending to lift
 the water of the ocean acts directly on every molecule from the
 surface to the bottom         but the force of gravity tending to pro

 of the ocean.     Gravity can exercise no direct force in impelling
 the under<U+FB02>ow from the polar to the equatorial regions, nor in
 raising the water to the surface when             reaches the equatorial
                                                      it
 regions.    Gravity can exercise      no  direct in<U+FB02>uence in pulling the
 water horizontally along the earth’s surface, nor in raising             up   it
 to the surface.     The pull of gravity         always downwards, never
                                                     is
horizontally nor upwards.          Gravity will tend to pull the surface
water from the equator to the poles because here we have descent.
 Gravity will tend to sink the polar column because here also we
have descent.     But these are the only parts of the circuit where
gravity   has  any tendency to produce motion.              Motion in the
other parts of the circuit, viz. along the bottom of the ocean
from the poles to the equator and in raising the equatorial
column,      is
              produced             by
                                the pressure of the polar column; and

the tides.

     Mr.   J.   Croll     on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.                119
   It is no doubt a somewhat di<U+FB02>icult problem to determine ac
curately the total amount of force exercised by gravity on the
ocean; but for our present purpose this is not necessary.    All
that we require at present is a very rough estimate indeed. And
this can be attained by very simple considerations.   Suppose we
assume the mean depth of the sea to he, say, three miles.     The
mean depth may yet be found to be somewhat less than this, or
it may be found to be somewhat greater; a slight mistake,
however, in regard to the mass of the ocean will not materially
affect our conclusions.   Taking the depth at 3 miles, the force
or direct pull of gravity on the entire waters of the ocean tend
ing to the production of the general circulation will not amount
to more than                     that of gravity, or only about              “+53
                                                                           that
of the attraction of the moon in the production of the tides.
 Let it   be observed that        Iam referring to the force or pull of
 gravity, and not to hydrostatic pressure.
     The moon,       by  raising the waters of the ocean, will produce                   a
slope    of2     feet   in    quadrant; and because the raised water
                           is a
 sinks and the level         restored, Mr. Ferrel concludes that similara
slope of   2   feet produced         difference of temperature will there
                                    by
 fore be su<U+FB02>icient to produce motion and restore level.                But
                                                                                         is is

 overlooked that the restoration of level in the case of the tides
 as truly the work of the moon as the disturbance of that level
is.     For the water raised          the attraction of the moon at one
                                      by
 time is    again, six hours afterwards, pulled down              by the moon
 when the earth has turned round             aquadrant.
     No doubt the earth’s gravity alone would                  course of time
 restore    the   level; but this does not follow as       a in
                                                                logical conse
 quence from Mr. Ferrel’s premises.              If we suppose a slope to
 be produced in the ocean             by
                                       the moon and the moon’s attrac

 level, the raised side will be the heaviest and the depressed side
 the lightest consequently the raised side will tend to sink and
                ;
 the depressed side will tend to rise, in order that the ocean may
 regain its static equilibrium.           But when    a difference of level              is
                                                                                                  -._,.,.,_ r , _-1.-.-a

    Pressure as a Cause of circulation—We shall now brie<U+FB02>y refer
to the in<U+FB02>uence of pressure (the indirect effects of gravity) in
the production of the circulation under consideration.               That
which causes the polar column C to descend and the equatorial
column W to ascend, as has repeatedly been remarked, is the
difference in the weight of the two columns.         The ef<U+FB01>cient cause
in the production of the movement                  is,

    We come now to the most important part of the inquiry, viz.
how   is the surface-water impelled from the equator to the poles                   ?
Is pressure from behind the impelling force here as in the case
of the bottom-water of the ocean?           It seems to me that, in
attempting to account for the surface-<U+FB02>ow from the equator to
the poles, Dr. Carpenter’s theory signally fails.          The force to
which he appeals appears to be wholly inadequate to produce the

    It will be observed that the water in that wedge-shaped por
tion WC W' forming the incline cannot be in a state of static
equilibrium.      A molecule of water at O, for example, will be
pressed more in the direction of C than in the direction of W',
and the amount of this excess of pressure towards C will depend
upon the height of W above the line C W'. It is evident that
the pressure tending to move the molecule at 0 towards C will
be far greater than the direct pull of gravity tending to draw a

from the greater height of the water at the equator due to its

                   is   a               am wholly unable to answer.

    If we suppose feet to he the height of the equatorial surface
                            9
above the polar required to make the two columns balance each
other, the actual difference of level between the two columns will
certainly not be more than one half that amount, because,                      if    a
circulation exist, the weight of the polar column must always be
in excess of that of the equatorial.      But this excess can only be
obtained at the expense of the surface-slope, as was shown at
length in my last paper.        The surface-slope probably will not
exceed more than       feet or 4% feet.
                             41            Suppose the ocean to be of
equal density     from  the  poles to the  equator,,and that     some     by
means or other the surface of the ocean at the equator         raised,   is
say,     feet above that of the poles, then there can be little

doubt that in such a case the water would soon regain its level ;
for the ocean at the equator being heavier than at the poles by the
weight of a layerlt feet in thickness, it would sink at the former
place and rise at the latter until equilibrium was restored, produ
cing, 'of course, a very slight displacement of the bottom-waters
towards the poles.     It will be observed, however, that restoration
of level in this case takes place by a simple yielding, as it were,
of the entire mass of the ocean without displacement of the mo
lecules of the water over each other to any great extent.       In the
case of a slope produced by di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature, however,
the raised portion of the ocean is not heavier but lighter than
the depressed portion, and consequently has no tendency to
sink. Any movement which the ocean as a mass makes in order
to regain equilibrium tends, as we have seen, rather to increase
the difference of level than to reduce it.         Restoration of level
can only be produced by the forces which are in operation in the
wedge-shaped mass W C W', constituting the slope itself.           But
it will be observed by a glance at the <U+FB01>gure that, in order to the
restoration of level, a large portion of the water WW' at the
equator will require to <U+FB02>ow to C, the pole.
     According to the general vertical oceanic circulation theory,
pressure from behind is not one of the forces employed in the
production of the <U+FB02>ow from the equator to the poles.           This is
evident; for there can be no pressure from behind acting on the
 water if there he no slope existing between the equator and the
poles.    Dr. Carpenter not only denies the actual existence of a
slope, but denies the necessity for its existence.         But to deny
the existence of a slope is to deny the existence of pressure, and
to deny the necessity for a slope is to deny the necessity for
pressure.     That in Dr. Carpenter’s theory the surface-water is
 supposed to be drawn from the equator to the poles, and not
pressed forward by a force from behind, is further evident from
the fact that he maintains that the force employed is not vis a
 teryo but vis afronte (Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc. Jan. 9, 1871, § 29).

Each of these crystals exhibits one face of a rhombohedron,
having angles which differ too widely from those of the forms
described by Des Cloizeaux in his Manuel de Minéralogie to admit
of identi<U+FB01>cation with any of them, and therefore has probably
never been observed before.
  The larger of the two crystals, besides the supposed new face,
which will be denoted by the letter   has the forms      5',00,                 2    1   1,   1

    In  a memoir by   Franz Leydolt, entitled “ Beitriige zur Kennt
niss der Krystallform und der Bildungsart des Eises,” it is
asserted that ice has no cleavage (Sitzungsbericlzte der mat/rem.
naturw. Cl. der kais. Akad der Wissensch. Band vii. Abth. 2,
p. 477).     A good many years previously I had seen some plates
of ice broken which exhibited a separation parallel to the sur
faces of the ice so perfectly like cleavage, that       I never hesitated
to publish    the statement   that  ice  has  a  cleavage parallel to the
 faces of the form 1 1 1.      A considerable time elapsed after the
 appearance of Leydolt’s paper before an opportunity of making
 further observations presented itself.         When at last  I  obtained
 some thick plates of newly formed ice,         I was unable to procure
 a trace of cleavage by the application of knife, chisel, or point
 in a direction parallel to their bounding planes.          On throwing
 one of the plates on the hard frozen ground it broke across, ex
 hibiting in the fracture two planes normal to the natural faces
 of the plate, and apparently (for      I had not at hand the means of
 measuring the angle they made with one ouother) parallel to two
 adjacent faces of a regular six-sided prism, looking like very per
 fect cleavages, and affording by re<U+FB02>ection distinct images of sur
 rounding objects; but      I  was unable to obtain a trace of clea
 vage in planes parallel to either of those revealed by fracture.
  It is therefore obvious that the separations, as well parallel as
 normal to the surfaces of the plates of ice, were due to the exist
 ence of faces of union and not to true cleavage.       The latter planes
 are   probably those of the six-sided prism 1 O 1 ; for some crys
 tals of ice examined by A. E. Nordenskjold were combinations
 of the simple forms 1 1 1, 10321, x2 1 0, K5 1 3, 1 O l. The
 angles which normals to the faces of these forms make with a
 normal to 1 1 1 are approximately :—

    A small cavity in the interior of a mass of Karstenite (CaO $0”)

 crystals attached at both ends to the walls of the cavity.          These
 crystals   exhibit  some  simple     forms   hitherto   undescribed, and
 several of the forms <U+FB01>rst observed by Hessenberg and described

    When light is refracted through the prism bounded by the
planes 1 0 0,     l  1 O,  the least-refracted ray is polarized in a plane
parallel to 0   O 1.      The indice's of the light in this plane are :—

and the other seen through the faces 1 1 O, 1 1 O, appeared to
make with one another an angle of 36° 22'. Hence the direc
tion of either optic axis within the crystal makes an angle of
22° 1' with a normal to the face 0 1 O.
   In crystals from Berchtesgaden, Hessenberg searched in vain
for a face of the form 1 0 1, for the existence of which     consiI
dered that           I
               had had satisfactory evidence.                 I
                                                   therefore reex
amined the crystal in which        I
                                supposed it to be visible.  Using
a spot of sunlight re<U+FB02>ected from a plane mirror as the bright
signal, the crystal being adjusted so that the intersection of the
faces         1 1 1 was parallel to the axis of the instrument, an
            1 1 1,
image  of the spot of sunlight was seen as if re<U+FB02>ected from a face
making .equal angles with the faces 1 1 1, 1 1 1; but on ma
king the crystal revolve round the axis of the branch of the
holder parallel to the plane of the circle, the spot remained im
movable.    Hence it is evident that the spot of light seen was not
due to a single re<U+FB02>ection, but to a re<U+FB02>ection at each of two sepa
rations in the interior of the crystal parallel to the faces 0 O      l
and     1   O O.
    In several of the fragments of crystals from Berchtesgaden
faint separations indicative of cleavages were observed, which,
on measuring the angles they made with the face 1 00 with a
position-micrometer, were found to be parallel to the faces of the
             l
form 1 0. It was not found possible to separate the crystal
in the direction of this cleavage, on account of the superior faci
lity of the other cleavages.                    _
    Some colourless crystals from Stassfurth, given me by M.
Pisani, of Paris, had the faces of many of the simple forms
striated to such an extent that it was extremely dif<U+FB01>cult to mea
sure the angles they made with one another.       By using for the
bright signal a large beam of sunlight re<U+FB02>ected from the mirror
of a heliostat, I think I have ascertained the existence of the fol
lowing forms, the last two being the least certain :—

XVI.      Measurements of the Polarization of the Light re<U+FB02>ected by
    the Sky and by one or more Plates of Glass.                 By Professor
     EDWARD C. PICKERING, Boston,              U.S.*
              following observations, which will be published in full
VFHEin         the ‘ Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences,’ were conducted to test Fresnel’s formula for the re
<U+FB02>ection of light.          He showed that, if the light was polarized
in the plane of incidence, the amount re<U+FB02>ected would be

a   formula which may be applied to any special case by substitu
ting proper values for i and r. The value of A evidently in
creases as i varies from 0° to 90°.              That of B, on the other
 hand, diminishes from 00 until i+r=90°, when it equals 0; or
at this angle, which is that of total polarization, all of the ray B
 is transmitted, all the re<U+FB02>ected beam being polarized in the plane
of incidence. When i=90°,              A: B:1,      1; hence all the light is

 re<U+FB02>ected light increases with n, being zero when n=1, and 100
 per cent. when         n:   00.    Many familiar phenomena are thus
 readily accounted for—for instance, the brightness of the dia
 mond, the covering power of white lead as a paint, and the bril
 liancy of wet or varnished stones and woods.
     A curious case presents itself when          n:   1 +dn, or di<U+FB02>‘ers from
 unity only by an in<U+FB01>nitesimal amount.                A then becomes equal
 to iatn2 (1+tan52      if,  and B to grin"2 (l—tan'2 1);.        When i=0,
 A, B, and R equal idng; and this quantity is accordingly taken
 as the unit in Table I.           The <U+FB01>rst column gives various values of
 the angle of incidence, the second and third the corresponding
 values of A and B, the fourth the amount of light re<U+FB02>ected, and
 the <U+FB01>fth the degree of polarization.            The other columns will be
 explained hereafter.         This Table is evidently applicable to all
 cases where the media bounding the surface have nearly the same
 index of refraction, whether its absolute amount is great or small.

   The most important application of Fresnel’s formula is to the
case of glass, where n somewhat exceeds 1'5.                     The <U+FB01>rst portion
of Table II. gives in an abbreviated form the result of a compu
tation for various values of i, A, B, R, and the polarization of the
re<U+FB02>ected and refracted rays. When, as frequently happens in
the case of plates of glass, the ray passes through several parallel
surfaces, a portion of the light re<U+FB02>ected back by the second sur
face is again intercepted by the <U+FB01>rst surface.                  It may readily be
proved that,     if'A is the     amount      re<U+FB02>ected    by a  single   surface, the
Tm,
amount transmitted including this internal re<U+FB02>ection will be

be only (I—A)“.           In Table        II.   the values of A, B, R and of
the polarization are given for 2, 8, and 20 surfaces, correspond

   These results are perhaps better shown in <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2, in
which abscissw represent values of i, and ordinates percentages
of polarization. In <U+FB01>g. 1 the four highest curves represent the
polarization of the beams re<U+FB02>ected by l, 2, 8, and 20 surfaces.
The other four curves give the corresponding refracted beams.
Fig. 2 gives all the curves of Table II. relating to 20 surfaces—~
the <U+FB01>ve curves corresponding to A, B, the intensity of the refracted
beam, and the polarization of both the re<U+FB02>ected and refracted
beams.    When i=0, both the re<U+FB02>ected and refracted beams are
unpolarized. With 10 plates of glass about half the light is re
 <U+FB02>ected, the transmitted ray being but little brighter than that
re<U+FB02>ected.     With 1 or 2 surfaces the re<U+FB02>ected beam increases as
2' increases 5 with 8 surfaces it remains nearly constant up to 50°;
 while with 20 surfaces a marked diminution is perceived.             This
 very remarkable result may be expressed by saying that 10 plates
 of glass transmit more light obliquely than normally. The ap
 pearance to.the eye con<U+FB01>rms this result, but it deserves a careful
 photometric proof.       At 57° the re<U+FB02>ected ray         of course, in all

 The transmitted ray, however, diminishes rapidly for large angles
of incidence.    A  very large number of plates are required to render
the polarization nearly complete, which accounts for the light
always remaining when even the best polariscopes                refraction   by
are crossed.     At 90° all the refracted beams are polarized          the            by

another Table was computed by the formula (l—a)", or sup
posing that no internal re<U+FB02>ection took place. A comparison
showed that while the re<U+FB02>ected beam is affected but little, a
great change takes place in the transmitted light. The results
are shown by the dotted lines in <U+FB01>gs. 7, 8, and 10, and will be

discussed below.
    To test the above conclusions, two experimental methods may
be employed.        First, by means of a photometer, to determine
the amount of light in any given case; and, secondly, by means
of a polarimeter, to determine the percentage of polarization of
the re<U+FB02>ected and refracted rays.            The latter method has been
employed    in  the  following experiments.          The instrument com
monly    used  to meaSure the     amount    of  polarization was invented
by Arago, and is called a polarimeter.              It consists of a Nicol’s
prism and Savart’s plates, in front of which are vseveral glass
plates, free to turn, and carrying an index which moves over a
graduated circle, thus showing the angle through which they
have been rotated.        The prism and plates form a Savart’s pola
riscope, which gives coloured bands with either light or dark
centre, according as the plane of the prism is parallel or perpen
dicular to the plane of polarization. When the plates are so
placed that the light passes through them normally, they have
no effect on it; but when turned, they polarize it in a plane pa
rallel to the axis of rotation, and by an amount dependent on
the angle.     Let the instrument be so set that the axis of rota
tion shall be perpendiular to the plane of polarization, and the
plates set at zero.      The bands will then be visible, the centre
one being bright.        As the plates are turned the bands become
 fainter, until the polarization neutralizes that originally present
 in the beam ; beyond this point the bands reappear dark-centred.
The amount of polarization is thus readily determined by turn

 duced to percentages by means of a Table.                 The dif<U+FB01>culty of
 computing    this  Table,  however,    is the  real   objection to the use
 of this instrument. It may be determined by the formulae given
 in the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper; but        it,    of course, then fails to
 prove them.      Moreover no account      is   taken of imperfect trans
 parency, dust on the surface, and other sources of error.                An
 excellent way of forming this Table experimentally              is  to view
 through the instrument        a   beam of light totally polarized.      If
 now the plane of polarization of the beam         is    changed, the per
 centage   of polarization   will  alter,  being   zero whenit   is inclined
 45° to the axis of the plates, and wholly polarized at          an angle of
0° or 90°.     At any angle    a  the beam may be regarded as com
 posed of two, cosia polariZed vertically, and sin’a polarized

                        = cos 2a, from which the polarization correspond
cos? a +     sin’   a

   The result of such a comparison is given in Table III. Four
series of observations were taken, from which curves were con
structed as in <U+FB01>g. 8, with angles of incidence as abscissaa, and
percentages of polarization as ordinates.      A curve was next
drawn, coinciding with them as nearly as possible; and its ordi
nates are given in Table III. column 3; the angles of incidence
are given in the <U+FB01>rst column, and the theoretical polarization in
the second column of the same Table.      Column 4 gives the dif
ferences ; and from it we see that, while the agreement is very
close between 0° and 60°, above this point a marked variation
is perceptible.   This deviation will be further discussed in con
nexion with <U+FB01>g. 8.

    To avoid the defects of the above instrument, the following

in contact, but not overlapping.     To the prism       attached             is              a
Nicol’s prism, free to turn, and carrying an index, moving over
a  graduated circle, which shows how far        has been rotated.
                                                                it

and through the top of this passes the end of a second T,
through the end of which the polarimeter slides. Three of these
tubes are graduated to show the azimuth and altitude of the
polarimeter tube, and the amount it is turned round its own
axis.
   The working of the instrument is as follows. If the Nicol’s
prism be removed and the light unpolarized, the two images of the
aperture at the end will be equally brilliant.  If now the Nicol’s
prism be replaced and turned, the images will vary in brightness,
alternately disappearing at intervals of 90°.   If the light is po
larized, one image will in general be brighter than the other;
but by turning the Nicol’s prism, certain positions will always
be found in which the two images will be equal. The percentage
of polarization is then readily determined from the angle through
which the prism has been turned. To determine the law which
connects these two, let the plane of polarization be vertical, and
the line of junction of the two images parallel to it.   Then call
A and B the brightness of the two images respectively, in which
case the      polarization   p:                     If the prism be turned through
an angle      1;,one image will have a brightness A sin"2   the other     11,

This method, though elegant theoretically, does not appear very
accurate practically, as the plane is more accurately determined
by covering the end of the polarimeter with a cap containing a
plate of selenite, thus converting it into an Arago’s pol-ariseope.
Then turn the tube until the two images have precisely the same
colour, when their line of junction will be inclined 45° to the
plane of polarization.      The plane may also be determined, more
easily  but   less accurately, by removing the Nicol’s prism, and
turning the tube until the two images are equally bright, and
adding 45° to the reading.
    We next wish to determine the delicacy of this instrument in
different parts of its scale.     If the Nicol’s prism be set at an
angle     12',
          differing slightly   from  its true value v, the brightness
of the two images will be Asin’v' and 1300st respectively.
Now     it    commonly assumed that the difference in two such
             is
images   will  be perceptible when the difference in brightness, di
vided     by     the brightness        of either, equals   a   certain fraction                in
                                                                                          2,

   The <U+FB01>rst series of observations were made on the light of the
sky. The instrument was screwed into           post and levelled, the

altitude and azimuth of the sun taken, and the instrument then
directed towards the points to be observed.       Most of these were
in the same vertical plane with the sun, so that       was only ne     it
cessary  to determine their altitudes.    The line of junction was
then brought parallel to the plane of polarization—that is,
turned until     was vertical, since
                    it                  then layin the plane passing
                                                     it

which the two images were equally bright, were then observed,
reading the angles to tenths of degree, and taking the mean.

The percentage of polarization was <U+FB01>nally obtained as described
above. Eleven series of observations were taken :—nine at Water

       the Light re<U+FB02>ected by      the   Sky and by Plates of Glass.    135
ville, N. H., in a valley at a height of 1500 feet, surrounded by
mountains 4000 feet high; the other two from the top. of the
Institute of Technology, Boston. It soon became evident that
 the polarization depended on the solar distance of the point under
observation, and not on its altitude. This is well shown in
<U+FB01>g. 5, in which abscissae give the solar distances, and ordinates
the polarization of the observed points.              The sun’s altitude
varied in these series from 0° to 68°.
    Before discussing these observations further, it seemed desi
rable to determine the polarization of other parts of the atmo
sphere not lying in the same vertical plane with the sun. More
over, as the polarization of points at equal distances from the
sun should be compared, the polarimeter was so mounted that
its principal axis would pass through the sun. The two gra
duated circles would then give solar distances, and the angle
from the vertical plane through the sun instead of altitudes and
azimuths.        The second of these angles will be called the meri
dian—distance, and will be regarded as positive to the right, and
negative to the left of the sun.           Of course, the direction of the
axis should continually change, so as to follow the sun; but as
great accuracy in the determination of the angles was not needed,
it was found suf<U+FB01>cient to readjust it every few minutes. Another
advantage of this arrangement was, that the line of junction,
being turned parallel to the axis, would always lie in the plane
 passing through the sun, and hence be parallel to the plane of
 polarization.
    Five series of observations were made in this way, all tending
 to show that the polarization was independent of the distance
of the point to the right or left of the plane passing through the
 sun. The results are given in Table IV., in which the <U+FB01>rst c0
lumn gives the number of the series, the second the sun’s alti.
 tude, the third its distance from the points observed, the fourth
the number of the latter, and the <U+FB01>fth their mean polarization.

      All   these observations point to one very remarkable result—
    namely, that the polarization is the same for a given solar dis
    tance for any meridian distance—in other words, that the polar
    ization is the same for all points equally distant from the sun.
    The variations in the observations are to be ascribed partly to
    errors of observation and partly to real irregularities in the at
    mosphere, as it is evident that they follow no regular law.       The
    means therefore give us the true polarization with much greater
    accuracy.     They are represented in <U+FB01>g. 5 by small crosses. The
    next thing   is to determine the law which connects the polariza
    tion with the solar distance in all these observations.      A draw
    ing was made like <U+FB01>g. 5 enlarged, and a <U+FB01>ne copper wire laid on
    it and bent into such a shape that it should coincide as nearly
    as           with all the observations.     The ordinates for every
        possible
     10 were then read o<U+FB02>‘, giving the results entered in column 7
    headed “ Observed” of Table I.
        A simple explanation of the polarization of the sky is to as~
     sume that it consists of molecules of air or aqueous vapour
     which re<U+FB02>ect the light specularly, and whose index of refraction
     di<U+FB02>'ers only by a very minute amount from that of the medium
     in which they <U+FB02>oat.     The theoretical polarization would then be
     at once given by Table 11., making 2' equal to one half the solar
     distance.   The curve thus obtained is given in <U+FB01>g. 5 at A. The
    polarization, according to this, should be complete at 90° from
    the sun, while in reality it is only about 70 per cent.      If, how
    ever, we multiply the ordinates of curve A by this fraction, we
     obtain curve B, which agrees almost precisely with the curve
     given in column 2 of Table XII.       c.). Its ordinates are given in
                                             (l.
    column   3,  and the differences in column 4.      From the latter       it

         the  Light re<U+FB02>ected by    the Sky and by Plates of Glass.     137
  will  be seen   that the empirical curve gives results somewhat too
  great for    solar  distances less than 60°, and too small for greater
  distances; but the deviation is so small, compared with the ac
  cidental errors, that we are justi<U+FB01>ed in regarding the agreement
  as complete within the limits of errors of observation.
      It will be noticed that no account is here taken of the points
, of no polarization or neutral points of the sky; but the polar
  ization is very slight for some distance from them, and hence is
  not easily measured.         They must be regarded as due to some
  secondary disturbing cause, as refracted light, which alters the
  general polarization of the sky but little.
      When the polarimeter is directed towards a polished coloured
  plane surface, the two images assume different tints.               One,
   which contains the light polarized in the plane of incidence, or
  A, is composed mainly of the light re<U+FB02>ected specularly, and is
  therefore white like the source of light.         The image B contains
   but little of the light re<U+FB02>ected specularly, consisting principallyof
   the rays emitted by the body, and hence partaking of its colour.
   The idea at once suggested itself, that testing the light of the
   sky in this way might give a clue to the cause of its colour.
   The experiment was tried several times with negative results,
   the two images appearing of precisely the same blue tint.           But
   on the evening of July 15th, near sunset, when measuring the
   polarization of a point near the northern horizon where the blue
   colour was comparatively pale, a marked difference in the two
   images was observable.         The image A was found to be of a yel
   lowish brown, B of a greyish blue or violet tint. This observa
   tion has since been frequently repeated, and can, in fact, be
   made almost any clear evening near sunset.            Evidently we may
   conclude from these colours that        the true  colour of the sky-par
   ticles is blue, a view quite in accordance with the observations
   of Professor Cooke with the spectroscope, and of Professor Tyn
    dall on aqueous vapour in a state of formation.
       Observations were next made to test the results found above
    for the light re<U+FB02>ected and transmitted by several parallel sur
    faces of glass.      To check the results which are given in <U+FB01>gs
    6—10,    two, and   in  some cases three independent methods were
    employed.      To measure the polarization of the re<U+FB02>ected ray, one
    or more sheets of glass were laid on a piece of black velvet and
    rendered horizontal with a spirit-level.          The polarimeter was
    then mounted a short distance from them, carefully levelled,
    and then turned down so that the light should be re<U+FB02>ected from
    their surfaces.       Its angle of depression would then equal the
    complement       of the  angle of incidence.    The line of junction of
    the two images was then rendered vertical, and the polarization
     measured in the usual way.           The polarization of the sky, if

138         Prof. E. C. Pickering     on the Polarization  of
clear, would introduce a large error into the results; and care
was therefore taken to make these observations only on cloudy
days.                    _
   The second method was to replace the slit of a large Babinet’s
goniometer, or optical circle, by a Nicol’s prism, which was free
to turn round its axis, the angle of rotation being measured by
a graduated circle and index.       In the eyepiece of the observing
telescope  a   N icol’s prism  was  placed, and in front of it quartz
wedges giving lines which were bright or dark-centred, accord
ing as the transmitted ray was polarized vertically or horizon
tally.   On looking through the telescope, the <U+FB01>eld was seen to
be traversed by lines, which disappeared only when the Nicol
in the collimator was inclined 45° with the vertical.          At any
other angle, a, the vertical and horizontal components were
cosea and    sin92 a, and hence were equivalent to a beam polarized
vertically by    an  amount cos 2a.    If now any object was inserted
between the two telescopes polarizing the light horizontally p,
the bands would disappear only when 11: cos 2a.             Measuring
the four positions of disappearance and taking their mean, gave
an accurate measure of the polarization by a Table of natural
cosines, as with the polarimeter described above.         Another way
of expressing the effect of this instrument is to ay that the
hands disappear when the Nicol is so turned that the plane of
polarization shall be broughtby the objectunder examination to an
angle of 45°.       The method of measuring the polarization of the
re<U+FB02>ected ray is now obvious. The pieces of glass are placed verti
cally on the centre plate between the two telescopes, the latter set
at an angle of 2i, and the glass turned until the light is re<U+FB02>ected
from its surface, so as to render the <U+FB01>eld bright.        The Nicol is
then turned until the bands disappear, and its position recorded.
The angle between the telescopes is then altered so as to make 2'
successively 20°, 30°, 40°, &c., and the observation repeated.
Various adjustments must be made to eliminate constant errors,
but they need not be detailed here.         One series was made with
a glass prism having an index of 1'52, 9. second with a plate of
coloured glass, a third with a sheet of plate glass, and others
with four and ten microscope slides.            The latter were used
because the thickness of the plate glass was such that, when a
number of plates were placed between the telescopes, a portion
of the internal re<U+FB02>ection would be lost.
   To measure the polarization by refraction, two similar methods
were employed.        The plates were placed vertically over the centre
of a graduated circle, and a piece of ground glass was viewed
through them by the polarimeter.          The plates were then set at
various angles, and     the polarization measured in each case.     All
these observations were made in cloudy weather, to eliminate the

    the   Light re<U+FB02>ected by   the   Sky and by Plates   of Glass.   139
effect of sky polarization.        Several lines were made with the
optical circle and Babinet’s wedges, placing the telescopes oppo
site each other, and recording the angles of the Nicol for various
positions of the plates.        Still a third method was employed,
already described in connexion with the Arago’s polarimeter.
     It will be noticed that no observations are given of the polar
ization of a beam transmitted by one surface of glass. There
seemed to be no easy method of measuring this quantit .              It
might     be done   by making    a series of prisms of such angles that
 when the light was incident on one face at 10°, 20°, 30°, &c., the
refracted rathould strike normally on the second face. The effect
of the latter would then be nothing; so that the polarization
 would in this case be entirely due to the <U+FB01>rst surface.
     To determine the polarization of a single surface of glass, a‘
 plate was covered on one side with lampblaek ; but it was found
 to give the same results as when laid on velvet.            A plate of
 coloured glass was therefore used instead.
      Fig. 6 gives'the results of the observations of the polariza
 tion effected by one surface of glass, <U+FB01>g. 7 that of two surfaces,
 <U+FB01>g. 8 of eight, <U+FB01>g. 9 the re<U+FB02>ected beam for twenty surfaces, and
 <U+FB01>g. 10 the corresponding refracted beam. The smooth curves
 give the theoretical polarization, including the internal re<U+FB02>ec
  tion, and the dotted lines omitting it. The observations of the
  re<U+FB02>ected beam agree very well with theory, especially when the
  number of surfaces is small.       The refracted beams, on the other
  hand, show a deviation from theory which becomes perceptible
  for one plate above 80°, for four plates above 65°, and for ten
  plates above 20°.
      The errors most likely to occur, which would be common to
  all the observations on the refracted beams, are, <U+FB01>rst, stray light,
  or light entering the instrument without passing through the
   glass; secondly, light passing through the glass endwise, which
   might be recognized by its deep green colour; and thirdly,
  light re<U+FB02>ected from the front surfaces of the plates.          But all
  these errors would tend to diminish instead of increase the po
  larization ; and hence, if eliminated, the divergence from theory
   would be still greater.      Probably the true explanation is that
   internal re<U+FB02>ection does not take place as completely as theory
   assumes, partly owing to the imperfect transparency of the
   medium, and partly to the dust and other impurities on the
   surface. It makes but little difference for the re<U+FB02>ected rays, the
   polarization being the same for three values of           namely, 0°,
                                                             2',
   57°, and 90°.     For the refracted ray, on the other hand, the varia
   tions are very great, amounting in the case of twenty surfaces,
   at 90° incidence to over 50 per cent.        From the dotted lines we
   see that a  partial absence of the internal re<U+FB02>ection would account

  for all the results obtained, while neglecting it entirely would
  cause a still greater divergence between theory and observation.
      On account of the thickness of the bundle of ten plates of
  glass, a portion of the secondary re<U+FB02>ection would be thrown a
  considerable     distance    to one side, especially when    i is large, so
  that it might fall quite outside of the instrument, or even be cut
  off by the ends of the plates. This effect would be least marked
   with the polarimeter, next with the Savart, and most of all with
  the optical circle, on account of the small aperture of the tele
  scope.     But this is just the order in which the observations
   stand, all of them falling between the two theoretical curves.
   These observations also show the effect to be expected from a
   bundle of plates when used to polarize light by refraction.              If
   ten plates are employed, set, as is usual, at 57°, the polariza
   tion would be only 6712 per cent. if internal re<U+FB02>ection took
   place, but would be 95'2 if this were in any way excluded.              We
   may in passing point out that an advantage might be expected
   in such a polari'scope from an increase in the angle of incidence,
   the increased polarization probably more than making up for
   the loss of light and distortion induced by the increased obliquity
   of the incident rays.
      rl‘he want of perfect transparency of _the glass would also tend
   to increase the polarization by enfeebling the secondary re<U+FB02>ec
   tion ; and dirt or grease on themsurface of the glass would pro
   duce the same effect. With eight or with two surfaces these dis
   turbing causes are much less marked, except for large angles
                                                                               '
   of incidence, and hence the agreement with theory much better.

      in Reply to Professor Challis.           By ROBERT MOON, M.A.,
      Honorary Fellow of Queen’s College, Cambridge*.
                    appreciating the candour evinced by Professor
    WHILE   Challis  throughout our discussion,       I cannot su<U+FB01>'er to pass
   in silence  his   assertion-{-  that   my “hydrodynamical researches
   are founded on differential equations which are really the same

and value, that v is an arbitrary function of p, and, by conse
quence, on substituting for v in f(p, 2:), that p is also an arbi—
trary function of p.“
   The tep here taken is nothing other than eliminating p                                          be
tween (2) and the equation
                                       P=f(p,         v),
where f(p, v) is absolutely identical with the right-hand side 0f(2) ;
and no such result as funct. (p, v)=0, or v=funct. p, can be
derived from such elimination.       For, when x in equation (2) is
spoken of as representing    an arbitrary function, all that is meant
is that in every case of motion the pressure may be expressed in
terms of p and v in the manner indicated by (2), where x repre
sents some function or other depending upon the particular cir
cumstances of the motion.
   In any particular case of motion x will have a de<U+FB01>nite value;
and to assume that in this particular case another relation exists
between p, p, v, viz. p=f(p, v), where f(p, v)is not identical with
the right side of (2), is simply to beg the question at issue.
   To put the matter in a di<U+FB02>'erent light—we have to start with,
as    Professor Challis admits,

   How can       be possible, in general, to eliminate three quanti
                   it
ties between these three equations so as to obtain the result
12: funct. p, or        p:
                     funct.      It true that under particular cir
                                       p   'F        is
cumstances we may do this, and under th0se circumstances no
doubt Mr. Earnshaw’ equations and mine may coincide; but the
                               s
ratio of the number of cases in which our equations differ to the
number in which they agree must be simply in<U+FB01>nite.
 I    observe that ProfessOr Challis refers to my solution of (l)

 I    have no doubt that this could be shown directly, in the

146             Dr. Helmholtz      on Galvanic   Polarization
powerful at the commencement, under the ordinary conditions
of observation, but mostly soon dwindles to imperceptibility.
    It is this simple experiment to which my investigations refer.
The question to be solved was, On what depends the apparently
unlimited duration of the polarizing current? for in a series
composed as above described, unless other changes also occur in
it, the electrolytic conduction which results according to Fara
 day’s law in the liquids cannot take place without infringing
the law of the conservation of energy.          That    to say,
                                                         is       no  if
 other equivalents of potential energy are expended, in such               a
 series the mechanical equivalent of the heat generated in the
 circuit must be equal to the work equivalent of the chemical
 forces which become active and are expended in electrolysis.
 The latter, however,     the decomposition proceeds according to
                         if
the law of electrolytic equivalents,       negative*, and therefore
                                          is
cannot be equal to    a positive  heat-work   to be produced     the  by
 current. If, then, Faraday’s lawis exclusively valid, the decom
 position of water, even in the minutest quantity, cannot be
 maintained continually       by Daniell’s element,
                                  a                   Indeed no dis~
engagement     of the gases of  which water      is
                                                composed    observed
                                                                is
in the above-described experiment, however long the current
lasts.
      It moreover to be remarked that not even
           is                                              by
                                                         di<U+FB01>'usion or
any process   similar  to diffusion could the  molecules   of hydro
gen and oxygen, which on the polarization of the plates are
urged towards them, become free and, again unelectric, remove
from them.      Such an occurrence would <U+FB01>nally give, as the re
sult of the work,    awater-decomposition   for which no equivalent
inciting force would be present in the Daniell’s element.        If, as
is probable, on the polarization of the electrodes       changed ar

rangement of the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen enters, whether
in the interior or at the boundary surfaces of the liquid, these
particles are at all events kept in their places           by
                                                         chemical or,
electric forces of attraction till new forces come to aid of suf<U+FB01>
cient power to set them free. Whatever relations between elec
tric and chemical attraction-forces may be assumed,           the law
                                                                 if
of the conservation of energy holds good, an electric attraction
upon one of the elements, whose potential        su<U+FB02>iciently great to
                                                  i
overcome the chemical a<U+FB02>inity, can itself be again overpowered
     According to Andrews,     gramme of hydrogen in burning to water gives
  *                           1
33,808 heat units; according to Favre and Silbermann,34,462.       For each
gramme of hydrogen, in the Daniell’s element, 32‘5 grm. of zinc are dis
solved, and the equivalent amount of copper precipitated.     This quantity
of zinc, when   itseparates copper from combination with sulphuric acid,
generates, according to Favre, only 23,205 units of heat.    Corresponding
to this, an electromotive force of at least 1%Daniell’s element  isrequisite
in order to maintain even the feeblest lasting decomposition of water.

  only by     a force  of equal or greater equivalent of work, so as to
  make the attracted particle freely movable in the liquid.
       But if the electromotive force of the Daniell’s element pro
  duces in our case no visible decomposition of water, it yet pro—
  duces polarization of the electrodes; and this is itself an equi
  valent of work; for the polarized plates are afterwards, when
  separated from the polarized galvanic element, able for a certain
  time to generate independently an electric current, therefore to
  develop heat in the conducting wire, or, with a suitable ar
  rangement, to perform respectively all other forms of work which
  galvanic current can perform.            In the state of polarization we
  have evidently to do with a changed arrangement of the ponder
  able atoms and the electricities in the decomposition-cell          and on
  its electrodes, on the particular nature of which we have no need.
  here to make any more special assumptions or suppositions, as
  long as the question is only the consideration of the work
  values.       The state _of polarization is to be regarded as a new
     tate of equilibrium, to which the source of decomposition, under             .
   the in<U+FB02>uence of the electrizing of the electrodes, tends, and
   which, when the electricity accumulated in the electrodes can
   discharge itself, tends back again to the state of electrically neu
   tral equilibrium.        But since for the production of a changed
   equilibrium in a limited system of bodies (such as is the decom
   position-cell) only a <U+FB01>nite amount of work is ever necessary, the
   production of polarization must always give only a current of
   <U+FB01>nite duration, or one whose intensity asymptotically approaches
   to zero, and the polarizing current could on the whole make only
   as much electricity <U+FB02>ow in the one direction as the depolarizing
    in the opposite.
        So far as this is the case (and my experiments show that in
    gas-free liquids and with gas-free electrodes such a condition
    can be very nearly attained) the decomposition-cell acts as a con
    denser of very great capacity.        In fact, if (according to the usual
    mode of representation) negatively charged oxygen be supposed
     in the vicinity of one electrode, and positively charged hydrogen
    near the other, but so that an interchange of electricities be
     tween the electrodes and the said constituents of water is not
     possible, the corresponding quantity of the opposite electricity
     may accumulate on the electrode itself; and each electrode
     would then, with the liquid, form a condener with vanishingly
     small thickness of the insulating layer and, just on this account,
     of enormous capacity.        This analogy has recently been empha
     sized by Messrs. Varley* and Maxwell-I".

      Indeed the phenomena which arise when a pair of polarizable
  plates are inserted in a circuit correspond in their main features
  with those which would be presented by a condenser of very
  great capacity.     The polarizing current is the current which
  charges the condenser, the depolarizing that which discharges
  it. The capacity of the condenser has only to be imagined so
  great that its charging and discharge require perceptible periods
  of time (seconds or minutes). Mr. Varley has tried to measure
  the capacity of such a condenser ; but the sequel will show that,
  unless extraordinary measures of precaution be used in the ex
  periments, other occurrences may play an important part and in
  <U+FB02>uence in a high degree the <U+FB01>nal result.
      The occurrences, then, in actual experiments with polarizable
  electrodes are distinguished from what happens in a well-insu
  lated condenser by this—that the charging current has a much
  longer duration than the discharging one, diminishes more
  slowly, and never entirely ceases.      In this respect a cell with
   polarizable platinum plates appears to resemble a. condenser with
   an imperfectly insulating partition; and even the phenomena
   of residual electricity <U+FB01>nd their analogue in the reinforcement of
   polarization which occurs after each interruption of the current.
       It would lie near to assume the same reason for the continu
   ance of the charging current with a polarized decomposition-cell
   as for the imperfect insulation of a condenser, viz. the existence
   of a slight metallic conducting-power in the electrolyzable
   liquids; and this would include a limitation of the validity of
   Faraday’s law.     Before we draw such a conclusion, however, we
   must inquire    whether  other changes, which might have similar
   results, do not also occur in the liquid and the electrodes.   And
   indeed it would be necessary here to think chie<U+FB02>y of the part
   which may be played by gases held in solution in the liquid, or,
   according to Graham’s discovery, occluded in the metal of the
   electrodes.
       It is well known that the' galvanic polarization of a platinum
   plate which serves as the hydrogen electrode in a decomposition
-  cell is diminished or destroyed by direct contact with the oxygen
   of the air, by access of water containing air, and by the contact
   of liquids which contain chemically combined oxygen, but may
   give it up‘to the separating hydrogen.
       The same holds for the oxygen polarization of a platinum plate
   when it is in contact with hydrogen dissolved in water or other
   chemical combinations which can take up oxygen.
       Besides, we know, as discovered by Graham, that platinum is
   capable, though in a less degree than palladium, of taking hy
   drogen into its own mass.       The reception of oxygen, which we
  know takes place in silver in a state of fusion, could not, it is

                             in Liquids free from Gas.                         149'
true, be directly proved chemically for platinum by Graham;
yet the phenomena of polarization to be described in the sequel
seem to indicate that perfectly similar relations subsist for oxy
gen as for hydrogen, and that only the quantity of oxygen that
can be occluded by platinum is much less than that of hy
                                                                                  "
drogen.
    If, then, an electric current traverses a water-decomposition
cell whose liquid holds hydrogen in solution, or whose platinum
electrodes have occluded           it,
                                  at that electrode to which the cur
rent urges the oxygen this may again become water, a'corre
sponding quantity of dissolved hydrogen from the water, or of
occluded hydrogen from the electrode, being consumed for that
purpose.        On the other hand, instead of this hitherto free
hydrogen (at least not chemically combined with oxygen), an
equal amount of electrolytically separated hydrogen will reap
pear at the other electrode, and either be dissolved in the liquid
or,  if there be time and space for        even be driven into the pla

place in the liquid, yet the two products of the electrolysis do
not <U+FB01>nally appear, but the last result          that free hydrogen dis

pears    in  increased   quantity. For this process, which plays a
prominent part in polarization-currents,             would propose the
                                                          I
name electrolytic convection.        Hence, in this process, the elec
tromotive force which drives the current has not also to perform
 the work against the forces of the chemical af<U+FB01>nity of hydrogen
 and oxygen, which must be performed when water               to be <U+FB01>nally

 separated into these its two elements; and therefore electrolytic
 convection can be kept up            by
                                       feeble electromotive force which
                                           a
is quite inadequate actually to decompose water—for instance,
the force of only     single Daniell element.

    The same thing holds when the liquid contains oxygen, or                     if
the platinum plates have occluded it. Then, through electro
lytic convection, free oxygen disappears on one side, while the
same amount       forthcoming on the other.
                    is                                                 -          ~

 with platinum electrodes, maintain an unceasing feeble current
 not merely when the liquid is in contact with air, but also in a
 perfectly closed vessel, if its electrodes are saturated with oxygen
 and its liquid holds oxygen in solution.
    The apparatus with which          I  experimented in this direction
 was an hermetically closed voltameter connected with a mercu
 rial air-pump, containing two large platinum plates of approxi
 mately 180 and 300 sq. centims. surface cylindrically bent to
 wards each other, and having derivation outwards through pla
 tinum wires fused into them.            The li aid in this voltameter
 extended downwards to the mercury of              thepump, with which          it
 was raised and lowered, while the gases which collected above
 the liquid could always be drawn oil through               separate cock.

 It was thus possible at any time to restore above the liquid                   a
 vacuum containing only aqueous vapour, and gradually to clear
 the liquid of every trace of dissolved gas.
    Saturation of the plates with oxygen       is  attained thus: during
 several days oxygen          developed on them
                             is                          by feeble current

 conducted to them through        a   platinum wire as hydrogen-elec
 trode. I     have seen for weeks together     a   current maintained           by
 electrolytic convection alone, under         the   in<U+FB02>uence of      limited
                                                                       a
 stock of oxygen in hermetically isolated liquid.          It character
                                                                  is
istic of the in<U+FB02>uence of the liquid herein, that every mechanical
 motion of    it,but especially circulating motions which are called
forth by changes of temperature, adds considerably to the inten
sity of the current. This as good as entirely fails in gas-free
liquids.

                                                                  is
because  it   can collect in very great quantity in the plates. When
the plates and the liquid are copiously saturated with electroly
 tically developed hydrogen, such         a  decomposition-cell     behaves
 towards    feebler   currents, for hours or     even  for days,  as    nona
polarizable element, similarly to         a  solution of silver between
 silver electrodes.     In spite of its being inserted, measurements
 of resistance in its circuit can be effected with the most perfect
 accuracy; and         shows, after interruption of the battery-cur
                        it
rent, scarcely      trace of polarization.
                    a                          Hitherto  I have succeeded
better in producing this state of hydrogen saturation                    emby
ploying    dilute  sulphuric   acid as  the electrolytic liquid  than   with
distilled water.
    The constancy of the current, however, comes to an end when,
through convection of the hydrogen, its store in one of the plates
begins to run short.
    Under these conditions, by employing only one (but                 wella
 conducting) Daniell element, development of hydrogen as                 gas
                                                                           a
 can be observed at the plate to which         is

an apparent decomposition of water.              That this happens has
already   been    seen by previous observers, but without a very
exact determination of the conditions.
   The course of things is but little different when, without
alteration of the state of the electrodes, the electrolytic liquid is
exhausted of gas by keeping it for weeks in the vacuum of the
mercury pump.        I    succeeded in making greatly diluted sulphu
ric acid so free from gas that, on pumping out, it would not free
itself from the vessel, and would not break up under the nega
tive pressure of a mercury column of 60 millims. height.                But
even when distilled water was employed,            Ihave constantly been
able to bring it to this—that the traces of air at any time still
escaping from the water, in the course of three or four days no
longer perceptibly augmented the pressure in the vacuum, the
volume of which amounted to about one sixth of that of the
liquid, and which contained only aqueous vapour.                      -      .
   Under these circumstances also, when the plates were copi
ously charged with one of the two gases, currents entered, which
might last for several days, but <U+FB01>nally sank to imperceptible in
tensity. The multiplier here employed showed a de<U+FB02>ection of
1 degree when traversed by a current which in twenty-fourhoura
was capable of developing only 003 cub. centim. of hydrogen.
A second difference was, that, as already remarked, motion of the
liquid failed to strengthen the current.
    On the other hand, the in<U+FB02>uence of the gases occluded in the
platinum plates showed itself very distinctly when              I
                                                                altered the
 quantity   of the   store  of gas contained  in  both.   To  this  end, at
the original charging of the plates with oxygen             I conveyed by
electrolysis small quantities of hydrogen to the two plates in
conducting connexion.           The second electrode was the mercury
alloyed with     a  little  zinc;  the electrolytic liquid was distilled
water.     The oftener this was done, the briefer became the dura
tion both of the current produced in the voltameter by aDaniell
element and of the depolarization-current after the removal of
the element.       The same course of current-intensities which at
the commencement, with a copious charge of oxygen, was ac
complished in twenty-four hours, was <U+FB01>nally, with the plates
cleared as much as possible, run through in eighteen minutes.
But  if, after this course was entered, more hydrogen was brought
to the plates, the duration of the current again increased, because
now the plates began to be charged with hydrogen.                   believe,
                                                                    I
moreover, that herein the minimum of gas-charging of the plates
has not yet been reached, because even with the minimum
attained of duration of the current there remained              asmall dif
ference of time in favour of the polarizing compared with the
depolariaing current.       It   is, however,  a   very tedious labour     to

152        On Galvanic Polarization in Liquids free from Gas.
 produce this minimum, because gases move on with extraordi
 nary slowness in metal when they are not impelled by any ex
 terior electromotive force ; to remove the last remains of them
 consumes on this account an extreme length of time.
     To show this slowness of the gas-motion       I    adduce the follow
 ingz—Polarized plates of platinum standing in the usual air
 containiug liquids apparently lose their polarization ina few
 hours, or even minutes, when in conducting connexion with
 each other.      Indeed on this circumstance depended, for instance,
 the utility   of the polarizable electrodes employed by E. du Bois
 Reymond formerly for experiments on animal electricity.                 On
 the contrary, in a gas-free liquid polarization dies away at <U+FB01>rst,
 it is true, quickly, but later very slowly.       I   have in such a case
 observed    in the  multiplier   the   depolarizing  current   for sixteen
 days.     From the electrolytic equivalents of the current used for
 the polarization of the plates and the depolarization-current
afterwards still existing it followed that months must elapse ere
 so feeble a current as the last named was could remove the
residue of the gas-charge still present.
     The phenomena in polarization which are similar to those at
 tending the residual electricity of a Leyden jar, are accounted
 for by the occlusion of the gases.          When hydrogen is penetra
 ting a platinum plate,     if the current   be interrupted a few seconds,
 the gas has time during this interruption to advance further
 into the interior, and thereby diminish its density in the super
 <U+FB01>cial layers.    If  the circuit be closed again, the resistance to the
 entry   of fresh  hydrogen is thereby diminished, the current may
 become stronger.        Conversely, the depolarization-current can
 remove the gas which has been driven to the surface; if we in
terrupt this current, the hydrogen Slowly pressing up from
 within will be able to accumulate at the surface and reinforce
its polarization. It is known that in a platinum plate, behind
 an oxygen polarization an older hydrogen polarization can exist
 simultaneously, which latter comes to light when the former has
vanished, and vice versd.
              I
    So far as can ee, the phenomena belonging here are without
 dif<U+FB01>culty explained if we assume for the onward motion of the
         occluded in metals the same laws as for the conduction of
]gases
   cat.
     Lastly, it is to be remarked that in these cases, after the cur
 rent of the condenserhas passed (that       is,   the electricity attached
 only to the surface of the plates    is    discharged), another current
can only set in in proportion as gas presses from the interior of
the metal to the surface.      If     this takes place only very slowly,
 the current-intensity in the circuit becomes as good as inde
 pendent of the resistance of the latter; so that, in my experi

Inents, insertions of from 20 to 60 miles of telegraph-wire cer
tainly made the needle of the multiplier go back for a few se
conds, but then soon permitted it to return to its previous de—
<U+FB01>ection. The resistance of the rest of the circuit amounted to
only about 2 miles of the same wire; the behaviour of the per
manent current-intensities which appeared in the circuit with
alternating resistances was just as if there existed at the surface
of the plates a passing resistance in comparison with which
40—60 miles of wire was vanishingly little.      This enormous ap-    ..
                                                                      'i
parent transitory resistance, hOWBVCI‘, existed only for just the
then present direction of the current; if a current of the oppo
site direction was called forth, no such resistance was present.
This holds good not only for platinum electrodes polarized by a
Daniell element nearly to the maximum, but also for such as have
been again depolarized almost to the vanishing of the polariza
tion, and have thus arrived as nearly as possible at their natural
state.

Treatise on Practical Solid or Descriptive Geometry : embracing
    Orthographic Projection and Perspective or Radial Projection. By
   W. TIMBBELL PIERCE, Architect, late Lecturer on Geometrical
   Drawing at King’s College, London.      With 85 Plates of Original
   Drawing.      London:     Longmans,  Green, and Co.   1873.
          volume is a small quarto, consisting of the plates and a
’l‘HIS text of 86 pages.      About two thirds of it are devoted to
orthographic, and the remaining third to radial projection.       The
former part is strictly elementary, but it embraces all the points
which under ordinary circumstances a student would wish to
make out.      After a brief view of the projection of points and
lines, with a. few examples, the author fairly begins the subject in
the second chapter, on Straight Lines and Planes, which is in
substance the same as the <U+FB01>rst section of the Géométrie Descrip
tive of Monge.     It is followed by a good many applications—one
chapter (the third) treating of the projections of the <U+FB01>ve regular
solids, while the fourth shows how to determine the projections of
a. cube from various data, and to solve a few other problems.     The
remainder of this part of the work is mainly devoted to a. number
of questions of intersection and tangency of a plane with cylinder,
cone, and sphere, and of the mutual intersection and tangency of
the same solids with each other; though a few other cases are
given, such as the section of an annulus by a plane, and the con
tact of a. cone with a surface of revolution.       The treatment is
clear and accurate; and though the subject is not without its di<U+FB01>i
culties, the student who brings to it a moderate acquaintance with
solid geometry will be able to read it without serious trouble.
    The case is somewhat di<U+FB01>erent in the second part, the subject

of which (radial projection) presents dif<U+FB01>culties of                a much higher
order than those of orthographic projection ; and Mr. Pierce’s
treatment by no means smooths down its asperities.                     Of course a
reader who has worked conscientiously through the <U+FB01>rst part, has

prime vertical, mural circle, and equatorial of the observatory. The
preliminary matter treats principally of the methods employed for
the reduction, throughout the Catalogue, to the Besselian epoch
18600, when the sun’s longitude was 280°. The Catalogue gives :—
the designations or numbers of the stars observed as they stand in
the catalogues named, with the magnitudes, the mean right ascen—
sion 18600 with the mean year of observation; the number of ob—
servations of each star with its annual precession in 1860; the
mean declination, mean year of observation, number of observations,
and annual recession in 1860.
   The Catalbgue contains a large number of small stars which
were observed in consequence of Mr. James Ferguson, who had
charge of the equatorial, requiring many for comparison with
the objects observed by him.         Mr. Ferguson having observed the
stars of the Pleiades with the equatorial, and those in Prznsepe
having been observed with the same instrument by Professor
Hall, many in both clusters were reobserved with the transit
instrument and mural circle.          The resulting right ascensions and
declinations are inserted separately from those determined with the
equatorial.     We cordially recommend this Catalogue to the atten
tion of amateurs, and the more so as so many telescopes of large
aperture are now in active work in this country.

 ON A NEW      DETERMINATION OF THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT
                OF HEAT. - BY H. SERRANO Y FATIGATI
         mechanical equivalent of heat had not, until now, been deter
THE  mined by the relation which subsists between the work expended
to turn the disk of a Ramsden electrical machine and the electro
static decompositions produced.         The following are, in brief, the
process   I  have employed to resolve the problem and the results
which   I have obtained.
   To turn the disk and measure the work,             I  wound round the
handle of the disk of a Ramsden machine two strings passing over
two pulleys and carrying each a weight at its extremity—the one

  of 17 kilogr., and the other of 22.             These weights descended near
  two graduated rules.         I  have deducted from the calculated work
  (1) the  work   equivalent     to   the via viva retained by the weights at
 the end of their fall, (2) the work consumed by the friction of the
 strings against the handle and in the pulleys.
                               I
     On the other hand, estimated as exactly as possible the heat
 developed by the cushions,—<U+FB01>rst by employing a good mercurial
 thermometer, and then by means of a thermoelectric pile compared
 with the preceding indications, and measuring approximately the
 speci<U+FB01>c heat of the cushions and the disk, taking into consideration
 the losses in the air.       The quantity thus obtained was likewise de—
 ducted from the calculated work.
    Finally, to measure the electrolyzation,              I  took two large test
tubes, graduated and furnished with platinum wires extending to
 their bottom, one of which was connected with the machine, while
 the other was in communication with the earth.                  These tubes were
 immersed in a large receiver containing acidulated water, and united
 by means of a long string wetted to serve as a conductor to the
electricity without producing sparks.

 operations :—

           ON  THE EXPANSIBILITY or EBONITE BY HEAT.
                              BY    1'. KOHLRAUSCH.
    Accidentally repeated observations that ebonite lids stuck fast in
glass vessels, or even cracked them, led me to the idea that this
material might have a considerable expansibility by heat. Expec
tation was exceeded by reality; for it was found to be about three
times as expansible as zinc.
    The coef<U+FB01>cient for      1° was found to be
             0'0000770 measured between 16°'7 and 25°'3,
             0'0000842             ,,        ,,       25°‘3 ,, 35°‘4.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.             157
Thus the increase with the temperature is very considerable.             The
linear coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion for the temperature t can be put
                         0'000061 + 00000007 6 t.
     Two strips of ebonite and sheet zinc, when rivetted together, curve
very materially with even a moderate heating.           A thin strip of ivory
 20 centims. in length, cemented by means of isinglass to a similar
 one of ebonite, even without index, forms a delicate thermometer,
 seeing that its free end moves through several millimetres for one
 degree.    The curvature in consequence of unequal expansion may
 be most simply demonstrated by the aid of a mere plate of ebonite ;
 for, owing to its bad conductivity, it curves considerably when rapidly
 heated on one side.
     The solid expansion of ebonite is, from the above numbers, at 0°
 equal to that of mercury; at higher temperatures it is still greater.
 It is possible that other kinds expand still more, so that as a curio
 sity a mercurial thermometer might be constructed whose scale
 sunk on being heated.
     The great expansion may possibly be connected with the pro
 portion of sulphur which ebonite contains: Kopp found" for the
 coef<U+FB01>cient of sulphur 0'000061 at 30°. On the other hand, the
 contrast to soft caoutchouc is very remarkable.
     I will mention one fact which was observed in the observation
 of expansion.     The bar of ebonite, which was about a centimetre in
 thickness, after being heated required a considerable time before it
 assumed a constant length.          Although the bad conductivity is
 doubtless the principal cause of this,     I imagine that another phe
 nomenon is also at work.       Like the elastic change of form, the ex
 pansion by heat may also not take place instantaneously, but con
 tinue itself after the change of temperature, gradually becoming
.weaker.      A few observations of Matthiessen’s with glass rods
 (Poggendorlf’s Annalm, vol. cxxviii. p. 521) seem to point in this
 direction; probably this thermal afteraction, like the elastic, occurs
 in an eminent degree in organic substances.—Poggend0rif’s Au
 'nalen, N0. 8, 1873.

the discharge through air.

    Let us consider an electri<U+FB01>ed conductor having              a charge q, and
suppose that a quantity of electricity dq escapes from the electri<U+FB01>ed
body and disappears into the air.             When this electricity dq passes
from a level surface where the potential function has a value V, to
the in<U+FB01>nitely near level surface Where the potential function has
the value V+dv, designating by dn the in<U+FB01>nitely small portion of

the repulsive force exerted on dq 1s —                   The elementary work

of the repulsion, in passing from one level surface to the surface
 in<U+FB01>nitely near is —dqu.                Consequently, when the quantity of
electricity dq      removes    to    in<U+FB01>nity, the corresponding work has the
value V’dq, if we call V’ the potential function at the surface of the
conductor, or, what is the same thing, in the interior of this con—
ductor: this expression has already been given by M. Helmholtz.
     But in proportion as the loss of electricity is e<U+FB01>ected, the charge
on the conductor diminishes; it is the same with the potential
function. The potential function V' is proportional to the charge
 q of the conductor; we can put V'=aq, a being a constant peculiar
 to the conductor.          The work necessary to repel to in<U+FB01>nity the
 quantity   of   electricity dq is (lg (lg.    Consequently, calling the initial
 charge   of   the  conductor     go, the work   necessary for repelling all the
 electricity of the body      to   an  in<U+FB01>nite  distance has for its expression

     Therefore the work consumed by the repulsion of all the electri
  city to in<U+FB01>nity is equal to the potential of the electricity; or, in
  other terms, the mechanical equivalent of the external discharge is
  equal to the potential of the electricity. The result would evidently
  be the same for a system of electri<U+FB01>ed conductors.
     The value of T is independent of the path pursued by the elec
  tricity which escapes from the conductors; it is easy to recognize
  that this value remains the same when two equal quantities of op
  posite electricities meet on their passage and recombine.                       _
     Let us in fact suppose that two quantities of electricity, +m and
   -m, recombine in a point M to form neutral electricity; let V be
  the potential function in this point.           Suppose that at the point M
  the electricity     +m is repelled by the force —mcg            ; the portion of
  the work     T necessary to remove +m to in<U+FB01>nity, starting from the
  point M, is Van. The quantity —m, on the contrary, situated at
  the point M, is attracted ;_ the attractive force has the same value
  as the repulsive force; and when —m removes from M to in<U+FB01>nity,
  the corresponding work is equal to the preceding and of the con
  trary sign. The value of T remains consequently the same, whether
   the two electricities recede to in<U+FB01>nity or recombination takes place

 at any point whatever.     It is necessarily the same if recombination
 is produced upon a conductor.
    This is the case presented, for instance, in the discharge from a
  Leyden jar. Let us consider aspheri cal jar : we will call 1' the radius
 of the sphere which is formed by the interior coating, e the thick
 ness of the glass. It q denotes the charge of the interior coating
 at a given instant, clq the quantity of electricity repelled from the
 interior to the exterior coating when these two coatings are united
 by a conductor, the work e<U+FB01>ected in the repulsion of the quantity
 of electricity dq is

   The factor contained in the parenthesis represents the potential
function on the interior coating. We thus again <U+FB01>nd, in the par
ticular case of the Leyden jar, the expression of the potential of
the electricity.
     M. Helmholtz was the <U+FB01>rst who applied the theory of the po—
  tential to the discharge of the Leyden jar. His researches have
  been completed by M. Clausius’<U+FB01> and the theory of the experi
 ments of M. Riess can now be regarded as very satisfactory.            It
  still remains, however, to inquire how the discharge is produced,
 independently of the value of its mechanical equivalent. M. Helm
 holtz, after explaining the heat disengaged in M. Riess’s experi
 ments, adds :—
     “ This law is
                   easy to understand, provided the discharge of a bat
 tery be not represented as a simple movement of electricity in one direc
 tion, but as A SERIES or OSCILLATIONS BETWEEN THE mm columns,
 oscillations which become less and less continually until the ole viva
 is extinguished by the sum of the resistances "1‘.
    We have just seen that the discharge may be represented by a
movement of the electricity directed from one coating towards the
 other.
    From the preceding may be deduced the demonstration of a
theorem established by Gauss in the case of a single conductor, and
generalized Afterwards by M. Liouville for a system of conductors :—
When conductors contain respectively equal quantities of the two
<U+FB02>uids, all these conductors are in the neutral state. Indeed in this
case the potential
                     is‘nil ; consequently the external discharge of the
system of conductors cannot give rise to any work.— Comptes Rendus

             XXI.    On the Electric Resistance  of Selenium.

           recently discovered fact of the diminution of the electric
 THE   resistance  of selenium in the crystalline state when exposed
 to the action of light or, possibly, of radiant heat, is one which
 naturally excites some interest beyond that arising from the
 curious and unexpected nature of the phenomenon considered
 by itself; for the possibility of selenium being applied to the
 measurement of light or radiant heat invests the discovery with
 a very general importance.
    Mr. Willoughby Smith       seems   to have satis<U+FB01>ed himself that
                                                I
 light, not heat, is the activeagent; but have spoken of the
 latter as possibly the cause of the effect observed, as Lieutenant
 Sale’s paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (although
 it is therein stated that selenium is affected by light, and again,
that the change of resistance is not due to an alteration of tem
 perature) might lead one to infer that the observed e<U+FB01>'ect was
due to radiant heat, not to light; for he says that the actinic
rays produce no effect, but that it is at a maximum in the red
 rays, or beyond them, near the maximum of the heat-rays 5 and
inasmuch as he appears not to have determined by means of the
thermopile the relative calori<U+FB01>c power of the various rays of his
spectrum, nor even to have reduced his results to what they
would have been if the normal or diffraction spectrum had been
employed, the experiment is inconclusive as to the comparative

  162               The Earl of Rosse   on the Electric
  sensibility of selenium to the various rays of the solar spec
  trum.
      As it was the opinion of one or two friends of much experi
  ence in kindred questions in physical science that heat, not
  light, is the active agent, and that selenium might with advan
 tage replace the thermopile in the measurement of radiant heat,
  I  procured the necessary apparatus for a preliminary trial.
      Although my experiments are hardly suf<U+FB01>cient to justify a de
  cided opinion in favour of or against its applicability to photo
 metric purposes,     I think that they remove all hope of selenium
 replacing the thermopile in the measurement of heat of low
 refrangibility.
     I   exposed a rod of selenium during a suf<U+FB01>cient interval to
 obtain the maximum effect from the light of a candle 3% inches
 distant.     The diminution of resistance produced amounted to
 243 per cent. A second trial gave a diminution of 24'2 per
 cent., the candle being at 4 inches distance.         A vessel of hot
 water of about 9 or 10 inches diameter and 9 inches height pro
 duced no perceptible change when it stood for several minutes
 with its centre at 13 inches distance, nor even when it was
 brought 6 inches nearer.        On the other hand, by means of the
 thermopile    a deviation  to the extent of 136 divisions of the scale
 of a Thomson’s galvanometer was produced by the radiation from
 the vessel of hot water whose centre was at 13 inches distance;
 and when it was replaced by the candle at 4 inches distance,
 the deviation was increased to only 315 divisions.        Thus it was
 shown that the two instruments were not comparable as measu
rers of the radiation from the two sources of heat.
     The change of resistance produced by exposure to the radia
tion from a candle when a sheet of glass was alternately inter
posed and removed was next measured" 'The effect due to ab
sorption by the glass appeared to be small, certainly not much
more, possibly even less than the average absorption of light by
glass.     Perhaps 90 'per cent. was transmitted. Owing to the
inconstancy of the light, much accuracy was not readily obtain
able in this experiment.       The piece of glass had been shown by
the thermopile to transmit 80 per cent. of the solar rays, and
under 1 per cent. of the radiant heat from a blackened tin ves
sel of hot water.      It was now by the same means ascertained
that 48 per cent. of the radiant heat from a candle was trans
mitted by it.‘
     A glass cell <U+FB01>lled with a solution of alum was now taken; and
it was found that, while the exposure of the selenium bar to the
radiation from a naked candle at 3% inches distance produced a
diminution of resistance amounting to 9'41 per cent., when the
alum solution was interposed the decrease was still 8'95 ,per

                         Resistance   of Selenium.                   163
cent. ; hence the quantity transmitted by the glass cell and
the alum solution it contained was as much as 952 per cent., as
measured by the rod of selenium.
   The same, measured by the thermopile, was found to be 7'06
per cent.
   Having satis<U+FB01>ed myself as to the comparative, if not the abso
lute insensibility of a bar of selenium to radiant heat of low
rcfrangibility, and therefore as to its being unsuitable for repla
cing the thermopile in the measurement of those rays,          I made a
few experiments with the view of <U+FB01>nding whether it was likely
to be a suitable instrument in photometry.
   To obtain a more constant light I substituted 9. paraf<U+FB01>n lamp
for the candle; and by placing in front of the horizontal sele
nium bar a vertical slit whose breadth could be varied at pleasure,
and which could be closed before and during every alternate
measurement of the resistance, also by varying the distance of
the lamp, it was found that while the decrease of resistance varied
as the breadth of the slit, and therefore as the length of the por
tion of the bar exposed to light, it was far more nearly propor
tional to the reciprocal of the distance, and therefore to the square
root of the intensity of the incident light than to the intensity
simply, between the limits within which the observations were
made.    The decrease of resistance observed was :—

   The length of the bar was        2%  inches.
   No experiments were made to ascertain how far the sensibility
was affected   by the temperature of the room ; but the presence
of moisture rendered the action feeble and uncertain as the dew
point was approached, probably owing to the deposit of a very
slight <U+FB01>lm of moisture on the surface of the bar.         Another e<U+FB02>'ect,
probably to be ascribed to the same cause, was noticed on two
occasions—a diminution of the change of resistance after a certain
duration of exposure to a screening from the light.

    In  a drier atmosphere the maximum, which was still as ra
pidly attained, was retained with tolerable constancy.               Probably
the diminution of the effect after the maximum had been reached
may have been due to the slower dissipation of the <U+FB01>lm of mois
ture, and to its re-formation under the alternations of temperature
which accompanied the alternations of light and darkness.
    I regret that   I  shall not have leisure to pursue this subject
for some time, and am therefore obliged to leave of these expe
riments in their present incomplete state.

XXII.     Note on the Composition of certain Mine Waters.                By  J.
      ARTHUR PHILLIPS, M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S., F.C.S., §w.*
              the publication of a paper in which            I  attempted to
SINCE   show   that the waters of the thermal spring at Huel Seton
Mine are probably derived from the scarf, two other waters from
deep Cornish mines have been analyzed in my laboratory.
   The <U+FB01>rst of these was from the 212-fathom level at the              thnix
Mines near Liskeard, where it issues from the lode at a tem
perature of 65° F.          This mine is in granite, and at one time
produced large quantities of copper ores, but has for the last ten
years been principally worked for tin, which is obtained from the
same veins which were formerly wrought for copper.                     A large
portion of the vein above the point from which                 the  water   for
analysis was collected had been removed some years previously.
   The following results, in grammes per litre and grains per
gallon. were obtained by analysis.

    The second water examined was collected at the 302-fathom
level at Dolcoath near Camborne; this mine also formerly pro
duced large quantities of copper ores. These have in depth gra
dually given place to cassiterite, and Dolcoath is at the present
time the most productive tin mine in the United Kingdom. The
water analyzed was collected from the roof of a short crosscut,
in granite, 25 fathoms east of the engine shaft and 15 feet south
of the main lode. The water issued in considerable quantities,

    The water issuing from the back of the crosscut at Dolcoath
deposits in considerable quantities a soft reddish-grey precipi
tate which frequently assumes stalactitic forms.              Similar incrus
tations, although generally less abundant, are found in nearly all
deep mines wherever water issues from the vicinity of a vein
and <U+FB02>ows over the surface of the adjacent rock.
    Three analyses made of air-dried specimens of this substance
afforded the following results :—

     It may appear somewhat remarkable that a plentiful de
posit of arsenate of iron should be formed from water in which
only traces of arsenic could be detected, and in which the amount
 of iron present is so inconsiderable.                On examining, however,
 the jars in which the water had been collected for analysis, a
 small amount of a <U+FB02>occulent brownish deposit was found at the
bottom of each; this, on being thrown on a <U+FB01>lter and subse
 quently analyzed, was found to contain 31'52 per cent. of arsenic
 anhydride and 25'27 per cent. of ferric oxide.                      The ferric
arsenate, together with a little clay, had been deposited before
 the clear water was siphoned off for analysis; this accounts
 for the small amounts of iron and arsenic retained in solution.
    These waters differ materially from those of the lithium spring
 at Huel Seton, which contain above a thousand grains of solid
 matter per gallon, while those from the Phoenix Mines and from
 Dolcoath contain respectively but 14'91 and 46'97 grains per
 gallon. The Huel Seton water is believed to be derived from
 the sea by percolation through a fault; the waters, of which
 analyses are now given, are probably the result of the in<U+FB01>ltra—
 tion of surface-water through the workings of the mines, and
 through <U+FB01>ssures in the respective veins.

  water of the Atlantic below the level of this ridge might be as
  light as air, and that of the Mediterranean as heavy as molten
  lead; but this could produce no disturbance of equilibrium.          It
  is only the waters lying above the level of this ridge in the two
  seas that require to balance each other; and if there is no dif
  ference of density between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean
g waters from the surface down to the level of the top of the ridge,
  then there is nothing that can produce the circulation which Dr.
  Carpenter supposes.        This submarine ridge comes up to within
  very nearly   100   fathoms     of the surface; and according to‘ Dr.
  Carpenter’s   own    admission, little or no difference of density ex
  ists down to that depth'l'; it follows therefore that there is nothing
  to produce disturbance of equilibrium, or any such circulation as
  that which he infers.        It is true that in his last expedition he
  found the bottom-water on the ridge somewhat denser than
  Atlantic water at the same depth, the former being 10292 and
  the latter 1'0265 ; but it also proved to be denser than Medi
  terranean water at the same depth.          He found, for example, that
  “ the dense Mediterranean water lies about 100 fathoms nearer
  the surface over a 300-fathoms bottom, than it does where the
  bottom sinks to more than 500 fathoms” (§ 51). But any excess
  of density which might exist at the ridge could have no tendency
   whatever to make the Mediterranean column preponderate over
  the Atlantic column, any more than could a weight placed over
  the fulcrum of a balance have a tendency to make the one scale
  weigh down the other.
      Although Dr. Carpenter has done me the honour to discuss
  nearly all the objections which          I  have advanced against his
  theory, he nevertheless makes no reference whatever to this ob
  jection ; and this is the more singular, seeing that the expedition,
  of which his memoir is a report, was chie<U+FB02>y if not solely under
  taken for the purpose of establishing the correctness of his theory
   of the Gibraltar current. If, therefore, there was any one objec
  tion advanced by me which he might have been expected to

    if the objection referred to be sound, it shows the mechanical
    impossibility of his theory.    It proves that whether there be an
    under current or not, or whether the dense water lying in the
    deep trough of the Mediterranean be carried over the submarine
    ridge into the Atlantic or not, the explanation offered by Dr.
    Carpenter is one which cannot be admitted.      It is incumbent on
    him to explain either (1) how the almost in<U+FB01>nitesimal difference
    of density which exists between the Atlantic and Mediterranean
    columns down to the level of the ridge can produce the upper
    and under currents carrying the deep and dense water of the Me
    diterranean over the ridge, or        how all this can be done by
    means of the difference of density which exists below the level
    of the ridge.

    objections to my conclusions regarding the in<U+FB02>uence of the Gulf
    stream on climate.

    rect both as to the amount of heat conveyed and the effects
    produced     bythat heat, the <U+FB01>gures must possess all the value
    which claim for them.
           I
        We shall now consider how Dr. Carpenter manages to render
    my estimate of the heat conveyed by the stream “utterly va
    lueless.”
       “In the <U+FB01>rst place, in Mr. Croll’s preliminary comparison of
    the temperatures of the northern and southern hemispheres, he
    altogether ignores the in<U+FB02>uence on the distribution of heat
    over the globe which     exerted                     by
                                         the great relative preponde

 rance of land in the northern hemisphere . . . . . And to af<U+FB01>rm,
 as Mr. Croll does, that the lower mean temperature of the south
 ern hemisphere is due to the amount of heat transferred over
 from that hemisphere to the northern by ocean-currents, is to
 repudiate all that has been established by the researches of me
 teorologists, as to the relative effects of land and sea,” 830. (§ 101).
     But what has all this to do with my estimate of the quantity
 of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream? Supposing it to be true
 that   I “altogether ignore the in<U+FB02>uence on the distribution of
 heat over the globe which is exerted by the great relative pre
 ponderance of land in the northern hemisphere,” and supposing
 it to be true that the lower mean temperature of the southern
 hemisphere is not due, as I have concluded, to the amount of
 heat transferred over from that hemisphere to the northern by
 ocean-currents,     this cannot in any way a<U+FB02>'ect the value of my
 <U+FB01>gures regarding the amount of heat conveyed by the Gulf
 stream.     It is not true, however, that I ignore and repudiate
 all that has been established as to the effect of land and sea in
 producing the di<U+FB02>'erence of mean temperature between the two
 hemispheres.       So far from this being the case,       I have devoted
 an entire paper (Phil. Mag. Sept. 1869) to an examination of
the arguments which have been advanced to explain the lower
mean temperature of the southern hemisphere.             I  have given my
reasons for concluding that an enormous amount of heat is trans
ferred from the southern hemisphere to the northern by means
of currents.      These reasons may or may not be satisfactory ; but
 nevertheless they are reasons, not assumptions.             It would he
needless as well as out of place to repeat these arguments; but          I
may be permitted simply to refer to one of them, viz. my reason             '
for concluding that a great portion of the heat possessed by the
Gulf-stream is derived from the southern hemisphere.                 If all
that heat came from the northern hemisphere, it could only
come from that portion of the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf
of Mexico which lies to the north of the equator.              The entire
area of these seas, extending to the tropic of Cancer, is about
7,700,000 square miles. Were the heat which passes through
the Straits of Florida derived exclusively from this area, the fol
lowing Table would then represent the relative quantity per unit
surface possessed by the Atlantic in the three zones, assuming
that one half of the heat of the Gulf-stream passes into the arctic
regions, and the other half remains to warm the temperate
regions* :—

      Mr.    J.   Croll   on the   Physical   Cause   of Ocean-currents.           171
     If   a very large proportion of the heat possessed by the Gulf
stream       be not derived from the southern      hemisphere, these
<U+FB01>gures show that the Atlantic, from the equator to the tropic of
Cancer, should be as cold as from the tropic of Cancer to the
North Pole. But independently of this, a mere glance at a
chart of ocean-currents will show that the Gulf-stream is chie<U+FB02>y
fed by a current from the southern hemisphere.          Without such
a transference of heat it would be impossible to account for the
N. Atlantic being actually 5 degrees warmer than the S. Atlantic.
    Again, Dr. Carpenter remarks :—“ In computing the heat
imparted by the sun to the equatorial area from which the Gulf
stream is fed, Mr. Croll assumes that the heat, being wholly
taken up by the water of the ocean, is transferred by its cur
rents towards the polar regions; whilst of the heat which falls
upon the land, a very large proportion is lost by radiation,
passing o<U+FB02>' into the stellar spaces”      102).
    But this cannot in any way a<U+FB02>'ect the correctness of the result
of my computation of the amount of heat conveyed by the Gulf
stream.    What           I
                      have maintained in my papers             that the is,
quantity of heat conveyed by the winds from intertropical land
is  tri<U+FB02>ing to that which            is
                                conveyed                  by
                                                currents from inter
tropical seas.   Dr. Carpenter says that     “the    heat lost      eva       by
poration from the sea must be far greater than that lost                            by
radiation from the land.”      According to the laws of radiation
 and absorption, all the heat received from the sun            the land by
must be either re<U+FB02>ected or radiated from       its  surface, with the
 exception of the small portion which         communicated to the
                                                      is
 air in contact with that surface.   In fact                       by
                                                        radiation that
                                                           it
                                                           is
 the sea as well as the land loses the greater part of its heat—the
 only di<U+FB01>'erence in the two cases being, that heat radiated from
 the sea     absorbed more readily by the air than heat radiated
             is
 from the land, and consequently produces            greater in<U+FB02>uence
                                                               a
 on climate.
    Dr. Carpenter continues :—“ Mr. Croll leaves almost entirely
 out of the question the N.E. transportation         of an enormous
 amount of heat from the general surface of the Atlantic             the      by
 agency of the aqueous vapour thus raised; although the im
 portance of this agency has been insisted on          the most emiby
nent authorities in meteorology ”     103).     (§
   Here again, however, my estimate of the heat conveyed                            by
the Gulf-stream, or the effects which    produces, cannot pos
                                                      it
sibly be affected             by
                      the above consideration.       It seems to be
forgotten in this objection, that, were    not  for the
                                                     it Gulf-stream,
the quantity of heat which could possibly be derived from the
Atlantic would be so much the less                by
                                           an amount equal to that
conveyed          by
              the stream.     Besides all this, there may be other

172        Mr.   J.   Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
 sources of heat than those noticed by me; but the omission
 does not diminish the importance of those to which              have   I
 referred.    Had       I
                       been writing a treatise on meteorology,              I
 should no doubt have referred as well to the in<U+FB02>uence of
 aqueous vapour as to many other sources of heat which           have   I
 purposely    omitted   in  my paper    on Ocean-currents   as  being
 foreign to my inquiry.
    Dr. Carpenter objects to my statement that “the greater
 part of the moisture received at the equator is condensed and
 falls as rain in those regions,” and refers me to the case of the
 Red Sea, where, although evaporation is excessive, almost no
 rain falls. But is it not an established fact, that the greater
 part of the water evaporated in intertropical regions does
actually fall asrain in those regions? The reason why the
vapour raised from the Red Sea does not fall in that region as
rain, is no doubt owing to the fact that this sea is only a nar
 row strip of water in a dry and parched land, the air overhead
being too greedy of moisture to admit of the vapour being de
posited as rain.     But over a wide expanse of ocean, where the
 air above is kept to a great extent in a constant state of satura
 tion, the case is totally different.
   I  continue my quotation :—-“ Until corrected by Mr. Findlay,
 Mr. Croll assumed that the whole of the true Gulf-stream con
 tinues to <U+FB02>ow in a N.E. direction ; whereas it is unquestionable
 that a considerable proportion of it (probably more than one
 half) turns southwards to the east of the Azores, and reenters
 the equatorial current” (§ 104).
   I   am not aware of having advanced any thing which could
 lead Dr. Carpenter or any one else to suppose that                 I
                                                               was of
 opinion that the whole of the Gulf-stream <U+FB02>ows in a N.E. di
 rection, or that       I
                       was ignorant of the existence of the S.E.
 branch.                I
             Nor do remember having seen the correction by Mr.
 Findlay to which he refers.       To suppose that           I
                                                       knew of the
 existence of the NE. but not of the S.E. branch, is to assume
 that  I  had never seen a chart of the Gulf-stream.               If I
                                                                  had
 seen a chart, how could               I
                                 possibly have observed the N.E.
 branch without at the same time perceiving the other?              It
would be just as possible to look one’s friend in the face and
notice his left eye without seeing his right.
    In reference to these four reasons or arguments designed to
show that my <U+FB01>gures are valueless, there must be some con
fusion of ideas. The point to be proved              is,
                                                that by some wrong
method I     have been led to form either an erroneous estimate of
the quantity of heat conveyed              by
                                      the Gulf-stream, or the effects
resulting   from  that heat.   This    what Dr. Carpenter proposes
                                            is
to do; but no sooner does he make this proposal than be com

       Mr.  J. Croll  on the  Physical Cause of   Ocean~currents.       173
mences to prove something totally different, viz. that there are
a great many important causes affecting climate which            I entirely
ignore or overlook, and that those causes which              I   ignore or
overlook have a far greater in<U+FB02>uence on climate than the heat
of the Gulf-stream.       It may be perfectly true that there are a
great many important causes a<U+FB01>'ecting climate which            I  have not
considered; and it may likewise be true that those causes, left
out of consideration, have a far more powerful in<U+FB02>uence on cli
mate than the heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream; nevertheless
it may be true also that all my statements regarding the in
<U+FB02>uence of the Gulf-stream on climate are perfectly correct.                It
does not necessarily follow that a horse may not possess a cer
tain amount of strength, and be able to perform a certain
amount of work, simply because there are other horses which
possess a much greater amount of strength, and can perform a
much greater amount of work.
    What    I  have endeavoured to prove in reference to the Gulf
stream is :—that the amount of heat conveyed by it is so enor
mous as to be equal to one fourth of all the heat received from
the sun by the North Atlantic in temperate regions; and that
were it not for the Gulf-stream and other ocean-currents, only
a very small portion of the globe would be suited to the present
orders of sentient beings *——that London, instead of possessing
a mean annual temperature of nearly 50°, would have a mean
temperature of not over 10°.           But I never argued that there
 were not other causes to which we are far more indebted than
to the heat of the Gulf-stream.          Were it not for those other
causes, the temperature of London would not be simply 40°,
but upwards of 500° below what it is at present.
  The hearing which my estimate has on       Dr. Carpenter’s Theory.
                                     I
    There is one point to which wish to direct special attention,
viz. the bearing which my conclusions regarding the quantity
of heat conveyed by the Gulf-tream have on Dr. Carpenter’s
theory of a general interchange of equatorial and polar water.
But, in order better to understand this matter, it will be neces
sary to refer very brie<U+FB02>y to a point which has already been dis
cussed at considerable length in former papers.             In my earlier
paper   on  the  amount   of  heat  conveyed by    the Gulf-stream      T,  I
estimated the volume of that stream as equal to that          of  a current
50 miles broad and 1000 feet deep, <U+FB02>owing (from the surface
to the bottom) at 4 miles an hour.         Of course I did not mean,
as Dr. Carpenter seems to suppose, that the stream at any par

 ticular place is 50 miles broad and 1000 feet deep, or that it
actually <U+FB02>ows at the uniform rate of 4 miles an hour at surface
and bottom.          All I meant was, that the Gulf-stream is equal to
that of a current of the above size and velocity.                    But in my
recent papers on Ocean-currents                I  have taken the volume of
the stream at one half this estimate, viz. equal to a current
50 miles broad and 1000 feet deep <U+FB02>owing at the rate of 2 miles
an hour. I have estimated the mean temperature of the stream
as it passes the Straits of Florida to be 65°, and have supposed
that the water in its course becomes ultimately cooled down on
an average to 40° *. In this case each pound of water conveys
25 units of heat from the Gulf of Mexico, to be employed in
warming temperate and polar regions.                    Assuming these data
to be correct, it follows that the amount of heat transferred
from the Gulf of Mexico by this stream per day amounts
to 77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds.                       This enormous
quantity of heat is equal to one fourth of all that is received
from the sun by the whole of the Atlantic Ocean from the
tropic of Cancer up to the Arctic Circle.
     This is the amount of heat conveyed from intertropical to
temperate and polar regions by the Gulf-stream.                       What now
is the amount conveyed by means of the general oceanic circu
lation?        If this general interchange of equatorial and polar
water he, as Dr. Carpenter supposes, the great agency employed
in distributing heat over the globe, then surely it is not too
much to expect that the quantity of intertropical heat carried
into the North Atlantic and Arctic seas must be at least equal
to that carried by the Gulf-stream.
     If we assume this to be the case, then the combined amount
of heat conveyed by the two agencies into the Atlantic from
intertropical regions will of course be equal to twice that con
veyed by the Gulf-stream alone. Taking the annual quantity of
heat received from the sun per unit surface at the equator at
1000, the quantities received by the three zones will be respec
tively as follows :—
                     Equator .       .   .   .     .  .   1000
                     Torrid zone    .   .   .     .  .      975

       It is probable that a. large proportion of the water constituting the
south-eastern branch of the Gulf-stream is never cooled down to 40°;
but, on the other hand, the north-eastern branch, which passes into the
Arctic regions, will be cooled far below 40°,                 below 30°. Hence
I  cannot be overestimating the extent to wplrobably  ich the water of the Gulf—
stream is cooled down in <U+FB01>xing upon 40° as the average minimum
temperature.                                                               ,.

      Mr.  J. Croll  on the  Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.    175
    Now it will be seen, by referring to what has been shown on
a  former occasion (Phil. Mag. for Oct. 1870, p. 257), that the
Gulf-stream and general oceanic circulation would, in such a
case, remove from the torrid zone 405 parts of the 975 received
from the sun ; and this transferred to the Atlantic in temperate
regions, would add 367 to the 757 already possessed by it.         In
this case the Atlantic in temperate regions would p0ssess 1126
parts of heat, whereas the intertropical region would possess
only 570 parts,- or, in other words, the Atlantic in temperate
regions would have twice the amount of heat possessed by it in
intertropical regions.       But if we assume that one half of this
heat goes into the Arctic Ocean, and the other half remains in
the temperate regions, the relative quantities of heat possessed
by the three zones will be as follows :—
             Atlantic, in Torrid zone       .  .    .  . 5'70
                 ,,     in Temperate zone      .    .  . 940
                 ,,     in  Frigid  zone    .  .    .  . 766
    It is here assumed, however,      that none of the heat possessed
by the Gulf-stream is derived from the southern hemisphere,
 which, we know, is not the case.             But supposing that as
much as one half of the heat possessed by the stream came from
the southern hemisphere, and that the other half was obtained
Irom the seas 'lying between the equator and the tropic of
Cancer, the relative pr0portions of heat possessed by the three
zones per given area would be as follows :—
             Atlantic, in Torrid zone       .  .     . . 671
                 ,,     in Temperate zone       .   .  . 940
                 ,,    in Frigid zone       .  .    .  . 766
    This proves incontestably that, supposing there is such a cir
culation as Dr. Carpenter maintains, the quantity of heat con
veyed by means of it into the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans
must be tri<U+FB02>ing in comparison with that conveyed by the Gulf
stream; for if it nearly equalled that conveyed by the Gulf
stream, then not only the North Atlantic in temperate regions,
but even the Arctic Ocean itself would be much warmer than
the intertropical seas.        In fact, so far as the distribution of
heat over the globe is concerned, it is a matter of indifference
whether there really is or is not such a thing as this general
oceanic circulation.       The enormous amount of heat conveyed
by   the  Gulf-stream    alone  puts it beyond all doubt that ocean
currents are the great agents employed in distributing OVer the
globe the excess of heat received by the sea in intertropical
regions.                                          _
    It is therefore, so far as concerns the theory of a General
Oceanic Circulation, of the utmost importance that the advo

cates of that theory should prove that I have overestimated
the thermal power of the Gulf-stream.                This, however, can
only be done by detecting          some   error  either  in my computa
tion or in the data on which it is based; yet neither Dr. Car
penter nor any one else, as far as            I   know, has challenged
the accuracy of my <U+FB01>gures.           The question at issue is the cor
rectness of the data; but the only part of the data which can
possibly admit of being questioned is my estimate of the volume
and temperature of the stream.            Dr. Carpenter, however, does
not maintain that        I  have overestimated the temperature of the
stream; on the contrary, he af<U+FB01>rms that            I have really under
estimated it.      “If    We assume,”   remarks    Dr. Carpenter, “the
limit of the stratum above 60° as that of the real Gulf-stream
current, we shall <U+FB01>nd its average temperature to be somewhat
higher than it has been stated by Mr. Croll, who seems to have
taken 65° as the average of the water <U+FB02>owing through the
entire channel.       The average surface-temperature of the Florida
channel for the whole year is 80°; and we may fairly set the
average of the entire outgoing stream, down to the plane of 60°,
at 70°, instead of 65° as estimated by Mr. Croll”               141). It
follows, then, that every pound of water of the Gulf-stream
actually conveys 5 units of heat more than           I  have estimated it
to do—the amount conveyed being 30 units instead of 25 units
as estimated by me. Consequently, if the Gulf-stream be equal
to that of a current of merely 41% miles broad and 1000 feet
deep, <U+FB02>owing at the rate of 2 miles an hour, it will still convey
the estimated quantity of heat. But this estimate of the volume
of the stream, let it be observed, scarcely exceeds one third of
that given by Herschel, Maury, and Colding (Phil. Mag. Oct.
1871, p. 272), and little more than one half that assigned to it
by Mr. Laughton, and but very little exceeds that given by Mr.
Findlay *, an author whom few will consider likely to overrate
either the volume or heating-power of the stream.
    The important results obtained during the ‘ Challenger ’ ex
pedition have clearly proved that        I  have neither overestimated
the temperature nor the volume of the Gulf-stream.               Between
Bermuda and Sandy Hook the stream is 60 miles broad and
600 feet deep, with a maximum velocity of from 3% to 4 miles
an hour.      If the mean velocity of the entire section amounts to
  %miles    an   hour,   which it probably does, the volume of the
stream must equal that given in my estimate-r.            But we have no
   '  Mr. Findlay considers that the daily dischar e does not exceed 333
cubic miles (Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1869, p. 160).         y estimate makes it
378 cubic miles. Mr. Laughton’s estimate is 630 cubic miles (Pa er “ On

between St. Thomas and Sandy Hook reveal the existence of an
immense <U+FB02>ow of warm water, 2300 feet deep, entirely distinct
from the water included in the above section of the Gulf-stream
proper.     As the thickest portion of this immense body of water
joins the warm water of the Gulf-stream, Captain Nares con
siders that “it is evidently connected with                         it,
                                                      and probably as

of water, after <U+FB02>owing northwards for about 1000 millss, turns
to the right and crosses the Atlantic in the direction of the
Azores, where        appears to thin out.

    If, therefore, we take into account the combined heat con
veyed   by  both streams, my estimate of the heat transferred from
intertropical regions into the North Atlantic will, be found
rather under the truth than above it. The quantity of heat
thus borne into the Atlantic           enormous compared with that
                                             is

tion of heat       concerned,
                  is                    matter of perfect indifference

         THE WIND THEORY or OCEANIC CIRCULATION.
   Ocean-currents not due alone to the Trade- VVinds.—The gene

of oceanic circulation   that the Gulf-stream and other currents
                                is
of the ocean are due to the impulse of the trade-winds. The
tendency of the trade-winds     to impel the intertropical waters
                                         is
along the line of the equator from east to west; and were those
regions not occupied in some places      land, this equatorial cur

portion trending northwards and the other southwards.          The
northern branch of the equatorial current of the Atlantic passes
into the Caribbean Sea, and after making a circuit of the Gulf
of Mexico, <U+FB02>ows northward and continues its course into the
Arctic Ocean.    The southern branch, on the other hand, is de
<U+FB02>ected along the South-American coast, constituting what is
known as the Brazilian current.     In the Paci<U+FB01>c a similar de<U+FB02>ec
tion occurs against the Asiatic coast, forming a current some
what resembling the Gulf-stream, a portion of which (Kamt
schatka current) in like manner passes into the Arctic regions.
In reference to all these various currents, the impelling cause
is supposed to be the force of the trade-winds.
   It however, urged as an objection
       is,                                              by

stream, extending as far as the Arctic regions, could not possibly
be impelled and maintained                by
                                   force acting at the equatorial

regions.   But  this     somewhat
                              is   aweak objection.       seems to    It
be based upon     misconception of the magnitude of the force in
                      a
operation.      does not take into account that this force acts on

in a basin of water, say three feet in diameter,   force    applied

 suf<U+FB01>cient to produce      surface-<U+FB02>ow one foot broad across the

 centre of the basin, the water impelled against the side will be
 de<U+FB02>ected t0 the extremes of the vessel.        And this result does
 not in any way depend upon the size of the basin.           The same
 effect which occurs in     small basin will occur in
                                   a                         large one,

 provided the proportion between the breadth of the belt of water
put in motion and the size of the vessel be the same in both
cases.    It does not matter, therefore, whether the diameter of the
 basin be supposed to be three feet, or three thousand miles, or
                                         '
ten thousand miles.
    There    ismore formidable objection, however, to_ the theory.
                  a
 The trade-winds will account for the Gulf-stream, Brazil, Japan,
 Mozambique, and many other currents; but there are currents,
 such as some of the polar currents, which cannot be so accounted
 for.   Take, for example, the great Antarctic current <U+FB02>owing
 northward into the Paci<U+FB01>c. This cun'ent does not bend to the
left under the influence of the earth’s rotation and continue its
course in    anorth-westerly direction, but actually bends round
to the right and <U+FB02>ows eastward against the South-American coast,
in direct opposition both to the in<U+FB02>uence of rotation and to the
trade-winds. The trade-wind theory, therefore,           insuf<U+FB01>cient to
                                                                 is
account for all the facts.    But there     yet  another
                                                   is      explanation,
which satisfactorily solves our dif<U+FB01>culties.     The currents of the
ocean owe their origin, not to the trade-winds alone, but to the
prevailing winds of the globe (including, of course, the trade
winds).

    Mr.   J   .   Croll on   the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.   179
   Ocean-currents due to the System of Wina's.—If we leave out
of account a few small inland sheets of water, the globe may be
said to have but one sea, just as it possesses only one atmo
sphere.    We have accustomed ourselves, however, to speak of
parts  or geographical divisions of the one great ocean, such as
the Atlantic and the Paci<U+FB01>c, as if they were so many separate
oceans.    And we have likewise come to regard the currents of
the ocean as separate and independent of one another.             This
notion has no doubt to a considerable extent militated against
the acceptance of the theory that the currents are caused by the
winds, and not by difference of speci<U+FB01>c gravity 5 for it leads to the
conclusion that currents in a sea must <U+FB02>ow in the direction of
the prevailing winds blowing over that particular sea.            The
proper  view  of the  matter, as  hope toIbe  able to  show,   is that
which regards the various currents merely as members of one
grand system of circulation produced, not by the trade-winds
alcne, nor by the prevailing winds proper alone, but by the
combined action of all the prevailing winds of the globe, regarded
as one system of circulation.
  If  the winds be the impelling cause of currents, the direction
of the currents will depend upon two circumstances, viz. :—(l)the
direction of the prevailing winds of the globe, including, of
course, under this term the prevailing winds proper and the trade
winds ; and        the conformation of land and sea.       It follows,
therefore, that as a current in any given sea is but a‘member of
a general system of circulation, its direction is determined,      not
alone by the prevailing winds blowing over the sea in question,
but by the general system of prevailing winds.       It may conse
quently sometimes happen that the general system of winds
may produce a current directly opposite to the prevailing wind
blowing over the current.    The accompanying Chart (Plate II.)
shows how exactly the system of ocean-currents agrees with
the system of the prevailing winds. The <U+FB01>ne lines indicate the
paths of the prevailing winds, and the <U+FB01>ne arrows the direction
in which the wind blows along those paths. The large arrows
show the direction of the principal ocean-currents.
   The directions and paths of the prevailing winds have been
taken from Messrs. Johnston’s small physical Atlas, which,               I
<U+FB01>nd, agrees exactly with the direction of the prevailing winds as
deduced from the four quarterly wind charts lately published
by the H drographic Department of the Admiralty. The direc
tion of       the
             ocean-currents  has been taken from the Current

proof that those winds are the cause of the ocean-currents than
this general agreement of thetwo systems as indicated by the chart.
Take, for example, the North Atlantic. The Gulf-stream follows
exactly the path of the prevailing winds. The Gulf-stream bifur
cates in mid Atlantic; so does the wind. The left branch of the
stream passes north-eastwards into the Arctic regions, and the
right branch south-eastwards by the Azores; so does the wind.
 The south-eastern branch of the stream, after passing the Cana
ries, reenters the equatorial current and <U+FB02>ows into the Gulf of
 Mexico; the same, it will be observed, holds true of the wind.
 A like remarkable agreement exists in reference to all the other
leading currents of the ocean. This is particularly seen in the
case of the great Antarctic current between long. 140° W. and
 160° W.      This current, <U+FB02>owing northwards frOm the Antarctic
 regions, instead of bending to the left under the in<U+FB02>uence of ro
 tation, turns to the- right when it enters the regions of the
 westerly winds, and <U+FB02>ows eastwards towards the South-American
 shores.    In fact all the currents in this region of strong westerly
 winds <U+FB02>ow in an easterly or north-easterly direction.
     Taking into account the effects resulting from the conforma
 tion of sea and land, the system of ocean-currents agrees pre
 cisely with the system of the winds. All the principal currents of
 the globe are in fact moving in the exact direction in which they
 ought to move, assuming the winds to be the sole impelling
 cause.    In short, so perfect is the agreement between the two
 systems, that, given the system of winds and the conformation
of sea and land, and the direction of all the currents of the ocean,
 or more properly the system of oceanic circulation, might be
 determined a priori.      Or given the system of the ocean-currents
 together with the conformation of sea and land, and the direc
  tion of the prevailing winds could also be determined a priori.
  Or, thirdly, given the system of winds and the system of currents,
  and the conformation of sea and land might be roughly deter
  mined.    For example, it can be shown by this means that the
  Antarctic regions are probably occupied by a continent and not
  by a number of separate islands, nor by sea.
      While holding that the currents of the ocean form one system
  of circulation, we must not be supposed to mean that the various
  currents are connected end to end, having the same water <U+FB02>ow
 ing through them all in succession like that in a heating-appa
  ratus. All that is maintained is simply this, that the currents
  are so mutually related that any great change in one would
  modify the conditions of all the others.        For example, a great
  increase or decrease in the easterly <U+FB02>ow of Antarctic water in the
   Southern Ocean would decrease or increase, as the case might
  be, the strength of the West-Australian current ; and this change

      Mr.  J. Croll on the Physical Cause of   Oceanvcurv'ents.      181
would modify the equatorial current of the Indian Ocean, a mo
di<U+FB01>cation which in like manner would affect the Agulhas current
and the Southern Atlantic current—this last leading in turn to a
modi<U+FB01>cation of the equatorial current of the Atlantic, and conse
quently of the Brazilian current and the Gulf- stream.          Further
more,   since  a current impelled by  the  winds,  as  Mr.  Laughton in
his exceent paper on ocean-currents justly remarks, tends to leave
a vacancy behind, it follows that a decrease or increase in the Gulf
stream would affect the equatorial current, the Agulhas current,
and all the other currents back to the Antarctic currents. Again, a
large modi<U+FB01>cation in the Great Antarctic drift-current would in
like manner affect all the currents of the Paci<U+FB01>c.         On the other
hand, any great change in the currents of the Paci<U+FB01>c would
ultimately affect the currents of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans,
through its in<U+FB02>uence on the Cape-Horn current, the South
Australian current, and the current passing through the Asiatic
archipelago; and rice versd, any changes in the currents of the
Atlantic or Indian Oceans would modify the currents of the Paci<U+FB01>c.
  - I may now consider the cause of the Gibraltar current. There
can be little doubt that this current owes its origin (as Mr.
Laughton points out) to the Gulf-stream.            “I  conceive,” that
author remarks, “ that the Gibraltar current is distinctly a stream
formed by easterly drift of the North Atlantic, which, although
 it forms a southerly current on the coast of Portugal, is still
 strongly pressed to. the eastward and seeks the <U+FB01>rst escape it
can <U+FB01>nd.      So great indeed does this pressure seem to be, that
 more water is forced through the Straits than the Mediterranean
 can receive, and a part of it is ejected in reverse currents, some
 as lateral currents on the surface, some, it appears, as an under
 current at a considerable depth” *. The funnel-shaped nature
 of the strait through which the water is impelled helps to ex
 plain the existence of the under current.            The water being
pressed into the narrow neck of the channel tends to produce
a slight banking up; and as the pressure urging the water for
ward is greatest at the surface and diminishes rapidly down
 wards, the tendency to the restoration of level will cause an
 under<U+FB02>ow towards the Atlantic, because below the surface the
water will <U+FB01>nd the path of least resistance.       It is evident indeed
that this under<U+FB02>ow will not take place toward the Mediterra
nean, from the fact that that sea is already <U+FB01>lled to over<U+FB02>owing
by the current received from the outside ocean.
    If we examine the Current-chart published by the Hydro
graphic Department of the Admiralty, we shall <U+FB01>nd the Gibraltar
 current represented as merely a continuation of the S.E. <U+FB02>ow
of Gulf-stream water.       Now, if the arrows shown upon this

182      Mr.  J. Croll on the Physical Cause  of Ocean-currents.
chart indicate correctly the direction of the <U+FB02>ow, we must be
come convinced that the Gulf-stream water cannot possibly
avoid passing through the Gibraltar Strait.     Of course the excess
of evaporation over that of precipitation within the Mediterra
nean area would of itself produce a considerable current through
the Strait; but this of itself would not <U+FB01>ll that inland sea to
over<U+FB02>owing.
   The Atlantic may, in fact, be regarded as an immense whirl
pool with the Saragossa Sea as its vortex; and although it is
true, as will be seen from an inspection of the Chart, that the
wind blows round the Atlantic along the very path taken by the
water, impelling the water forward along every inch of its course,
yet nevertheless it must hold equally true that the water has a
tendency to <U+FB02>ow off in a straight line at a tangent to the circular
course in which it is moving.     But the water is so hemmed in
on all sides that it cannot leave this circular path except only at
two points; and at these two points it actually does <U+FB02>ow out
wards.    On the east and west sides the land prevents any such
out<U+FB02>ow.    Similarly, in the south the escape of the water is frus
trated by the pressure of the opposing currents <U+FB02>owing from
that quarter; While in the north it is prevented by the pressure
exerted by polar currents from Davis Strait and the Arctic Ocean.
But in the Strait of Gibraltar and in the north-eastern portion
of the Atlantic between Iceland and the north—eastern shores of
Europe there is no resistance o<U+FB02>‘ered ; and at these two points an
out<U+FB02>ow does actually take place.      In both cases, however, espe
cially the latter, the out<U+FB02>ow is greatly aided by the impulse
of the prevailing winds.
    The consideration that ocean-currents are simply parts of a
 system of circulation produced by the system of prevailing winds,
and not by the impulse of the trade-winds alone, helps to remove
 the dif<U+FB01>culty which some have in accounting for the existence of
under currents without referring them to difference of speci<U+FB01>c
gravity. Take the case of the Gulf-stream, which passes under
the polar stream on the west of Spitzbergen, this latter stream
passing in turn under the Gulf-stream a little beyond Bear
Island.    The polar streams have their origin in the region of
prevailing northerly winds, which no doubt extend to the Pole.
The current <U+FB02>owing past the western shores of Spitzbergen,
 throughout its entire course up to near the point where it dis
appears under the warm waters of the Gulf-stream, lies in the
region of these same northerly winds.        Now why should this
current cease to be a surface-current as soon as it passes out of
the region of northerly into that of south-westerly winds? The
explanation seems to be this: when the stream enters the region
of prevailing south-westerly winds, its progress southwards along

    Mr.   J.   Croll    on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.        183
the surface of the ocean is retarded both by the wind and by the
surface-water moving in opposition to its course; but being con
tinually pressed forward by the impulse of the northerly winds
acting along its whole course back almost to the pole perhaps,
or as far north at least as the sea is not wholly covered with ice,
the polar current cannot stop when it enters the region of op
posing winds and currents; it must move forward.             But the
water thus pressed from behind will naturally take the path of
least resistance.   Now in the present case this path will neces
sarily lie at a considerable distance below the surface.     Had the
polar stream simply to contend with the Gulf-stream <U+FB02>owing in
the opposite direction, it would probably keep the surface and
continue its course along the side of that stream ; but it is op
posed by the winds, from which it cannot escape except by dip
ping down under the surface ; and the depth to which it will
 descend will depend upon the depth of the surface-current <U+FB02>ow
ing in the opposite direction. There is no necessity for suppo
 sing a heaping up of the water in order to produce by pressure
a force suf<U+FB01>cient to impel the under current.        The pressure of
 the water from behind is of itself enough.      The same explana
tion, of course, applies to the case of the Gulf-stream passing
under the polar stream.       And if we re<U+FB02>ect that these under
currents are but parts of the general system of circulation, and
that in most cases they are currents compensating for water
drained off at some other quarter, we need not wonder at the
distance which they may in some cases <U+FB02>ow, as, for example,
from’the banks of Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico. The
under currents of the Gulf-stream are necessary to compensate
for the water impelled southwards by the northerly winds; and
again, the polar under currents are necessary to compensate for
the water impelled northward by the south and south-westerly
winds.
    No accurate observations, as far as I know, have been made
regarding the amount of work performed by the wind in impel
ling the water forward ; but when we consider the great retard
ing effect of objects on the earth’s surface, it is quite apparent
that the amount of work performed on the surface of the ocean
 must be far greater than is generally supposed.        For example,
 Mr. Buchan, Secretary to the Scottish Meteorological Society,
has shown* that a fence made of slabs of wood 3 inches in width
and 3 inches apart from each other is a protection even during
high winds to objects on the lee side of         it,

     Ocean-currents in relation to Change of Climate—In my
attempts to prove that oceanic circulation is produced by the
winds and not by di<U+FB02>'erence of speci<U+FB01>c gravity, and that ocean
currents are the great distributors of heat over the globe, my
chief aim has been to show the bearing which these points have
on the grand question of secular changes of climate during geo
logical epochs, more particularly in reference to that mystery
the cause of the glacial epoch.
                                         I
    In concluding this series of papers, may therefore be allowed
brie<U+FB02>y to recapitulate those points connected with the subject of
ocean-currents which sccm to shed most light on the question
of changes of climate, referring the reader for fuller details to
former papers on the question.
    rl‘he complete agreement between the systems of ocean-cur
rents and winds not only shows that the winds are the impelling
cause of the currents, but it also indicates to what an extent the
directions of the currents are determined by the winds, or, more
properly, to what an extent their directions are determined by
the direction of the winds.
    We have seen in a former part of this paper (Phil. Mag. Feb.
 1870) to what an enormous extent the climatic conditions of the
globe are dependent on the distribution of heat effected by means
 of ocean-currents.     It has been there pointed out that, if the
 heat conveyed from intertropicalto temperate and polar regions
 by oceanic circulation were restored to the former, the equa
 torial regions would then have a temperature about 55° warmer,
 and the high polar regions a climate 83° colder than at present.
 It follows, therefore, that any cause which will greatly affect the
 currents or greatly change their paths and mode of distribution,
 will of necessity seriously affect the climatic condition of the
 globe.     But as the existence of these currents depends on the
 winds, and their direction and form of distribution depend upon
 the direction and form of distribution of the winds, any cause
 which will greatly affect the winds will also greatly affect the
 currents, and consequently will in<U+FB02>uence the climatic condition
 of the globe.     Again, as the existence of the winds depends
 mainly on the difference of temperature between equatorial and
 polar regions, any cause which will greatly a<U+FB02>'ect this di<U+FB01>'erence
 of temperature will likewise greatly affect the winds ; and these
 will just as surely react on the currents and climatic conditions
 of the globe.     A simple increase or decrease in the difference of
 temperature     between   equatorial and polar regions, though it
 would certainly produce an increase or a decrease, as the case
  might be, in the strength of the winds, and consequently in the

       Mr.  J.  Croll   on the   Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.          185
strength of the currents, would not, however, greatly affect the
mode of distribution of the winds, and, as a consequence, the
mode of distribution of the currents.                 But although a simple
change     in  the  difference    of  temperature     between  the equator and
the poles would not produce a different distribution of: aerial,
and consequently of ocean-currents, nevertheless a di<U+FB02>'erence in
the di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature            between the equator and the two
poles    would   do  so;    that  is  to  say, any cause that should increase
the difference     of  temperature       between    the equator and the pole
on the one hemisphere,               and decrease that difference on the
other, would effect a change in the distribution of the aérial
 currents, which change would in turn produce a corresponding
 change in the distribution of ocean-currents.
     It has been shown* that an increase in the eccentricity of the
 earth’s orbit tends to lower the temperature of the one hemi
 sphere and to raise the temperature of the other.                    It is true
 that an increase of eccentricity does not afford more heat to the
 one hemisphere than to the other ,- nevertheless it brings about,
 as   I have already shown, a condition of things which tends to
 lower the temperature of the one hemisphere and to raise the
 temperature of the other.             Let us imagine the eccentricity to
 be at its superior limit, '077 75, and the winter solstice in the
 aphelion.       The midwinter temperature, owing to the increased
 distance of the sun, would be lowered enormously ; and the effect
 of this would be to cause all the moisture which now falls as rain
  during winter in temperate regions to fall as snow.                Nor is this
 all; the winters would not merely be colder than now, but they
 would also be much longer. At present the summer half year
  exceeds the winter half year by nearly 8 days; but at the period
  in question the winters would be longer than the summers by
  upwards of 36 days.            The heat of the sun during the short
  summer, for reasons which have already been explained, would
  not be suf<U+FB01>cient to melt the snow of winter; so that gradually,
  year by year, the snow would continue to accumulate on the
  ground.
      On the southern hemisphere the opposite condition of things
  would obtain.         Owing'to the nearness of the sun during the
  winter of that hemisphere, the moisture of the air would be pre
   cipitated as rain in regions where at present it falls as snow.
  This and the shortness of the winter would tend to produce
  a decrease in the quantity of snow.                  The difference of tem
   perature    between     the   equatorial     and   the  temperate and polar
   regions would therefore be greater                on  the  northern than on
   the southern hemisphere; and, as a consequence, the acrial

 186    Mr.  J. Croll on the Physical Cause  of Ocean-currents.
currents of the former hemisphere would be stronger than
those of the latter.     This would be more especially the case
with the trade-winds. The N.E. trades being stronger than
the S.E. trades would blow across the equator, and the medial
line between them would therefore be at some distance to the
south of the equator.      Thus the equatorial waters would be
impelled more to the southern than to the northern hemi
sphere; and the warm water carried over in this manner to the
southern hemisphere would tend to increase the difference of
temperature between the two hemispheres.        This change, again,
would in turn tend to strengthen the N.E. and to weaken the
 S.E. trades, and would thus induce a still greater <U+FB02>ow of equa
torial waters into the southern hemisphere—a result which
would still more increase the difference of temperature between
the northern and southern hemisphere, and so on—the one cause
so reacting on the other as to increase its effects, as was shown at
length on a former occasion (Phil. Mag. March 1870).
   It was this mutual reaction of those physical agents which led,
as  I have pointed out (Phil. Mag. March 1870), to that extra
ordinary condition of climate which prevailed during the glacial
epoch.
   There is another circumstance to be considered which perhaps
more than any thing else would tend to lower the temperature
of the one hemisphere and to raise the temperature of the other;
and this is the displacement of the great equatorial current.
During a glacial period in the northern hemisphere the medial
line between the trades would be shifted very considerably south
of the equator; and the same would neCessarily be the case with
the great equatorial currents, the only difference being that the
equatorial currents, other things being equal, would be de<U+FB02>ected
further south than the medial line. For the water impelled by
the strong N.E. trades would be moving with greater velocity
than the waters impelled by the weaker S.E. trades, and, of
course, would cross the medial line of the trades before its pro
gress southwards could be arrested by the counteracting in<U+FB02>u- .
ence of the S.E. trades.     Let us glance brie<U+FB02>y at the results
which would follow from such a condition of things. In the
<U+FB01>rst place, as was shown on former occasions (Phil. Mag. for
August 1864, February 1867, March 1870), were the equatorial
current of the Atlantic (the feeder of the Gulf-stream) shifted
considerably south of its present position, it would not bifurcate,
as it now does, off Cape St. Roque, owing to the fact that the
whole of the waters would strike obliquely against the Brazilian
coast and thus be de<U+FB02>ected into the Southern Ocean.        The effect
produced on the climate of the North Atlantic and North-western
Europe by the withdrawal of the water forming the Gulf-stream,

      Mr.  J.  Croll on the  Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.     187
may be conceived from what has already been stated concerning
the amount of heat conveyed by that stream.           The heat thus
withdrawn from the North Atlantic would go to raise the tem
perature of the Southern Ocean and Antarctic regions. A similar
result would take place in the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean. Were the equato
rial current of that ocean removed greatly to the south of its
present position, it would not then impinge and be de<U+FB02>ected
upon the Asiatic coast, but upon the continent of Australia ; and
the greater portion of its waters would then pass southward
 into the Southern Ocean, while that portion passing round the
 north of Australia (owing to the great strength of the N.E.
 trades) would rather <U+FB02>ow into the Indian Ocean than turn round,
 as now, along the east coast of Asia by the Japan Islands.        The
 stoppage    of the Japan   current, combined  with the  displacement
 of the equatorial current to the south of the equator, would
 greatly lower the temperature of the whole of the North Paci<U+FB01>c
 and adjoining continents, and raise to a corresponding degree
 the temperature of the South Paci<U+FB01>c and Southern Ocean.
 Again, the waters of the equatorial current of the Indian Ocean
  (owing to the opposing N.E. trades), would not, as at pre
 sent, <U+FB01>nd their way round the Cape of Good Hope into the
 North Atlantic, but would be de<U+FB02>ected southwards into the
 Antarctic sea.
     We have in the present state of things a striking example of
 the extent to which the medial line between the two trades may
 be shifted, and the position of the great equatorial currents of
 the ocean may be affected by a slight difference in the relative
 strength of the two aerial currents. The S.E. trades are at pre~
  sent a little stronger than the N.E. ; and the consequence is that
  they blow across the equator into the northern hemisphere to a
  distance sometimes of 10 or 15 degrees, so that the mean posi
  tion of the medial line lies at least 6 or 7 degrees north of the
  equator.
     And it is doubtless owing to the superior strength          of the
  SE.   trades that so much warm water crosses the equator from
  the South to the North Atlantic, and that the main portion of
  the equatorial current <U+FB02>ows into the Caribbean Sea rather than
  along the Brazilian coast. Were the two trades of equal strength,
  the transference of heat into the North Atlantic from the south
  ern hemisphere by means of the Southern Atlantic and Equa
  torial currents would be much less than at present.        The same
  would also hold true in regard to the Paci<U+FB01>c.
     Ocean-currents in relation to the Distribution of Plants and
  Animals—In the <U+FB01>fth and last editions of the ‘ Origin of Species,’
  Mr. Darwin has done me the honour to express his belief that
  the foregoing view regarding alternate cold and warm periods

 188     Mr.  J. Croll  on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
in north and south during the glacial epoch explains          a great
 many facts in connexion with the distribution of plants and ani
 mals which have always been regarded as exceedingly puzzling.
    There are certain species of plants which occur alike in the
 temperate regions of the southern and northern hemispheres.
At the equator these same temperate forms are found on elevated
 mountains, but not on the lowlands. .How, then, did these tem
perate forms manage to cross the equator from the northern
temperate regions to the southern, and vice versd .? Mr. Darwin’s
 solution of the problem is (in his own words) as follows :—
    “As the cold became more and more intense, we know that
Arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and from the facts
just given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the more
vigorous, dominant, and widest-spreading        temperate forms in
vaded the equatorial lowlands.        The inhabitants of these hot
lowlands would at the same time have migrated to the tropical
 and subtropicalregions of the south; for the southern hemisphere
 was at this period warmer. On the decline of the Glacial period,
 as both hemispheres gradually recovered their former tempera
 tures, the northern temperate forms living on the lowlands
 under the equator would have been driven to their former homes
or have been destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms
returning from the south.      Some, however, of the northern tem
perate  forms   would  almost  certainly have ascended any adjoining
high land, where,   if suf<U+FB01>ciently lofty, they would have long sur
vived like the Arctic forms on the mountains of Europe.”
    “In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere
would in its turn be subjected to a severe glacial period, with
the northern hemisphere rendered warmer; and then the south
ern temperate forms would invade the equatorial lowlands.        The
northern forms which had before been left on the mountains
would now descend and mingle with the southern forms. These
latter, when the warmth returned, would return to their former
homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and carrying
 southward with them some of the northern temperate forms
which had descended from their mountain fastnesses.             Thus
we should have some few species identically the same in the
northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains
of the intermediate tropical regions.” (P. 339, sixth edition.)
    Additional light is cast on this subject by the results already
stated in regard to the enormous extent to which the tempera
ture of the equator is affected by ocean-currents.       Were there
no transference of heat from equatorial to temperate and polar
regions, the temperature of the equator, as has been remarked,
would probably be about 55 degrees warmer than at present.        In
such a case no plant existing on the face of the globe could live

       Mr.  J.  Croll  0n the  Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.     189
 at the equator unless        on some elevated mountain-region.        On
 the other hand, were the quantity of warm water which is being
 transferred from the equator to be very much increased, the tem~
 perature of intertropical latitudes might be so lowered as easily to
 admit of temperate species of plants growing at the equator.           A
 lowering    of  the temperature   at the equator some  20 or 30 degrees
 is all that would be required; and only a moderate increase in
 the volume of the currents proceeding from the equator, taken in
 connexion with the effects <U+FB02>owing from the following considera—
 tions, might su<U+FB01>ice to produce that result.        During the Glacial
 epoch,   when     the  one   hemisphere  was under  ice and the other
 enjoying a warm and equable climate, the medial line between
 the trades may have been shifted to almost the tropical line of
 the warm hemisphere.           Under such a condition of things the
 warmest part would probably be somewhere about the tropic of
 the warm hemisphere, and not, as now, at the equator; for since
 all, or nearly all, the surface-water of the equator would then be
 impelled over to the warm hemisphere, the tropical regions of
 that hemisphere would be receiving nearly double their present
.amount of warm water.                                               I
     Again, as the equatorial current at this time would be shifted
 towards the tropic of the warm hemisphere, the surface-water
 would not, as at present, be <U+FB02>owing in equatorial regions parallel
 to the equator, but obliquely across it from the cold to the warm
 hemisphere.        This of itself would tend greatly to lower the
 temperature of the equator.
     It follows, therefore, as a necessary consequence, that during
 the glacial epoch, when the one hemisphere was under snow and
 ice and the other enjoying a warm and equable climate, the tem
 perature of the equator would be lower than at present.             But
 when the glaciated hemisphere (which we may assume to be the
  northern) began to grow warmer and the climate of the southern
  or warm hemisphere to get colder, the medial line of the trades
  and the equatorial currents of the ocean also would begin to
  move back from the southern tropic towards the equator.           This
  would cause the temperature of the equator to rise and'to con
  tinue rising until the equatorial currents reached their normal
  position.    When the snow began to accumulate on the southern
  hemisphere and to disappear on the northern, the medial line of
 the trades and the equatorial currents of the ocean would then
  begin to move towards the northern tropic as they had formerly
  towards the southern.         The temperature of the equator would
  then again begin to sink, and continue to do so until the gla
  ciation of the southern hemisphere reached its maximum.           This

of the two hemispheres continued.
    This lowering of the temperature of the equator during the
severest part of the glacial epoch will help to explain the former
existence of glaciers in intertropical regions at no very great
elevation above the sea-level, evidence of which appears recently
 to have been found by Mr. Belt and others.

IN tain following
        the                will brie<U+FB02>y indicate a way in which, cer
             hypotheses presupposed, very remarkable explanations
of the relations of the aether might possibly be reached.
    I start from the comparison of the expressions, on the one
hand, for the thermal effect of a galvanic current, and, on the
other hand, for the vis viva represented therein at any moment
by the motion of the electric particles.            I may mention before
hand that it is quite immaterial of what kind we suppose the
motion of the electrical masses to be. Even a not uniform,
somehow oscillating motion would only introduce into the cal
culation additional simple factors which would be quite insigni
<U+FB01>cant for the <U+FB01>nal result.       Such motions will therefore be left
out of consideration.
    This presupposed, and holding fast the notion of only one
<U+FB02>uid, let e be, in electrostatic measure, the quantity of electricity
in motion in     l millim. length of the conductor, and v its velo
city,  the  unit  of time being the second.             Then, in mechanical
measure,    the  current-intensity    is co.     If,  further,   also expressed
in mechanical measure, R is the resistance of 1 millim. of the
conductor, and L millim. the length of the latter, in it there is
produced in 1 second, according to Joule’s law, a quantity of
heat which has in mechanical measure the expression

   Comparing expressions (1.) and (II.), it appears that they
differ only by the factor 2enR.       And it now we adopt the
assumption, certainly favoured by many physicists, that e in the
same portion of the conductor is for all currents constantly the
same, and therefore the action of different currents in such por
tion di<U+FB02>'ers only by the various values of 11, it will be seen that,
in the same conductor, expression                           is   for all   currents the same
multiple of expression (IL).

              then, only necessary the knowledge of           number             a
which (as   one  may perhaps    dare  to say) speci<U+FB01>es how often in
the unit of time the vis viva of the electric motion (constantly
transformed into heat)        is

in order from one value of the vis viva to deduce at once the
total thermal effect of the current. Perhaps the following con
sideration may elucidate this number.
   Let us imagine from any place in the conductor the resistance
and consequently its thermal effect to cease; from that moment
the space of the conductor must be much more <U+FB01>lled only with
electric <U+FB02>uid, and, indeed, at <U+FB01>rst of the same density as in the
conductor.     The electric motion would then be propagated in
this <U+FB02>uid without enfeeblement.       If we call the constant velocity
of propagation of the motion in this case, expressed in millime
tres, C, in second

194          Lord Rayleigh   an the
                                      Manufacture and
examining the question for myself, I came to the conclusion
that the theory of gratings, as usually presented, is encumbered
with a good deal that may properly be regarded as extraneous.
   One of the <U+FB01>rst things to be noticed is the extraordinary pre
cision required in the ruling.   The difference of wave-length of
the two sodium-lines is about a thousandth part.      If, therefore,
we suppose that one grating has 1000 lines in the space where
another has 1001, it is evident that the <U+FB01>rst grating would pro
duce the same deviation for the less-refrangible D line that the
second would produce for the more-refrangible D line.           We
have only to suppose the two combined into one in order to
see that, in a grating required to resolve the D line, there must
be no systematic irregularity to the extent of a thousandth part
of the small interval. Single lines may, of course, be out of
position to a much larger amount. It is easy to see, too, that
the same accuracy is required, whatever he the order of the spec
trum examined.
   The precision of ruling actually attained in gratings is very
great.   In the 3000 Nobert it is certain that the average interval
between the lines does not vary by a six-thousandth part in
passing from one half of the grating to the other; for the D
lines, when well de<U+FB01>ned, do not appear so broad as a sixth part
of the space separating them.
    In considering the in<U+FB02>uence of the number of lines          and
the order of the spectrum (in), we will suppose that the ruling
is accurate, and that plane waves are incident perpendicularly
upon the face of the grating whose width is represented in the
<U+FB01>gure by A B.     But inas-                                       B

consider the in<U+FB02>uence of the ruling.
   In the perpendicular direction BC all the secondary waves
emanating from AB are in complete agreement of phase, and
their resultant accordingly attains its highest possible value. In
a direction B P, making with B C a very small angle, the agree
ment of phase will be disturbed.      IfB P be so drawn that the
projection of AB upon it is equal to      the phases of the secon

and the resultant will therefore be nil. The same result must
ensue whenever B D is an exact multiple of 7t.
   For the intermediate directions we require a little more cal
culation.
   The phase of the resultant will always correspond with that of
the secondary wave which issues from the middle of the aperture.
If .Z' denotes the retardation of any element with respect to this
one, the amplitude of the resultant is given by
                                +€

This expression gives the magnitude of the resultant amplitude
compared with that in the principal direction B C, where all the
components agree in phase.
   The composition of elementary vibrations whose phases vary
uniformly within certain limits may be illustrated by a mecha
nical analogy.    Each elementary vibration is represented by a
force proportional to the element of circular are P Q and acting
at 0 along a direction 0 P, making with a <U+FB01>xed line of reference
0 X an angle corresponding to the
phase of the vibration.    The force
may   be  supposed   to be due to the
attraction of the are on a particle
placed at O.    The group of vibra
tions is thus represented by the
group of forces whose directions are
distributed uniformly through the
angle A O B ; and the resultant of
the forces, found by resolving in
the ordinary way, represents on the
same system the resultant of the
vibrations.    In the present case AOB corresponds to R, and

       The image of an in<U+FB01>nitely narrow line of light (whose length
    is perpendicular to the plane of the diagram), as formed by an
    0bject~glass with aperture A B, is thus a series of parallel stripes,
    composed of a central narrow band whose illumination varies
    from a maximum in the middle to zero at the edges, enclosed by
    parallel bands of rapidly decreasing illumination.     We have now
    to examine the effect of the ruling.
       For the sake of simplicity, we will take <U+FB01>rst the case of a gra
    ting composed of transparent bars of width a, alternating with
    opaque bars of width          and consider the central image or

    a:  a+d. In another direction, making          small angle with             a                        B   C

    same as     there were no ruling.
                     if                   For example, when the direc
    tion     such that the projection of

    wave-length, the elementary components neutralize one another,
    because their phases are on the whole distributed symmetrically,
    though discontinuously, round the entire circumference.        The
    only effect of the ruling    to diminish the amplitude in the ratio
                                                       is

       The lateral images occur in such directions that the projection
    of the element a+d of the grating upon them         an exact mul                     is

which is generally very far from being true. In an engraved glass
grating or in a gelatine copy there is no opaque material present
by which light could be absorbed, and the effect depends on a
difference of retardation due to the alternate parts.              It is re
markable that this point is never alluded to in the ordinary
treatises on optics, and, so far as               I
                                           know, was <U+FB01>rst noticed by
Quincke (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxxii. p. 321 (1867)), who made a
theoretical and experimental examination of the phenomena pre
sented when light is diffracted at the edge of a transparent
obstacle.    My attention was <U+FB01>rst drawn to            before  it, was ac I
quainted with Quincke’s work,                   by
                                          observing that, contrary to

length in passing over each element of the grating and then fall
back to its previous value, thus springing suddenly over             wave—     a
length.    It    notislikely  that  such   resultawill ever   be  obtained
in practice; but the case was worth stating, in order to show that
there      no theoretical limit to the concentration

     It is not possible to say precisely under what circumstances a

 the <U+FB01>rst spectrum would require 1000 grooves, in the second
 spectrum 500, and so on.          It is evident that if the ruling be
 perfectly accurate and the illumination suf<U+FB01>cient, the work may
 be accomplished      with comparatively few lines by using a spec
 trum of elevated order.
     The result of an attempt to determine experimentally the
 number of lines necessary to resolve D in the solar spectrum
 may here be recorded.        The 3000-to-the-inch Nobert was used,
 its horizontal aperture being limited by the jaws of an adjustable
 slit.    From the width of the slit found to be necessary the
 number of lines in operation was calculated.
     In the <U+FB01>rst spectrum 1200 lines were required, in the second
  630, and in the third 375. These numbers should be in the
 ratio 6 : 3 : 2 ; but the last, which presents the greatest deviation,
 was dif<U+FB01>cult of exact measurement.
     The number of lines necessary in the <U+FB01>rst spectrum is very
 much what might have been expected.          The effect of a limitation
 of the aperture of the grating by a slit whose length is horizontal,
 is, of course, quite different.    As the slit is narrowed, the image
 of a point would be dilated in a vertical direction; but this is of
 no moment when the subject of observation is itself a uniform
 vertical line.     As was mentioned in the <U+FB01>rst part, the de<U+FB01>nition
 is often materially improved.
     Since a grating resolves in proportion to the total number of
its grooves, it might be supposed that the de<U+FB01>ning-power de
 pends on different principles in the case of gratings and prisms;

                      Tkeory of Di<U+FB01>'raction-gratings.               201
but the distinction is not fundamental.        The limit to de<U+FB01>nition
arises in both cases from the impossibility of representing a line
of light otherwise than by a band of <U+FB01>nite though narrow width,
the width in both cases depending only on the horizontal aper
ture (for a given 7»).      If a grating and aprism have the same
horizontal aperture and dispersion, they will have equal resolving
powers on the spectrum ; the greater dispersion is the only
cause of the superiority of the diffraction-spectra of high order.
     In estimating the value of light-analyzing apparatus, there
are three things to be considered—the brightness, the purity,
and the apparent magnitude of the resulting spectrum.            In the
case of a prism, where the loss of light by re<U+FB02>ection and ab
sorption may in a rough approximation be neglected, the <U+FB01>rst
two characteristics      are inseparably connected, whether a tele
scope be used or not, so long as the pupilof the eye is <U+FB01>lled with
light.      In whatever degree the purity be enhanced, whether by
increasing the dispersion or narrowing the slit, in the same de
 gree must the brightness su<U+FB02>'er.       The angular magnitude of the
 spectrum is merely a question of magnifying-power.          No matter
 how small the dispersion may be, the spectrum may yet be made
 to appear as long as we please by su<U+FB02>iciently increasing the
 focal length of the object-glass and the power of the eyepiece.
 But if the brilliancy is not to suffer, the size of the prism and
 the aperture of the telescope must be proportionally increased;
 for otherwise the condition will be violated of keeping the pupil
 <U+FB01>lled with light.      There are thus two ways of obtaining a pow
 erful spectroscope.       The <U+FB01>rst is to procure a great dispersion
 by multiplication     of prisms; the second is to be satis<U+FB01>ed with a
 small dispersion, and attain the necessary length of spectrum by
 a high-power telescope, which may involve alarger aperture.          It
  may    be  questioned   whether  the second  method   has  received as
 much attention as it deserves. When there is light to spare, a
 higher power than usual may often be employed advantageously
  without an augmentation of aperture.
      In the case of gratings the question is complicated by the
  choice of spectra; but some remarks may perhaps be useful.
  Much misapprehension appears to exist as to the nature of the
  advantage derived from c10se ruling.        It is generally supposed
  that the closer the ruling the greater the resolving-power of the
 instrument ; but this is for the most part a mistake. When there
  is no limitation on the order of the spectrum to be observed, re
  solving-power depends not on the closeness but on the accuracy of
  the ruling. Let us take the case of a grating with 3000 lines in an
  inch, and consider the effect of interpolating an additional 3000
  lines. The e<U+FB01>‘ect of the addition will be to destroy by interference
  the <U+FB01>rst, third, and the odd spectra generally; while the advan

202              Lord Rayleigh    on the  Manufacture and
tage gained in the spectra of even order is not in dispersion, nor
in resolving-power, but simply in brilliancy, which is increased
to four times. If we now suppose halfthe grating to be cut away,
so as to leave 3000 lines in half an inch, the dispersion will
evidently not be altered, while the brightness and resolving
power are halved.        If, therefore, resolving-power be our object,
we should aim at covering a considerable breadth with very
accurately placed lines, rather than at extreme closeness of the
lines themselves.       On the other hand, for experiment on dark
heat, or whenever a narrow slit is not available, resolving-power
is of less importance, and the best grating will be one that covers
the largest space with the <U+FB01>nest lines.
    I have already mentioned that my GOOO-to-the-inch             Nobert
de<U+FB01>nes not only not better, but decidedly worse, than the one
with 3000 lines in the inch. This inferior de<U+FB01>nition is probably
an accident ; for there seems to be no theoretical reason for it. In
brightness the closer-ruled grating has greatly the advantage.
    The preceding investigations are founded on the principles
ordinarily adopted in explaining di<U+FB02>'raction-phenomena, and not
on a strict dynamical theory.         In the present state of our know
ledge with respect to the nature of light and its relations to
ponderable matter, vagueness in the fundamental hypotheses is
rather an advantage than otherwise; a precise theory is almost
sure to be wrong.         Nevertheless it is often instructive to ex
amine optical questions from a more special point of view ; and
therefore    I  hope that an investigation of an ideal grating on
dynamical      principles  will not be out of place, though not Very
closely   connected    with  the preceding portion of the paper.
    In actual gratings the lines or grooves occur at the boundary
of two media of different refrangibilities ; but, for the sake of sim
 plicity, we shall here suppose the medium on both sides to be
the same.       The grating will thus consist simply of bars (in<U+FB01>
nitely long) whose optical properties differ from those of the rest
of the medium; and we further suppose
    (1) that the variation of optical properties depends upon a
di<U+FB01>'erence of inertia, and is small in amount ;
    (2) that the diameter of the bars is very small in relation
to the wave-length of light.
    The supposition that refraction depends upon a difference of
inertia is that of Fresnel and Green, and has been shown by the
latter to lead to Fresnel’ s laws.       In several papers in this Maga
zine*,   I  have shown that, if the analogy with an elastic solid
holds good at all, no other supposition is reconcilable with the
facts of the re<U+FB02>ection of light from surfaces and its diffraction

chanically possible.
    Since the bars are very small, the effect of each is quite inde
pendent of the rest; and so the dynamical theory need only con~
cern itself with one.     In my paper “ On the Light from the

Sky          proved that the effect of a body in disturbing the waves
of light incident upon it may be calculated by ordinary integra
tion from those of its parts, provided that the square of the alte
ration of mechanical properties may be neglected.         This propo
sition, though true as stated, requires some caution in use, and
 is practically inapplicable when the body is elongated in the di
 rection of original propagation, because the dimension of the
 body in this direction divided by 7t may occur as a factor in the
terms omitted.     In the present case, however, where the light
                                                                  \\

206                M. J. L.   Soret on some Phenomena         of
    This publication of M. Hirn’s induces             me to make known a
few of the results      I  have obtained in observing the polarization
of <U+FB02>ame in general presents no trace of polarization.       As is known, it was
this observation that served to place one of the <U+FB01>rst and most important
landmarks of the theory of the sun, by informing us that the solar light
emanates from a gas, and not from a liquid or a solid.
    “ When we have to do with a homogeneous <U+FB02>ame, such as that of
                                                                        strongly
compressed hydrogen burning in compressed oxygen, when the light ema
nates from all parts of the incandescent gas itself, the fact discovered by
Arago exhibits nothing unusual, nothing inconsistent with other known
facts.    It is not so when the <U+FB02>ame is heterogeneous, formed of a real mix
ture of a gas with the dust of a solid body—dust which is far from being,
as has often been erroneously advanced, in a state of in<U+FB01>nitesimal division;
in a word, it is not so with nine tenths of ordinary <U+FB02>ames, the brightness
 of which can only be explained by Davy’s theory.        Here, in fact, not only
 does each of the solid particles emit light of its own, but it must re<U+FB02>ect
light from other sources; for it is illumined by the other particles.       Then
 how is the total absence of polarization to be explained?       The interpreta
 tion, it seems, is not dif<U+FB01>cult in the case of carburetted gases.
    “Of all known substances, carbon (at least in its most usual state) is
 that which re<U+FB02>ects light the least. Lampblack, for example, re<U+FB02>ects very
little or none at all; now, in <U+FB02>ame, it is precisely in the form of lampblack
 that carbon is found, although incandescent. The absence of light polarized
 by re<U+FB02>ection seems therefore very natural in this particular case.         In an
 experiment, however, of which I shall speak subsequently, I have ascer
 tained that the smoke of carbon, when produced in a very hot atmosphere
 and strongly illuminated, appears not black, but of dazzling whiteness.
 The above interpretation is therefore not so correct as it seems; and we
 shall see besides that it cannot be applied in its entirety in a great number
 of other cases. I cite as striking examples the two following :—
    “ l. I have examined with the Arago-lune polariscope the <U+FB02>ame of phos
 phorus burning in shade or in bright sunshine, and I have not been able
 to perceive the least appearance of coloration in either of the two images.
 When, on the contrary, I directed the instrument towards the vapour of
 phosphoric acid strongly illuminated by the sun, the coloration became
 manifest.
     “ 2. I have examined in the same manner the lofty and bright <U+FB02>ame that
 issued from the top of a cupola coke-furnace, supplied with air by an ener
 getic blast, which served for melting cast iron.      Neither at night, nor in
 bright sunshine have I been able to perceive in it the slightest trace of po
 larization.    Now, although here also the combustible was carbon, the light
  of the <U+FB02>ame (a very bright light yellow) was certainly not due solely to par
 ticles of carbon precipitated in the burning gas; instead of not solely, it
 would be perhaps more correct to say not at all.         When, at the end of
 the operation, the furnace-door was opened for drawing out the scoriae, the
  calcareous <U+FB02>ux, 860., a thick bluish smoke (various metallic oxides or salts)
  escaped from the top instead of the <U+FB02>ame.       This smoke, strongly illumi
  nated by the still-glowing interior, gave to the polarimeter two images as
 much coloured as those obtained on looking at any light whatever, re<U+FB02>ected
 under the most favourable angle, through an unsilvered glass plate.            It
 is evidently to this vapour of metallic oxides or salts that the <U+FB02>ame owed
 the greater part or even the totality of its brightness while the furnace was
 in action.
    “ How is it to be accounted for that phosphoric acid and the vapour of

                    Polarization   by Dé<U+FB02>'usion   of Light.              207
of di<U+FB01>'used light, whether by particles disseminated in a trans
parent medium, or by surfaces not polished.     This subject, the
study of which I am‘far from having <U+FB01>nished, is connected with
my preceding researches on the illumination of transparent
bodies *.
   I hardly need to recall here the fact, now well known, that a
gas or a liquid holding heterogeneous particles in suspension is
illuminated by the passage of natural light, and the light ema
nating from this illuminated trace is polarized in the plane of
vision'l'.    If the angle of vision is 90°, polarization is complete
if the particles are minute and not too abundant.
    This said,  I  will report the facts     I have observed on employ
ing lampblack      as the  diffuser,  both  at the moment of its forma
tion and as a deposit on other bodies.
      Ifin a dark chamber a pencil of solar rays be made to fall on
 a smoky <U+FB02>ame of illuminating-gas, its trace is perceived very di
 stinctly: the portion of the <U+FB02>ame traversed by the pencil ap
 pears bluish white, contrasting with the reddish tint of the
 adjacent parts.      This experiment can be easily made with a cir
 cular (Bengel) burner without a chimney; in these conditions
 (i. e. when the combustion        isincomplete) the trace of the pencil
 of solar rays, especially  if   concentrated     by   lens,

                                                              is
 in every part of the <U+FB02>ame except quite at the base.
    If be observed with Nicol or any other analyzer, for an
           it                 a
 angle of vision of 90° the polarization         isascertained to be com

                                                                    is
 as to intercept the rays which are polarized in the plane of vision.
    If instead of natural light pencil of polarized solar light
                                    a                                     is

 the trace presents well-marked differences of coloration accord
 ing to the position of the quartz.
    The same phenomena are manifested when the pencil of solar
 light passes to the smoke above the <U+FB02>ame—that                is,
                                                               to the non

the same? Are we not authorized, or even compelled to conclude that an

     If we employ the Bengel burner with its glass chimney, the
 <U+FB02>ame becomes more brilliant, it ceases to be smoky, and the
 trace of the luminous pencil is no longer perceived; but if an
 excess of gas be admitted, so as to cause the <U+FB02>ame to shoot, it
 presents in its upper part the same characters as when the burner
 was without its chimney.
     With a butter<U+FB02>yrburner, where the combustion is complete,
 no luminous trace is to be observed, and consequently                   no
 polarization.
     If we examine with       a polariscope a gas-<U+FB02>ame,     or better that
 of an oil-lamp,    which    shoots, without   the addition of solar light,
we <U+FB01>nd that the column of smoke emits light polarized in a ho
 rizontal plane.
     In hort, for what concerns the experimental results, it is             .
 seen that I am in accord with M. Hirn: where the <U+FB02>ame burn
with vivid brilliance the trace of a luminous pencil is not ap
 parent.
     M. Him (with        some reserve,   it is true) explains this by the
 weakening of the re<U+FB02>ecting-power, and by the transparence of
 the carbon particles at a high temperature.            I should not ven
 ture to express an absolute opinion on this question, which
 I have not specially studied; but before admitting this hypo
thesis, which is partly in disagreement with the principle of
the identity of the emissive and absorbing-powers,            I ask myself
if the absence of polarization in the parts of the <U+FB02>ame where
combustion is complete cannot be accounted for by the two
following considerations :—
     lst. A gas-<U+FB02>ame may in general be regarded as formed of
several layers.       In the centre of the sheet the gas is at a tem
perature     inferior   to that of the decomposition of the carburets
of hydrogen ; it is only on the surfaces of this sheet that decom
position is e<U+FB02>'ected and carbon precipitated in incandescent par
ticles which are burned as rapidly as they are produced.               The
incandescent layer        is therefore  very thin,  the particles are rare,
and the phenomena of re<U+FB02>ection and polarization must be in
sensible.
    The fact of the apparent continuity of the <U+FB02>ame cannot be
alleged as a proof of the abundance of the particles; irradiation
and the persistence of the impressions on the retina suf<U+FB01>ciently
account for it.        Besides, in speaking of the rarity of the par
ticles   I only  mean    a relative rarity.    Observing with a lens the
feeble luminous trace produced by a solar ray in very clear
water suf<U+FB01>ces for the recognition of the presence of myriads of
heterogeneous particles <U+FB02>oating in the liquid; and yet the power
of illumination is very feeble.
    If, on the contrary, the <U+FB02>ame is smoky, the a<U+FB02>iux of oxygen

                   Polarization   by  Difusion of Light.               209
being insu<U+FB02>‘icient,    combustion does not destroy        the lampblaek
in proportion to its production, the particles accumulate              and
become      su<U+FB02>iciently  abundant    to  render  visible the  trace of the
pencil of solar light.
    2nd. When the combustion is complete the light is very in
tense, it dazzles the eye; and it is easy to comprehend how dif
<U+FB01>cult it must be to perceive the polarization of the very slight
proportion of re<U+FB02>ected light. We can convince ourselves of this
by endeavouring to observe through a gas-<U+FB02>ame the polarization
 which accompanies the illumination of a liquid for example,
though it is so easily veri<U+FB01>ed under the usual conditions.
     I  have also studied  the diffusion of  light by any solid surface
 covered with lampblack deposited from the <U+FB02>ame of essence of
 turpentine or of benzine. When a pencil of sunlight falls on this
 surface in a dark chamber, a very notable proportion of light is
 seen to be diffused in all directions ; the incident pencil is marked
 on the black by a white spot of considerable splendour, much
 more brilliant than that which is obtained upon a smoky <U+FB02>ame:
 the re<U+FB02>ecting particles are, in fact, much more abundant.          What
 ever be the angle and the plane of incidence of the luminous
 pencil relative to the blackened surface, the diffused light is seen
 to be polarized in the plane of vision. The maximum corresponds
 to a visual angle of 90°, though there the polarization is not
 complete. When looked at through an analyzer which is rotated,
 the spot augments or diminishes in brightness, but remains
 always distinctly visible.
     If in place of natural light we employ a pencil of solar rays
 polarized, for instance, in a vertical plane, the light diffused by
 the lampblack presents in all directions the same phenomena of
 partial polarization as the trace which is produced in an illumi—
 nated gas or liquid.       In a horizontal plane of vision, and with
  a visual angle of 90°, we have the minimum of brightness, but
  not complete extinction as this takes place with a smoky <U+FB02>ame
  or, in general, with gases or liquids holding in suspension <U+FB01>ne
  particles in relatively little abundance.        The residual light is
  neutral and shows no trace of polarization; but as soon as the
  angle of vision becomes greater or less than 50° partial polariza
  tion reappears immediately.
      I explain this residue of neutral light by multiple re<U+FB02>ections
  from the minute rugosities produced by the particles of lamp
  black on the diffusing surface. I do not think it can be attributed
  to a <U+FB02>uorescence, for the following reasons :—
       lst. When this residual light is analyzed with the spectro
  scope, the principal lines of the solar spectrum are recognized in
  it ; therefore there is no change of refrangibility*.
     * This proof is perhaps not quite conclusive; for under the in<U+FB02>uence of
  Phil. May. S. 4. Vol. 47. No. 311. March 1874.                   P

210              M.   J. L.  Soret on some Phenomena        of
    2nd. M. Ed. Becquerel has proved that lampblack deposited
from the <U+FB02>ame of benzine upon a plate of mica, in a layer suf<U+FB01>
ciently thin to be translucent, does not give in the phosphoro
scope any trace of phosphorescence*.               Now in general, with
solid substances, <U+FB02>uorescence has a certain duration and is con
founded with phosphorescence.
     3rd. If this residual light proceeded from a <U+FB02>uorescence, it
ought to be remarked also in the smoke of a <U+FB02>ame ; the intensity
of the illumination is certainly strong enough for this.            Now, as
we have said, polarization       is  complete   in this  latter case.   One
can very well conceive that, the particles being relatively much
disseminated and distributed throughout the thickness of the
incident pencil, the proportion of light undergoing multiple
re<U+FB02>ections may be insensible, while in the lampblack deposited
on a solid substance all the particles are in mutual contact, they
are accumulated on the same surface, and must re<U+FB02>ect recipro
cally a notable quantity of light.
     In brief, lampblack, whether as a continuous deposit or in the
state of corpuscles disseminated in a gas, appears to me to con
stitute a very good type for this kind of phenomena of illumina
 tion. Indeed, on the one hand these particles are very tenuous,
 and, on the other, they are opaque—which eliminates the per
turbations which may be induced by refraction, leaving only
 what is due to re<U+FB02>ection.
     There are other fumes, in the widest sense of the term, which
 give rise to very different results.        For example, the vapour of
 water precipitated in small quantity in the vesicular state, and
 illuminated by a pencil of light, gives also phenomena of polar
 ization; but while ordinary vapour re<U+FB02>ects under an angle of
 vision of 90° light polarized in the plane of vision, vesicular
vapour in the same conditions diffuses light partially polarized
 in a perpendicular plane.          This is what Professor Tyndall has
 described in his beautiful researches on the optical properties of
 cloudy substancesT, and        I  have veri<U+FB01>ed also upon vapour con
 densed in divers manners.
     For an angle of vision less than a right angle a diminution of
 the polarization is <U+FB01>rst observed, then a neutral point (towards
 70°) ; at last, under an angle of about 65° and below, polariza
 the solar rays certain substances, as sulphur and carbon, emit a light which
 has the closest correspondence with that of the <U+FB02>uorescence of quinine.
 esculine, &c., except that there is no change of refrangibility: it is what
 M. Lallemand has called isochromatic <U+FB02>uorescence.
    * M. Ed. Becquerel has been so
                                       extremely obliging as, at my request,
 to repeat this experiment in my presence.

of 90°.

rainbows, which are usually so readily visible, disappear almost
completely in these conditions of extreme minuteness of the glo

that they have spread out and mingled, and that the reds of the
two bows have united with each other.          This remarkable fact is,
I  think, thus explained :—because on extremely minute surfaces
 re<U+FB02>ection and refraction do not follow the laws of geometrical
optics; as Fresnel has demonstrated, di<U+FB02>'raction                   is

BY vibroscope,
          the  optical study
                       M. Lissajous has endowed acoustics with means
of investigation much more accurate than those based upon
hearing only; nevertheless this optical method does not appear
hitherto to have been conveniently applied to the determination
of the absolute number of vibrations. I have thought that it
could be utilized for this purpose, and that a touometer might
be more easily constructed with its aid than by the operation
devised by Scheibler.          The new tonometer, at, least as accurate,
would be much less icostly ; and it could be employed to give,
by simple reading, the number of vibrations of any sonorous
body whatever, and that through a very great extent of the
musical scale.
   I  have had made by M. Kbnig four diapasons furnished with
cursors, and each carrying at the extremity of one of its branches,
like the diapason of the vibroscope, a small biconvex lens to
serve as an objective.         These diapasons can be successively <U+FB01>xed
upon     the  same   support, on which an ocular is placed.        By shift
ing   the   cursors,   we  can  obtain  all the sounds comprised between
UT2    (128   double   vibrations)   and  org; moreover some sounds are
common to two diapasons which immediately follow one another.
The diapasons were divided by M. Ko'nig after his tonometer,
in such sort that, by shifting the cursors the space which sepa~~
rates two strokes, the sound is changed two double vibrations;
      I
but consider this only a completely arbitrary division which
might be replaced by any other made by means of a dividing
machine.        I shall give to these diapasons the name of standards.
    I  have, besides, other diapasons, not graduated, but likewise
furnished with cursors and extending from or, to UTs.               Two are
suf<U+FB01>cient, because spare cursors can be adapted to them.                    I
shall give to these the name of auxiliary diapasons.
    The <U+FB01>rst standard diapason and the <U+FB01>rst auxiliary are <U+FB01>xed
the one in front of the other, on suitable supports, in one and
the same horizontal plane, and at a right angle ,- moreover the
vibrations of the standard diapason (which serves as a vibro
scope) being made as usual, in a vertical plane, those of the
auxiliary take place in a horizontal plane.

vibratory movements at a right angle might be readily perceived,

upon the terminal section of one of the branches of the auxiliary
diapason.     The facets of this crystalline powder, obliquely illu»
minated by means of a lamp and lenses, form luminous points
of great brilliancy and extreme delicacy. The cursor of the
standard having been <U+FB01>xed upon the <U+FB01>rst stroke of the division,
the auxiliary diapason is put into exact unison with the former
by shifting the cursors, <U+FB01>nally putting on them small pieces of
wax.    The operator is guided in this operation evidently by the
transformations of the elliptic curve which is due to the coexist
ence of the vibrations ; and he stops when it diminishes gradu
ally and very slowly without changing its form.
    This done, he moves the cursor of the standard diapason so as
to obtain about one beat per second, and determines the exact du
ration of at least <U+FB01>fty beats by aid of a pointing telltale, observing
the oscillations of the elliptic curve. If the conditions be good, the
total duration of <U+FB01>fty beats scarcely varies a half second in several
successive determinations, which gives an approximation within
1%? of a econd for one heat, and consequently permits the num
ber of vibrations to be determined within less than 0'01.          The
cursor of the auxiliary diapason is then shifted till unison is re
established, which is ascertained by the <U+FB01>xity of the curve pro
duced.     The cursor of the standard diapason is then placed on
the second stroke of the division, and the duration of the beats
produced determined again.                        ~
    The operation is continued in the same manner by shifting
successively the cursors of the two diapasons until a sound is
obtained suf<U+FB01>ciently distant from U'rg, such as M12, capable of
giving with the sound U're2 a suf<U+FB01>ciently simple acoustic curve
(4:5). When, by successive stops, the auxiliary diapason is
put in unison with the sound M1,, the cursor of the <U+FB01>rst standard
diapason must be carried back to the <U+FB01>rst stroke, and it must be
ascertained if the sound Mi,z is perfectly true; if there is any
difference, it is determined by the duration of the oscillations of
the acoustic curve.     The sum total of the numbers of beats per
second (the inverse of their duration) which have been observed
on the shifting of the cursors in succession, gives the difference
of the numbers of vibrations of the sounds U're and M12, of which
we have the ratio—which agrees with the principle given by
Scheibler for the construction of the tonometer, and permits the
absolute number of the vibrations of or, to be calculated.
    Continuing in the same manner, we arrive at Ura. On the
way numerous datum- and veri<U+FB01>cation-points are met with in
the simple intervals, such as the fourth, the <U+FB01>fth, the sixth, Sec.
At length we know in this manner the absolute number of vibra
tions corresponding to each stroke of the division of the standard
diapason.

   The only practical dif<U+FB01>culty which          I
                                             have encountered (and
this     I
        think I am on the point of surmounting) is in the mode
of <U+FB01>xing the cursors on the diapasons.        In fact they should be
<U+FB01>xed there in a quite invariable manner, so that the sound may
not suffer any variation of pitch when the diapason is set in
vibration 3 this does not always happen, though the di<U+FB02>'erences
observed are very slight.      In the second place, the cursors must
be restored to the same position with mathematical accuracy.
   I  have already veri<U+FB01>ed a certain number of the divisions traced
by M. Konig on my diapasons from his tonometer, and have
found only differences amounting to not more than a few hun
dredths of a vibration per second, which shows the degree of
con<U+FB01>dence that may be placed in the determinations made from
the tonometer constructed by him.
   By this method, then, it will be possible, with more facility
than by the old process, though not without sustained attention
and numerous determinations,        to divide the interval from U'r.2
to U'r,3 into sounds differing one from another by two vibrations,
or even by one only, if it be desired.      At the least, by the em
ployment     of auxiliary diapasons  with cursors,  the same proce
dure   will permit the veri<U+FB01>cation of the accuracy of the divisions
of the standard diapasons mounted in the form of a vibroscope,
and to construct a table of corrections if the divisions are not
perfectly         exact.
     The vibroscope tonometer once constructed and veri<U+FB01>ed, in
order to determine the pitch of any sound whatever, it will be
su<U+FB02>icient to place one of the diapasons of which it consists by
the side of the vibrating body in such a way that the vibrations
 of the one shall be perpendicular to those of the other.     On this
body (which may be a rod, a plate, a string, &c.) some particles
of antimony powder are to be <U+FB01>xed; then the cursors will be
shifted until an acoustic curve of well-recognizable form isob
tained, such as that due to vibrations in the ratio of 1 : 2, 1 :3,

An   Introduction to the Elements of Euclid, being a familiar explana
   tion of the <U+FB01>rst twelve propositions of the <U+FB01>rst boolc.   By the Rev.
   STEPHEN Haw'ranr, A.M., late Assistant Master     at  Eton. London:

    NE’S <U+FB01>rst impression on looking at this book might be to ask,
       Is it possible that the <U+FB01>rst twelve propositions of Euclid’s
<U+FB01>rst book require 105 pages of explanation ? But if the querist has
 ever taught the elements of geometry to a child and remembers in
 what his verbal instruction consisted, he will probably <U+FB01>nd on read-        ,
 ing the book that his explanations were at least as voluminous as
 those here printed; and doubtless he will be both interested and in
 structed in this record of the method of oral teaching which was
 used for many years by Mr. Hawtrey “ with some success.”
     We will notice very brie<U+FB02>y the leading points of the book. In
 the <U+FB01>rst place the author insists on the learner being provided with
 “ a. pair of
              compasses having a. pen- and pencil-leg, a, small <U+FB02>at ruler,
 and a hard pencil ;” besides these, he adds, it is well to have “a
 little box-wood triangle, called . . . . ‘ a set square.’ ” He also
 insists on having the data of each problem drawn in ink before the
 construction is completed in pencil.     In the next place he treats
 the de<U+FB01>nitions very fully, those at least which the learner needs to
 begin upon; the postulates and axioms are noticed, with a. suf<U+FB01>—
ciency of comment, the twelfth axiom being left out as not needed
at present. The propositions are then taken in order, directions are
given for drawing the <U+FB01>gure line by line, and each step of the de
monstration commented on. At the end of each exposition the
proposition is given as it stands in Euclid—general enunciation,
particular enunciation, construction, demonstration ; and the learner
is directed to write it out.
    The fourth proposition is treated at great length, and its import
ance in regard to what follows insisted on more forcibly (not than
it deserves to be, but) than we have ever seen it insisted on before.
“It is a great and most important proposition, and has .been called
the key to Euclid.” The expoeition of the proposition is followed
by seven exercises, all fully worked out; and as they cannot be
done without assuming something more than the <U+FB01>rst four propo
sitions, the assumptions are carefully explained; as a deduction
from two of the exercises the <U+FB01>fth proposition is proved in fact
though not in name. After this the learner is ready to encounter
the <U+FB01>fth proposition in its proper form, which         as Mr. Hawtrey
                                                      is,
says, nothing but an exercise on the fourth proposition, though too
hard to be taken immediately after it.
    We fear that this account of the contents    is somewhat meagre;
but there is, in fact, not much to say about the book in the way of
description.     Its merit consists in the admirable clearness with
which all the points of well-trodden road are brought under notice
                         a.
and much insisted on, which, in these days of quick travelling,        is

——-who having got hold of the key, can go on to investigate the
hidden treasures of Euclid. .We cordially recommend the book to
all who are engaged in teaching the elements of geometry to the

from it something as to the best way of performing a. dif<U+FB01>cult and

THE    “ The Action of Light on the Electrical Resistance  of Selenium.”
BY Lieut. Sale, RE.
    It   having been recently brought to notice that selenium in the
crystalline condition exhibits the remarkable property of having a
conductivity varying with the degree of light to which it is ex—
posed, the following experiments were undertaken with a view to
the further elucidation of the matter :—
    Erqoeriment 1.—A bar of crystalline selenium measuring approxi
mately 1'5" x '5” X '05” was procured, and platinum wire terminals
were fastened to the ends.
    The bar itself was then enclosed in a box having a draw-lid, so
as to admit or exclude the light at pleasure.
    Then, the lid of the box being on, the resistance of the selenium
was measured by means of a. high-resistance galvanometer and a
Wheatstone’s bridge, with dial-coils capable of measuring up to
10,000,000 ohms.        The battery-power was 2 cells Daniel].
    The measurement was made on a dull cloudy day, and in a
room of equable temperature.
    The resistance having been carefully balanced, the lid of the box
was withdrawn, when the resistance of the selenium fell instanta—
neously and considerably, as indicated by the rapid movement of
the spot of light on the galvanometer-scale.
    Experiment 2.—The transition from darkness to the light given
by an ordinary gas-burner (conditions as before), caused a. slight
and barely perceptible fall in the resistance.
    Emperiment 3.—The bar of selenium was next tried in the solar

                 on the Electrical Resistance               of Selenium.              217
spectrum on a. very bright cloudless day (conditions as before),
except that more battery-power was used (10 cells Daniell).
    The diifused daylight could not be cut 0E; so the trial was made
in the most shaded part of an ordinary room, the spectrum being
superimposed on the ordinary diffused daylight.
    The resistances were very carefully balanced in each case, with
the following results :—

            after exposure (resistance rising) . . . . . .                   310,000
    The indications were very clear; and the bar of selenium was so
 sensitive to the action of the spectrum, that a slight movement of
 the prism produced a corresponding movement in the spot of light
 on the galvanometer-scale.
    It is to be noted that in this experiment the re<U+FB02>ecting galvano
 meter was placed on a heavy masonry pillar insulated from the
 <U+FB02>oor for observatory purposes, and that the battery, bar of sele
 nium, and resistance-coils were in another room, being connected
 by long and carefully insulated leads with the galvanometer.
    Experiment 4.—The diffused light was cut 0E as much as pos
 sible by screens; and the resistances were again balanced in the
 solar spectrum.       Conditions as in the last case.
          Resistance of selenium in red . . . . . . . . . . . .              240,000

    Experiment 5.—The selenium was also exposed to the spectrum                        '
 of the electric light in a darkened room.
    The elfect was feeble ; but by using more battery-power in ba
 lancing, it was possible to measure the swing of the spot of light
 when the selenium was suddenly exposed to the action of the light
 of the spectrum.
    The maximum effect was obtained in, or just at the edge of the
 red, the violet and blue rays producing scarcely any eifect.

     The following were the general results of the experiments :—
     Results.—(1) That the resistance of selenium is largely affected
  by exposure to light.
     (2) That this e<U+FB01>ect is not produced by the actinic rays, but is

  coincident with the locus of the maximum of the heat—rays.
     (3) That the e<U+FB01>ect of varying resistances is certainly not due
 to any change of temperature in the bar of selenium.
     (4) That the eifect produced on exposure to light is sensibly in

 normal resistance is not so rapid.
     It would seem that there exists a power in rays nearly coincident
 with the heat-rays of high intensity, of altering instantaneously

     “Determination of the Number of Electrostatic Units in the
 Electromagnetic Unit made in the Physical Laboratory of Glasgow
 University.” By Dugald M‘Kichan, M.A.
     The object of this paper is to describe experiments made at
 intervals from 1870 to 1872 in the Physical Laboratory of Glasgow
 University to determine the relation between the fundamental units
 in the two systems of absolute electrical measurement, the electro
 magnetic and the electrostatic.      A summary is also given of the
 results of similar observations made by W. F. King in 1867 and
 1868.
     The two systems of electrical measurement, or the units which
 they employ, are founded on the fundamental units of time, mass,
 and space applied to the observed eifects of electricity at rest and
 electricity in motion.   The dimensions of quantity in the two sys
 tems are such that the ratio of the electromagnetic and the elec
trostatic unit of quantity is expressible as a velocity.
    This velocity, usually known as v, is not only of great im
 portance in all combinations of electromagnetic and electrostatic
action, but it is also of great scienti<U+FB01>c importance in the theory
of the propagation of electromagnetic disturbances through a di
electric medium.     It occupies a very important place in the deve
lopment of the electromagnetic theory of light by Professor Clerk
Maxwell, according to whose theory this velocity v is the same as
the velocity of light.
    The <U+FB01>rst experimental determination of u was made by Weber
from a common electrostatic and electromagnetic measure of capa
city.    As the result of Weber’s experiments, 11 was found to be
310-74 x 10' centims. per second.
    Another determination was made by Prof. Clerk Maxwell in

          Heating  of a Dish by rapid Rotation in vacuo.           219
1868, by means of a direct comparison of electrostatic attraction
with electromagnetic repulsion. His experiments gave 1) =288 x 108
centims. per second.
   The value of a given by the experiments here described is
293x 10° centims. per second. The method employed was that
of obtaining an absolute electrostatic and an absolute electromag
netic measurement of the same electromotive force.        'u is de<U+FB01>ned
as the ratio of the units of quantity in the two systems; but it
follows from the de<U+FB01>nition of electromotive force, that v is also the
ratio of the units of electromotive force in the two systems.
   The electromotive force, or the difference of potentials between
the two poles of a constant Daniell’s battery, was measured elec
trostatically by means of Sir William Thomson’s absolute electro—
meter.    The absolute electromagnetic value of this electromotive
force was given by the eifect of the current which it maintained
in the circuit of an electrodynamometer.       The determination of
this value depended on the resistance of. the electrody'namometer
circuit, which was reckoned in terms of the absolute value of the
British-Association standard unit of resistance. Any correction
which may hereafter be found to be applicable to the absolute
value of this standard coil, as measured at King’s College by Pro—
fessors Clerk Maxwell, Balfour Stewart, and Fleeming Jenkin, must
be applied to the value of 1) given above.
   The comparisons made in 1867 and 1868 by Mr. King gave as
the mean value of 11, 284-6 x 108 centims. per second.
    The experiments made in 1870 with the new absolute electro
meter gave as the mean result 11:294'5 x 108 centims. per second.
The result of later observations made under much more favourable
circumstances was v=292-4 x 108 centims. per second.
   The latest observations (1872) furnish the most probable value
of v, 293 x 10" centims. per second.

              Heating of a Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.” By
Balfour Stewart, M.A., F.R.S._, and P. G. Tait, M.A.
   26. In two previous communications (Proc. Roy. Soc. June 15,
1865, and No. 88, 1866) to this Society, we gave an account of
some experiments which we had made upon the heating of a disk
through rotation in vacuo.     In these experiments the increase of
radiation of the heated disk was observed by means of a delicate
thermopile and galvanometer.       Three aluminium disks of various
thicknesses and one ebonite disk were used; and the results derived
from the experiments were as follows :—
   (1) The heating effect observed appeared to be independent of
the density, and of the chemical constitution, of the residual air and
                                             '
vapour surrounding the disks.
   (2) The quantity of heat developed under similar circumstances
of rotation in three aluminium disks '05, '0375, '025 of an inch in
thickness respectively appeared to be the same, inasmuch as the
relative thermometric eifect for these disks varied inversely as their
thickness.

 220        Royal Society :—Messrs. Stewart and Tait                on the
      (3) Besides the heating e<U+FB01>ect alluded to in (1) and (2), there
   was found to be, when the vacuum had been recently made, a strictly
   temporary effect, sometimes in the direction of heat, sometimes in
   that of cold, owing probably to the condensation or evaporation of
   small quantities of aqueous vapour; but this eifect was only notice
  able during rotation, disappearing the moment the motion             '
                                                                              was
  stopped.
      27. The experiments described in these communications were re
   sumed in 1870. In the interval an addition had been made to the
  apparatus, in virtue of which an ordinary carbonic—acid vacuum
  might be subjected to the in<U+FB02>uence of a. vessel containing potash
  allowed to open in    it,  and thus to absorb as much as possible of the
  remaining gas.
      On May  4   a carbonic-acid vacuum was obtained by this means
  (pressure 005 in.). A disk made of cartridge-paper, when made
  to rotate in this vacuum, gave      a    very perceptible result.      Carbonic
  acid was then allowed to enter the vacuum until the pressure
  became 0'65 in. The consequence of this increased pressure was in
  this instance an increase in the eifect, which was probably of a per—
  manent nature, inasmuch as      it     remained after three days. Unfor
  tunately the exact increase was not noted; but          it   is believed that
 the heat-indication became about three times as great in conse
 quence of the additional pressure.
      28. On May 11 another carbonic-acid vacuum was made (pres
 sure 0'12 in.), and at the suggestion of Professor Maxwell                   sul
                                                                             a.
 phuric-acid gauge     was    placed  in  the  receiver.   A'rotation    was then
 made and the result of the rotation was
       ;                                          a      hardly perceptible rise
 in the sulphuric-acid gauge. \Ve may therefore imagine that the
 residual air was not greatly heated.
     29. 'On May 16 another carbonic-acid vacuum was obtained (pres
 sure 0'08 in.), and with an ebOm'te disk of about 911,- inch thickness,
 the heat-indication was 16.          Carbonic acid was introduced, until the
 pressure   was  1'6  in.;   but  the  indication was only 18.      This result
is    in conformity with our previous experiments, in which an in
 crease of pressure of the residual air produced little or no e<U+FB01>ect.
     30. The ebonite disk was likewise tried in         a.    carbonic-acid var
cuum, pressure      0'04   in.;   and   also in  one, pressure 0'02 in., which
was the lowest we could obtain.             The   result of these experiments
appeared to show that in all probability the cartridge-paper disk
radiated more than twice as much as the thin ebonite disk.                   The
experiments were put      a     stop to bya     collapse of the glass receiver
during rotation, fortunately without injuring any one present.
     31. In June 1871 the experiments were resumed.                In the mean
time Mr. Beckley had .<U+FB01>tted the apparatus with an arrangement
working through     a   barometer—tube, by means of which, instead of
trusting to radiation, the disk itself might, after rotation, be tapped
by means of the pile, which could be brought up to                  itand then
withdrawn. By this means much larger effect might be obtained
                                 a.                                               ;
and  it  became possible, by varying the adjustment, to <U+FB01>nd according
to what law the heat e<U+FB01>ect varies with the distance from the centre.

           Healing of             a   Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.                           221
   32. These experiments were conducted in the following man
ner :—The disk was <U+FB01>rst of all tapped before rotation several
times ; at each tapping the momentary swing of the needle was re—
corded, and the mean of the readings was regarded as indicating the
state of the disk with respect to heat.
    The disk was next tapped after rotation, and the di<U+FB01>erence
between the readings before and after was taken as indicating the
change in the state of the disk produced by rotation.    In the later
experiments-the   disk before  rotation was kept in slight motion in
order to equalize any tendency to unequal heating of its various
parts; but this was not done in the experiments of June 1871.
In these experiments (June 1871) the disk was of brown paper,
and the results obtained were as follows z—For a carbonic—acid va—
cuum (pressure 0065 in.) a swing of 307 divisions was recorded,
while for a hydrogen vacuum (pressure 0150 in.) a swing of 281
divisions was recorded. Each result was the mean of three rotations.
   33. The next experiments were made in January 1872. The gal
vanometer was one of Thomson’s, but more adapted for battery
currents, and hence not in a very delicate state for these experi—
ments; the time of vibration of the needle was 3 seconds.        The
disk used was of ebonite (thickness about 31°- in.). The ebonite of
this disk was completely black; and in this respect, as well as in
being thinner, it di<U+FB01>ered from the ebonite disk <U+FB01>rst used in the
radiation-experiments    (art. 17). In the present experiments the
centre of the pile was made to tap the disk at a distance of 1'5
in. from the rim. The amount and velocity of rotation were re
 presented by 30 turns of the handle, or 3750 turns of the disk, in
about 40 seconds. The following results were obtained, a result
representing on an average somewhat more than four rotations :—

   It would thus appear that the results derived by tapping are
very di<U+FB01>erent from the radiation-results, inasmuch as in the former
the e<U+FB01>t'ect of the pressure and quality of the residual air is very ap
parent, while in the radiation-results it is hardly perceptible.     A
probable explanation of this will be given afterwards (art. 46); but
in the mean time, in view of these results, it will be expedient to
discuss them quite independently and by themselves, with the view
of ascertaining whether they can best be explained by a gas—effect
alone, or whether they likewise indicate a residual effect indepen
dent of gas.

    35. Similar experiments with the same galvanometer were made
with a disk of cartridge-paper, of which the pores were <U+FB01>lled
with solid paraf<U+FB01>n. And here we may mention that in all experi—
ments with paper disks a small wooden attachment was placed at
some little distance behind the disk and at the height of the pile,
and against this the disk was pressed during tapping—~care being
taken that the disk did not touch it during motion, but only when
it was pressed against it by bringing up the pile.                               ~
    With this paper disk the amount and speed of motion were repre
sented by 30 turns of the handle, or 3750 turns of the disk, in 30
seconds. The results were as follows, a result representing on an
average somewhat less than four rotations :—

    Treating these results in          the same manner as those of the ebonite
 disk,we obtain :—
                                   Dry hydrogen.      Dry air.   Dry carbonic acid.

    36. Now, if we suppose that there is only one effect due to
 gas,   it follows :—
    (a) That the proportion between the eifeets due to the various
gases exPerimented on (and all of the same pressure) is neverthe
 less di<U+FB01>erent for the two disks.
    (,6) That the proportion (for the same disk) between the e<U+FB01>ects
due to the various gases experimented on is different according to
the pressure.
    If, however, we suppose that there are two e<U+FB02>ects, one of which
is independent of the residual gas, we <U+FB01>nd :—
    (a) That, as regards the gas-qfect, the proportion between that
due to the various gases is nearly the same for both disks.                     Thus
in the ebonite disk we have 4, 20, 18, while in the paper disk we
have 4, 20, 23 as representing the gas—effect for the various gases.
    (/3) That the residual q<U+FB01>'ect in either disk is nearly the same for
the various gases.            Thus in the ebonite disk we have 55, 5'0, 60,
while in the paper disk we have 210, 25-0, 205 as representing the
residual e<U+FB01>ect for the various gases.

                                                                                                           '

          The results are thus much more simple on the hypothesis of two
       edects, one of these being independent of the residual gas, than on
       the hypothesis of only one effect.
           37. It was next endeavoured to ascertain whether these two
       effects were differently in<U+FB02>uenced by a blind.
          A linen blind was <U+FB01>rst used before the thin ebonite disk, which
       it cloaked during rotation, falling down afterwards.    During rota
       tion the blind did not appear to touch the disk.   A delicate galva
       nometer was used for this experiment ; and the time of vibration of
       the needle was 2 seconds. The rotation consisted of 30 turns of the
       handle in 40 seconds, as before.   The following result was obtained
       (each  number  representing  the mean of two observations) :_.
                                                                               Without blind.     With blind.

         Thus the proportion between the two e<U+FB01>ects is greatly altered
      by the blind ; for while the hydrogen e<U+FB01>ect is not much diminished,
      the other is reduced to little more than one half.
         38. A chamois-leather blind was next used, which lay close to
      the disk during rotation.     For all these experiments the time of
      vibration of the galvanometer-needle was 20 to 30 seconds, while
      the speed was the same as before.      Also the disk was tapped im
      mediately  after rotation, and  then again at the interval of one mi
      nute ; and in order to obtain as many individual results as possible,
      the mean of these two tappings has been taken in the following

and hence we <U+FB01>nd residual eifcct =31.
   From all these results, allowing for errors of experiment, we may
suppose that the residual eifect is not much altered by a chamois
leather blind.
   We ought to mention that the numbers of this article, similarly to
those of art. 38, represent the mean of two tappings, the one taken
immediately after rotation, and the other after the interval of one
minute.
   40. It was suggested to us by Prof. Helmholtz that it would be
desirable to ascertain whether any difference was produced in the
results by loading the disk on one side; for if these results were
due to vibration, it might be supposed that they would be a<U+FB01>ected
by this means.
   It will be seen by art. 39 that the residual effect obtained from
a disk covered with chamois leather is approximately the same as
that from an uncovered disk; this would appear to us to be against
the vibration hypothesis.
   In the following experiment the disk was covered with a chamois
leather blind with a segment cut out as underneath—
   A mean of two sets of experiments (consisting of 16 separate
observations, and embracing results immediately after rotation, as
well as results one minute after) gave as the result of tapping in
A with    1,30-
            dry hydrogen 47, while mean of 24 similar observations
                                   a
with the same atm0sphcre gave as the result of tapping an uncovered
disk 53. Allowing for errors of experiment, we may conclude that
this arrangement does not much in<U+FB02>uence the results.
   41. The disk was next treated in the following manner :—

              Heating of   a Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.                           225
      It was covered with a chamois leather blind tied into holes drilled
  in the disk, and having the above shape.                   The mean of 3 sets of
  experiments    similar  to those  in  art.    40, and     consisting of 18 separate
  observations, gave as follows for an atmosphere of 335 dry hydrogen,
  tapping in A 54, tapping in B 56, which two results are approxi—
  mately equal to one another, the mean being 55.
      The mean of 3 sets of experiments, consisting of 24 separate
  observations for an atmosphere of 331; hydrogen, but with an unco
  vered disk, gave 53 as the heat—result.                     All these experiments
  apparently    combine   to prove    that   the   result     is  not due to vibration.
      42. When the atmosphere was E35 hyd.+L-,6O- air, we also found
   A and B approximately the same, A giving 181 while B gave 182;
   we have therefore not hesitated to combine together the results of
  tapping in this atmosphere, Whether at A, or at B, or with an
   uncovered disk, in the comparison given in art. 38.
      43. Our next experiments were made with the view of testing
   whether or not the two e<U+FB01>ects, the residual and the gas—e<U+FB01>ect, were
   resident in the same particles of the disk; and for this purpose the
   experiments made immediately after rotation were compared with
   those made one minute afterwards.
      The experiments available for this purpose are so numerous that
   they can bear splitting into two portions, in each of which the same
   result is seen.
      Thus we have for an atmosphere of                    dry hydrogen, and as the
   mean of 30 individual comparisons,
          Eifect at <U+FB01>rst   :  E<U+FB01>ect one minute after               : :   1'30 :  1 ;
   also, as the mean of 22 individual comparisons, we obtain the pro—
   portion of 1'19 : 1, while as the mean of the whole We obtain
    1'25 : 1.
       Treating in a similar manner the observations made with an atmo
   sphere of       hyd.+-2§;; air, we obtain
         As the mean of 25 comparisons              . . . . . . . . . .       1'47   : 1,
         As the mean of 21 comparisons               . . . . . . . . . .      1'41   : 1,
   while as the mean of the whole we obtain 1'44 : 1.
       We therefore conclude that the residual e<U+FB02>ect is less diminished
   during the interval of one minute than the gas-effect.
       44. We next made experiments with two aluminium disks '05
   and “025 of an inch in thickness respectively.                        These disks were
    covered on both sides with a coating of lampblack applied by nega
   tive photographic varnish.
       In both disks we found that with a vacuum of E35 hyd. the effect
   one minute after rotation was greater than the e<U+FB01>ect immediately
   after rotation.     Thus we have :—

         In all the experiments with aluminium disks the needle of the
      galvanometer vibrated 20 times in 20 seconds, and the rotation
      consisted of 30 turns of the handle in 40 seconds.
         Without pretending to explain all these experiments       must,      *,    it
      we think, be concluded from them that there are two e<U+FB01>ects which
      are di<U+FB01>erently distributed over the particles of the disk.

      In the preceding experiments the centre of the pile was at dis                      a

      may be supposed to represent the gas-effect) are both diminished

      transference of the pile to       position nearer the centre of the disk.

      It would thus appear that the di<U+FB02>ierence in distribution among the
      particles of the two e<U+FB01>ects brought to light in art. 44 cannot be
      explained by difference from centre to rim, but would rather seem
                     a a
      to be due to difference in depth.         If this appear to be improbable,
    it   must be remembered that these experiments were not made on                                a
      naked metallic disk.      These experiments would therefore appear
      to show that in an aluminium disk covered with varnish, as well as
      in disk of ebonite, we may imagine the residual cfEcct to be more
         a
      deeply seated than the gas-e<U+FB01>ect.
         46. We venture on the following as what ap ears to us to be the
      most probable explanation of the whole bodyo experiments, inclu—
      ding those with radiation.
         (1) There    is   temporary heat or cold e<U+FB01>ect (art. 26) which
                           a
         * May not this peculiarity of the aluminium disk in the hydrogen vacuum
      be due to some       h   grometric surface-e<U+FB01>'ect resident in the varnish?          In   one
      experiment, but on   y    one, the peculiarity was absent.

          Healing of a Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.                   227
may be supposed to arise in particles very slightly attached to the
disk; this is radiated    01f chie<U+FB02>y during rotation, and probably does
not greatly aifect the disk afterwards.
    (2) There is a surface gas-eifect, which in an aluminium and
even in an ebonite disk is conducted into the interior as it arises,
so that it does not greatly radiate during rotation of the disk (art.
26).    In a paper disk, however, which is formed of a badly con
ducting material loosely put together, part of the e<U+FB01>ect does escape
as radiation during rotation (art. 27).
    (3) There is a residual e<U+FB01>ect, which is more deeply seated than
the gas—e<U+FB01>ect.        And inasmuch as radiation takes place from a
perceptible depth, this e<U+FB01>ect is much more in<U+FB02>uential than the gas
e<U+FB01>ect in increasing radiation after rotation.      In the case of a paper
disk, this deeply seated eEect will be less diminished by radiation
during rotation than the gas-e<U+FB01>ect, and therefore after rotation
in such a disk we might expect the gas-e<U+FB01>ect to be peculiarly small
(art. 35).
    47. In the course of these experiments we have endeavoured to
prove that this residual effect is not caused by vibration.          The ra
diation-experiments with aluminium disks of three diiferent thick
nesses went, on the other hand, to show that it was of the nature
of a surface—effect.     This is con<U+FB01>rmed by the results derived from
tapping; for, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the experiments of art. 45 show
that the two effects (the residual and the gas—e<U+FB01>ect) are probably
distributed in the same proportion, going from the centre to the
circumference of the disk.         Again, taking the two disks of thick
ness '05 and '025 of an inch, we obtain the following results :—
                          E<U+FB01>'ect for {is hyd.     Effect for 3%- hyd.+§"n- air.
Thin disk . . . . . . 48 (22 observations).       228 (10 observations).
Thick disk . . . . . . 29 (20 observations).       108 (10 observations).
    Now, allowing for errors of experiment, we see that the resi
dual, as well as the gas-effect, is reduced to about one half for the
thick disk.
    Again, an experiment of a similar nature gave the effect for
hyd. in an ebonite disk of JU in. in thickness =33, against aresult
 =55 for the thin ebonite disk. Unfortunately it was omitted to
make a comparison with these two disks for the gas-eifect; never
theless these results are all in favour of the residual effect being a
surface-e<U+FB01>ect.
    48. It might be well to make one remark regarding these experi
ments. They are not like the radiation-experiments, which required
an extremely delicate instrument in order to give a sensible effect.
But, on the other hand, the eifect obtained by tapping being that
due to the mere surface of the disk, is liable to be altered by any
thing which affects the surface of the disk, We have come to the
conclusion that in such experiments it is unadvisable to use a po—
rous hygrometric surface, such as that of paper, not having its pores
 <U+FB01>lled with paraf<U+FB01>n or some other similar substance. It is likewise
desirable that all parts of the apparatus should be as nearly as pos
sible of the same temperature ; indeed we suspect that some ex

228                              Royal Society.
periments made during some very peculiar summer weather were
in<U+FB01> uenced by a want of temperature-equilibrium between the various
parts of the apparatus, the result appearing to be that the gas
e<U+FB01>ect for the ebonite disk was abnormally large.
    49. Our conclusion from the evidence before us is, that the resi
dual e<U+FB01>ect is a surface-e<U+FB01>ect more deeply seated than the gas-e<U+FB01>ect,
 but distributed outwards from the centre to the circumference, very
 much in the same manner as the gas-effect. The residual effect
 likewise appears able to penetrate a chamois—leather blind without
 any perceptible diminution.    We regard these conclusions as pre
 liminary, and shall endeavour in our future experiments to procure
 additional evidence of these properties of the residual effect, as well
 as to obtain new facts regarding it.   In the mean time, as the sub
 ject is one of interest, and has been  already  too long delayed, we
 have not hesitated to bring these results before the notice of the
Royal Society.       ,

     The Diurnal Variations of the Wind and Barometric Pressure
     ‘.‘
at Bombay.”     By F. Chambers.
   The object of this paper       to bring to notice
                                      is                  remarkable

relation that has been found to exist between the diurnal variations

of the wind and the barometer at Bombay.
 , The observations made use of are the records of        Robinson’s
                                                             a
anemograph during the <U+FB01>rst three years of its performance, viz.
from June 1867 to May 1870, and the corresponding hourly ob—
servations of the barometer and the dry- and wet-bulb thermometer
made at the Government            Observatory, Bombay.
   The mean results for each hour of the day during the whole
period and the mean diurnal variations of each element are tabu
lated and graphically represented by <U+FB01>gures.  The diurnal variation
of the wind    then investigated, the most in<U+FB02>uential part of which
                is
is   attributed to the   land—    and sea-breezes   which blow from
and W.N.W., and are shown to follow mainly the             same law of
progression as the temperature of the air, thus a<U+FB01>ording con<U+FB01>rma
tory evidence of the truth of Halley’s theory of the trade-winds as
                                                                  - r
applied to land- and sea-breezes.
   Some peculiari Yes of the curve representing the land- and sea
breezes are then pointed out, and these, the writer concludes, are due
to the‘ superposition of another distinct variation having two maxima
and two 'minima in the twenty—four hours, like the barometer va—
riation; and he supports his views by a reference to the variation
of the east components of the wind in the months of July and
August, when the_land- and sea-breezes have almost disappeared.
This      found to exhibit
           is                decided double period.

ponents of the land— and sea-breezes are then approximately elimi
nated from the north components of the whole variation, and the

                            Geological  Society.                   229
 variation which then remains exhibits a very decided double period
 in this direction also. These variations with double periods are re
 garded as indicative of the existence of a double diurnal variation
 in the general movements of the atmosphere. Upon this hypo
 thesis typical diurnal variations of the wind are deduced for north
 and south low latitudes—that for north latitudes exhibiting a
  double diurnal right-handed rotation, and that for south latitudes
 a double diurnal left-handed rotation; and from these the diurnal
 variation of the barometer is deduced.
     The movements of the wind-vane at Bombay are then analyzed;
 and the writer concludes that the greater part of the excess of
 “ direct ” over “ retrograde ” rotation of the vane at Bombay is due
 to the diurnal variation of the Wind.
     Extracts are given from observations made at St. Helena, To
 ronto, and Falmouth, shewing the character of the diurnal wind?
  variations at those places, and their greater or less agreement
 with the deduced typical curves. The writer maintains that these
 variations aiford independently a possible, if not a probable, ex
  planation of that movement of the air which Dove had called‘the
  “Law of Gyration;” and, in conclusion, he points to the extent
 of their applicability in deducing weather probabilities, and to the
  method of discussing storms.
     A postscript is added, giving the mean diurnal variation of the
 wind at Sandwick Manse, Orkney, and pointing out its general
 conformity 'with the results deduced from the Bombay wind-obser—
  vations.

  Bryce,  M.A.,  LL.D., F.G.S.
     In this paper the author described numerous sections of Jurassic
  rocks exposed chie<U+FB02>y in the sea-cli<U+FB01>'s of Skye and Raasay, indicating
  the presence in those islands of a complete series of beds ascending
  from the Lower lies to the middle of the Middle Oolite.            He
  noticed the occurrence in these sections of fossils belonging to the
  zones of Ammonites angulatus and A. Bucklandi in the Lower Lies,
  to the zones of A. Jamesoni, A. capricornus, A. margaritatus, and
  A. spinatus in the Middle Lies, of Upper Lias fossils, including
  Ammonites communis, falcifer, heterophyllus, and bifrons, and of
  others indicating beds belonging to the Inferior Oolite and Corn
  brash and to the Oxford Clay. The Loch-Sta<U+FB02>in beds were described
  as an estuarine series, nearly approaching the Oxford Clay in geo
.logical age, and including a bed almost entirely made up of the
  shells of Ostrea hebiidica.
     The whole series of Jurassic rocks in these islands reposes 0n the
  Torridon sandstone of Cambrian age; and the author discussed the

qucstion whether or not the intervening beds have ever existed in
this locality, and came to the conclusion that they probably existed,
and have been swept away by denudation.                He remarked further
upon    the  resemblance    in lithological  characters of the beds described
to the corresponding deposits elsewhere in Britain.                The trap
rocks intruded between the Jurassic deposits he regarded as of post

probable origin of many of the more striking known boulders in
Westmoreland, Cumberland, Lancashire, Cheshire, and on the bor—
ders of Wales.        The northern boulders seem to have originated
chie<U+FB02>y from \Vastdale Crag, Cri<U+FB02>'el, Enncrdale, and Eskdale ; those
of Cheshire chie<U+FB02>y from the Lake district and south of Scotland;
and many of those on the Welsh borders from the mountains of
Wales.      Many of the boulders noticed by the author exhibit glacial
striaa.    The author also especially referred to the occurrence of
boulders at high levels.

Jurassic Deposits of the East Coast of Scotland.” By Thomas David
son,   Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    In   this note the author stated that four species of Brachiopoda
collected by Mr. Judd were especially worthy of notice, two of them
being quite new, and two new to Britain. Three of them were ob
tained from the equivalent of the Kimmeridge Clay, which was
the more remarkable as the Brachiopoda of that formation are
 comparatively few. The new species described were Rhynchonella.
Sutherlandi and Terebmtula Joassi, derived, with Terebratula hume
ralis, Rom, from the Upper Oolite of Garty in Sutherland; the
fourth species is Terebratula bisufarcinata, Schlot., from the Lower
Calcareous Grit of Braamberry Hill.            This note is intended to form

the Isthmus of Corinth.”             By Prof. D. T. Ansted, M.A., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
    After noting the    traces of volcanic action east of the Pindus chain,
the   author   described  the Solfataras and sulphur-deposits of the neigh
bourhood      of Kalamaki     as furnishing indications that there is even
now a real though subdued volcanic energy in this part of Europe.
 At. this place, about three miles east of the Isthmus of Corinth,
 there is a series of cream-coloured and grey gypseous marls, broken

         Mr.  J. Lucas  on the  Origin ofClay-Irenslone.           231
by narrow    gorges  and <U+FB01>ssures.    These marls, the strati<U+FB01>cation of
which is much disturbed,   are loaded with sulphur.    In the principal
gorge there are several lateral <U+FB01>ssures, forming caverns, communi—
cating with the interior by deep cracks; these caverns are com
pletely lined with crystals of sulphur and other volcanic minerals,
and are rendered inaccessible by the large body of hot sti<U+FB02>ing
vapours constantly emitted through them. The temperature of
this vapour, where it can be reached, is about 100° F.; but the <U+FB02>oor of
the caverns is too hot to stand on, even near the entrance. The
author is of opinion that the rocks in this gorge might be pro<U+FB01>tably
worked for sulphur.      Similar phenomena occur in several other
places within about a mile of the ravine described; and the author
was informed that this was the case also several miles further to
the east.
   The author adverted to other signs of volcanic action to the west
of these solfataras, and especially to the structure of the Acropolis
of ancient Corinth, and inferred that lines of volcanic action parallel
to the spurs of the Alps of which Etna and Vesuvius and Santorin
are the modern vents, ranged far to the north at no distant period.
   3.  “ On the Origin    of Clay-Ironstone.”     By  J. Lucas,   Esq.,
F.G.S.
   The author commenced by giving a general view of the varieties,
chemical composition, and mode of occurrence of Clay-ironstone, and
suggested that the formation of all the bedded varieties may be ex
plained by the supposition that they originated in peaty or non
peaty lagoons on the alluvial <U+FB02>ats of the deltas of the Carboniferous
formations, which would present semiterrestrial conditions—that is
to say, a surface exposed to the air, but subject to be covered by
<U+FB02>oods.    Carbonic acid (formed in the lagoons from decomposing
vegetable matter) meeting with protoxide of iron in solution, would
unite with it to form carbonate of iron, which, with the mud of
the lagoon, would produce Clay-ironstone.       Thus, in the author’s
opinion, the beds of Clay-ironstone, like Coal-beds, mark terrestrial
horizons.   The author supported his views by reference to various
sections, and also cited the occurrence of what he regarded as an

dendron gaspianum.”      By Principal Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   This note accompanied some photographs of the remains of plants
referred to, and was in opposition to the identi<U+FB01>cation of these re—
mains with the Lepz'dodendron      nothum, Unger, as proposed by Mr.
Carruthers in his Appendix to Mr. Daintree’s paper on the Geology
of Queensland. The author maintained that his Lepidodendron
guspianum is distinct from Unger’s species, although nearly allied
to it, and that his Leptophloeum rhombicum differs from both gene
rically and speci<U+FB01>cally. He tabulated as follows the characters of
his two species :—

Capt. F. W. Hutton, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of New
Zealand.
    In this paper the author gave a summary of the Tertiary and
later Secondary formations of New Zealand. He stated that he had
been able to determine 37 5 species of true Mollusca, 12 of Brachio
poda, and 18 of Echinodermata from the Tertiaries ; and under each
of the formations which he recognizes he gave the number of species
 of true Mollusca found in              it,
                               indicating the number of recent species
and of those belonging to other formations occurring in each.      He
also noticed the range and distribution of the various formations.
The Tertiary groups of strata distinguished by the author are, in de
scending order, as followsz—I. Pleistocene.        II. Pliocene:   the                   1,

 the name of the Waipara formation.          A species of Belemnitella
 occurs in beds belonging to the Ototara group, and also in the Wai
 para. formation.   Volcanic action commenced in the North Island
 during the deposition of the Waitewata group, and has since been
 almost continuous in the northern, western, and central parts of the
 island. In the South Island the volcanic formations appear to belong
 to the later Cretaceous,     Oligocene, and Miocene periods. The
 volcanic rocks of the Chatham Islands belong chie<U+FB02>y to the Upper
Oligocene.

    2. “ On the Tree Ferns of the Coal-measures, and their relations
to other living and fossil forms.”    By W. Carruthers, Esq., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
    After referring to the remarkably uniform character of the order
of Ferns throughout their whole history on the globe, the author
pointed out that there existed in the Coal-measures two very di
stinct kinds of fern-stems, each represented by several species. Both
of these were very different from the Chelepteris-group already de—
scribed by the author in the Journal of the Society. The <U+FB01>rst group
had a stem-structure like that of living tree ferns.      In them the
vascular elements of the stem formed a closed cylinder round the
pith; and the vascular bundles for the leaves were given off from
the out-turned edges of the cylinder, where, at regular intervals,
corresponding to the position of the leaves, narrow meshes occur for
this purpose. To this group were referred the stem described by
Lindley and Hutton as Caulopteris Phillipsii, and several hitherto
undescribed species from Radstock and Newcastle. No materials had
yet been detected which could throw any light on the foliage or fruit
of these fern-stems.     The second group included some stems the
casts of which the author had obtained from Radstoek, and the root
structures from Halifax. By the help of a <U+FB01>ne series of specimens in
the collections of the British Museum, he was able to correlate the
different parts of these plants.   The stems had been described by
Oorda under the name of Stemmatopteris.         They differed from the
other group chie<U+FB02>y in having the ends of the vascular plates, as seen
in the transverse section, turned inwards, and having the bundles of
the leaves formed in a complete condition in the axis of the stem.
The author showed that the relation of thezdi<U+FB01>'erent parts of the stem
in the species of Oaulopteris was the same as in a <U+FB01>rst year’s dicotyle
don, while in the latter group the analogy of the structures was
with the monocotyledonous stem. The roots, which surrounded the
older portions of the stem, formed the well—known genus Psaronius
of Cotta; and as this was the earlier name, it was proposed to retain
it for the genus.    There was associated with all the <U+FB01>ne specimens
of this group which he had received from J. M‘Murtrie, Esq., F.G.S.,
foliage which had been described as Cyatheites arborescens. Although
this had not been observed organically connected with the stems, the
 author adduced several reasons for believing that it belonged to
them. If this connexion could be established, it was of the greater
 importance, as this form was known in fruit, and the fruit esta
 blished that its af<U+FB01>nities were with the living Alsophilas and Cya
 theas.   Many species of this genus occurred in the continental coal
<U+FB01>elds ; but the author believed that all the specimens found in Eng
land, though di<U+FB01>'ering considerably amongst themselves, belonged to
a single species.

    In this paper, which accompanied a series of specimens presented
 to the Museum of the Society, the author described the section pre
 sented by the hills in the neighbourhood of Kazirun.      The general

  234                      Geological Society   :—
  surface was described as consisting of nearly unfossiliferous Post
 tertiary deposits, immediately beneath which is an unstrati<U+FB01>ed marine
  deposit containing a great abundance of fossils, among which are
  species of Ostrea, Pecten, and Cidaris (?).    Below this deposit is a
 succession of strata, repeated several times in the hills ; and at the
  bottom of the series in each case is a bed of gypsum.        The spaces
 between the recurrent series are <U+FB01>lled up with conglomerates. Be
 neath the gypseous series is a formation of compact limestone, which
 rises to a height of about 1500 feet both north and south of the
 plain of Kaziriin; its beds dip 25°, and their strike is from N.E. to
 S.W. The author mentioned the occurrence in a gypsum quarry
 near Kaziri‘in of three long cylinders from 6 to 10 feet in diameter,
 composed of the same material as the surrounding rock.            He also
 stated that he had examined several caverns in the neighbouring
 mountains, and also the great cave at Shahpoor, but without dis
 covering any organic remains.

     The following communications were read :—
     1. “ Lakes of the North-eastern Alps, and their bearing on the
 Glacier-erosion Theory.”     By the Rev. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.G.S.
     The purpose of this paper was to test, by the Lakes of the Salz
 kammergut and neighbourhood, the theory of the erosion of lake
 basins by glaciers, which has been advanced by Professor Ramsay.
 The author premised :—
    (1) That an extensive glacier could not exist without a consider
 able area to supply it.                      .                   -
    (2)  That  under  no  circumstances  could   a glacier excavate a cliff
 of considerable height (say 1000 feet) approximately vertical.
    (3) That owing to the proximity of the regions, a theory of ex
cavation which applied to the Western and Central Alps ought to be
 applicable also to the Eastern Alps.
    He then proceeded to examine a number of lakes in detail.
    The Ko'nigsee lies in a remarkably deep, steep-sided valley, ter
minated by a cirque, with cliffs full a thousand feet high, and has
no large supply-area behind.
    The Hallstadtersee is similarly situated, has a cirque at the
head, and two lateral valleys nearly at right angles to the lake, up
which arms of it have formerly extended. These are not likely to
have furnished glaciers which could have excavated the lake; and
above the cirque there is no large supply-area.
   The Gosauthal consists of lake-basins separated by valleys of river
erosion.
    The Fuschelsee and Wolfgangersee, on the south side of the
Schafberg, are separated by a narrow sharp ridge of hills, incapable
of nourishing glaciers large enough to grind them out; there are
no signs of glaciers from other directions having eroded them.
    The Mondsee and Attersee (once one lake) on the north lie
under the steep cliffs of the Schafberg, which could not have nou~
rished a large glacier; and the ridge of the Schafberg is too sharp

         Signor B. Gastaldi    on the E<U+FB02>'ects   of Glacier-erosion.     235
to admit    of the supposition that a great glacier, coming from the
south, has passed over it to excavate the lake; yet the Attersee,
in a position least favourable to glacial action, is the largest and
deepest lake in the Salzkammergut.          The head of the valley in
which these lakes lie is really among low hills, in the direction of
the Austro-Bavarian plain.
   The Traunsee was shown to give no evidence in favour of a theory
of glacial erosion.
    Since, then, these lakes either had at their heads preglacial cirques
(the very existence of which was incompatible with much erosive
power on the part of a glacier), or were beneath sharp and not
greatly elevated ridges of rock, the author concluded that they had
 not been excavated primarily by glaciers.
    He considered a far more probable explanation to be, that the
greater lake—basins were parts of ordinary valleys, excavated by rain
and rivers, the beds of which had undergone disturbances after the
 valley had assumed approximately its present contour. He showed
 that the lakes were in most cases maintained at their present level
 by drift,—and that while in a region so subject to slight disturbances
 as the Alps positive evidence for his theory would be almost impos—
 sible to obtain, no lake offered any against      it,
                                                    and one, the Konig
 see, was  very favourable  to it.
    2.   “ On the Effects of Glacier-erosion      in Alpine Valleys.”    By
Signor B. Gastaldi.
   The author described the occurrence in the valley of the Lanzo
and other Alpine valleys, at heights between 2000 and 3000 metres
(6700 and 10,000 feet), of large cirques,_in tWO of which, in the valley
Sauze de Césanne, the bottom was occupied in the autumn by gla
ciers reduced to their smallest dimensions.     The author noticed the
various rocks in which these cirques were cut, and expressed his
opinion that they are the beds formerly occupied by glaciers, the
power of which to excavate even comparatively hard rocks, such as
felspathic, amphibolite-, and chlorite-schists, he considered to be
p roved.
   The author then referred to the mouths of the Alpine valleys
opening upon the plain, which he described as being generally very
narrow in proportion to their length, width, and orographical im
portance    ;and he pointed out that in the case of the valley of the
Stura, at any rate, the outlet of the valley has been cut out by the
river.   This peculiarity he accounts for by the fact that whilst the
calcareous and felspathic rocks are easily disintegrated by atmo
spheric action, certain other rocks, such as the amphibolites, diorites,
syenites, amphibolitc-schists,    euphotides, serpentines, &c., resist
atmospheric denudation     ;and he indicated the peculiar distribution
of these rocks in the region under consideration, by reason of which
portions of them occupied the points which are now the mouths of
the valleys.

the distance between each two bright lines which can be recognized

  EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES ON NEWTON’S COLOURED RINGS.
                               BY P. DESAINS.
     The experimental veri<U+FB01>cation of the theory of N ewton’s rings
ordinarily consists only in measuring, under one or several inci
dences, the diameters of a certain number of those rings.         A good
micrometric screw permits the measurements to be made very con
veniently and withlmuch rigour. A screw can also be employed
for measuring directly the quantity by which the distance between

          the two glasses must be increased to force the ring of the order n
          to come and take the place of the central spot,\and that in the dif
          ferent prismatic colours.     According to the theory this quantity                                is
          equal to n times half the wave-length of the light employed.      The
          apparatus used by me, in the laboratory of instruction of the Faculty,
          to verify this point of the theory, was constructed with much care
          by M. Laurent-Duboscq.

              The rings are formed as usual, between a lens and a plane. The

in the dark.     This is particularly the case with hard siliceous
stones, such as rock-crystal, quartz, chalcedony, &c. The pheno
menon takes place both in air and under water.        But only the sur
face of the stones appears to phosphoresce.      For many years, how
ever.  I have known that under very powerful friction, such as can
only be produced by corresponding machinery, such stones become
throughout splendidly luminous with red light and at the same time
transparent.    This takes place at the agate-polishing establishments
at and near Oberstein and Idar in the Oldenburg principality of
Birkenfeld—on-the-Nahe.      It has not been expressly mentioned by
any writer on the agate industry of that region.         Cellini, who a
century ago described with great accuracy all the arrangements and
manipulations in operation there, just as they exist unaltered at the
present time, makes only the general remark that polishing agates
on the rapidly revolving grinding-stones produces “ <U+FB01>re and sparks.”
   On a recent visit, for a mineralogical purpose, to Oberstein and
Idar,  I made some observations on these phenomena, which          I will
here communicate.
   The establishment is situated on a water-course, which drives an
undershot water-wheel, the axle of which reaches into the room,
and here, by means of two cog-wheels, moves a horizontal shaft, on
which are four or <U+FB01>ve grindstones rotating vertically.       Over each
is brought a gutter so that a constant small stream of water pours
over the rotating stone and between it and the stone to be ground.
   The grindstones consist of very solid <U+FB01>ne-grained sandstone from
the Bunter formation, and are obtained in the neighbouring Rhenish
Palatinate.    They must be faultless throughout, without <U+FB02>aws,
clay—cells, and such like, as otherwise they are very likely to crack
with the rapid rotation.     There have been many instances, even
recently, of stones (which had unobserved defects) cracking when
in rotation, <U+FB02>ying asunder in fragments, killing the workmen, and
making great havoc in the work-room, even shattering the roof and
the walls.   The stones are from 5 to 5% feet in diameter, and 14
inches thick at the grinding-surface.    The average velocity is three
revolutions in a second, therefore 180 in a minute, or 10,800 in an
hour.     Hence the grinding-surface that passes over the object
pressed against it amounts to from 169,646 to 186,613 feet or from
7 t0 8 (German) geographical miles (28 to 32 English) per hour.
   When grinding, the workman lies with his belly and partially
his chest on a semicylindrically hollowed—out stool raised somewhat
obliquely in exactly the direction of the grindstone, his feet stretched
out behind and resting against a post <U+FB01>xed in the <U+FB02>oor.          In this
position he presses the stone to be polished, with both hands, <U+FB01>rmly
against the grindstone.     With his head a little raised he can see to
the placing of the object on the grindstone and to perform the en—
tire operation properly.    This position gives him the necessary pur
chase.    As the muscular exertion of the workman is very great,
the polishing is performed with intermissions, so that hours of work
alternate with equal times of rest mostly employed in the preli
minary operations.
   The further working of the agates (boring, colouring, polishing,

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                      239
&c.)    I omit to describe, as these manipulations do not touch my
                                   ’
purpose“.
     My experiments on the luminous phenomena in question were
performed in bright daylight at noon, the temperature of the air
being about 14° R.           I  had only one hour for them, and could
only make use of the few sorts of stone that were at hand.
     The phenomena       I  observed were essentially of two kinds.              As
soon as a stone of about the hardness of quartz was pressed against
the revolving grindstone, there was produced between them an in
tense red light, which at the same time radiated round the object
and emitted numerous sparks. This appearance was the same with
all hard stones.
      The second phenomenon occurred simultaneously with the other,
but only with translucent and transparent stones, not with com
pletely opaque ones. The stones of the former quality shine with
brilliant red light slightly yellow-tinged.             They appear almost like
red—hot iron; and it really looks as if the hands of the grinder must
be severely burned. All the stones tried became warm in grinding,
but not very hot; feeling them with my hand, estimated the in  I
crease of temperature at from 10° to 12° R.
      The stones on which        I  experimented in this way were the fol
 lowing :—
      Chalcedony of a yellowish grey colour, 8. little translucent, from
Uruguay, South America;              a piece 2 inches thick became magni<U+FB01>
cently <U+FB01>ery red, and therewith transparent.
      Ghalcedony, white and opalescent, said to be oriental; behaviour
 as in the preceding experiment.
      Chalcedony of a reddish colour, translucent, from Idar; gave the
 same result.
      Chrysoprase from Silesia; a thick piece, pale green, very
  slightly translucent at the edges, hardly useful as a jewel, gave a
  little red light.
      Rock-crystal, colourless, perfectly transparent, from Brazil. The
  luminous appearance was very magni<U+FB01>cent; but the <U+FB01>ery red, in
  comparison with the above experiments, was more subdued, almost
 rose-red.
      Rock-crystal, smoke-grey, transparent (the so-called smoky topaz),
 from the Swiss Alps. Pretty nearly the same result, only some
  what less beautiful.
      Carnelian of a beautiful red colour, intensely translucent, from
  India; gave the most magni<U+FB01>cent red light, as the colour of it was
  saturated with the natural colour of the carnelian.
    -
      Amethyst, crystals, intensely translucent, from Idar.                The light
  was pale violet, because here also the violet-blue colour of the stone
  blended with the <U+FB01>ery red of the light, beautifully transparent.
       Of perfectly opaque stones were tried red agate jasper from Idar,
  black lydite with thin White stripes of quartz, arti<U+FB01>cially black—
  coloured chalcedony from Uruguay, opaque heliotrope from India,

and, lastly, unweathered melaphyre from the Oberstein Railway Sta
tion. Within none of these stones was any light perceptible; only
the light on the ground surface remained constant.
    It deserves to be mentioned that J. H. Pl. Heinrich, as stated in
his copious work on phosphorescenm‘, has made similar observa
tions with far inferior appliances.          For his experiments (which
were all made in the dark) he employed an ordinary grindstone of
14% inches diameter, turned by hand, and making two revolutions
in a second.      The extent of surface, therefore, which in one second
passed over the object applied to the grindstone was only 7 feet
7 inches, while in the agate-grindery it was from 47 feet 1 inch to
51 feet 10 inches.         He thereby caused onyx, carnelian, chalcedony,
rock-crystal, &c. to shine with <U+FB01>ery red light.         He does not state,
however, whether the shining was only super<U+FB01>cial, 0r penetrated to
the interior of the stones ; and just as little does he say that under
grinding they appear transparent.           On the contrary, he says that
the light is not so bright as when two stones of the same sort are
rubbed against one another.         Hence the light obtained by him can
only have been very faint.         He alleges, however, that a luminous
arc appeared round the circumference of the grindstone.            This  I
have not seen; and it is perhaps only to be observed in the dark.
    If we inquire after the fundamental causes of the phenomenon
 of the illumination of the grinding surface, these may well be no
 other than the combination of friction and the development of elec—
tricity, of which the rise of temperature of the stone is a necessary
consequence. The red halo round the stone which is being ground,
and the scattering of sparks, can only arise from the illuminated
 particles separated from the two stones by the friction.
     The second phenomenon, the magni<U+FB01>cent <U+FB01>ery red illumination
 of the stone, seems to be a mere consequence of the radiation of the
light through from the surface of contact of the stone to be ground
 and the grindstone, although transparent and merely translucent
 stones of 5 0r 6 inches length are perfectly alike in di<U+FB01>using the
<U+FB01>ery red light.       Hence also no light can be produced in completely
 opaque stones.
     I  was not able to make closer investigations.     Much more might
 be said in respect of my experiments from the physical point of
 view.     In the <U+FB01>rst place, immediately after the grinding of the
 stones, electroscopic experiments and trials of their increase of tem
 perature might be made ; also spectral analysis of the light would
 be of importance ; lastly, my investigations should be supplemented

 by such with many other kinds of stone.
     The intention of this publication of my experiments is substan
 tially this—to call attention to the singular opportunity offered by
 the numerous agate-'grinderies of Oberstein and Idar for the pur
 pose in question, and to invite physicists to further investigations
 in these localities.       I know not, being in my eightieth year, if    I
 am destined to be able to complete my experiments.—Poggendorif’s

      SHALL       send you by this mail the advance sheets of a paper
      of mine to be published in our Academy Proceedings, giving
 an account of some new observations, which                 I  am sure will
 greatly interest you.        The mineralogical details of the paper
 will not probably appeal to you; but they also have importance
 as bearing on the optical question.          You will <U+FB01>nd that      I have
 succeeded in constructing       uniaxial  crystals  of the  hexagonal type
 from rhombic crystals of 60° and 120° angle, and havealso been
 able to show that, in some cases at least, hexagonal crystals are
 so constructed in nature.        You will <U+FB01>nd, further, that I have
 been able to reproduce the optical conditions of a quartz crystal,
and in such a way as to be able to point out the mode of mole
cular structure by which the result is produced.                It would be
 unnecessary     to  recapitulate   these   points,  which    you will <U+FB01>nd
fully stated   in   my paper,   were   it  not  that you might otherwise
 be repelled by the mineralogical crust with which the optical
results are necessarily enclosed.

    In order that you may have the evidence on which my con
clusions rest, I send several specimens :—
    1. A plate of magnesian mica (phlogopite) from Jefferson Co.,
New York, with optical angle of about 14°.
    2. Macle of the same, showing planes of optical axes inclined
to each other, on different parts of the plate, at an angle of 60°,
and also showing variation of optical angle in passing from one
part of the plate to the other.
    3. Compound plate essentially uniaxial, made by splitting
plate like No. 1 and piling up the laminae in alternating posi
 tions at angles of 60°.
    4. Plate of Muscovite mica with optical angle between 60°
and 70°.
    5. Compound plate showing left-handed circular polarization,
formed from last by piling thin laminae (Tl-5 of an inch about)
in left-handed spirals.
    6. Compound plate showing right-handed circular polariza
tion, formed from <U+FB01>lms of the same mica as 4 by piling in
right-handed spirals.     By placing 6 on 5 (point marked a on a)
with the edges of the glass of 6 parallel with the pencil lines
on 5, you will see, in certain azimuths with the plane of polari_
zation, the Airy spirals beautifully reproduced.
    I am sorry that the last two specimens (by far the most inter
esting) are not more perfect.    Neither of them presents constant
features at different azimuths with the plane of polarization;
but No. 5 is more perfect than No. 6 ; and a comparison of the
two will show how     I have approximated to the perfect result in
               I
proportion as have succeeded in making the laminae at the same
time suf<U+FB01>ciently thin and of uniform thickness.       Plates as good
as No. 5 can be readily prepared; but to do better than this,
except by accident, involves selecting the laminae by actual mea
 surement with a spherometer ; and since the laminae must also
 be taken from one and the same piece of mica and cut in parallel
positions, you can easily see that, even after succeeding in cleav
ing the mica into suf<U+FB01>ciently thin <U+FB01>lms, you may work for many
days before securing at least twelve laminae from the same <U+FB01>lm
of uniform thickness.     These specimens, however, will illustrate
my paper, if not by what they are in themselves, at least by that
to which they point and closely approach.          My observations
were made with a polarizing microscope designed by Des Cloizeaux
and made by Soleil. The object is illuminated by a very strongly
converging beam» of polarized light ,- and the instrument brings
into the <U+FB01>eld at once the two hyperbolas of a plate of topaz with
an optical angle of over 80°.     An instrument, however, which

                    expelled.   Moreover, although the loss of basic
 water may greatly alter the external aspect of the body, yet there
is  not the same complete breaking up of the structure as before.
 To illustrate these points,          only necessary to refer to the
                                       it    is
 well-known reactions of the common rhombic sodic phosphate
when heated.
    It generally believed that the water of crystallization exists

 as such in the salt, the molecules of water forming        part of the
                                                                     a
 structure of the crystals; and the facts to be presented in this
paper tend to support this view.          But our modern theories
 assume that the so-called water of constitution, which may be
 also driven o<U+FB02>' when the salt         su<U+FB02>iciently heated,
                                             is                 formed    is
 under the in<U+FB02>uence of the heat from the atoms of hydroxyl,
 H-O-, which are united to the acid radical of the compound.
 But in every simple salt, whatever may be our theories in regard
 to the mode of combination, the weight of the water of constitu
 tion, as well as that of the water of crystallization, must bear to
 the weight of the salt      de<U+FB01>nite proportion, which can easily be
                                 a
calculated from the symbol; and the ratio between the amount
 of hydrogen and the amounts of the other radicals must be that
 of the atomic weights of these radicals or of their multiples. In
 any given class of salts, moreover, in which the ratio between
 the atomicity of the basic and acid radicals has constant value,
                                                              a
 all hydrogen which represents water of constitution will sup
 plement the other basic radicals, and added to them will com-
 plete the relative amount of basic radical which the given class
 of salts require; while the hydrogen which represents water of
 crystallization will be in excess of that amount.
     In mineral silicates these relations are complicated           the        by
 phenomena of isomorphous replacements; and although there
 may be some question in regard to the replacing capacity of hy
 drogen, we cannot expect the same constancy, in the amount of
 water of constitution which these minerals contain, as in the
 case of simple salts.      The amount of water of crystallization,
 however, must be as invariable in one case as in the other, and
 the hydrogen must bear the same relations to the atomic ratio
of the compound.        Thus,     the mineral
                                     if            an orthosilicate, in
                                                         is
 which the atomic ratio between the sum          the basic radicals and
~the silicon is    1 : all hydrogen in excess of the amount which

this ratio requires must represent water of crystallization, while
all required to complete the ratio must represent water of con
stitution; and we thus have a means of distinguishing between
these two states of combination where the class of compounds
to which the mineral belongs is known.
   Now it is true of each of the minerals we have distinguished
among the vermiculites,—
   First. That the water is driven off at a temperature below a
red heat.
    Secondly. That the loss of the water is attended with a com
plete disintegration of the mineral.
    Thirdly. That the amount of the basic radicals, exclusive of
the hydrogen, is suf<U+FB01>cient to saturate the silicon, and that the
amount of hydrogen is wholly in excess of the amount which the
atomic ratio 1 : 1 requires.
    Could it be proved that the vermiculites are orthosilicates, the
last of the three facts just stated would be alone su<U+FB02>icient to
establish the correctness of our conclusion.        Unfortunately such
absolute proof cannot be obtained ; and we only claim that the
crystallographic and chemical relations of the vermiculites to
each other, and to the magnesian micas, give a very high degree
'of probability to our theory that they are orthosilicates.
    From these facts we have concluded that the water which
enters into the composition of the vermiculites is water of crys
tallization. For the evidence of the facts, we refer to the descrip
tions of the several species given below.        But, further, in order
to justify our conclusion, we propose to bring into comparison
with the vermiculites a class of hydrous micas from which the
water obtained is clearly water of constitution ; and this class of
 minerals we shall describe <U+FB01>rst.               '
    Damourite.——Delesse originally gave this name to a hydrous
mica which occurs in <U+FB01>ne scales in Pontivy in Brittany.            Since
then micas of similar composition have been observed in several
 countries, and shown to be not unusual constituents of granitic
 rocks*.    Among these we may distinguish several varieties (or
 species ?),  marked    by slight differences of composition and op
tical characters.      But we would propose to give the name
 Damourite to the whole class, distinguishing the varieties by
 separate names only so far as may be thought necessary. Under
 the family of Damourites, then, we class- all unisilicate micas,
 which are chie<U+FB02>y silicates of aluminium and potassium, but in
 which a   portion of the alkaline radical     is

         Of the two analyses of Damourite, No. 1 is by Delesse, of the
      mineral found in the gangue of cyanite, at Pontivy in Brittany,
      and No. 2 is by Igelstrom, of the similar mineral found at
      Horrsjoberg, Wermland.                The analysis of Sterlingite was made
     by Mr. C. E. Munroe,              Assistant    in the Chemical Laboratory of

 Harvard College; and the above numbers have been abundantly
 con<U+FB01>rmed in repeated analyses by various students in the same
laboratory.   The alkalies were treated by Smith’s process; and
the potassium was weighed as PtKez 01“.      This value, compared
 with the total weight of the alkaline chlorides and that of the
chlorine, also determined, showed that the alkali in the mineral
was almost wholly potash, although the preence of lithium and
sodium was plainly indicated by the spectroscope.        The water
was determined by igniting the mineral in coarse powder, pre
viously dried at 100° C. Even after ignition the <U+FB01>nely pulverized
mineral'is only partially decomposed by hydrochloric acid ; and
in the above analysis it was decomposed by fusion with sodic car
bonate. The usual tests failed to indicate the presence of <U+FB02>uorine.
   Regarding the water as basic, and as forming apart of the
protoxides, the atomic ratio in Sterlingite between the silicon,
the sesquioxide radicals, and the protoxide radicals, is
         1V       v1       1]
         Si   :   R : R=23'40                  :   18    :    6'45, or nearly 4   :   3   :   1.
The deviation from the simple ratio will not appear so great as
seems at  <U+FB01>rst sight, if it be noticed that a difference of one half
per cent. in the amount of water would make the ratio almost
exact.
    The corresponding ratio in the Damourite from Wermland is
         2315          :   17'78      :   6'41, or,           as before, nearly   4       :3   :   1.
These ratios point to the general formula

   The Damourite and Sterlingite are types of very large class               a
of hydrous micas, which in many places are widely distributed
through the granitic reeks.    This class of minerals has been
especially investigated                   by
                         Professor Haughton, of Dublin, whose
papers may be found in Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. ix. p. 272, and
Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xviii. p. 403, also vol. xx. 268.                                     p.

bable that there are two varieties of anhydrous mica, containing
an excess of SiO’, which,                          by

saturate the excess of the acid radical, are reduced to one or the
other of the two normal types.       In     previous paper (Amer.       a
Journ. Sci. (1L) vol. xii. p. 217, 1867) the author suggested
the idea that the excess of silica in this class of micas might
result from mixture of two isomorphous species corresponding
                    a
to the two hydrates,
                              HEO‘ESi                 and     H9=OQ=SiO;
and he there    described     mica whose atomic ratio was very
                                               a
closely that of the second type, and which he called Cryophyl
lite. Now the simplest theory of the relation of the hydrous to
the anhydrous Muscovites would seem to be that, while in the
molecules of the anhydrous micas        portion of the silicon atoms

graphic formulae which follow indicate more clearly than any
other language can, the relations we have attempted to describe.

   The new mineral Sterlingite, whose examination has been the
occasion of this discussion, is remarkable as being a very We'll
de<U+FB01>ned example of a hydrous mica occurring in large crystals,
and exhibiting very marked characters.                  It does not materially
differ in composition from Damourite; and it also agrees with
the specimens of this mineral so closely in other physical quali
ties that we cannot regard the small optical angle, observed by
Des Cloizeaux on the minute scales of the Pontivy mica, as suf<U+FB01>
cient ground for separating the new mineral from the old species.
We should include under this species all hydrous micas which
are rendered by the basic hydrogen orthosilicates 3 and to it the
name Damourite belongs by priority.                    Sterlingite is simply a
variety  of Damourite,     having the    ratio    1 : 3  : 4, with more marked
qualities and    a  wider optical angle       than      the   Pontivy mineral ,
and, provisionally, the name       I  have given will be useful in de
signating it.
    The hydrous micas, of which Sterlingite is a variety, have a
 special interest in connexion with the subject of this paper, he

   The crystals of e<U+FB01>'erisite cleave like mica, affording thin but
                        J

 by  lines crossing at angles of 60° and 120°.        In some cases
there   is  jointing as in crystals of mica, parallel to the shorter

  1' Since the above was written, we have received from Dr. F. A. Genth
his very valuable paper on corundum and its associated minerals.           He
regards Damourite as one of the most important products of the alteration
of corundum, and gives large number of analyses of specimens from dif

in this paper, even more markedly than the analyses cited above. The
Damourites are evidently widely distributed minerals and characteristic

the plates become opaque at a very moderate thickness; and for
this reason it is impossible to measure the angle with great pre
cision. Some of the plates are apparently uniaxial; but this
may result from the blending of the two hyperbolas, due to the
thinness of the plate.         The dispersion of the axes is but slight,

     A comparison of the results given in (2) and (3) will show
 that the anhydrous Je<U+FB02>'erisite corresponds very closely in its
 chemical constitution with the Biotite mica from Pargas.                      The
 chief difference is to be found in the fact that the mica contains

potassium and basic hydrogen in place of more than one half
of the magnesium of the Je<U+FB01>'erisite.       It should, however, be re
membered in this connexion that the Biotites present a very wide
variation in the ratio between the amounts of the protoxide and
sesquioxide radicals which the various varieties contain.        The
limits usually assigned to this variation correspond to the ratios
           ll VI                       II VI
           R:R:Si=1:2:3,          and  R:R:Si=1:1:2;
and the Pargas mica, with the ratio 2 : 3 : 5, falls between these
limits; but the Culsagce variety of vermiculite corresponds to
the more common class of Biotites, which have the ratio 1 : 1 :2.
    But this resemblance in chemical constitution only appears

when we compare the Biotite mica with the anhydrous e<U+FB01>'erisite ;
while it is the crystallized hydrous Je<U+FB01>'erisite which so closely
resembles the magnesian micas in its crystallographic relations;
and the question now arises, What is the condition of the large
amount of water (12% per cent.) which the crystallized mineral
contains ?
    To aid us in forming a conclusion on this point, we have the
following evidence :—
    First. As the above analysis shows, the water is united in de
<U+FB01>nite and atomic proportions amounting to six molecules to every
<U+FB01>ve molecules of silicon in the molecules of the mineral—that is,
su<U+FB02>icient to convert all the silicon into a hydrate, assuming that
the <U+FB01>ve silicon atoms in this hydrate are joined to each other by
the smallest possible number of bonds.
    Secondly. While both the crystallographic and the chemical
relations of Jetferisite to the other vermiculites, and to the mag
nesian micas, indicate that the mineral is an orthosilicate, the
amount of basic radical, exclusive of the water, is amply suf<U+FB01>
cient to saturate the atomicity of the silicon.
    Thirdly. It was observed by Professor Brush (and his obser
vations have been fully con<U+FB01>rmed by ourselves) that the water
is given off at a comparatively low temperature—about 300° C. ;
and, as every mineralogist knows, this dehydration is attended
 with that remarkable exfoliation which is characteristic of the
vermiculites, and indicates a complete disintegration of the mo
lecular structure.     This exfoliation is wholly different from the
phenomena which the so-called hydrous micas present under
like conditions. In these last (which, as we suppose, contain
hydrogen as a part of the basic radical of their molecules) avery
high temperature is required to expel the water, and the loss is
attended by no such marked change of volume and disintegration.
    The conclusion that we draw from these facts is that the com
bined water is in the same condition in Jefferisite as in the zeo
lites and in many crystallized salts—a condition which has

                        Prof.    J.   P. Cooke   on the Vermiculites.                        255
    long been known in chemistry as water of crystallization. We
    shall not here attempt to discuss what are the relations of the
    water thus combined to the molecular structure of the mineral.
    This question is still in suspense, and we are persuaded that our
    science is not yet in a condition to solve the problem.               All that
    we can at present do is to classify the phenomena presented by
    the exfoliation of the vermiculite minerals with the e<U+FB01>lorescence
    of Glauber’s salt or the intumescence of alum.

        If, then, am justi<U+FB01>ed in the inferences have drawn, Jeffer
    isite differs chemically from Biotite mica chie<U+FB02>y in containing
     water of crystallization,'very much in the same way that gypsum
     differs from anhydrite, or common salt from the crystals with
     two molecules of water which form in brine at a low tempera
     ture.    In these bodies, however, the forms of the crystals of the
                                                                                                   '

    in North Carolina are very similar to those in Pennsylvania.

256               Prof.   J.   P. Cooke   on the Vennulites.
Professor    J.   Lawrence Smith, in his recent article        in Amer.
Journ. Sci. (III.) vol. vi. p. 180, says that “in the development
in North Carolina the corundum” (with which the vermiculite
is associated) “ occurs in chrysolite or serpentine rocks, and out
side of serpentine it has not been found. These chrysolite rocks
belong to a regular system of dikes which have been traversed
for the distance of about one hundred and ninety miles. This
system of dikes lies on the north-west side of the Blue Ridge,
and has a strike parallel to the main mass of the ridge, and has
an average distance from the summit of the ridge of about ten
miles.    The serpentine appears at intervals along this whole
line of one hundred and ninety miles,” and “is usually enclosed
in a hard crystalline gneiss.”     In the serpentine the corundum
has been found at several localities along a distance of forty
 miles. Colonel Jenks writes me :——“ The workmen have opened
a new vein they call the gem vein.      It is walled with chrysolite ;
and the <U+FB01>ssure is from one to four feet wide, which <U+FB01>ssure is
<U+FB01>lled with ripidolite ; and in this the corundum crystals are im
bedded.” As regards the association of the ripidolite and ver
miculite, he also write :—“ They occur both alone and inter
mingled, and also in layers, like the leave of a book.”       Again,
“The ripidolite maintains a uniform character of texture and
appearance, whether associated with the vermiculite or alone.
                                               I
In the vein at the bottom of the shaft have spoken of, and else
where, it is of uniform hardness, texture, &c. ; but in it the co
rundum seems to have lost cohesion—in some localities falling
to pieces, and crumbling out of the ripidolite matrix.     But when
exposed   to the  air and sunshine  for a day  or two, the corundum
regains its cohesion, and you can then chip off the ripidolite
from it. It is just the opposite with the vermiculite when alone
the matrix.      Sometimes it occurs in masses several feet long,
formed of scales as large as your hand, easily separating like
mica from the corundum, which in this matrix always seems to
retain its cohesion.     Then, again, the vermiculite will occur in
masses of many bushels, all broken up and disintegrated, like
very coarse bran, in which the crystals of corundum lie like eggs
in a box of sawdust.      The great crystal (weighing 316 pounds)
was thus deposited.      At other places the entire mass seems to
have changed to the colour of white Castile soap, with specks of
green in      the corundum crystals all falling apart until exposed,
            it,
when they harden.”        This untechnical language of an unpro
fessional but accurate observer conveys        very vivid idea of the
                                                   a
mode of association of these minerals.      The specimens so kindly
sent me     byColonel Jenks con<U+FB01>rmed in all respects his observa
tions.   In several cases the corundum was still imbedded in both
the~ripidolite and the vermiculite and the scales of these minerals

not nnfrequently penetrated the corundum crystals in such a
way as to indicate that the corundum had crystallized around
them.       The ripidolite is <U+FB01>rm in texture, and closely resembles
the variety from West Chester.             It occurs in hexagonal plates,
which have a striation similar to that I formerly described as
characteristic of the Pennsylvania specimens (Amer. Journ. Sci.
(IL) vol. xliv. p. 201, 1867), and which is illustrated by <U+FB01>g. 7.
Professor Smith (lac. cit.) gives analyses of two varieties of ripi
dolite (one compact, the other friable) as follows :—

    A determination of the silica in the compact mineral, made by
Mr. F. Gooch, student in the laboratory of Harvard College,
gave    2725 per cent. of SiOQ, and 1193 H2 O,           as the mean of two
closely agreeing       determinations.      But  in the  specimens sent me
by   Colonel    Jenks   I   did not  recognize  the friable  variety.
    The vermiculite occurs in close contact with the ripidolite,
 and is frequently interlaminated with it ; but the two are always
perfectly distinct, thus entirely disproving the theory that the
 vermiculite was derived from the ripidolite by weathering.                 It
 occurs in large plates having more or less of an hexagonal out
 line.                                                 J
           Some of those received from Colonel enks were 5 inches
 in diameter.       It has a greenish-yellow colour, which is very
 much lighter than that of the West-Chester variety.               The plates
 are strongly marked by lines crossing at angles of 60° and 120°,
 like those from West Chester; but these lines are more marked
 in the North—Carolina variety.           This variety is also much more
 friable   than  the   other,   and   readily breaks in directions parallel
 to these lines, yielding rhombic plates with angles of 120° and
 60°, and, more readily, hexagonal or triangular plates, produced
 by the truncation of the 60° angle of the rhombic plate, on a
 line parallel to the shorter diagonal of the fundamental rhomb.
 The plates most readily break parallel to this diagonal, and, like
 the specimens fromWest Chester, are frequently jointed in this di
 rection. Like other micaceous minerals, the plates cleave readily
 parallel to the basal plane, yielding very thin lamina, exceedingly
 <U+FB02>exible, but not elastic.        The optical characters are the same as
 those of the West-Chester variety,—strong negative double re

fraction yielding a biaxial ring system, with uniform distribution
of colours, and very variable optical angle.         I   have measured
angles from about 30° to about 13°.            The angle often varies
widely in different parts of the same plate. Thus           I  have mea~
sured on different laminae, from a single plate not exceeding 3
inches in diameter, the three angles 30°, 24°, and 13°; and,
again,    I have noticed a similar variation on one and the same
 lamina. Indeed the phenomena which            I observed were almost
 identical with those I had previously observed on plates of ripi
 dolite from Texas, Pennsylvania (lac. cit.). On moving the lamina
just referred to parallel to itself, in front of the polarizing micro
 scope, the optical angle varied as I passed from one side of the
 <U+FB01>eld to the other.      Beginning with a value of about 30°, the
 angle   decreased  to  about  13°.   Moving the plate still further,      I
 found a region of indistinctness ; and then the axes Opened again,
 the new plane making an angle of 120° with the old.            I  had evi'
  dently here a macling precisely similar to that I had previously
  described in the Texas ripidolite, and shown in <U+FB01>g. 8, where the
  lines of shading represent the position of the plane of the optical
  axes.    This represents what we may call an ideal macle ; for           I
  have seldom been able to trace more than three individuals on
  the same plate, and, as a rule, these are very unequally developed.
  On many of the specimens of the North-Carolina vermiculite,
  the macling is externally marked by the eminent cleavage or
 jointing parallel to the shorter diagonal of the rhomb section ;
  and in several of the specimens 1 have examined it was quite
  symmetrical. A study of these specimens led me to an expla
  nation of the cause of the remarkable variation of the optical
  angle, which   I believe not only applies to the vermiculites and
  ripidolites, but  also, in many cases at least, to the micas.           It
  would be expected that the several members of such macles as
  <U+FB01>g. 8 represents would penetrate each other; and            I   therefore
  made a series of experiments to ascertain what would be the
  effect of the interfoliation of laminae in which the planes of the
  two sets of optical axes had the same relative position as in the
  several members of the macle.          To that end   I divided a plate,
  which presented the largest optical angle I had observed, into
  as thin lamina: as possible, and then superimposed them in the
  relative position  I  have mentioned, so that the planes of the op
  tical axes should be inclined at an angle of 60°.        The result was
   (when   the thickness   of  the  plates in each position was nearly
  equal) that a symmetrical ring system was obtained in which the
  optical angle was about 13°-—the smallest I had measured; and
  by varying the relative thickness, intermediate degrees of optical
  divergence were produced.         By now introducing laminae into
  the compound crystal in the position of the third member of the

  of a parallel  ruler into strips, and from these strips cut out the
  hexagonal laminae by means of a steel pattern carefully made.
  The thin mica can be cut with perfect accuracy by a sharp knife
  on a plate of glass.         The hexagonal laminae thus obtained,
  though coming      from  different  parts of the mica plate, were opti
  cally parallel to each other; and by drawing at the outset a line
  with a sharp point near the corresponding edges of the several
  strips, this line serVed as a guide for placing the hexagonal
  laminae.    From laminae thus prepared, plates were made showing
  the familiar system of rings as perfectly as could be expected.
  The best results were obtained with plates consisting of from
  twelve to twenty-four laminae ; and the character of the resulting
  plate, whether left- or right-handed, was found to depend on the
  order of the spiral arrangement.         If in building up the pile the
  marked side of each successive lamina is turned through an
  angle of 60° in the direction of the motion of the hands of a
  watch, the result corresponds to left-handed quartz if turned in
 the reverse direction to right handed ; and on superposing two
 dissimilar plates thus prepared 1 obtained again the spirals of
 Airy in great perfection.        Thus, then, it appears that, even with
 micas of the widest optical angle, we can build up a structure
 which is optically uniaxial*.
    * The great dif<U+FB01>culty in preparing these plates is to obtain thin <U+FB01>lms of
 mica of uniform thickness which are of suf<U+FB01>cient size to yield a dozen or
 more laminae; and the more nearly we have succeeded in preparing such a
 <U+FB01>lm by splitting sheets of mica, the more closely we have been able to
 imitate the phenomena seen under like conditions with a plate of quartz.
 We have been able to work with <U+FB01>lms which measured with a spherometer
 only rh- of an inch in thickness, and have not obtained good results with
those which were much thicker; and when thinner than this the mica cannot
readily be cut into shape. The least inequality in the thickness of the
several lamina: composing the same plate more or less mars the effect; and
although some of the striking features seen with quartz may remain, such
as the succession of colours on revolving the analyzer, and even the spirals
of Airy, yet the more delicate phases of the phenomena disappear. The
plate changes colour when revolved in its own plane, the rings lose their
circular form and become confused, and the violet cross disappears. More
over, as regards the conditions which determine the phase of the circular
polarization, the law stated above can only be af<U+FB01>rmed with certainty of
plates consisting of laminae which very nearly ful<U+FB01>l the conditions we have

and made it at <U+FB01>rt dif<U+FB01>cu t to discover the law.      Our experiments have
been a series of approximations;    and although we may never be able with
our rude appliances to compete with nature in the manufacture of uniaxial
crystals, yet we have approached so near to the perfect result as to be able
to point out with con<U+FB01>dence one way at least by which the effects seen in
natural crystals may be produced.     We have usually cut the laminae into
regular hexagons ; but equilateral triangles might more easily be cut, and
would probably give as good results; for although the errors of position
might not be so well distributed, we have found that a slight variation in

    The theory which I have formed to account for these facts is
as follows.     We may conceive that the molecule of mica is an
ellipsoid, whose elliptical section, through the longer axis, can
be inscribed in the rhomb of 60° and 120°.               Assume now that
these molecules have polarity, the rhombic prism would be the
normal result of their association, as represented in <U+FB01>g. 9. We
may, however, conceive that three of these molecules may become
associated by alternate single poles to form a nucleus, such as
represented in <U+FB01>g. 10.         Such a group once formed would be in
a condition of great stability, resulting from the concurrent
action of the several poles; and if now each of the molecules
developed into a crystal, the result would be a. macle of a form
which is very common in the mineral kingdom. If six molecules
 united in a similar way to form a nucleus, as in <U+FB01>g. 11, we should
also have stable equilibrium (although less <U+FB01>rm than before),
and the result of a symmetrical development would be a macle
such as has been represented in <U+FB01>gs. 7 and 8.                 Whether this
more complex arrangement is necessary in order to explain the
phenomena presented by the vermiculites and micas                  I do not
feel con<U+FB01>dent.       It is seldom that more than three individuals
can be distinguished on a given plate; and the very unequal
 development of the several individuals and the inde<U+FB01>niteness of
the lines of demarcation, resulting from the phenomena which
have been described, render what would seem to be a character
istic feature of the more complex group not necessarily a certain
 indication of the structure. I refer to the fact very constantly
 noticed, that the plane of the optical axes is parallel to the
nearest hexagonal edge, as shown in <U+FB01>gs. 7 and 8.                In <U+FB01>gs. 10
and 11 this same plane is parallel to the shorter axis of the
ellipse ; and it can easily be seen that, if either of the individuals
of <U+FB01>g. 10 were developed over any large portion of the space of
its neighbours, the optical plane might appear parallel to the
adjacent edge.
    Having made the two suppositions as above to explain the
phenomena of twinning, which have been long familiar and ex
ternally visible, it will not, we trust, appear unreasonable if we
 make a third supposition-to explain the phenomena <U+FB01>rst described
in this paper. We may conceive that, the ellipsoidal molecules,
instead of grouping together on the same plane, become asso
ciated by their alternate poles, one over the other, as represented
in <U+FB01>g. 12. Molecules so associated, developing laterally, would
the relative position of the laminae injures the result to a far less degree
than the least inequality in their thickness.  It still remains to make care
ful quantitative measurements of the effects produced under determinate
conditions; and, as can easily be seen, the subject opens a wide <U+FB01>eld for
mathematical analysis as well as physical investigation.

which we have placed them in our arti<U+FB01>cial crystals, with only
this difference, that the laminae would be inde<U+FB01>nitely thin and
in exact pesition; and the effect of such compound molecules
in modifying the elasticity of the crystalline structure must be,
In most respects at least, like that of single molecules symme
trical on all sides of one line or axis; in other words, they must
produce a structure similar to that of uniaxial crystals.       Under
what further conditions the grouping of the molecules, in right
or left-handed spirals, determines the phenomena of right- or
left-handed circular polarization, and what bearing the new facts
may have on the received theory of these phenomena as they
appear in quartz, must be left for further analysis to discuss.
    I pass next to consider the composition of the Culsagee ver
miculite; and I give below at (1), (2), and (3), the results of
three analyses made by myself, together with the corresponding
oxygen-ratios.
    The pulverized mineral, after it has been exfoliated by heat,
is easily and perfectly decomposed by hydrochloric acid.            In
analysis (I), after the separation of the silica, the alumina and
ferric oxide were separated from the magnesia by ammonia with
the usual precautions.      In (2) and (3) the bases were converted
into nitrates and separated by Deville’s method.          In each case
the magnesia was weighed as pyrophosphate, and the alumina
and ferric oxide were weighed together.
    All three analyses were made with material rendered anhy
 drous by ignition until the weight was constant ; and each is re
presented by three distinct determinations—namely, the weight
of the silica, the sum of the weight of the alumina and ferric
oxide, and the weight of the magnesic pyrophosphate.              The
oxides of iron and the water were once for all determined on
separate portions of the dried but not exfoliated mineral,   '
                                                                   and
therefore appear of the same value in all the analyses.
    The determination of the water was the only di<U+FB01>iculty which
the analysis of this mineral presented.      It is by far the most hy
groscopic   silicate I have ever examined,  when   once dry absorbing
water from comparatively dry air with almost as much avidity
 as chloride of calcium.     In two experiments with different por
tions of the same powder, the material was heated in an air-bath
 at 100° C. for seventy-two hours before the weight became con
 stant ; and in each case the weight was compared at intervals of
 about six hours.       The total loss in the <U+FB01>rst experiment was
 1027 per cent., and in the second 1019 per cent. The mineral
thus dried lost, when ignited, 10'84 per cent. Another portion
 of the same powder, which had been dried over sulphuric acid
 for more than two months, lost, when ignited, 1109 per cent.

                  Prof.  J. P. Cooke   on the Vermiculites.             263
 This close agreement indicates that all the water lost in drying,
 either at 1000 or over sulphuric acid, is hygroscopic; and the
 conclusion is very strongly con<U+FB01>rmed by the fact that the mineral
 in thus drying does not change its aspect in the least degree,
 and rapidly reabsorbs the water when exposed to the air. On
 the other hand, when the mineral is ignited it swells up to many
times its volume, like other members of the vermiculite family,
 and undergoes what is evidently a profound alteration in its mo
 lecular structure.

    It  is evident from these analyses that the atomic ratio of the
mineral is 2 : 1 : 1 : 1 ; and its formula may therefore be written

    By referring to what has already been said of the relation of
J  e<U+FB02>'erisite to the Biotites, it will be seen that while that mineral
corresponds to a less common variety of this species, the Cu]
sagee vermiculite corresponds to its more usual type.             We give
below at (1) the results of an analysis of Vesuvian Biotite by
Chodnef, and at (2) the same, assuming that a portion of the
iron is in the ferrous condition, as is well known to be the case,
in order to show that values within the probable error of the
analysis would give the ratio 2:1 :1.                 Here, of course, the
alkali takes the place of a portion of the magnesia of the ver
miculite.

    This new variety of vermiculite is              so well marked, and the
composition    so de<U+FB01>nite,     that  I  have   thought      best to designate it
by the    name  Culsageeite.       As   regards    its other  characters, it has
a speci<U+FB01>c gravity of 2225 (taken in alcohol), and about the
hardness of talc.        Before the blowpipe the exfoliated mineral
fuses readily to a white enamel, but does not fuse in the <U+FB02>ame
of a Bunsen lamp.
    To this variety of vermiculite belongs, as I have already inti
mated, the original mineral from Millbury, analyzed by Crossley.
There can be no question as to the general accuracy of Crossley’s
results; and assuming that all the iron is in the ferric condition,
they give, as I have shown, almost precisely the atomic ratio
2 : 1 : 1 z 1. The only question that can arise is in regard to the
condition of the iron.         I have therefore made an assay of the
iron by the accurate       method     I  formerly described in the Amer.
Journ. Sci. vol. xliv. p. 347 (1867).              One hundred parts of the
massive mineral gave 7'40 per cent. ferric oxide and 3'86 per
cent. ferrous oxide, which corresponds to a total of 1056 ferrous
oxide.     Crossley found 10'02 ferrous oxide; but be separated
with great care the vermiculite from the steatite with which it is
mixed; and this steatite was probably the source of the greater
part of the small quantity of ferrous oxide found in our assay,
which, though not made with pure material, shows conclusively
that the condition of the iron in the Millbury vermiculite is not
different from that in other varieties of the same family of mi
nerals.
    Hallite.-—Several years since, this variety of vermiculite was
 sent to me by Mr. John Hall, of Philadelphia, by whom it was
 originally discovered.        The examination then made showing that
the  mineral   was  a  new    variety, if not a new species, of the ver
miculite family,    I  gave to it the name of Hallite, in recognition
of the mineralogical services of Mr. Hall, who not only disco
vered the mineral, but has carefully worked the locality and
observed the associations in which it is there found.                 A prelimi
nary notice of the mineral under this name was published at the
time by Professor Leeds, of Hoboken; but the interesting rela
tions which the mineral bears to the subject of this paper have
made a further examination desirable.

                Prof. J.  P. Cooke    on the Vermiculites.           265
    Hallite occurs in large rough six-sided prisms, with easy mi
caceous cleavage.      There are two varieties, differing markedly in
colour—green and yellow ; and          I am indebted to Mr. Hall for
the following facts in regard to the locality and associations of
this species. Mr. Hall writes :—“‘The mineral is found at East
Nottingham, in the serpentine formation of south-eastern Penn
sylvania, three miles south of Oxford, in Chester County; and           I
know of no other locality.        I  think the green and yellow varie
ties are very closely related, and may possibly pass from one into
the other; but      I  have no positive proof that they do.          The
crystals   are found  in nests   or pockets;   and  the  two colours  are
not found in the same nests. The green crystals are imbedded
in a steatite earth or base of the same colour as the crystals, and
the yellow in a yellow earth; and sometimes nests containing
the opposite varieties are only a few feet apart in seams of the
serpentine rock.”
    As the following analyses show, the two varieties have essen_
tially the same composition ; and the only difference that could
be detected was in the degree of oxidation of the iron.              The
yellow crystals appeared      to  be  more   weathered  than the  green ;
and on the last the green colour frequently fades out towards
the centre of crystals, thus giving indications of a metamor
phosis by which one variety may pass into the other.
    Under the microscope these scales of the mineral show a re
 markable appearance.        Between the greenish or nearly colour
 less plates are seen elongated scales of a yellow mineral resem
                                            J
 bling closely in colour thin scales of e<U+FB02>erisite.        They are more
 or less spear-shaped in form, although usually very narrow, and
 lie accurately in parallel lines, which cross at angles of 60° and
 120°, like the magnetic oxide of iron in the Muscovite from
 Pennsbury, Pa., or the microscopic crystals in the Biotite of
 South Burgess of Canada; and the phenomenon of asterism, seen
 so beautiful with the plates of the last, can also be seen with thin
 laminae of Hallite.      It was impossible to free the mineral from
 this admixture; but specimens were selected for analysis as free
 from it as possible. It was also impossible to determine its exact
 nature.     The scales had not a de<U+FB01>nite form; but there was a
 tendency to a rhombic shape, which is well described by the
 term “spear-shaped,”         and though the material is so widely
 distributed through the crystal, the total mass must be very small.
    This mineral is not so hygroscopic as Je<U+FB01>'erisite, and no di<U+FB02>i
 culty was found in drying the material for analysis.              When
 ignited, it exfoliates like other-species of vermiculite, but not
 nearly to so great an extent as Je<U+FB01>'erisite.        After ignition it is
 decomposed by hydrochloric acid.           The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the

                       a                             More commonly
 there are distinct evidences of twinning; and on the borders of
 the hexagonal plate may be discovered           biaxial structure, of
                                                       a
 which the optical plane          parallel
                                    is     to different   edges of the
 hexagon on different parts of the plate.
     It must, however, be remembered that as,                       by
                                                         the process of

  In other words, the process      twinning we have illustrated in this
                                         of
 paper produces hexagonal crystals in external form as well as in
  optical characters; and the question naturally arises, May not
  the hexagonal crystals of other minerals be formed in          similar        a
  way? that    is,may they not be developed from twinned mole
  cules, which, though in their aggregate producing an hexagonal
 structure, singly would develop into biaxial crystals? Bearing
 on this point we have discovered some very remarkable evidence.

268               Prof.   J. P. Cooke    on the Vermiculites.
     We have in our possession a plate of Elba tourmaline cut per-             .
pendieular to the axis, in which the polarizing microscope shows
on different zones a separation of the hyperbolas, which amounts
in some positions to 8 degrees; and in moving the plate across
the <U+FB01>eld the optical divergence varies precisely as on plates of
phlogopite and vermiculite.           There is certainly no external evi
dence of lamination on tourmaline crystals; for the mineral is
remarkably compact, and the crystals have not even a basal
cleavage: but it will be remembered how readin some of the
varieties pass by alteration into micas of the magnesian type;
and this change to a foliated structure, in which the lamination
is parallel to the base of the original hexagonal crystal, may be
facilitated by a grouping of the molecules of the tourmaline in
the manner represented by <U+FB01>g. 12.
     We have also a plate of amethystine quartz, in which a beam
of parallel polarized rays of light exhibits a twinning almost as
symmetrical as that shown in <U+FB01>g. 10, the three zones being most
beautifully mapped out by the alternating bands of right- and
left-handed quartz, which are such a familiar phenomenon of
these crystals.     But, besides this, in each of these zones, near the
border of the plate, can be distinguished a biaxial structure with
an optical divergence of several degrees ; and on one other plate
of amethyst we have had an opportunity of examining, we have
also seen under the polarizing microscope the biaxial curves at
one or more points.
      These facts most distinctly suggest the theory that the optical
phenomena of quartz are produced by a molecular structure
 similar to that by which we have obtained identical phenomena
in our arti<U+FB01>cial plates of mica, and that the two orders of crystals
 are aggregates of compound molecules, whose parts are twinned
together in the one case in right-handed, and in the other in
 left-handed spirals, and, lastly, that the simple molecule, if de
 veloped normally, would produce a biaxial structure*.                   This
theory is most markedly in harmony with the chemical relations
of silica. The compound SiO‘2 is the only one of the tetrad
     * Since the above was in type   we have received the Amer. Journ. Sci.
 ( IV.) February 1874, containing a description of the rhombic silica which
 Professor Maskelyne, of the British Museum, has discovered in the meteo
rite of Breitenbach.     This new species of silica, which Professor Maske
lyne calls Asmanite, has the form of a right rhombic prism, with an angle
of 120° 20', and the crystals are optically biaxial ; but while the speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity of quartz is 2'6, that of Asmanite is said to be 2'245. It is perhaps
 to be expected that such a molecular macling as we have described Would
 determine an increase of density, since thereby three molecules coalesce to
 form one; or it is possible that the remarks made infrh in regard to
 calcite apply also to quartz; but still the marked difference remains to be
 explained.

oxides  which crystallizes in the hexagonal system ; and ever
since,  by the study of the organic compounds of silicon, the
quadrivalent character of the element has been made evident,
this fact has been a striking anomaly in our chemical classi<U+FB01>ca
tion. Assume, however, that the molecule SiO"z would develop
normally into a rhombic structure, and that the hexagonal form
of quartz is solely a result of molecular twinning, and the ano
maly disappears.    The molecule SiO2 may be approximately of
the same form as the molecule TiO2 in Brookite; but having
the exact dimensions and polar conditions which favour the
mode of molecular twinning, described above and represented by
<U+FB01>g. 12, it may always develop into hexagonal shapes.
    Are, then, all hexagonal forms thus closely related to the
rhombic systems of crystals? And do all molecules of the di
mensions and polar conditions illustrated by the <U+FB01>gures of this
article (that          is,
                   those which correspond to the rhomb of 60C and
120°)    usually   develop    into hexagonal forms? May not the
whole difference between an hexagonal and            rhombic form arise         a
from     aslight difference of dimensions, which determines          mo                      a
lecular macling in the one case, and           normal development of   a
the single molecules in the other? These questions point out
most interesting lines of investigation, and will recall to the mi
neralogist      number of facts bearing upon the subject.

both of phenacite and of beryl is more closely allied to that of
chrysoberyl and corundum than the received theory of their
chemical constitution would indicate.
    We would not convey the impression that in all these crystals
the appearances we have described are strongly marked, or that
they have passed wholly unnoticed hitherto.            Every one who
has become familiar with the optical properties of crystals must
have noticed that, with'many always regarded as uniaxial, there
is not unfrequently in some positions a small separation of the
cross into the hyperbolas ‘which are characteristic          of biaxial
structure. But these irregularities, although long known, have
never been satisfactorily explained.        They have been hitherto
residual features    not accounted     for by the received theory of
crystalline structure, which explains so satisfactorily the general
order of the phenomena observed with the polariscope. We have
endeavoured in this paper to trace their true signi<U+FB01>cance :——<U+FB01>rst
by showing that the appearances we are discussing are precisely
similar to the effects which can be obtained by known means
with mica plates; and secondly by observing, on different spe
cimens of various minerals, every intermediate stage between the
unmistakable effects of twinning on plates of mica or vermicu
lite, and the delicate phases of the same phenomena seen with
sections of crystals of tourmaline, corundum, or phenacite. One
other illustration of our theory.
    The rhombic angle of Witherite (native baric carbonate) is
118° 30'; and the all but universal hexagonal macling of crys
tals of this species is a well-known fact*.       The rhombic angle
of Aragonite (the corresponding form of calcic carbonate) is
116° 10'; and the much greater divergence of this angle from
120° determines, as is also known, a style of macling which is
 usually quite different from that of Witherite.        In the isomeric
calcite, however, we have the type of all hexagonal forms.
 Hitherto the crystalline forms of calcite and Aragonite have been
 regarded as being as widely separated as possible; and a compa
 rison of these two well-known mineral species has furnished one
 of the most striking illustrations of dimorphism.         But may not,
 after all, the comparatively small physical differences between
 these two minerals correspond to a crystallographic difference no
 greater, fundamentally, than the difference between the rhomb
of 116° 10' and the rhomb of 120°?
    The macles of chrysoberyl and Witherite are illustrations of a
 general truth, fully recognized in mineralogy, that all rhombic
crystals whose angles approach 120° tend to form hexagonal
 macles. The optical phenomena described in this paper certainly
suggest the theory that a perfect hexagonal form and structure

               Prof. J. P. Cooke  on the Vermiculites.           271
may be the result of a more fundamental and molecular macling,
which results when the angle is exactly 120°.
    Observations of Se'narmont.—The only previous observations
which we have been able to <U+FB01>nd bearing on the ubject of this
paper are those of the late eminent mineralogist, H. de Sénar
mont, of Paris.      In a well-known paper (Ann. de Cbim. et de
Phys. 3rd ser. vol. xxxiii. p. 391), Sénarmont showed that salts
which were both geometrically and chemically isomorphous
might have very different optical relations—for example, that,
while the biaxial crystals of two such salts might have the same
bisectrix, the plane of the optical axes in the crystals of one
might be perpendicular to the corresponding plane in those of
the other.      He further proved, by crystallizing together two
salts so related, that in the crystals of the isomorphous mixtures
thus obtained the optical angle varied with the varying propor
tions of the constituents between the extreme conditions in the
crystals of either salt ,' and by trial he succeeded in forming
from two biaxial salts crystals which, in monochromatic light at
least, appeared uniaxial.      In a later paper (Ann. de Cln'm. et de
 Phys. 3rd ser. vol. xxxiv. p. 171) Sénarmont applied the principles
 which he had thus experimentally veri<U+FB01>ed, to explain the varia
 tion of the optical angle of the micas.       In this paper he seeks
 to prove, <U+FB01>rst, that all micas may be referred to a right rhombic
 prism with angles of approximately 60° and 120°; secondly,
 that while in some micas the plane of the optical axes is parallel
 to the shorter diagonal of the rhomb, as in <U+FB01>g. 13, in others it
 is parallel to the longer diagonal, as in <U+FB01>g. 14.       Interpreting
 these facts by the results of his experiments on isomorphous,
 salts, he draws the inference that there are, crystallographically
 at least, but two species of mica which are geometrically iso
 morphous but optically distinct, that these are represented by
 the varieties which have the widest optical angle between the
  axes in either plane, and that all other varieties with optical
  angles varying from 0° to 70° in either direction are isomor
  phous mixtures of the two optically distinct conditions of the
 mineral.
  _ The observations    described in this paper, although they prove
  that another cause may also determine the variation of optical
  angle in micaceous minerals, do not necessarily invalidate this
  beautiful theory of Sénarmont. The variations observed with
  other minerals, not only on different specimens, but with the
  same specimen at different temperatures, and which are so beau
  tifully seen with the orthoclase from Wehr in the Eifel, and with
  crystals of selenite, indicate that such variations may be deter
  mined by conditions of molecular structure wholly independent
  of the macling here described. We have shown that the macling

272             Prof.   J.    P. Cooke      on the Vermiculites.
does produce the variation in certain cases; and it must remain
for future investigation to assign the limits of the in<U+FB02>uence which
this cause may exert. We would only remark in conclusion that,
although in the <U+FB01>fty-seven varieties of mica examined by Senat
mont he did not note a single instance in which the position of
the plane of the optical axes, (with reference to the diagonal of the
rhomb) was different on different parts of the same specimen, or
even on different specimens from the same locality, he does de
scribe and <U+FB01>gure several remarkable macles of Muscovite mica
similar to those of vermiculite described above and represented
by <U+FB01>g. 10.      In one instance the plane of the Optical axes is
parallel  to the  shorter, and in the other to the longer diagonal
of the rhombic prism ; but in both cases it has the same relative

forming with each other angles of 60°.          On the plate of another
macle a difference of optical angle was observed on different por

have been studying in this paper.         On another plate from the
same crystals, he observed a superposition of the laminae of the
different individuals of the macle ,- and the following language
by which this phenomenon is described, and which is the only

XXXII.      On the'Sensibility to Light of Bromide of Silver with
    respect to the so-called Chemically Inert Colours.     By HER
    MANN VOGEL*.
             regard to certain colours (red, yellow, and green) the
WITH    photographic action, as we are aware, is either very limited
or altogether wanting. This circumstance not only throws dif
<U+FB01>culties in the way of copying coloured objects (oil paintings),
but also with regard to taking portraits, in which coloured
clothes and likewise a yellow tint of the complexion, light hair,
or rosy checks are reproduced in abnormal conditions. What is
of a light colour, when of a yellowish tint, comes out bright; and
this drawback is only' to be got over to a certain extent by a sub
sequent retouching of the negative.
    This abnormal insensibility to colour, as regards photographic
plates, is pronounced in the most marked manner with respect
to the colours of the spectrum, wherein beyond the violet a
powerful action is manifested, which in the visible spectrum
 (according to the researches hitherto made) does not extend
deeper than to the line E in the green. (See Dr. Schultz-Sellack,
‘
  Reports of the German Chemical Society,’ 1871, p. 211). Re
searches recently instituted by me by means of bromide of silver,
however, have shown that the sensibility of this preparation not
only embraces a considerably wider extent of the spectrum, but
even that, by the employment of certain accessories, its sensibi
lity may be carried as far as into the red, or, in other words, to
regions where hitherto for photography dark night reigned.
    I received recently from England some'dry bromide-of-silver
plates which Wortley prepares in that country for sale, by a pro
cess which is only in part divulged.       On exposing these plates
to the spectrum, I found to my astonishment that they proved
to be more sensitive in the green (that is to say, near the line E)
than in the light blue (that is to say, near the line F). Here
was an instance of sensibility not in accordance with our previous
experience—namely, that a colour the chemical action of which
was held to be weak, proved more energetic than that of one
which was looked upon as powerful. This circumstance induced
me to enter at once upon a more intimate examination of the
behaviour of bromide of silver with regard to the colours of the
spectrum.
    I formed my spectrum by the use of a photographic camera
and a Steinheil lens, which I adapted to the battery of prisms
of a direct-vision spectroscope.    The width of the slit was 0'25

274             M. H. Vogel   on the   Sensibility   to   Light
millim.   The solar rays were thrown on to it by means of a
Foucault’s heliostat, for the use of which I am indebted to the
great kindness of my friend Dr. Zenker.        The length of the
spectrum  from  D  to G was  35 millims.
   When desirous of comparing my experiments,           chose the I
time from 11 till 2, and then operated only when there was a
cloudless sky, which it is true is but seldom the case at this
period of the year.   The time of exposure lasted generally ten
minutes.    The plates were developed with protosulphate of iron.
Even in my earliest experiments I found that the sensibility of
the bromide of silver extends considerably further than is stated
by Dr. Schultz-Sellack, who obtained therewith an action only
from the ultra-violet as far as nearly to the line F in the blue.
In my experiments the sensibility extended in all cases beyond
the line F, more or less far beyond according to the transparency
of the atmosphere.                                        I
                       Upon this latter point purpose entering
more at length in a separate communication.
    Imade a trial of the bromide of silver in two forms :—<U+FB01>rst, as
a so-called wet plate,  that is to say, when moist from an adhe
ring solution of nitrate of silver derived from the silver-bath
wherein the plates were sensitized; secondly, as a dry plate, ob
tained by washing off the solution of silver and then drying the
                                  ‘
plate. (For further details see Reports of the German Chemical
Society,’ 1873, p. 89.)    The behaviour of the two classes of
plates was different.
    The result was that dry bromide of silver exhibits a more ex
tended sensibility for colours than does the bromide which lies
beneath a silver solution; when an acid development was em
ployed, the latter manifested sensibility up to the middle point
between D and E—that is to say, nearly up to the yellow; the
former, however, exhibited sensibility 2 millims. beyond the line
D, or up into the orange.                  _
    The action of the two plates was moreover very different in a
 qualitative sense. With moist bromide" of silver an extremely
energetic action is seen between G and F (in the indigo and
 blue) ; near F, however, it declines suddenly, and nothing but a
faint indication could be traced as far as the other side of
E. Dry plates, on the other hand, exhibited a far less decided
action in the blue than the wet plates did ; this action, however,
declined only gradually, and it extended, as has been remarked
above, as far as beyond D.
    Hence dry bromide of silver' is more sensitive for the rays of
lesser refrangibility in the visible solar spectrum ; moist bromide
    silver ismost sensitive for the blue rays of greater refrangi

powerful                       (see the above work, 1873, p. 88); that is
to say, it augments their sensibility in consequence of its <U+FB01>xing
chemically the iodine or bromine as it becomes liberated during
exposure. That this action occurs chie<U+FB02>y in the blue <U+FB01>nds its
solution without doubt in this, namely that the blue rays are
 more eagerly absorbed by the wet <U+FB01>lm than are the others.
     As has been already observed, the sensibility of the dry bro
 mide of silver diminishes gradually from the blue to the red.
                                                         I
 With bromide-of-silver plates as prepared by me could see no
 thing of the phenomenon which I had noticed as occurring in
 such a marked manner with the English bromide-of-silver plates
 spoken of above, namely a falling off of the sensibility from the
 violet to the blue, and an increase thereof from the blue to the
 green.       The explanation above offered as to the action of nitrate
 of silver upon bromide of silver induced me, however, to con
jecture that the English bromide-of-silver plates must contain
 some substance that absorbs the green in a greater measure than
 the blue.      It is not unusual to give dry plates a coating of sub
 stances of the most varied kinds, such as gallic acid, caffeine, or
 morphine, all which bodies <U+FB01>x iodine and bromine and exercise
 a sensitizing action; occasionally,          too, a yellowish colouring
  matter   is  added  thereto,  with the view of retarding the “chemical”
  blue light thereby.       The optical demeanour of these “ preserva
 tives” may be looked upon as a matter not yet in any way un
 derstood; neither, indeed, is their favourable in<U+FB02>uence placed
  beyond all question.
     The plates of Wortley contain nitrate of uranium, gum, gallic
 acid, and a yellow colouring-matter as a coating.             In order to
  ascertain whether this coating exercised any action,       I washed one
  of these plates with alcohol and water, and obtained in fact by
  so doing a plate that no longer gave any indication of an aug
  mented sensibility in the green.        I     now made an attempt to
  impregnate bromide of silver with a substance that absorbs espe
  cially the yellow rays and <U+FB01>xes free iodine or bromine, in the
 hope of thereby heightening the sensibility for yellow. 1 selected
  coralline, which Professor Liebermann most kindly placed at my
 disposal.       A solution thereof, when greatly diluted, gives in the
 spectroscope an absorption-band between D and E; in a more
 concentrated solution the absorption becomes widened out until
 it reaches beyond D, while, on the other hand, the blue near F is
 transmitted'to a pretty considerable amount.
    I   dissolved coralline in alcohol and added some of it to my
  bromide collodion, so that it became of a strong red colour.
 Dry bromide of silver plates prepared with this collodion were
 of a decided red tone. On exposure to the spectrum they bore
 out my anticipation; that is              say, the plates proved sensitive

  276         On the Sensibility to  Light of Bromide of Silver.
  in   the  indigo, from there their sensibility decreased till the light
  blue, became     weak at F, then increased again, and in the yellow
  was found to be almost as e<U+FB02>icient as in the indigo.       Thus a me
  thod was attained for preparing bromide-of-silver plates that are
  acted upon almost as strongly by a colour hitherto held to be
. chemically inert, namely yellow, as they are by indigo, which
  hitherto has been held to be the colour possessing the strongest
  chemical energy.
       After this experiment     I was justi<U+FB01>ed in hoping that some
   other bromide-<U+FB01>xing substance endowed with a powerful absorp
   tion of the red would in like manner heighten the ensibility of
   bromide of silver for red.      Such a body   I  met with among the
   green aniline products.       The body in question absorbed in a
   marked manner the red rays in the middle between D and C ;
   when further concentrated this absorption           became extended
   towards D, while the yellow, green, and blue were transmitted
   almost unimpaired.         In point of fact a collodion coloured with
   this green proved sensitive to light as far as into the red.
       The sensibility fell off from the indigo to the yellow, then in
   creased again; and at the identical place where the above-men
   tioned absorption-band was visible a powerful action in the red
   was manifested.
        From these experiments     I        I
                                     think am pretty well justi<U+FB01>ed in
   inferring that we are in a position to render bromide of silver
   sensitive for any colour we choose—that is to say, to heighten for
   particular colours the sensibility it was originally endowed with.
   To effect this, all that is required is to add thereto some sub
   stance which promotes the chemical decomposition of the bro
    mide of silver and absorbs the particular colour in question but
   not the others.       Perhaps we may even arrive at this, namely
    photographing the ultra-red as we have already photographed
    the ultra-violet. The photographic inef<U+FB01>ciency of certain colours,
    which has hitherto proved so great an obstacle, would in that
    cae be surmounted.         The following experiment shows to what
    extent this is practically substantiated.    A photograph was taken
    of a band of blue upon a yellow ground. Employing an ordi
                                                   I
    nary collodion plate with iodide of silver, obtained thereupon a
    white band upon a black ground.           On a bromide-of-silver and
    collodion plate, where the action of the blue and the yellow is
    equally powerful, it was to be anticipated that no eEect was to
    be obtained.-     I therefore placed in front of the object-glass a
    disk   of yellow glass, which absorbed the blue light and trans
    mitted the yellow unimpaired; and then, after an exposition of
    suitable duration,    I obtained in point of fact a dark band on a
    light ground.
        The matter isnot alone of practical but also of scienti<U+FB01>c in

  E<U+FB01>ectsproduced        byFoy and Vapour on      the Intensin of Sound. 277
  terest.     Hitherto it has been held that the haloid salts of silver
   were modi<U+FB01>ed       chemically only by the rays which they absorb to
  a marked extent (Schultz-Sellack, ‘ Reports of the German Che
  mical Society,’ 1871, p. 211) 3 and, moreover, the in<U+FB02>uence of
  “                ” has been
     sensitizers                   partially called in question (Schultz
  Sellack, ‘Photographic Communications,’ seventh annual publi~
  cation, p. 301).
      My investigations show that, with respect to the sensibility of
  photographic plates to the action of light, not only does the op
  tical aptitude for absorption on the part of the sensitive silver
  salts themselves, but also the optical aptitude for absorption on
  the part of the substances mixed therewith play a prominent
  part.
      Further experiments on this point are in progress.

      in the Atmosphere       on  the  Intensity   of  Sound.   By Professor
      CHALLIS,      M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
             experimental     results obtained by Dr. Tyndall relative to
  THEthe         intensity of sound under various conditions of the
  atmosphere (as published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
  No. 149, pp. 58—68) are of so much scienti<U+FB01>c importance that it
  seemed to me desirable to endeavour to account for them theore
 tically.     The questions they raise are clearly hydrodynamical;
 and I think       I  shall be able to show that the appropriate answers
 may     substantially    be given by reference to propositions in hydro
 dynamics      which    I  have previously discussed in the pages of this
 Journal.
     It is evident from the experiments that the phenomena to be
 explained are of two kinds—those resulting from Fog, or the pre
 sence in the air of vapour in a visible form, and those due to the
 admixture with the air of invisible vapour.             As to Fog, or Haze,
 I shall at once assume that it is to be attributed to the suspen
sion in the air of extremely minute globules of water.                  This
supposition is justi<U+FB01>ed by phenomena of the Fog-bow, which in
dicates by its form an action of spherical drops of water on light
the ame as that which takes place in the case of the primary
rainbow ; and its freedom from colour gives evidence of the ex
tremely small size, as compared with that of rain—drops, of the
suspended globules.                                        _

number of these small globules.    The problem of determining
the velocity and condensation of the air due to the reaction of a
single small sphere on which such vibrations are incident, have                                  I
already discussed and applied on several occasions.         (See the
Number of the Philosophical Magazine for June 1864, pp. 457
& 458, that for October 1865, pp. 262 8: 263, and the solution of
Example VI. in pp. 279—287 of ‘The Principles of Mathematics
and Physics.’)    Suppose the velocity at any point due to the
reaction of the sphere to be resolved along, and perpendicularly
to, the radius vector drawn to the point from the sphere’s centre,
and let the former resolved part be U, and be reckoned positive
in the direction from the centre, and the other he W, and be
reckoned positive when it is in the same direction as that of the
incidence; also let a- be the condensation at the same time at
the ame point.     Then if r and 0 be polar coordinates of the given
point, the origin being at the centre of the sphere and 0 being
the angle which the radius vector makes with an axis drawn in
the direction of incidence from the origin, and if b be the radius
of the sphere, and T the velocity of the incident vibration at the
time t in a plane through the origin transverse to the axis, the

Now any re<U+FB02>ection of the incident waves, caused      the reaction             by
of the sphere, will be proportional to ac, and must be extremely

                                                                          2"                     If, for
instance, we suppose that           T=m      sin                A.   being the breadth of

                                                                                       37$),
therefore,     by   reason of the ratio                  is   excessively small                  for all

will become excessively small at small distances from its centre,
because such distances may still be many multiples of      Thus,                           6.
 byreason of the two factors combined, the re<U+FB02>ection from single                                a
globule may be so extremely minute at all sensible distances
from its centre, that the sum of the re<U+FB02>ections from very large                    a
number of globules contained within      given <U+FB01>nite space might

from a great depth. The experiments of Dr. Tyndall showed
that this is actually the case in afoggy or hazy atmosphere ; and
accordingly this fact, so contrary to previous expectation, may be
considered to be accounted for by the present theory.
    Taking now into consideration the velocities U and W, it may
be proved (as is shown in the discussions above cited) that these
velocities are such that just as much <U+FB02>uid crosses any plane per
pendicular to the direction of the propagation of the incident
waves as would have crossed if the globule had been absent. As
this is true with respect to each globule, it follows from the prin
ciple of the coexistence of steady motions, that the mean effect
of the reaction of all the globules is simply to augment the velo
city in the incident waves by contracting the space in which the
<U+FB02>uid moves, just as the rate of the <U+FB02>owing of a river is increased
by contraction of its channel.          By this means an impetus
 would be given to the sound-waves; and it might thus happen
that, in the absence of countervailing causes, sound would be
audible in a hazy atmosphere at unusually great distances. This
in fact appears to have occurred in the experiments of July 1
 and October 30.
    During a fall of rain or snow, the drops or the <U+FB02>akes might
by their size produce a sensible amount of re<U+FB02>ection, and so di
minish the intensity of the sound; but, on the other hand, by
their occupation of space they would, in the manner explained
above in relation to the globules of vapour, give impulses to the
 vibrations; so that upon the whole (as appears from experiment
to be the case) rain or snow falling might have little effect on the
 intensity of sounds.
    It is to be observed that the theory points to no change of the
 rate ofpropagation of sounds by the action of visible vapour, but
 exclusively to an alteration of their intensity.    I
    Let us now suppose vapour in an invisible state to be mixed
 with the air. The vapour is connected with the air only by a
 kind of mechanical suspension ; yet there is reason from expe
 riment to conclude that the elasticity of the compound differs
 very little from that of the air itself.   So long, therefore, as the
 mixture is not irregular, there would appear to be no reason for
 the production of re<U+FB02>ected sound.         But, to use Dr. Tyndall’s
 terms, an irregular or “<U+FB02>occulent
                                      ”   admixture would render the
 air “ acoustically opaque.” This effect may be conceived to take
 place as follows.
    If it Were possible that two portions of an elastic <U+FB02>uid
 of different densities and the same elasticity could be in jux
 taposition on opposite sides of the same plane, in any case
 of the propagation of waves from one portion to the other
 re<U+FB02>ection would take place at the plane of separation, whether

280    E<U+FB02>'ects produced by Fog and Vapour on the Intensity     ofSound.
the waves passed from the rarer to the denser portion, or from
the denser to the, rarer.     In an irregular, or <U+FB01>occulent, admix
ture  of air and  vapour  of water such an abrupt change of density
would not be possible; but there might be changes of density
more or less rapid from point to point without change of elasti
city; and, so far as these changes tend to be abrupt, partial re
<U+FB02>ection of the anes might ensue. It is also to be considered that
the re<U+FB02>ections would always take place in the ‘directions of most
rapid change of density, whether the density be increasing or
decreasing; so that in a <U+FB02>occulent admixture there might be
re<U+FB02>ections in various directions, and the sound might be dis
 persed or absorbed in a manner analogous to the absorption of
light on its entrance into an opaque or partially transparent me
 dium. Thus air charged with vapour in an invisible state,
 although optically transparent, might be in various degrees im
 pervious to sound.      That this is actually the case was clearly
 demonstrated by the experiments.           This view is con<U+FB01>rmed by
 the fact, observed   on October 8,   that   the intensity of the sound
 was increased by a heavy fall of rain, the effect of which would
 be, as is remarked by Dr. Tyndall, to remove to a certain amount
 by condensation and precipitation the invisible vapour to which
 the diminution of the intensity of sound is mainly attributable.
    Thus theoretical reasons can be given for the experimental
 results that fog and haze do not diminish, and may even increase,
 the audibility of sounds, and that loss of sound is chie<U+FB02>y due to
 certain conditions of the invisible vapour mixed with the air.
 Theory also indicates that neither by fog and haze, nor by that
 condition of invisible vapour which diminishes or absorbs sound,
 is the rate of propagation sensibly altered.              I
                                                      But know of no
 hpriori means of determining whether the amount of vapour in
 regular admixture with the air may not have some in<U+FB02>uence
 on the velocity of sound; and this,       I  think, is a point which is
 open to further inquiry by experimental means.
    The greater distance to which sounds are audible to leeward
 than to windward of the place of excitation, is very little owing
 to the transmission being accelerated by the wind in the former
 case and retarded by it in the other.         It is chie<U+FB02>y due to the
 circumstance that in those vibratory movements of the air to
 which the loudness of the sound is principally due there is an
 excess of condensation above rarefaction, and the consequent
 excess of the velocity corresponding        to the condensation is in
 the same direction as the current of the wind on the leeward
 side and opposed to it on the windward side.             As the action
 on the ear is in each-case proportional to the square of the
 compound velocity, the result will be an excess of intensity on
 the leeward side.

     Connexion     between  Capillary and Electrical Phenomena.          281
    In concluding these remarks,         I  take occasion to advert to the
solution I have given, on hydrodynamical principles, of the
problem of lines of magnetic force, this problem being in its
conditions analogous to that of determining the effect of the
small globules of water in a foggy atmosphere on the intensity
of sound.              the “ Note on the Hydrodynamical Theory of
                ”(See

Magnetism
pp.    42-45,     and   arts. 4—8 of a new discussion of the same
theory in the Number for June 1872). In that solution I have
argued that a stream, or a vibration, of the aether receives an
impulse on entering into a magnet by reason of the contraction
of channel resulting from the occupation of space by the atoms
of the magnet, and that this impulse is proportional to the
number of atoms in a given space. On the hypothesis, there
fore, that the density of the magnet increases by slow degrees
from one end to the other, a given element of the eether will
receive successive impulses as it moves towards the denser end,
and in this way a permanent stream will be maintained in oppo
 sition to the inertia of the <U+FB02>uid.        In the case of the transmission
of ound in a foggy atmosphere, there is not an analogous incre
 ment of the globule-density in the horizontal direction of the
 propagation; but so far as experiment indicates that an im
 pulse is given to the sound-vibrations by the presence of the
 globules and the intensity of the sound is thereby increased,
 the two kinds of phenomena are alike, and the proposed theore
 tical explanations of them are mutually con<U+FB01>rmatory.

 T           present investigation was made in the laboratory of
          Professor Kirchhoff, to whom I am greatly indebted for
 his counsel and for his kind assistance.           It might well have been
 dif<U+FB01>cult to    seek  a priori  for relations   between  electrical variables
  and the so-called constants of capillarity; and in fact             I  only
  gradually arrived at such relations, starting from an experiment
 for which I am indebted to Professor Kiihne of Heidelberg, and
  which is essentially as follows.                      v

282           M. G. Lippmann       on the Cannes-ion between
iron wire is <U+FB01>xed near it so as to dip in the acid and just
touch the edge of the drop of mercury.             As soon as contact
has taken place, the drop performs regular vibrations which may
last for hours.     The resemblance between this phenomenon and
the movements of mercury electrodes (see Wiedemann, Galvanis
mus, 1872, § 368) is striking, and the explanation is manifestly
the same.      From the view hitherto received it would be as fol
lows.     The solution containing chromic acid would oxidize the
 surface of the drop and thus <U+FB02>atten it.       In contact with iron an
 iron-mercury couple is formed.         The current would reduce the
 surface by electrolysis ; the drop would contract, and the contact
 with the iron would be broken; the same succession of phenomena
 would ensue as before, and so forth.          By using a suf<U+FB01>ciently
 concentrated chromic acid solution these processes are actually
 seen to take place ; but with a dilute solution the surface always
 remains bright.      Measurements have shown in fact that the po
 larization of mercury by hydrogen effects a contraction, and that
 we need only remember the depolarizing action of chromic acid
 to explain the above phenomenon.
     Experiments which      I will now detail more completely have
 shown that the capillary constant (super<U+FB01>cial tension, coe<U+FB01>icient of
 Laplace’s formula) at the contact-surface of mercury and dilute
sulphuric acid is an invariable function of the electromotive force
of the polarization at the same surface.
 I.   Variation of   the  Capillary Constant with     the Electromotive
                        Force of the Polarization.
     Measurements.—The apparatus consisted of a vertical ca
 librated glass tube, G G', which was connected at the bottom by
means of an india-rubber tube with a reservoir of mercury, A
  (Plate II. <U+FB01>g. 1).     The mercury rose thus in the tube G G', but
 underwent    there  a capillary depression which was measured with
 the cathetometer, and from which the capillary constant could
 be determined in the ordinary manner.           The upper part of the
 glass  tube  was <U+FB01>lled   with dilute  sulphuric  acid (one eleventh of
 the volume   of acid),  which wetted  the meniscus   of the mercury M,
 and was continued by the glass siphon, H, into the glass vessel,
 B, which also contained dilute sulphuric acid. At the bottom
of the vessel was a layer of mercury, B, to serve as a second
electrode.     The capillary depression of the mercury in the tube
G G' was, of course, corrected for the pressure of the dilute acid.
In order to evoke in M a known E. F. P. (Electromotive Force
of Polarization), the two masses of mercury (namely, that in B
 and the mass A M) were respectively connected with two points,
P and Q, of the circuit of a Daniell’s element by means of the
 platinum wires a, B, which may be called the poles of the appa

              Capillary and Electrical Phenomena.                   283
ratus.    A branch current then traversed the apparatus, which
now acted as a decomposing cell, until the E. F. P. produced was
equal to the difference of potentials between P and Q.            The
E. F. P. bears the same relation to the electromotive       force of a
Daniell as the resistance P Q bears to the resistance of the entire
circuit.    This relation may be deduced from the de<U+FB02>ection of a
tangent-compass       contained in this circuit.    The ratio of the
surfaces of mercury in M and in B was intentionally taken very
small, in order that the electromotive force of polarization in M
need alone be taken into account; for it is clear that a quantity
of electricity which is suf<U+FB01>cient to produce in M any given hy
drogen polarization would give on the surface B, which is many
thousand times as large, no appreciable oxygen polarization.
Thus was obtained from the indications of the compass the E.F.P.
in M, and from the indications of the cathetometer the simul
taneous capillary constant.      In order to reduce the E. F. P. in M
to zero, all  that  was necessary was to interpose a simple metallic
circuit between a and ,8. The magnitudes to be measured are
not small.      Thus the depression in a tube having a radius
 =0-32 millim. is 14 millims. for an electromotive force of
 polarization = 0 ; for an electromotive force equal to one Da
niell it is 1890 millims. ; the alteration in level is therefore
equal to 4'90 millims. =0'35 of the original depression.           The
constant of capillarity, therefore, is equal to 304 for an electro
motive force equal to 0 5 and is equal to 406 for an electromo
 tive force of polarization equal to one Daniell.
    In order to measure the alterations in the constant of capilla
 rity with still greater accuracy, instead of the tube G G' an ex
tremely hollow open point 77 (<U+FB01>g. 2) was used, which was pre
 pared by drawing out one end of a glass tube.           Mercury was
 poured into this tube to such a height that it penetrated into the
 <U+FB01>ne point and partially <U+FB01>lled it (<U+FB01>g. 2).       The point dipped in
 dilute sulphuric acid; the bubble of air which at <U+FB01>rst occupied
 the end was removed by pressing out some mercury. There was
 thus in the point a wetted hemispherical* meniscus M of about
 T—(lm
       millim. radius, whose capillary pressure counterbalanced the
 pressure of the mercury contained in the tube (750 millims. in
 height).    The dilute acid was also in contact with a second mass
 of mercury, B, which, as before, was to serve as positive electrode ;
 by means of platinum wires both masses could be connected with
 the external poles at,  ,8.   These poles were <U+FB01>rst placed in metallic
 connexion with each other, whereby the E. F. P. in M was equal
 to zero, and a    microscope so placed in front of the point that
 with    220-fold magni<U+FB01>cation one of the cross-threads was in

284          M. G. Lippmann        on the Connewion between
the tangent plane of the meniscus (<U+FB01>g. 3).                 To make a mea
surement, a Daniell’s element, for instance, was interposed be
tween a and B: the column of mercury disappeared from the <U+FB01>eld
 of view; and in order to adjust the mercury to the thread a new
 pressure, which might be called the compensating pressure, had to
 be exerted upon the column of mercury which supported the me
 niscus.    This compensating pressure bears to the former pres
 sure the same ratio that the increase of the constant of capilla
 rity at the meniscus does to the former value of this magnitude.
This is clear from Laplace’s formula, in which the curvature
must be assumed to be constant when the adjustment of the
 meniscus is constant, and thus the pressure is proportional to
 the constant of capillarity.         In the example given the compen
 sating pressure amounts        to  260   millims. of mercury (more than
 one third of an atmosphere) when a Daniell’s element is inter
 posed—that     is, 035 of the former pressure (750). The constant
of capillarity has increased     by     0'35 of its former value.
    The compensating pressure was exerted                  by
                                                            means of com
 pressed air, produced and measured              by means of an air-pump
 and of a    mercury manometer.            Electromotive forces of polari
 zation which were equal to known fractions of                Daniell were
                                                                a
produced     by    the   above-described      method   of branch   currents.
It   was thus found that to every value of the E. F. P. a perfectly
 de<U+FB01>nite value of the constant of capillarity corresponds             so that
                                                                         ;
 from the one magnitude may be inferred the value of the other.
     In all of these experiments in which the circuit was closed (that
is,   where between a and    B     either
                                       a      mere wire or   constant elec
                                                                a
 tromotive force was interposed),     it     was surprising to observe how
 constant were the results—that            is,  the constant of capillarity
 and the invariability of the position of equilibrium of the me
 niscus.     We have been accustomed to certain “disturbances”
 which occur in capillary experiments arranged in the ordinary
 manner (that     is,  without completion of the electrical circuit), and
which, of course, occurred here also when a and             Bwere insulated
from each other.          These disturbances are as follows: (1) the
position of equilibrium     is   different according to the direction of
the previous motion of the mercury; (2)               it
                                                     may suddenly change
on agitation, as, for instance,       by     tapping; (3) the position of
equilibrium may slowly change with time and only cease to
become displaced hours after.            But when the circuit was closed
by    interposing,   for instance,a     wire  between a and         8,
                                                                 all irregu
larities at once disappeared and they could not be reproduced;
that  is,  the position of equilibrium became so constant that the
meniscus was at once adjusted to the cross_wire with              precision
                                                                     a
which, in spite of the 220-fold magni<U+FB01>cation, left nothing to
be desired.       Moreover the cause of these disturbances was dis

                      The Capillary    E lectrometer.
   Since, in the apparatus just described, every compensating
pressure is represented by a de<U+FB01>nite value of the electromotive
force interposed between a and B, the latter can be inferred from
the former when once a table is constructed for this purpose.
Thus the free electrical tension at the poles of a Daniell was
measured by the compensating pressure of 260 millims. mercury,
and smaller electromotive forces by smaller pressures.            The ap
paratus   in this case  is not traversed  by  a current ; for the electro
motive force of polarization holds in equilibrium the electromo
tive force between a and B.         It is only necessary to have this     ~
electromotive force so small that it produces no appreciable de
composition of water; it must not much exceed one Daniell. This
can always be attained if a known number of Daniell’s elements
be allowed to act against the electromotive          force to be tested.
The capillary electrometer is also very sensitive in regard to
quantities of electricity; to charge it is to produce an ap
preciable polarization upon a meniscus the surface of which is
equal to (211' X T-k5)2=0'0006 sq. millim. And in fact a de<U+FB02>ec
tion is obtained when a feebly charged proof plate from a Cou
lomb’s balance is approached to the pole a—or if the current of a
Daniell be momentarily closed by the apparatus, the current being
enfeebled by the interposition of a piece of air-dried glass. The
sensitiveness of such an electrometer is therefore so great that
that of no other electrometer, excepting that of Thomson, can
be compared with it.          This sensitiveness is moreover constant
at all times; the de<U+FB02>ections are apparently momentary, in most
cases at least; and the deadening is very rapid.              The pole B
must be in metallic connexion with the gas- or water-pipes,
while a is carefully insulated from the table by means of
shellac supports.      If  also a remains insulated from B for some
time, the apparatus charges itself, as is also observed in Thom
son’s electrometer.       Accidental contacts, atmospheric electricity,
Ste. produce these charges.
   When the indications of an atmospheric-pressure             manometer
are suf<U+FB01>cient for measuring the pressure, the electrometer may be
arranged in a form which is easily transportable.            The drawn—
out glass tube is only a few centimetres long, and is connected
with a second tube sealed at one end, which contains mercury and
compressed air, and acts as a manometer for atmospheric pres
sure.    This connexion is established by means of a short thick
caoutchouc tube, which is under a small screw-press to produce
the necessary pressure.           The whole is placed upon a small
wooden bracket, which may be clamped to the stage of any mi
croscope.     The indications of the instrument are quite constant.

Also, instead     of applying compensating         pressure, successful
attempts   were  made    to measure  micrometrically the displacement
of the meniscus which took place each time.             The drawn-out
tube is then fused-to at the outer end, and contains a quantity
of compressed air, which produces the necessary constant pres
sure.    The electrometer is then a few centimetres in length ; it
must, however, be empirically graduated.           It is best when the
electrometric glass point presses like a spring against the side
of the tube which contains the dilute acid, so that under all
magnifying-powers it may be conveniently observed.
                    Electrocapillary Engine, <U+FB01>g. 5.
   Just  as electromagnetic     motors have been constructed which,
depending    on the principles of electromagnetism,         derive their
work from the battery and are driven by magnetic forces, so
also an electrocapillary motor has been constructed which is
driven by capillary forces, and transforms electrical into mecha
nical work.     Such a motor, which is now in the Physical Insti
tute at Heidelberg, consists of a glass trough,         KK,   <U+FB01>lled with
dilute sulphuric acid (15 per cent. by volume of acid), and con
taining two glass vessels, G, G,, which are partly <U+FB01>lled with mer
cury. These masses of mercury, G, G, can severally be connected
with the poles of a Daniell’ s battery, D, by platinum wires, the
upper parts of which are kept from contact with the mercury by
means of <U+FB01>ne glass tubes.        In the circuit there is a commutator,
W, by which these connexions may be reversed, so that each
mass of mercury may be successively polarized with hydrogen.
On each mass of mercury <U+FB02>oats a bundle of glass tubes, B, B,
Which are about 2 millims. in diameter and are open both at
the top and at the bottom.          About 300 of these tubes form a
vertical bundle 60 millims. in height and of the same diameter,
and are held together by platinum wire.             In the axis of the
bundle   a glass  rod is  fastened,  which  plays the  part of the stem
of a piston. The lower half of the bundle <U+FB02>oats in the mercury,
while the upper is immersed in the acid and is quite <U+FB01>lled with
it. The bundle <U+FB02>oats freely upon the mercury and remains
vertical because the glass rod is clamped in a metal U-shaped
rod, the lower ends of which are not free but <U+FB01>xed to the lower
surface of a double horizontal lever, which is movable about a

Thus the bundles may be said to hang to it upwards as the scale
pans downwards,       and keep each other in equilibrium.            By
means of the vertical stirrup V, the rod s, and the bent lever z,
the oscillating motion of the lever may be converted into a rota
ting one of the <U+FB02>ywheel R ; on the axle of the <U+FB02>ywheel is another
bent lever 2, which moves the commutator.         The whole has a cer

tain resemblance to some marine steam-engines.                If, now, by
means of the binding-screws 0', a" the whole be connected with a
Daniell’s element, one mass of mercury is polarized with hydrogen
and the other with oxygen.            On the <U+FB01>rst side the capillary con
 stant, the capillary depression in and between the tubes, and thus
 also the force by which the bundle is driven upwards is increased
 by 0'35 of its value, and this bundlerises ; exactly the reverse is
 the case on the other side.         The wheel begins to turn; after a
 complete excursion, the current is reversed by the commutator
 and the action begins again in the opposite direction.
     The machine works silently, without sparks, and with very
 feeble currents, therefore very economically.           It once worked
 <U+FB01>ve days and nights with a single Daniell’s cell.          The number
 of turns, which was 108 in a minute, of course decreases when
 the sulphate of copper is exhausted*.
      The working-power of such a machine, which is driven by ca
 pillary forces, is entirely independent of the volume which it
 occupies, and depends alone on the variation of the surfaces of
  contact of the two liquids.        This may be readily calculated from
  the well-known law, that the work of capillary forces is propor
  tional to the variation of the surface and is independent of its
  shape.      If, for instance, the E. F. P. of the surface of mercury
  has successively the values 0 and one Daniel], it may be easily
  calculated from the numbers above given that the work is equal to
                           O'Ol x S kilogrammetres,
  if  S is the variation    of the surface in square metres.
  II.    Disengagement     of Electricity and Polarization with Capillary
                                   Phenomena.
      Experiment has shown that capillary phenomena allow us to
   transform mechanical work into electrical.           Any arrangement
   which, when a current passes, produces a motion can conversely
   serve as electromotor.        Helmholtz has deduced this reciprocity
   for electromagnetism        and induction from the principle of the
   conservation of force; his demonstration may without much
   trouble be put into a somewhat more general form.               We have
   here apparently something similar to induction.
       If, for instance, instead of the battery a galvanometer be con
   nected with the electrocapillary engine which has just been
   described, and the wheel be turned by the hand, it will be seen
   that the needle de<U+FB02>ects ; the deflection continues as long as the
   turning of the wheel ; the direction of the de<U+FB02>ection changes with
   the direction of the rotation.
      * This machine, as well as the above-named electrometer, is made by M
   Jung, mechanician,    of Heidelberg.

288                 M. G. Lippmann        on the Connexion between
    These currents may be produced and measured in a simple
manner.
    The apparatus described above (page 285) was used for the
measurement.      The poles at and B were respectively connected
with a re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer' of 2000 turns. To make an
experiment, the reservoir of mercur    A was either raised or low
ered;   the level of the mercury G Gywas    altered thereby, and a
throw of the needle produced. Alterations in level of a few mil
limetres were suf<U+FB01>cient to make measurements;       otherwise cur
rents are obtained so strong that a needle which is not astatic
strikes against the stops. When the level is raised, the surface
of contact of the mercury and the acid in M increases.          The
galvanometer then indicates a current which proceeds through
the dilute sulphuric acid from the increasing electrode to the
other.    On sinking, the direction of the current is reversed.
   Experiments were made with various heights of lift and with
different glass tubes.   Let a be the observed de<U+FB02>ection of the
galvanometer, l the height of the lift, r the radius of the tube;
all the numbers found satis<U+FB01>ed the condition

de<U+FB02>ection in scale-divisions for an increase of surface of     square                 1
millim.    It was found that uo=0'55 on the scale. To express
this number in electromagnetic measure, the ends of the galva
nometer wire were connected with the ends of coil above which       a
a  second coil was placed      this latter was traversed
                                ;                             current        by   a
whose intensity amounted to 4'5 in absolute-electromagnetic
measure.     The potential of the two coils on each other (as
given     by
           Professor   Kirchho<U+FB02>) amounted to 23,223,000. When
the current in the second coil was opened, an induced current
was produced in the <U+FB01>rst which de<U+FB02>ected the mirror through
57 divisions.      Moreover the resistance of the galvanometer
together  with   the induced coil was compared with        known re          a

  To make this clearer we may call to mind that, according to
Weber, the electrical equivalent of water is 00098 milligr.
Hence an increase of surface of 1 square millim. would disen
gage a quantity of electricity which would decompose almost
130 milligrammes of water.
   In order to have the de<U+FB02>ections proportional to the quantities
of electricity,the currents must, of course, have an in<U+FB01>nitely short
duration compared with that of the swing of the needle. With
this view the reservoir of mercury was provided with a cock,
which was only opened for a short time alter a complete raising
or lowering. Moreover small displacements were employed;

                                                               given   a
glass tube,   the displacement   of the  mercury   exceeds    certain  a
amount, because with this length the resistance of the thin
layer of acid between the glass and the mercury, and which
forms    apart of the circuit, becomes larger, and the discharge
slower.
   The same electrical    currents may also be very simply pro

respectively connected with the terminals of     galvanometer, the

 put in communication with the earth, the wire 2 becomes charged
 with free negative electricity, as was established by means of
 Thomson’s electrometer ; the deflection of the electrometer may
 become as great as if its poles had been connected with a Da
 niell’s element. It is at the same time observed that the depres
  sion of the mercury in the glass tube is greater than when the
 circuit is closed; in other words, the constant of capillarity is
  greater than before.   Now the increase of the electromotive force
  between mercury and dilute acid, with a simultaneous increase of
  the constant of capillarity at the common surface, is just what is
.called polarization by hydrogen: the phenomena can then be
  thus represented :—
   If  by mechanical means the surface of contact between mercury
 and acid water be increased, the mercury thereby becomes polarized
 with hydrogen.
    On this may be based a Very striking experiment which may
 be made with the capillary electrometer.         If by blowing or by
 suction with the mouth the atmospheric pressure over the mer
 curial column be varied, the column of mercury in the <U+FB01>ne point
 can be moved without exertion—this, however, only so long as
 there is metallic contact between a and             If this contact be

 suddenly broken, the column of mercury at once becomes im
 movable, as        ifwere frozen.
                         it            This may be thus explained.
 On blowing, for instance, the surface of mercury begins to in
 crease;     thereby becomes polarized, and the increase of the
              it
 capillary constant produces an increase of the capillary pressure
 which cannot be overcome by the lungs.           The exact opposite               is
 the case with suction.
    On the same phenomena             based an apparent disturbance
                                              is
 observed in capillary experiments, namely         slow decrease of the
                                                       a
 constant of capillarity, as has been shown                  by
                                                      Quincke for mer
 cury  in water.    If, for instance, mercury    be  allowed   to ascend
 ina   moistened capillary tube, the surface of the mercury in the
 tube     increased and
         is                        is
                               thereby polarized.     Now polarization,
 as is well known, diminishes with time, <U+FB01>rst rapidly, afterwards
 continually more slowly. In accordance with this            decrease of  a
 the constant of capillarity      observed.
                                        is    A similar thing happens
 when    adrop of mercury“       brought into water: in <U+FB02>attening on

 shown that when mercury             contained    in

 produces an alteration of the capillary constant.      But when a

        On the Measure of Work in         the Theory   of Energy.      291
circuit is closed, the polarization, capillary constant, and depres
sion are constant.
    By “increase of the surface of contact” of mercury and di
lute acid two things might be understood—(1) moistening fresh
parts of the mercury which had hitherto been dry, or (2)
further recession from each other of parts already wetted.              In
all the above phenomena the second is to be understood.               This
can be shown by the following simple experiment.
    On a dry surface of mercury a broad drop of dilute sulphuric
acid is placed, which is then removed by a pipette, so that only
a. wet spot remains.        If this spot be perforated by an iron point
it polarizes and contracts immediately. But we only see a dis
tortion of the entire surface, such as would take place upon the
surface of a stretched caoutchouc balloon upon which was a
damp spot and from which air emerged.              The individual details
at what is ordinarily the jagged edge of the spot, as well as the
outlined part of the dry surface, remain separately recognizable
during the distortion, as if they had been drawn upon a caout
chouc membrane; and after the polarization has ceased they
return to their old position.
    On Young’s view, according to which the constant of capil
larity is regarded as a super<U+FB01>cial tension, the result last
adduced (namely, that when the circuit is open the constant
increases on expansion) would be simply expressed thus—that
the surface of mercury behaves like an ordinary elastic
membrane, the tenion of which increases when the membrane
is stretched.

and    the        throughout which that force is overcome
             distance
(Theory of Heat, 1871, p. 87).
  “Fs is the work done by the force F acting on the body
while it moves in the direction of F through a space .9” (ibid.
p . 89).
   Interpreting the latter of these sentences by the former, it is
clear that in the case considered the resistance offered to the
action of the force F is treated as exactly equivalent to, and as
capable of being represented by, F.    The question arises, there
fore, What is F?
   The phrases “ the absolute force,” “ the force acting at a
point,” are so constantly in use among us that we are apt to
lose sight of their purely conventional character.
   Force can only be measured by its effects ; and in order that
force may produce any e<U+FB02>‘ect, it must operate throughout an
interval of time.   As a matter of fact F is the amount of mo
mentum generated by a force acting uniformly during a unit of
time; and what F truly represents is the force acting on a body
during a unit of time*.    If, therefore, F can be accepted in any
degree as the representative of the resistance offered in the above
case, it must represent the resistance o<U+FB02>'ered in a unit of time.
Thus, if we adopt the above de<U+FB01>nition of work, it follows from
the simple rules of arithmetic, not less than I trust that I have
already shown it to result from sound mechanical principles,
that the work done by the force F acting during the time T is
FT,    and    not
                    T    as,   if   the measure of work above proposed
were admissible, it would be, supposing the body to move from
rest        the in<U+FB02>uence of the uniform force F throughout the
time ulpder
        .
   2. Suppose abody whose mass is M to be moving in a certain
direction with a velocity VI, and that the force F is applied to
the body in the direction of its motion.   Then, as before, if F
be uniform we shall have
                           Fs=§(MV’-MV§),
wheie s represents the space described by the body while the
velocity changes from V. to V; and putting V=Vl +v, we shall
have
                        work=Fs=%M(v9+2vVl).                  .   .   .   .   (a)
We thus arrive at the entirely inadmissible conclusion, that
while the body moves through the space      the work done
                                                        .9,

force generates equal amounts of momentum in equal times.

measure of work, the resistance offered by the body to the action
of the force, will be greater when the body has an initial velocity
Vl urging it in the direction in which it is solicited by the force
 (in which case V1 and n have the same sign), than it has when
the body moves from rest,-—nay, more, that when the space a

                                                                 12)   is
small, the resistance offered in the former case (which will be
Mvvl) will be in<U+FB01>nitely greater than in the latter, when        will            it
be éMve.                                .
   3. The vice, or rather one vice of the measure of work above
proposed,       manifest from the formula (a) of the preceding
                is
article.   In the production of what      there offered as the work
                                                 is
done     by
          the force,     clear that the initial velocity (that which
                         it   is
the body had before the force began its work) has been an
agent.
   This view of the subject may be further illustrated as follows.
Suppose that V1     the velocity of the body at the beginning of
                         is
the time       T,
             and that throughout       the motion of the body
                                            T                                             is
counteracted by the uniform force        which   F,
                                                  of such amount
                                                            is
as to reduce the body to rest at the end of T.   Under these cir
cumstances two things will have been done during the time      :—               T
    (1) Space will have been described.
   (2) Velocity will have been destroyed.
   The space manifestly has not been described                   by
                                                        the agency of
the force, the only product of which          the destruction of velo
                                                  is

   4.     may be an object of curiosity to some of my readers to
know how the above measure of work came to be adopted.             On
this point     Iam  sorry to be unable   to afford them   very precise
information.      If my memory serves me rightly, Helmholtz, in
his paper in Taylor’s Scienti<U+FB01>c Memoirs’ for 1852, treats
                              ‘                                                  it

a thing “ well known           ;”
                             and in Thomson and Tait’s        Natural       ‘
Philosophy’        appears to be regarded in the same light.

   If this passage may be taken to afford the true clue, we can
hardly fail to be struck with the originality of the suggestion
that a   great philosophical principle may be established                                 by
“ engineering evidence.’           ’

    I    have already said that “force can only be measured                               by
its effects,” which in popular language      tantamount to the
                                                       is
assertion that force     measured
                               is      the  work by  does.  The        it

  a rehabilitation, indeed, of a very peculiar character; for the
  Leibnitzian 'measure is not supposed to supplant, but to stand
  pari gradu with its Newtonian rival.
                             I
      If the views which have endeavoured to unfold are correct, it
  will follow that the received measure of work, of whatever use it
  may be in simple cases (say when a body moves from rest) as
  affording within certain limits some rude indications, must be
  regarded as utterly inadmissible for every scienti<U+FB01>c purpose.

  XXXVI.        Determination of the Absolute Value of the Siemens Mer
      cury Unit of Electrical Resistance.       By F. KOHLRAUSCH’X‘.
         HE    more <U+FB01>rmly the general adoption of the Siemens Mer
             cury Unit is established, the more desirable is it that the
  ratio which it bears to the scienti<U+FB01>c standard of resistance, the
  so-called Absolute or Weber’s unit, should be known as accu
  rately as possible.       A determination of this ratio forms the
  subject of the present communication.             It was carried out in
  the year 1869 in the Magnetic Observatory at thtingen, by
  means of, on the one hand, the splendid instruments for
  galvanic and terrestrial-magnetic measurements which the Ob
  servatory and Physical Institute of Gottingen have acquired
  through the labours of W. Weber, and, on the other hand, of
  mercury units which Mr. Siemens kindly had prepared specially
  for this purpose.
      I    may be allowed to premise that           I   have shunned no
  labour in order to reach the degree of precision attainable
  with such means; and in assuming that this degree of precision
  has really been reached,      I  believe I am warranted by years of
_ practice in observations of this nature, no less than by the <U+FB01>nal
  agreement of the results.
      The outcome of the investigation is that the Siemens unit is
  equal, in absolute measure, to
                              9717000000 mm',

      So far as space allows, I will communicate the observations
  in such a form that the calculation can be checked, and that it
   may be possible to form an opinion as to the degree of accuracy
  that has been reached.        Independently of the consideration that,
  in the case of any fundamental and dif<U+FB01>cult measurement which
  lays claim to precision, the fullest detail is desirable in the pub
  lication of the numbers obtained, there are in the present case
  two additional reasons for this course.           In the <U+FB01>rst place, the
  observations relate to a perfectly new and important principle
  of galvanometry established by Weber, in connexion with which
  the methods of observation with a swinging needle, likewise
  introduced by him but not widely adopted as yet, have been
  employed.       In the second place, my results render probable an
  error of about 2 per cent. in the unit of resistance adopted by the
  British Association ,- and, in view of the authority attaching to the
  Committee on Electrical Standards, which was appointed by so
  eminent a body and Composed of the <U+FB01>rst scienti<U+FB01>c names, and
  which moreover disposed of considerable external means, there
  seems need for the greatest caution, but also in the end for more
‘
  distinct emphasis.      A series of objections will be found pointed
  out further on against the determination of the British Asso
  ciatiou.
      I.  On the various Methods for the Absolute Measurement           of
                                  Resistance.
      The determination of the absolute resistance of a conductor
  by magnetic means always leads to the problem of measuring
  the current which a known electromotive force producas in the
  conductor, the unit current being taken as that which exerts
  externally the unit of magnetic action, and the unit of electro
  motive force being that which is developed when a conductor is
  moved against magnetic forces under certain normal conditions*.
  We Owe to Weber four methods for making such determinations
  of resistance, the principles of which may be brie<U+FB02>y stated as
  follows :—
      In the <U+FB01>rst-1', the electromotive force induced by the earth’s
  magnetism in a moving conductor (earth-induction apparatus)
  of known dimensions is made use of ; and the strength of the
  current is found from the de<U+FB02>ections of a short magnetic needle
  surrounded by a multiplier-coil, also of known dimensions.             We
  only require     to know   in  addition  the   time of  vibration  of  the

    effects compensate each other.   It     however, essential that the

    with a small needle, or the multiplier must be constructed     very                    of
    considerable dimensions.
         The second method*, which          the one employed in the fol

                                            any other considerations, in
     whatever degree we please.         This possible, inasmuch as the

     according to the laws of magneto-induction, by the damping
     effect which the multiplier exerts on the swing of the needle.
     But in addition   it   is now needful to know, not only the time
     of vibration, but also the moment        inertia
                                                   of    the needle, as well

                                              is             both the ratio

      of the magnetic moment of the needle to the earth’s magnetic
      force and the distribution of magnetism in the needle have been
    ascertained   by observing its power of de<U+FB02>ecting       compass,           a                it   is
    possible from these data and the dimensions of the multiplier to
    calculate the electromotive       force developed in the latter by
    the motion of the needle.         The strength of the current thus
    produced, and consequently the resistance of the multiplier,                                     is
    found    byobservations of its damping effect.
       The last process    1consists in setting    multiplier of known

    de<U+FB02>ection of  a  small magnetic needle suspended within it.
       In each of these methods, whenever great accuracy           aimed                  is

    II.  On the Determination of the Absolute Unit of Resistance
        carried out at  the instance of the British Association*.
    The fourth method was proposed by Weber in two different
modi<U+FB01>cations: in one the axis of rotation of the inductor is
horizontal; in the other it is vertical.         In the former case .it is
necessary to know the ratio of the two components of the earth’s
mayneticforce, inasmuch as the horizontal component acts on
the needle, while the inductive action is due to the vertical
component. By the second modi<U+FB01>cation of the method, which
was the one adopted by the Electrical Standard Committee of
the British Association, this knowledge may be dispensed with,
since the horizontal component occurs, in consequence of its
 inductive action, in the numerator of the expression for the
 strength of the current, and as acting on the needle it enters
 into the denominator; so that we have here what is in truth a
 most elegant, and, so far as the principle is concerned. a very
 simple process, independent both of the earth’s magnetism
 and of that of the needle, and presenting only the mechanical
 dif<U+FB01>culty of the production of a constant and rapid motion of
 rotation.
     But, on the other hand, another obstacle presents itself in
 practically carrying out the second modi<U+FB01>cation, the effect of
 which comes out most clearly in the work of the “ Committee,”
 and appears to call for more serious consideration than the
 necessity of making a determination of dip.          In this arrangement
 the suspended needle, as well as the earth’s magnetism, exerts an
 inductive action; and consequently it is needful to eliminate the
 e<U+FB02>'ect of the former.     If a small magnet, such as is commonly
 used for galvanometric      measurements, were to be employed in
 conjunction    with the  multiplier of 300 millims. diameter adopted
 by the Committee, its own inductive action would far exceed that
 of the earth’s magnetism.        If the effect of the former was to he
 treated as a small correction, it was accordingly essential to use
 an unusually weak magnetic needle.
     The Committee went in reality very far in this direction—so
far, indeed, that such a weak magnetic needle as they employed
has assuredly never been used for any other measurement. Their
magnet consisted of a steel sphere (thus a mass of magnetically
 the most unfavourable shape possible) of 8 millims. diameter and

 the steel sphere, in order to reduce the torsion to the small
 amount prescribed by the varying elasticity and elastic reaction
 of the silk. Now let a magnetized sewing-needle of the very
 smallest size be conceived of as fastened by a connecting-piece
 about ,% metre in length to a mirror of 30 millims. diameter,
and therefore (according to the drawing) offering a surface of
about 14 square centims. for the action of air-currents, which,
even in a well-closed case, cannot be entirely avoided ; further,
let the whole mass have such a moment of inertia that its time
of vibration is ten seconds (p. 173), while that of the sewing
needle by itself would have been about two thirds of a second,
and we have an idea of the essential part of the magnetometer
acted on by the weak currents of the multiplier, an error of two
minutes of arc in the determination of whose position would
cause an error of 1 per cent. in the result.      Moreover the large
multiplier was revolving in the immediate neighbourhood of this
magnetometer with a velocity sometimes as high as four revo
lutions in a second.
    It appears to be a defect in the otherwise very complete reports,
that, so far as   Iam aware, there has been no publication of the
full details of a series of observations such as would a<U+FB02>'ord
ground for accepting or rejecting the objection that has been
urged above. It is mentioned (page 174) that individual parts
of the lengthy series of experiments were rejected before the
calculation was made, on account of their want of agreement with
others? ; whence it appears that considerable unexplained irregu

through an angle =tan-10'0078=27'           (Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1863, p. 172).
Hence, taking the horizontal intensity=1 '76, we get for the magnetic
moment, M=l . 1‘76 . 156'63 . 0'0078=26000.        But since 1 milligr. of steel
will assume a maximum of permanent magnetism amounting to about 1000
units (comp. also Schneebeli, Progr. des Zitrch. Polyt. 1871—72, Pogg.
Annal. Ergiinzungsbd. vi. p. 150), the above degree of magnetization might
be given to a thin rod of 26 milligr.

          Siemens Mercury Unit       of Electrical Resistance.        299
larities were met with.      In physical
                                      measurements, however, it is
always dangerous to assume that large errors of eaperiment can
only be of accidental origin and are eliminated by a su<U+FB02>iciently
great number of observations.
    Indeed, if we now look at the <U+FB01>nal published results *, they
seem to justify some slight degree of hesitation in accepting them.
These mean values still exhibit di<U+FB02>'erences amongst themselves
which rise as high as 1'4: per cent.    We <U+FB01>nd further that the
slow spins give a mean result which differs by about 0'5 per cent.
from that of the rapid spins.    In like manner the publication
of a few observations belonging to one and the same day (p. 17 5)
makes it possible to form some opinion. Four results are given,
which differ amongst themselves by as much as 2'3 per cent.,
although each of these numbers is obtained by a series of ob
servations extending over about a quarter of an hour and inclu
ding about one hundred scale-readings, from which, if need were,
the least-accordant numbers had already been struck out. An
unprejudiced reader must always have his attention arrested by
 differences as great as these.
    But the discrepancies, amounting in some cases to as much
 as 8'5 per cent., according as the inductor was turned towards
 the left or towards the right, are to me totally unintelligible.
According to     a statement by Mr. Jenkin (Pnggend. Annalen,
vol. cxxvi. p. 387), the explanation of this circumstance lies in
the fact that “the thread, to which the magnet was hung,
exerted a slight in<U+FB02>uence in one direction.”     One is inclined to
conclude from this that there was a permanent torsion of the
thread one way, whereby the de<U+FB02>ection to the two sides would
of course be made unequal.      But in order to explain such differ
ences as occur here, the torsion would have to be great enough
to de<U+FB02>ect the magnetic axis of the steel sphere many degrees
from the magnetic meridian. It is hardly admissible to suppose
that such an oversight was made in suspending the magnet.
Should    it,however, have occurred,   seems to me that the series
                                         it
of observations affected     byought to be rejected; for such
                                it                                       a
want of symmetry would not be willingly allowed even in ordi
nary working, and must be regarded as specially dangerous when
 the spherical form and feeble magnetization    of the magnet are
 considered.    For to say that the magnetic axis of the magnet,
on the permanence of which every thing ultimately depends, was
really permanent within minutes of are, when       did not coincide
                                                     it
 with the direction of the magnetic directive force, would be             a
hazardous assertion.

300         M. F. Kohlrausch   on the Absolute   Value  of the
    Less ground for distrust would no doubt be a<U+FB02>'orded if the
 expression that has been quoted were interpreted as meaning
that a change had taken place, through gradual elastic yielding,
 in the position of torsional equilibrium of the cocoon-<U+FB01>bre, as
 might be the case, for instance, if the <U+FB01>bre had not been sus
pended for a suf<U+FB01>ciently long time.        But even this I do not
like to suppose; for in such a case the observations ought to have
been postponed, or at least the yielding should have been elimi
 nated by means of special observations.
    In short, we can hardly avoid coming to the conclusion that
the feeble magnetism of the needle gave rise to considerable
 discrepancies;   and it does not appear to me allowable to apply
the rules for the calculation of probabilities to such observations
 unless we have explicit proof of the absence of constant sources
of error.
    In any case, however, the probable error of 0'1 per cent.,
 which is calculated for the <U+FB01>nal result, can only apply to the
 scale-readings; to extend it to the entire measurement is pre
 supposing that there were no other sources of error. Even the
 very noteworthy agreement between the numbers found in the
two years 1863 and 1864, which differ by only 0'16 per cent.,
 cannot be regarded as unconditionally decisive.        If we now in
quire   for other sources of error, we encounter    <U+FB01>rst of all the ob
jection raised by Dr. W. Siemens against calculating the mean
 radius of the coil from the length of the wire and the number
 of turns. I think     I  may conclude, from careful experiments
of my own, that this process may be employed without hesita
 tion in the case of thick wires; but the section of the wire
 which we have to deal with here (to judge from the weight and
total resistance of the wire, as well as from the dimensions
 of the coil) cannot have been more than about 1 millim.; so
 that the above objection may perhaps be regarded as not out of
 place.    But, in any case, the error thus arising cannot have
 been great.
    But possibly another circumstance (which is not alluded to
 in the Reports of the Committee, though in general the correc
tions are treated with a comprehensiveness and completeness
 that is worthy of imitation) may have been of greater import
ance.     The support in which the coil revolved consisted of a
“ strong brass frame,” which, as appears from the <U+FB01>gure,
formed within itself a closed circuit.     It is nowhere stated how
the observers convinced themselves of the unimportance of the
currents which the closed inductor must have caused in these
stationary metallic parts when rotating.       No doubt the experi
mental detection of these'currents would have been di<U+FB02>icult ; but

           Siemens Mercury Unit    of Electrical Resistance.      301
exactly on this account the neighbourhood of masses of metal
ought to excite suspicion.
    I  have been unable to avoid a criticism of the method by
which the “ British-Association Unit ” was obtained, since the
question is how to explain a difference the cause of which           I
cannot, to the best of my knowledge, <U+FB01>nd in my measurement.
For the rest, it is not impossible that many of the above objec
tions might fall away if the results of the observations were
published more in detail; and the want of such publication is
the more to be regretted, as it causes a de<U+FB01>ciency in the other
wise in some respects classical reports.
    The question as to which unit of resistance is best <U+FB01>tted for
general use hardly belongs to a scienti<U+FB01>c investigation. For the
sake of Physics itself we can but rejoice in the competition be
tween the Siemens unit and that of the British Association ; for
thereby the best means is afforded of testing the unalterable
ness of both, and this is all that comes into account for scienti<U+FB01>c
application.
    With regard to practice, the position occupied by Mr. Siemens
in relation to telegraphy must have secured a considerable start
 for his unit ; while a no less important circumstance is that the
judiciously arranged and, so far as          I  know, well-adjusted
 Siemens’s    Resistance-scales  have   become widely distributed.
Moreover it can scarcely be denied that the de<U+FB01>nition of the
unit by means of mercury is intelligible to practical men, whereas
the de<U+FB01>nition of the other unit would be intelligible to but few
in the <U+FB01>rst instance.       But further, a considerable additional
 weight must be laid in the scale on the side of the Siemens unit,
 if the other unit, as appears to be the case, does not approach in
                                                      earth-quadrant
 any important degree more closely to the absolute
                                                           second
 than the mercury unit does by accident.        The British-Associa
 tion unit is in reality (even in the view taken of it by the Com
 mittee ; comp. Report for 1864, page 346) not an absolute
 measure but a concrete standard; and for use it is quite imma
 terial whether its degree of approximation to the absolute unit
 amounts to 2 per cent. or to 3 per cent. Lastly, if the possibility
 of reproducing the British-Association unit is to be made to
 depend, not upon a repetition of the absolute measure (see
 ‘
   Report’ for 1864, page 348), but upon the conductivity of
 metals, in which case it is self-evident that the preference would
 be given to mercury, there does not seem to be any reason what
 ever why a column of mercury of simple and convenient dimen
 sions should not be chosen.

    III.         The Absolute Measurement                                     of Resistance by    the method
               of Recoil (Zuriickwerfungsmethode).
    The process described at page 296, as the “ second ” method
of determining the absolute resistance of a circuit consisting of
an earth-inductor and a galvanometer with narrow coils, depends
on the connexion between the coef<U+FB01>cient of sensitiveness of the
galvanometer and the ratio of damping of the vibrating needle.
I intercalate here a demonstration  of this principle, as the ex
pression given by Weber* requires a tri<U+FB02>ing correction.
   The coef<U+FB01>cient of sensitiveness q is the de<U+FB02>ecting moment
which a current of unit strength exerts on the galvanometer
needle, when the latter is parallel to the windings of the coil.
Then, according to the general laws of induction, the electro
motive force which the needle induces in the coil when moving
with the angular velocity                                         in the neighbourhood of the par

        1. The principal share of the uncertainty must be ascribed to
    the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic force T, the per
    centage error of which affects the resistance in a twofold degree.
    The dif<U+FB01>culty of accurately determining this element (a dif<U+FB01>culty
    which is no doubt in general underrated) makes it essential that
    the observations should be carried out in a very completely
    equipped magnetic observatory.                 It is evident also that the
    variations of the earth’s magnetism must be taken into account;
    for the horizontal intensity varies with us to the extent of about
    g per cent. ; so that, without observing the variation-apparatus,
    an error of 1 per cent. might arise in the calculation of the re
    sistance.                            _
        The observatory of thtingen without doubt answers to the
    requirements of the case more completely than any other place,
    inasmuch as the arrangements that have been carried out there
    by Weber for determining the horizontal intensity far surpass,
    in delicacy and convenience, those in use elsewhere. The great
    est sources of error in the absolute measurement unquestionably
    lie in the determination of the moment of inertia and the measure
    ment of distances; in long series of observations of variations
    the change in the magnetism of the bi<U+FB01>lar needle also introduces
    dif<U+FB01>culties that are not inconsiderable.             Essential improvements
    have been effected affecting precisely these points.                   The dis
    tances to be measured are solely those between the suspending
    <U+FB01>bres of magnets, and therefore can be determined with the
    utmost accuracy.       The weights for determining the moment of
    inertia are more <U+FB01>rmly connected with the magnetometer; they

    distance between them.       Finally, the bi<U+FB01>lar magnetometer is
    supplied with a Weber’s auxiliary needle*.
      I   had myself the grati<U+FB01>cation of using these arrangements for
    the <U+FB01>rst time in their entirety, while determining the terrestrial
    magnetic elements at G6ttingen in 1867, and of convincing
    myself of their excellence.    During these determinations, and in
    a subsequent series,          I
                             acquired an accurate knowledge of the
    constants of the instruments and su<U+FB02>icient practice in their use.
        While referring to the next section for the observations them
    selves,  Iwill adduce here two pairs of determinations of intensity,
    from each of which variations in the terrestrial magnetism are
_   eliminated, and which can therefore be directly compared.       The
    following are these values :—
        1867, with an interval of sixteen days, 183960 and 183849 ;
    difference =O'00011.      1869, with an interval of three days,
    1'83860 and 183832 ; difference =0'00028.
       Expressed in terms of the whole, these differences amount
    to 000006 and 000015.       But the error arising from the moment
    of inertia and the measurements of distance is not included in
    these differences; hence for the possible error AT of the hori
    zontal intensity we may take about ten times the above amount
    —that is                    AT          1

In order to eliminate the alteration due to change of tempera
ture, the in<U+FB02>uence of which cannot be directly determined in
large masses of wire, one comparison was made at the beginning

of each set    of observations, and another at the end. As the tem
perature of the air changed but little during the time of ob
servation, this method is in any case adequate.
   The question arises whether the supposition made in the dif
ferential equation (page 302) is correct, namely that the coef<U+FB01>
cient of sensitiveness q of the galvanometer is constant, or, in
other words, that the damping-ratio is independmt of the ampli
tude of the swing.      In reference to the instruments the question
may   be   thus  stated :—Is the multiplier so broad that a lateral
displacement of the needles such as occurs in the vibrations
does not alter the moment of rotation which a current in the
multiplier exerts upon the needles? The question could be easil y
decided.      The horizontal component of the terrestrial magnetism
made the largest are equal to about 3° ; if the damping in these
vibrations were already less than in very small ones, its amount
must considerably decrease if recoil-observations were made with
the vertical component as the inducing force, in which case the
arc of vibration amounts to 7°.          Observation gave :—
             Large arc =3°, ratio of damping =1'74430
                  n      = 70:       n        n        = 1 74255
                              Difference     .    .  .   0'00175
Hence    if the induction were executed with the vertical        compo
nent, a correction    would   be necessary   in our galvanometer which
would amount to a quarter of a division in the smaller are.           As
the correction must be proportional to the square of the ampli
tude, it can from this be calculated that for the horizontal com
ponent it must amount to about 1016-6, a magnitude so small
that it is not worth while to determine it accurately.            In the
sequel no regard is paid to it.
   As regards the induction on each other of the hort currents
arising and ceasing in the terrestrial inductor, brief considera
tion will show that it can exert no appreciable in<U+FB02>uence on the
de<U+FB02>ections; for the extra current which accompanies the prin
cipal current causes no change in the velocity imparted, but
exhibits its in<U+FB02>uence solely in a sudden displacement of the needle,
as I have shown elsewhere*.          From the observations there given
we cannot estimate the extra current at more than 1'5 division;
and that produces an error of at most 0'01 division in our larger        -
are A, which may well be neglected.
   The actual agreement of the three measurements given below
quite satis<U+FB01>es expectation.        It will be found that they differ
respectively from the mean values by 0'14, 0'04, and 0'11 per
cent., which would correspond to a “probable error” in the
result of 005 per cent.        In this indeed are not contained the

errors of the moment of inertia and of the inductor surface—nor
those of the intensity of the earth’s magnetism, except so far
as concerns variations in this magnitude.         On the other hand,
I  have assumed sixfold the above amount as the error.
    I by no means maintain that with such a limit of error all
that is desirable is accomplished; but without constructing en
tirely new instruments, and without erecting special buildings,
it would be for the present dif<U+FB01>cult to exceed this limit.
    It must moreover be considered that an alteration of g, per
cent. in the conductivity of the ordinary metals is produced by
an alteration of 1° in temperature.

THE   “ On the Action of Electricity on Gases—No. II.      On the Elec
tric Decomposition of Carbonic—Acid Gas.”         By Sir B. C. Brodie,
Bart., D.C.L., F.R.S.
    In my previous experiments the maximum amount of ozone
obtained by the action of electricity upon pure oxygen passed
through the induction-tube of W. Siemens was about 20 per cent.,
an amount which, under the conditions of the experiment, could
not be exceeded.     It occurred to me as possible to replace the 80
per cent. of oxygen unaifected by the action of the electricity by
an indi<U+FB01>erent gas, and thus to e<U+FB01>ect the complete conversion of
oxygen into ozone.       This idea was the starting—point of the fol
lowing investigation.
    When pure and dry carbonic-acid gas is subjected in the induc—
tion-tube to the electric action, a certain proportion of the gas is
decomposed into carbonic oxide and oxygen, a. portion of which
appears in the form of ozone. _ The presence of this ozone may be
detected by its odour and the characteristic oxidations produced by it.
    It was a. point of fundamental importance to determine whether
the ozone thus generated was the same in kind as that formed by
the action of electricity on pure oxygen, and Whether the oxidations
referred to were exclusively due to it; for it was quite conceivable
that under the peculiar circumstances of the experiment other sub
 stances capable of producing similar oxidizing effects might be
formed.      Now, in the investigation before referred to,   I had dis
 covered certain quantitative reactions of ozone by which this sub
 stance is discriminated from all other known gases, and by which
its presence may be detected and its quantity estimated. The
 electrized carbonic-acid gas was examined by the aid of these re
 actions.

310                        Royal Socier   :—
   When theelectrized gas was passed through a solution of hy
posulphite of soda, it was found to undergo a diminution in volume
                                             ”
equal in amount to twice the “iodine-titre      of the gas, the mean of
twelve experiments giving for this value 1'9, the “titre” being 1.
The oxidation also effected in the solution of hyposulphite of soda
was equal to three times the “titre” of the gas, the mean of a set of
<U+FB01>ve experiments giving for this value, according to one method of
estimation, 2‘72, and according to a second and more exact method
3'01.    Again, the oxidation e<U+FB01>ected by the electrized gas in a so
lution of protochloride of tin was equal to three times the “titre”
of the gas, the value found as the mean of six experiments being
2'77.    In two experiments also, in which both the oxidation and
contraction were respectively estimated, 2'75 and 2-69 were the
values found for the oxidation, and 1'9 and 1'8 the values found
for the contraction, the “titre” of the gas being in all cases assumed
as 1.   These experiments conclusively demonstrate the identity of
the ozone formed by the action of electricity upon carbonic-acid gas
with the ozone similarly generated from pure oxygen.
   Various experiments were instituted with the view of ascertain—
ing the conditions most favourable to the conversion of a large
proportion of this oxygen into ozone. The conclusion at which          I
arrived was that the greatest proportion of ozone in relation to
the total oxygen was produced when a rapid current of dry car
bonic-acid gas was acted upon at a low temperature by electricity
of feeble tension.    When these conditions were realized, it was
found that 75 per cent. of the total oxygen eliminated in the in
duction-tube by the decomposition of the carbonic—acid gas could
readily be converted into ozone, but that it was dif<U+FB01>cult to pass
this limit. This amount corresponds with the formation of agas
constituted of ozone and oxygen in the proportion of two units of
ozone to one unit of oxygen, the matter of the oxygen being thus
distributed 253 + E”. In several experiments, nevertheless, this limit
was considerably exceeded; and a table is given of nine experiments,
in which the amount per cent. of ozone ranged from a minimum of
76'6 per cent. to a maximum of 855 per cent. This latter amount
corresponds with a gas constituted of ozone and oxygen in the pro
portion of four units of ozone to one of oxygen, thus 4534-13”.       In
this case the ratio of the total oxygen present to the titre of the
gas is 3‘5 ; if the whole oxygen were converted into ozone, the value
of this ratio would be 3.
   These experiments, taken in connexion with those described in
my previous communication, leave no room for reasonable doubt
as to the composition of the unit of ozone, which is the triad form
of the element oxygen, and is to be symbolized as 23, an hypothesis
henceforth to be regarded as conclusively demonstrated.         This re
markable discovery has many important bearings upon chemical
theory, especially in relation to the problem elsewhere raised by me
of the true nature of the elemental bodies and the constitution of
the unit of the element chlorine, which ozone so closely resembles
in its chemical properties, and which is also a triad element sym—  .
bolized as ax’.

    “ On the
              Quantitative Analysis of certain Alloys by means of
the Spectroscope.” By J. Norman Lockyer, F.R.S., and William
Chandler Roberts.
    The authors, after referring to experiments which showed clearly
that the spectroscope might be employed to detect minute differences
in the composition of certain alloys, proceed to give an account of
the researches which they had instituted with a view to ascertain
the degree of accuracy of which the method is capable.
    The image of an electric spark passing between the unknown
alloy and a <U+FB01>xed electrode being thrown by means of a lens on the
slit of the spectroscope, the phenomena observed were found. to
vary with the composition of the alloys ; and further, by arranging
them together with known check—pieces on a suitable stand, and
bringing them in turn under the <U+FB01>xed electrode, the compomtlon of
the unknown alloys was determined by comparison with the known
check-pieces.
    The shape of the electrode ultimately adopted was that repre—
sented in the sketch; and these pieces were held
in their places by suitable metallic clips. Special 5
attention was then directed to the adjustment of ;
the length of the spark, which was found to ma- ,‘
terially in<U+FB02>uence the phenomena. The method
adopted consisted in placing the variable elec—
trode in the <U+FB01>eld of a <U+FB01>xed microscope having
 a 3- 0r 4—inch objective, and adjusting the sum
 mit of this electrode to coincide with the spider—lines of the eyepiece.
    After a series of experiments on alloys of zinc and cadmium of
 various compositions, the results of which were shown on a curve,
 more extended trials were made with the gold-copper alloy em
 ployed in coinage, which was peculiarly suited to these researches
 in consequence of the known method of assay having been brought
 to so high a state of perfection (the composition being determined
 with accuracy to the <U+FB01>npart of the original assay-piece of about 7
 grains), and from the fact that reliance can be placed on its ho
 mogeneity.     The paper is accompanied by a series of four curves,
 which show the results of experiments, and in which the coordi—
 nates are given by the ordinary method of assay, and by the spec—
 troscopic readings.
    The chief practical advantage which appeared to <U+FB02>ow from this
 inquiry was that, if it were possible to replace the parting assay
by the spectroscopical method, a great saving of time in ascertain
 ing the value of gold bullion would be e<U+FB01>ected.

                          It should be remembered, in considering the curves of sun-spot

      1. “ On the- Permian Breccias and Boulder-beds of Armagh.”
  By Prof. Edward Hull, F.R.S., F.G.S., Director of the Geological
  Survey of Ireland.
      In this paper the author described certain breccias occurring in
  the vicinity of Armagh, which he referred, both on stratigraphical
  and physical grounds, to the Lower Permian series, considering them
                                         ”
  to be identical with the “ brockram      of Cumberland and the breccias
  of Worcestershire and Shropshire.        The lower beds rest on the de
  nuded surface of the Lower Carboniferous Limestone, and consist of
  a breccia of limestone pebbles in a reddish sandy paste, sometimes
  becoming a bedded calcareous sandstone with pebbles.        These beds,
  which are 10-12 feet thick, are overlain by soft rudely strati<U+FB01>ed
   conglomerate and Boulder-beds of subangular and rounded blocks
  of grit, felspathic sandstone, vein-quartz, and limestone. In some
  places the breccia graduates up into the overlying Boulder-beds ; but
   sometimes its surface is eroded. These beds are overlain by Boulder
   clay of the Drift period. Within the city of Armagh well-borings
   &c. have revealed the existence of New Red Sandstone above the
   Breccia and Boulder-beds.       In the author’s opinion the only agent
   which could have brought the blocks of Silurian and Old-Red-Sandstone
   age found in the Boulder-beds from their place of origin is <U+FB02>oating
   ice. The author further referred to the extensive denudation which
   the Carboniferous beds have undergone in Armagh, and also alluded

       2. “Geological Notes on Griqualand       West.”   By G. W. Stow,
    Esq., F.G.S.
       The geological results of a journey made by Mr. G. W. Stow and
   Mr. F. H. S. Orpen from the Orange Free State into Griqualand
    West are communicated by Mr. Stow in this paper, with numerous
    carefully executed sections and a geological map based on the survey
    map prepared by Mr. Orpen for the Government.         From the junc
    tion of the Riet and Modder rivers (south of the Panneveldt Dia
    mond—<U+FB01>elds) westward to the junction of the Van and the Orange,
    over the Great Campbell Plateau to Griquatown, Ongeluk, Matszip,
    Potgieter, the Langeberg, Witte Zand, and to Kheis and the Schurwe
    Bergen, the track traversed three degrees of longitude, but nearly
'
    300 miles of road. The return route north-east to Mount Huxley
    and Daniel’s Kuil, and eastward to Likatlong, on the Hart or Kolang
    river, was nearly as long; and its results form part of the present
    communication.     A subsequent portion of the journey up the Hart,
     across to the Vaal, dOWD the valley by the diamond-diggings of

 Hebron and Klipdrift to the Panneveldt, will he treated of in
 another paper.                            .
    From the Modder, <U+FB01>rst south-westward and then westward, to the
junction of the Veal and Orange, the olive shales of the Dicynoolon
 or Karoo series, traversed frequently by igneous rocks, form the
 country, and are seen in some places to lie unconformably on older
rocks. The shales reach to the edge of the Campbell Randt, on the
other side of the Orange River, and have been, it seems, to a great
 extent, formed of the debris of those old hills.    The oldest rocks of
the locality are seen cropping out here and there in the gorges at the
 foot of the Randt, and consist of metamorphic rocks, greatly denuded,
 on which the massive and extensive siliceo-calcareous strata of the
 Great Campbell Plateau lie unconformably.         These latter and the
 breccias of their slopes are coated thickly with enormous travertine
 deposits.   Beyond the Plateau, at Griquatown, a long parallel range
 of jaspideous rocks comes out from beneath the Campbell Plateau,
presenting a wonderful group of yellow, brown, chocolate, and red
jaspers, with magnetic and other ironstone, and beautiful seams of
blue and yellow crocidolite.      The southern portion of this range has '
long been known as the         “ Asbestos Mountains ” and the “ Doorn
berg.”     Igneous rock-masses occur around Ongeluk, west of the
Jasper range: and then bright-red jasper rocks crop up near Matsap,
succeeded to the west by the parallel quartzite range of Matsap,
 and again by other bedded jaspers, which seem to lie in a synclinal
of the quartzite rocks, which come up again in the Langeberg. These
are succeeded by lower rocks, consisting largely of sandstone, grit,
 and quartzite, with more or less pervading mica, as far as the ourney
 extended in the Schurwe Bergen, also parallel to the former ranges.
The maximum thickness of the successive strata is calculated by the
author at 24,000 feet; allowing for possible reduplications, the
minimum is regarded as not less than 9000 feet.            The details of
 strati<U+FB01>cation, successive upheavals, denudation, nature and origin of
the salt-pans, escarpments, river-valleys, and other features were
treated of by the author, who has supplied a very large collection of
specimens illustrative of the phenomena observed in the line of
march, and of his numerous sections, maps, and sketches.
    3.  “ On  some Bivalve Entomostraca, chie<U+FB02>y Cypridinidm, of the
Carboniferous formations”. By Prof. T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The larger forms of bivalved Entomostraca are not rare in the
Carboniferous Limestone; and some occur in certain shales of the Coal
measures.     Professors Phillips, M‘Coy, and De Koninck have <U+FB01>gured
and described some specimens.        The collections made by M. J. Bos
quet, F.C.G.S. (Belgium), Mr. Joseph Wright, F_G.S. (Cork, Ireland),
and Mr. J. H. Burrow, M.A. (Settle, Yorkshire), and submitted to
the author and his friend Mr. J. W. Kirkby, have elucidated many
obscure points in the history of these old Entomostraca.      Other spe
cimens from Scotland, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and the Isle of Man,
communicated by many friends, were treated of in this paper.
   The Entomoconchus of M‘Coy proves to have the Cypridinal cha

                  Intelligence    and Miscellaneous     Articles.         315
meters of anterior sinus and gape; and, besides E. Seauleri, at least
two species have been determined. A very closely related genus,
O<U+FB02>'a, has also been indicated.          M‘Coy’s “Daphnia primwva” be
longs to Cypridina proper ; and twelve other Carboniferous species
have been established. A modi<U+FB01>ed form of carapace, without any
exact modern analogue, characterizes the new genus prriclinella,
with seven species. De Koninck’s genus prm'della (restricted) has
seven species; and a form intermediate to this and Cypridina is
described as prridellina, with eight species.             Sulcu'na (with two
species) is an exaggerated modi<U+FB01>cation of prridella.              prrella of
De Koninck (restricted) has two species.           The recent Bradycinetus,
Sars, and Philomedes, Lilljeborg, appear to have their prototypes in
the Carboniferous Limestone, with one species each.                Rhombi-na,
a new genus, is a less easily recognized Cypridinal form, with an
Irish and a Belgian species.
    The recent Polycope, Sars, belonging to a different family, and
represented by three Carboniferous species, was the last described in
the memoir; but Oytherella, belonging to an allied group, is known
in the Mountain-limestone           and Coal-measures;        and Leperditia,
Entomis, Beyrichia, Kirkbya, and other palaeozoic genera, abound,
together with forms referable probably to Oythere, prris, O'undona,
 &c., which will be treated of in a future paper.

    ON THE    PERMANENT MAGNETISM or STEEL.                  BY E. BOUTY.

    Wiedmann has, more pro<U+FB01>tably, brought the phenomena in ques—
 tion into comparison with those which depend on elasticity in solid
 bodies, especially the phenomena produced by torsion.              Although
 this comparison does not constitute a theory properly so called, it
 has the advantage of expressing a real physical relation; for tor
 sion modi<U+FB01>es the magnetic state of a bar, and modi<U+FB01>cations of that
 state can in turn modify the torsion to which the 'bar has previ
 ously been submitted.          A great number of facts relative to mag
 netization or demagnetization are conveniently interpreted in this
 system ; but the following phenomena can only with very great
 dif<U+FB01>culty be adapted to it.
    It has long been known that a certain temporary magnetism can
 be superposed to a permanent magnetism opposite in direction, and
 that the latter may reappear, sometimes even integrally, after the
 in<U+FB02>uence of the external forces has ceased.            For example, if a bar
 of magnetized steel be submitted to the action of a current too
 feeble to demagnetize it entirely, during the action of the current a
  diminution of the magnetism of the bar is observed, which may go

 316           Intelligence    and Miscellaneous    Articles.
 so  far as to the apparent reversal of the poles, whereas after the
 cessation of the current the bar is found to be still magnetized in
 the original direction.
    The following fact, which       I have observed, appears to me still
 more curious.     I  take a bundle formed by the combination of four
 square bars of the same length.         It is tempered hard and magnet
 ized immediately; its magnetic moment is measured; lastly it is
 taken to pieces, and the magnetic moment measured of each bar
 separately.    It is found that the sum of these moments is very
 considerably greater than the magnetic moment of the bundle.           If
 the bars be united in twos, the sum of the moments of the pairs is
 intermediate between those of the whole bundle and of the sepa
 rate bars. When, <U+FB01>nally, the bundle is reconstructed, the magnetic
 moment also returns to its former value.
    In this experiment the bundle, which, innocent of all anterior
 magnetization, has only once undergone the action of the magnet
 izing spiral, is in an absolutely normal condition at the moment of
 the <U+FB01>rst separation; and no new force appears to intervene, to
 which one might attribute the observed augmentation of the per
 manent magnetism.          It is true that, in separating the bars, we
 suppress their reciprocal reaction; and we know that in each of
 them it acted in the opposite direction to that of the permanent
 magnetism; but this suppression can only have eifect on the tem
 porary magnetism.        Thus, even in a normal bar, a certain degree
 of permanent magnetism is found to be superposed to a temporary
 magnetism of the opposite direction.
    It would therefore be very natural to recur to an old hypothesis,
according to which the condition, whatever it may be, which corre—
 sponds to the conservation of a certain permanent magnetism, is
 communicated, in the conversion into steel or in the tempering,
 only to a certain number of molecules, the others retaining their
former properties.       If  we remark (1) that the laws of the tempo
rary magnetism of steel appear to be identical with those of induced
magnetism in soft iron, (2) that the development of permanent
magnetism is eminently variable from one sort of iron or steel to
another, and for one and the same sort according to sometimes in
signi<U+FB01>cant physical conditions, we shall be led to examine more
closely than has been done yet the consequences of this hypothesis.
    Let us consider a cylinder of elemental dimensions, but of very
great length relatively to its diameter.          Let us suppose the two
kinds of magnetic elements scattered at random, but in a determi
nate proportion, in all parts of the cylinder, and a magnetic force
F acting in the direction of the axis. If the molecules devoid of
coercive power existed alone, the cylinder would take a magnetic
moment kFAv,—Av representing the volume of the cylinder, and
la a coef<U+FB01>cient which depends on the density of the molecules.        In
the same way the molecules endowed with coercive power, if the
                                                                       '
were alone, would take a magnetic moment qFAv.
    If we suppose the coe<U+FB01>icients of induction la and q constant
 (which is sensibly true for small values of the inductive forces), and
 designate by c a coefficient dependent on the grouping of the mag

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             317
netic elements of both kinds, we <U+FB01>nd that the magnetic moment
communicated to the cylinder by the force F will be, taking account
                                 W
of the reactions of the two sorts of molecules.
                          M-_ k+ q+ 20kg FAv ,    .
after the cessation of the force F, they will retain   a moment
                           m __  (1 +clc)2 FAv.
                             _ql_—02kq
This quantity is what is ordinarily called the permanent magnetism.
The temporary magnetism, which disappears on the cessation of
the force    F, is
                             p. = M —- m  = kFAv.
     It is thus seen that the two coef<U+FB01>cients of temporary and per
manent magnetism ordinarily determined are not quantities of the
same kind. The quantity q, analogous by the part it plays to k, is
obtained by dividing the ordinary coef<U+FB01>cient of magnetism by
 (1 + ck)2
  l—czlcq'
     It is evident, and veri<U+FB01>ed Without difficulty in a particular case,
 that the total magnetic moment M is intermediate to those which
 would be produced by the same force F acting on two cylinders
 equal to the- <U+FB01>rst, each comprising only one sort of molecules, with
 the same total density.        But it is not the same with the residual
 moment m, which, for a given value of q, is as much greater as the
 coef<U+FB01>cient k of temporary magnetism itself is greater; and as the
 coef<U+FB01>cient lc relative to soft iron is enormous, it is seen that the ad
  dition of a certain quantity of soft iron to the hardest steel may
 augment the residual magnetism of the latter.       The employment of
 armatures of soft iron at the extremities of magnetic bundles, in
  order to increase their power, comes to the support of our asser
 tion. We will also remark that, according to M. Jamin, the varie
  ties of steel the richest in carbon and tempered the hardest do not
  present the greatest residual magnetic moments—which is what
  should be if the molecules of soft iron in them are very rare, as we
  must suppose them to be. We reserve to ourselves to return to
  this subject subsequently, and to develop the results by calcula
  tion and experiment.
      The complete theory of the phenomena of breaking, on which we
  were engaged in a preceding communication, required a rigorous
  knowledge of the two functions of temporary and permanent mag
  netism of steel.     Let us consider two bodies, A and B, submitted
   to one and the same inductive force, but united invariably the one
  to the other.    After the cessation of the inductive force the body
  A remains under the action of B, and conserves, apart from the re—
  sidilal magnetic moment which would remain to it after its separa
  tion from B, a moment (of the same or the contrary direction) pro
  duced by the in<U+FB02>uence of B, and which is permanent only so long
  as the union between A and B subsists. This magnetic excess might
  be named the subpermanent magnetic moment.          In the experiment

of the bundle broken parallel to the axis the subpermanent magnetism
is contrary in direction to the permanent magnetism.      It would be
the same in direction in the case of a needle broken in a plane per—
pendicular to its axis, and of which the two fragments were sepa
rated or reunited end to end. This result has been veri<U+FB01>ed by ex—

   CONTRIBUTION        TO THE THEORY        OF   THE MAGNETIC FORCES.
       '
                                BY M. STEFAN.
   The memoir consists of three parts. In the <U+FB01>rst, “ on the cal—
culation of the magnetic forces of electric currents,” it is pointed
 out that the equivalence between the forces emanating from mag
 nets and those from electric currents is complete, not only, as is
 known, in the exterior, but also in the interior space, and that in
this the action of a magnet on a point outside of its elements must
be di<U+FB01>erent from its action on a point within them.         A simple rule
is given for the calculation of the electromagnetic forces; and it is
specially noted that the interior of a sphere round which currents
run in parallel circles presents a homogeneous magnetic <U+FB01>eld, that
the same property belongs to an ellipsoid, and that such systems of
          furnish galvanometer- and magnetizing spirals of constant
purrents
  orce.
    In the second part, “on the action of a magnet on an internal
point,” this problem, already touched upon in the <U+FB01>rst part, is
treated more in detail.     It is shown that the action of a magnet on
an internal point is not completely determined by the magnetic
potential—that other forces besides those given by that potential
are operative, di<U+FB01>ering in direction and quantity according as the
point aifected is within or without a molecule of the magnet. These
forces are dependent on the form and arrangement of the molecules,
and so constituted that the sum of their works on a <U+FB01>nite path is =0.
Only when the magnetism of the molecules consists of electric cur
rents is the latter generally not the case, and the principle of the
conservation of energy requires the entrance of induction currents.
    The third part has for its subject the “ theory of magnetic in—
duction.”    The basis of it is formed by the theorem, found in the
second part, of the action of a magnet on a point in the interior of
its molecules. On the foundation of this theorem the general equa—
tions of the theory of magnetic induction and of the theory, iden
tical with it,of dielectric polarization can be immediately written,
and, with the aid of some theorems found in the <U+FB01>rst part, some
problems on the magnetizing of        asphere, an ellipsoid, a ring, be
solved without further calculation.       Several series of experiments
are then discussed, from which        results that all sorts of iron and
                                     it
steel admit the same maximum of magnetization, that the resist—

        ON APECULIAR OCCURRENCE OF CRYSTALLIZED SILICIC ACID.
                   BY THEODOR H<U+FB01>BENER, OF ROSTOCK.
                              I
        About a year since, was treating some Go'litz browncoal for the
    purpose of exhibiting microscopic products with Schultze’s macera
    tion—<U+FB02>uid (a solution of chlorate of potass in nitric acid).   After
    the coal had been suf<U+FB01>ciently treated with the liquid, and then
    extracted with ammonia and alcohol, the microscopic examination
    showed in the residue a quantity of minute crystals the form of
    which (six—sided columns pointed at both) ends) left no doubt that
    they consisted of crystallized quartz.     By repeated ignition of
    the residue and treatment with hydrochloric acid, they could
    be readily isolated.    From, at the most, 1 kilogramme of the
    coal,  Ihave in this way obtained about 3 grammes of the crystals.
    I  have not at present found them in other browncoals.      Unfortu—
    nately     I
              have not yet succeeded in obtaining some of the sand which
    perhaps overlies the browncoal ; but as the residue above mentioned
    contains scarcely any grains of ordinary quartz, it might be supposed
    that, by the in<U+FB02>uence of the products occurring in the gummifaction
    of coal (humic acid &c.), solution of siliceous salts in<U+FB01>ltrated into
    it may be decomposed, whereupon the silicic acid is separated as
    crystals.    My attempts (only on a small scale, it is true) to separate
    silicic acid in crystals by protracted digestion of humous substances
    with solutions of siliceous salts have been without result.            I

      The brightest lines in the spectrum of this nitro-body are the
   two sodium—lines ; they appear, however, not as in a quietly burn
   ing alcohol <U+FB02>ame saturated with vapour of sodium, but strikingly
   widened, so that frequently the space between them vanishes.             So
   far as the observations extend, this appears to be dependent on the
   violence of the explosion.        Also the more refrangible sodium-line is
   always the most widened.
      Characteristic of the spectrum are two brilliant lines in the
   green, which are indistinct on each side, and of which the
   more refrangible is the more intense.            Further, there are two
  bright broad bands, striking in the red and orange, sharply de<U+FB01>ned
  towards the red end, and dying 0E towards the blue. Besides
  these lines and bands, we succeeded in measuring a faint streak in
  the red, another in the green, and a faint but sharp line in the green.

     On the 14th of March, 1874, one of the <U+FB01>rst of European astro—
 nomers, Dr. Madler, Professor and Director of the Dorpat Obser
 vatory, entered into rest. 'His life had been one of ceaseless and
untiring activity, and he was well known for his general astrono—
mical labours; but the work that will carry his name to posterity
perhaps more than any other is the Mappa Selenographica, bearing
his name conjointly with that of Beer.            From the announcement
of his death sent by his widow, Minna v. Madler, to his friends, we
learn that during the last sixteen months his sufferings were very
great from frequent attacks on his brain, to which he ultimately
succumbed when about completing his eightieth year. His works
were numerous; and we fully enter into the feelings of the widow
in desiring, according to her own expression, “a blessing on his
works and peace to his ashes.”

IF       under   the prime angle of incidence H linearly polarized
        light be re<U+FB02>ected from a plane surface, the plane of polar
ization making the angle a with the plane of re<U+FB02>ection, the two
components polarized perpendicular and parallel to the plane of
incidence will have a difference of phase of a quarter wave-length,
and the ratio of their amplitudes is determined by the tangent
of the prime azimuth B, by the equation                                 .

The re<U+FB02>ection is named p0sitive when the component polarized
parallel to the re<U+FB02>ection-plane         is accelerated relatively to that
polarized perpendicular      to that plane, negative when it is retarded.
The former case is the         more   frequent.    With metals, positive
re<U+FB02>ection only has yet been observed.
    If the prime angle of incidence and prime azimuth are known,
then from these the difference of phase and the ratio of the am
plitudes, or the intensity of the components of the re<U+FB02>ected
light, for any angle of incidence can be calculated by means of
formulae which, although of quite a different form and found in
a   very different     way, represent      the phenomena     equally   well,
within the possible errors of observation.             (Conf. Pogg. Ann.

  The prime angle of incidence and azimuth are thus deter
mined :-—The di<U+FB01>'crence of phase of the two components polarized
parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence are, in any
way, made equal to a high multiple of                                   i       The two then give
linearly polarized light, which being extinguished by an analy
zing Nicol prism, its plane of polarization can thus be determined.
    The light originally polarized linearly, and after re<U+FB02>ection ellip
 tically polarized, can be converted into linearly polarized (l) by
being again re<U+FB02>ected once or more times under the same condi
tions,       by annihilating the difference of phase by a plate of
crystal  of variable thickness      plate of calc spar cut perpendi

Jamin determined in this way the optical constants of several

    On the table of the horizontal circle, instead of the plane
 glass, two parallel plane mirrors of the substance to be examined
 are fastened with their ends overlapping, so that one of them by
 re<U+FB02>ection of the cross-threads can be placed perpendicular to
 the axis of the auxiliary telescope or the collimator, and its
 parallelism be tested by turning it through 180°.        The mirrors
 were, by    means  of  the  arrangement    described in  Pogg. Ann.
 vol. cxlii. p. 198, pl. 5. <U+FB01>g. 3, placed parallel, being fastened
 with wax on the two sledges, the faces pressed against each other,
                                               '
 and the sledges drawn asunder.
     Frequently they were only fastened with wax upon a horizontal
 glass plate, and one of the mirrors rotated until the twice re
 <U+FB02>ectedimage of a distant object (a tree on the horizon) was coin
 cident with the object itself.
   If   from a heliostat sunlight be let through the slit of the col
 limator, and polarized in the azimuth i45°, to the parallel mir
 rors, and the light re<U+FB02>ected under the prime angle of incidence
 be taken up by the analyzing Nicol in the azimuth        i<U+FB01>,   a dark
 streak appears in the spectrum, which can be made to fall on a
 determined Fraunhofer line by changing the angle of incidence
 H and the azimuth B. The reading of the incidence-angle gives
 directly the prime angle of incidence H for the Fraunhofer line
 in question, and equation         the corresponding prime azimuth.
     From the determinations with positive and negative angles of
 incidence. and positive and negative azimuths the mean was
 taken.
     The defects of the method consist in the dif<U+FB01>culty of obtaining
 Nicol prisms with even surfaces, which, brought in front of the
 objective of the collimator and the telescope, would give distinct
 images of the slit, and, further, that the incident and the issuing
 ray make with each other an angle which may amount to as much
 as 1°.     For this reason  I   have mostly omitted the observing
 telescope between the eye and the analyzer.
     On turning the polarizing Nicol from the azimuth +45° to
  —45° the image of the collimator-slit was displaced towards the
 cross-thread of the auxiliary telescope ~8', as shown by the
 image of the thread re<U+FB02>ected by the plane glass.      This alteration
 of the angle of incidence -—8' had to be taken into account in

frequently alter the optical qualities of a mirror very consider
ably; and it is probably much more dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain faultless
re<U+FB02>ecting surfaces than transparent substances free from veins.
Besides these irregularities, disturbance is occasioned by un
avoidable scratches and roughnesses of the surface, which act
like a diffraction-grating.   As in the case of coef<U+FB01>cients of elas
ticity or electric conducting-power, properly the value of H and
B must be determined for each de<U+FB01>nite portion.
    The following Table (p.326) contains a series of determinations
of the prime angle of incidence and prime azimuth for Frann
hof'er’s lines C, D, E, F, and G, executed by the method of
parallel mirrors; and the numbers in general, so far as they
relate to substances previously investigated,      agree with the
abovementioned measurements by Jamin and Haughton.
    The gold was burned in upon plate glass by heating a solu
tion with essential oil; copper and nickel were electro-dcposited ;
the cobalt consisted of polished pieces such as occur in com
 merce.     Antimony, bismuth, zinc, and tin were cast and po
lished plates; aluminium, brass, and platinum were rolled; the
silver was obtained by Martin’s process (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxix.
 1866, p. 55) from a solution several months old.
     For re<U+FB02>ection in glass, the silver was <U+FB01>xed on the long, pa
 rallel sides of two Fresnel parallelepipeds, which had an acute
 angle of 56° 52' and the exponents of refraction

     In the calculation of the prime azimuths, account is taken of
 the rotation of the plane of polarization on the entrance into and
 the issue from the glass. To the selenium a re<U+FB02>ecting surface
 had been imparted by pressing cold plates of glass on the melth
 substance.
     The most perfect surfaces were possessed by nickel, silver,
 gold, and selenium.
      Where not stated otherwise, the re<U+FB02>ection took place in air;
  and shortly before the observation the metals had been polished
  with clear buckskin and a trace of jeweller’s rouge.
      With the exception of gold, in the case of all the metals here
  mentioned the prime angle of incidence (polarization-angle) di
  minishes with the diminution of the wave-length——the reverse
  of what takes place with transparent bodies. The. diminution,
  however, is Very di<U+FB02>'erent with the different metals.
      The prime azimuths partly increase, and partly diminish as
  the wave-lengths become less. Platinum shows a maximum
  value for the line D, cobalt and bismuth for the line E, and tin
  for the line F.                            -

               and prime Azimuth    of Fraunhofer’s Lines.         327
     According to my earlier investigations (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxviii.
p. 562, vol. cxxix. p. 211, 1866), a prime angle of incidence and
a prime azimuth can still be spoken of when the light is re<U+FB02>ected
in air from a thin, transparent lamina of metal lying on a glass
plate.      The difference of phase and ratio of amplitudes of the
components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of
re<U+FB02>ection can thence be calculated for any angle of incidence,
just as with non-transparent metallic mirrors.
     I have therefore determined the prime angle of incidence and
prime azimuth on transparent laminae of gold, platinum, and
 silver, as well as on non-transparent metals.          (See Table II.)
 They lay on plates of mirror-glass, the back of which was blackened
 with oil-colour in order to destroy their re<U+FB02>ection.
     The gold was obtained by Wernicke’s process (Pogg. Ann.
vul. cxxxiii. p. 183, 1868).     The silver was obtained thus: from
the same freshly prepared Martin’s silvering-<U+FB01>uid, on strips of
the same plate glass, dressed simultaneously in the same manner,
I   let silver be precipitated during %, 2, 3, 6, and 15 minutes
respectively.       The thicker layers 'were converted into silver
iodide,- and from the colour of the iodide layer the thickness of
the silver was calculated(cf.Pogg.Ann.      vol. cxxix. p. 208, 1866).
The platinum was a mirror, such as have been sold in France
for some years past.       The thickness given of the gold and pla
 tinum layers is only from a very rough estimate.
     The observations on the thinnest layer of silver, as it was not
everywhere of equal thickness, deserve but little con<U+FB01>dence.
The rest of the mirrors of silver, however, were most perfect and
homogeneous, and re<U+FB02>ected the light strongly, although they
had merely been rinsed with water and dried but not polished
with leather.
     The polarization-angles of the uusilvered glass plates were
 calculated from the refraction-exponents of the surface, deter
 mined by a peculiar process.       The glass for the gold layers had
 exactly, and   that  for the platinum very nearly, the same expo
 nents of refraction as for silver.
     These measurements agree substantially with the results of
 the previous investigations, which yet were made with only one
 coloured red light.      They show that the prime angle of inci
 dence and the prime azimuth increase as the thickness of the
 metal increases, but in different degrees for different colours.
 The values of the prime azimuths for the different Fraunhofer
 lines approximate to one another with increasing thickness of
 silver, recede from one another with greater thickness of gold.
     With silver the prime azimuth exhibits a maximum value for
 a certain Fraunhofer line, which maximum moves towards the
 red end of the spectrum as the thickness is augmented.

             and prime Azimuth of Fraunhofer’s Lines.               329
   Gold, in transparent as in non-transparent layers, has a mi
nimum angle of incidence for Fraunhofer’s line F.
   The values of H and B were not altered by magnetizing or
electrizing the metallic mirrors.
   By polishing and pressure of the layer of metal the value of
the prime angle of incidence is augmented, that of the prime
azimuth diminished.        I  have observed this also with other me
tals than those cited in Tables I. and 11., for example cobalt and
nickel. The treatment may vary much for the different colours.
    Only with re<U+FB02>ection from silver into glass was there shown a
slight increase of the prime azimuth through pressure, which,
however, was not exerted in this case on the re<U+FB02>ecting front sur
face of the metal, but on its hinder surface bounded by the air.
   The effect of pressure, or of the distance of the particles of
silver, upon the constants of re<U+FB02>ection was most strikingly exhi
bited with silver-collodion <U+FB01>lms, for which           I  am indebted to
M. F. A. Nobert, of Barth. They were obtained by the process
used in photography—a glass plate coated with collodion (con
taining iodide of potassium?) being immersed in a silVer solu
tion, browned by exposure to daylight, and made black by a
strong solution of pyrogallic acid.        After drying, the plate was
strongly heated,    in  order to make  the  collodion <U+FB01>lm adhere more
<U+FB01>mly to the glass.
    Such a collodion <U+FB01>lm contains uniformly distributed <U+FB01>nely
divided particles of silver, is opaque even when very thin, but
re<U+FB02>ects too little light for the double-re<U+FB02>ection method.          With
Babinet’s compensator and homogeneous red or blue glass, trial
was made with re<U+FB02>ection in air :—

   An ordinarily transparent collodion <U+FB01>lm, rendered opaque by
<U+FB01>nely divided particles of silver, shows therefore a slight altera
tion of the prime angle of incidence, but a great alteration of the
prime azimuth, which approximates to that of pure silver.
   If by a slight pressure the silver particles are brought nearer

330        Prime Angle of Incidence of Fraunhofcr’s Lines.
to one another, the prime angle of incidence and prime azimuth
change very considerably in the same direction, only more than
with a layer of pure silver particles on glass.     Moreover, with
a suitable pressure and re<U+FB02>ection in air the prime azimuth may
be nearly the same for blue as for red.
   Whether the silver-collodion <U+FB01>lm he unpolished or polished,
the particles of silver have always a different distance from one
another, or a different distribution, in the vicinity of the glass
surface and in the vicinity of the free surface bounded by air;
so that the re<U+FB02>ections in air and in glass are not directly com
parable.                                      _
   According to the distribution of the silver particles in the
interior of the collodion, which varies of course with the nature
of the exposure in its preparation, the prime angle of incidence
and prime azimuth vary for different colours, and the silver col
lodion-<U+FB01>lm (photographic plate) exhibits various colours under
the incidence of natural white light, which may be different for
re<U+FB02>ection in air and in glass.
   Precisely similar is the behaviour of substances with so-called
surface-colours, with which H and B increase and diminish with
increasing wave-length.
    Cartbamin, dried in a red-coloured transparent layer on the
faces of the above-mentioned      parallelepipeds, exhibited, with
re<U+FB02>ection in the same substance, di<U+FB02>‘erent re<U+FB02>ection-constants in
different parts, according as the distance between the particles
was less or greater.     The parallel-mirror method showed, for
light of the given wave-lengths 7c (in millionth parts of a milli
metre), the following mean values of the prime angle of inci
dence   H and prime azimuth B :—

   It cannot be surprising that the values of the re<U+FB02>ection-con
stants change with the distance of the opaque particles, since
the transparency and colour of thin layers of the same metal
also depend on it. (Faraday, Exp. Res. iv. 391.)
   The dependence of the optical properties of a quantity of more
or less transparent and non-transparent particles on the distance
of the latter seems to me hardly compatible with the assumption
that absorption and dispersion of light are determined solely by
a mutual vibration of the molecules of the body, occasioned by
the motion of the tether.

The origin of it was so peculiar, that to the reader it could not
but seem a desirable thing to establish a more general result,
and point out some connexion between it and previous special
results of the same kind.  This has been done in one direction
by Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher, in a paper recently read before the
Mathematical Society of London, in which he transforms the

  P.S.—Since the above       was written I have read part of an en
cyclopaadic paper by   Stern    in Crelle’s Journal, vols. x. and xi.
(1832-33), entitled “Theorie der Kettenbriiche und ihre An
wendung,” and have to-day arrived with surprise at the third
chapter, the <U+FB01>rst division of which has the same title as Mr.
Glaisher’s paper above referred to, viz. “ Verwandlung der un
endlichen Producte in Ketteubriiche.”        In this Stern establishes
a general formula of transformation, and then proceeds to give
examples illustrative of it.   Among these are <U+FB01>ve forms of con
tinued fraction for
                            g, and <U+FB01>rst of the <U+FB01>ve the very fraction   we
have been speaking of as Sylvester’s.    Stranger still, in a foot

of hydrogenium      ”   before we could arrive at any conclusion
regarding the condition of the absorbed hydrogen.                Subse
quently Professor Tait made a series of determinations on the
“Electrolytic Polarization of Palladium Electrodes”*, devising
a new and ingenious method for the purpose.           Although at dif
ferent times subsequent to my <U+FB01>rst communication the problem
of determining the physical constants of hydrogenium recurred,
as my attention was in the meantime directed to the speci<U+FB01>c heat
of carbon at high temperatures, no progress was made with the
investigation until September 1872, when the results of my pre
liminary experiments were communicated to the Philosophical
Magazine, under the title “ Note on the Speci<U+FB01>c Heat of Hy—
drogenium.”       In that note it is stated that by means of a spe
cially constructed calorimeter the speci<U+FB01>c heat of hydrogen in
palladium is found to be 3'1 per atomic weight, nearly identical
 with that of gaseous hydrogen. The present paper deals with
 some of the physical constants of hydrogenium, more especially
 with the speci<U+FB01>c gravity, speci<U+FB01>c heat, and coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion.
    Graham, in his celebrated paper on hydrogenium, made many
 determinations of the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the occluded hydrogen
 by observing the increase of length of palladium wire after being
 fully charged, thus <U+FB01>nding the cubical expansion, and from it
 deducing the weight of unit volume of the absorbed hydrogen.
    From experiments made in this way he found the speci<U+FB01>c gra
 vity to be nearly 2. Afterwards he discovered the value was
 about three times what it ought to be, from a contraction of
 length occurring when palladium wire is used. This he con
 <U+FB01>rmed by the use of alloys of palladium that resist this contrac
 tion, and <U+FB01>nally regarded the speci<U+FB01>c gravity as 0733. No
 determinations    were made when the palladium was partially
 saturated; and he rejected the ordinary process of taking speci<U+FB01>c
 gravities, because of the continual evolution of gas preventing
 exact weighings being taken in water.
    In the experiments to be detailed a cubical mass of the metal
 was charged with hydrogen by electrolysis, taken at different
 times during the progress of the saturation and weighed in air
 and in water.     If the mass was allowed free exposure to the air
 for several hours, little dif<U+FB01>culty arose from the evolution of gas
 when immersed in water, and accurate results could be obtained.
    From the experimental numbers the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the
 absorbed hydrogen was calculated by the well-known formula

drogen in the eight determinations of Table             are examined,I.                           it
will be observed no material alteration can be said to take place
in the speci<U+FB01>c gravity during the course of the saturation, regard
being paid to the dif<U+FB01>culty of getting accurate weighings imme
diately after removal from the electrolytic cell.         All the above
determinations were made as quickly as possible after the palla
dium was taken from the pole of the battery.           The mean of the
results gives    speci<U+FB01>c gravity of 0620 for the hydrogen.

and the alteration of volume         equivalent to saying that, in the

 dium would take was given to _N0.          experiment; and this very

 nearly accords with  the  composition Pd“ H’.       In treating masses
 of palladium the above proportion was never exceeded.
    As all the above experiments were made with bar palladium
 increasing to saturation,      was necessary to <U+FB01>nd similar values
                                        it
 for  a mass decreasing  from   saturation, the hydrogen being ex
 pelled    by
            heating.   For this purpose        piece of plate palladium

 was employed.     When the plate was fully charged for the <U+FB01>rst
 time, and the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the hydrogen found as                the                 in
 previous experiment,   the  result  was    density  ofa 0621:   the plate
 in this case contained 0'21 grm. of hydrogen.               When por                      a
 tion of the hydrogen was expelled                       by
                                             heat, leaving 0'127 grm.

                     Constants  of Hydrogenium.                 337'
in the plate, the density of the hydrogen was 0633; and where
only 0'0495 grm. was left, the value was 0615. The mean
speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the three different alloys of plate was 0'623,
nearly the same as previously found for the bar.        After palla
dium has- been treated with hydrogen and heated, the metal
becomes porous, and often blisters, thus rendering speci<U+FB01>c-gra
vity determinations very uncertain.       The curious discovery of
Graham, that the strain on the particles of palladium produced
by wire-drawing induces such a curious shrinking in the length
after the hydrogen has been expelled, suggests the importance
of investigating how a saturated piece of bar would resist the
action of sustained pressure or tension.    If the formation of the
alloy is attended with _an increase of volume in excess of the sum
of the volumes of the constituents regarded as in the solid state,
then partial decomposition ought to occur under great pressure.
Experiments on this subject are left over for the present. After
palladium has been used in the above experiments, and the last
trace of hydrogen is removed by heating, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity is
found to have diminished from 12'0359 to 119546.             If this
<U+FB01>nal value is taken in calculating the mean density, then the
average result of the three hydrides of plate is 0707 for the
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the condensed hydrogen.       The mean of the
<U+FB01>rst and second series of experiments is thus 0664. A piece
 of palladium, weighing 31 grms., was fused in a lime crucible
with the oxyhydrogen-<U+FB02>ame; and the speci<U+FB01>c gravity was now
found reduced to 105549. When this sphere of palladium was
hydrogenized    for a very long time (twenty-four hours) only
0'0684 grm. of hydrogen was absorbed, and by further treat
ment nothing was added.       The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the hydrogen
in this case was 0655, nearly identical with the mean of the
values found from the plate experiments.
                     Speci<U+FB01>c-Heat Observations.
    The apparatus devised for this purpose is represented in the
<U+FB01>gure (p. 338) ; the calorimeter used in the experiments had the
 form A. It held conveniently 100 grammes of water, and was
 inserted in the middle of a stout brass envelope, thoroughly
 exhausted of air, the whole being placed in the middle of a large
 cylindrical tin vessel (E), having an outer annular compartment.
 The tin vessel was <U+FB01>lled with water; and a constant current from
 the town supply was kept circulating by means of a. siphon
 through the outer chamber.      To the thermometer a ring of thin
 sheet india rubber was attached as a stirrer, and, when it was
 removed before the immersion of the palladium, was placed in
 the little tin tube represented at B. Immediately before an
 observation the whole apparatus was moved below the steam_

338                 Mr.   J. Dewar   on the  Physical
bath (C), and the palladium dropped in.             This arrangement of
the calorimeter is very convenient in a small chemical labora
 tory, where uniformity of temperature cannot be easily com
 manded.      The constancy of the radiation in the calorimeter
 makes the correction for cooling very exact.
    The same arrangement of the calorimeter is employed for re
 gistering very small amounts of heat by placing in A bisulphide
 of carbon or chloroform, packing the middle and outer compart
 ments of the tin vessel full of pounded ice, and covering the
 exposed surface with sawdust.          The thermometer is now pro
 vided with a thin sheet-copper stirrer, instead of the india-rubber
 one formerly used.       The rate of cooling is in this case deter
 mined once for all for a range of 5° above zero, and plotted in
 a curve..   From this curve the correction for the radiation is de
 termined for all subsequent experiments.
    Two series of experiments were made. In the <U+FB01>rst series bar,
 and in the second plate palladium was used, three different by
 drides* of each. The experimental results are given in Tables
 II. and  III.
    In the case of the bar the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the occluded hy
 drogen increased as the charge diminished, the extreme values
 being 3'79 and 5'05.        Similarly with the plate the values are
greater, and have a wider range, viz. from 3'93 to 5'88.              These
results are calculated in each case for the heat given to the

calorimeter by the hydride in excess of that of the original
palladium.      But if a comparison is made between the different
hydrides in both series of experiments, then the speci<U+FB01>c heat is
found to exhibit no such regular increase as in the former series.
In the bar the extreme values are 3'21 and 3'77, and the mean
of the three results is 3'47. The plate, on the other hand, gives
a range of from 2'7 to 3'94, the mean value being 3'31.          The
amount of variation in the plate is very great as compared with
 the bar, and is clearly due to some secondary action taking place.
    The increase of speci<U+FB01>c heat for small charges of hydrogen,
when comparison is made with pure palladium, is clearly due to
some regular increase of the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the palladium, or of
the hydrogen, or of both individually or conjointly.       The mere
fact that we have only a very small weight of hydrogen relatively
 to the amount of palladium does not explain the anomaly, be
 cause a small amount of hydrogen by the second mode of com
parison does not yield such high results.        The observational
errors, although    much   greater  when we  are dealing with small
 quantities, cannot be expected to fall always in the same direc
 tion ; and thus we are forced to admit there is some regular
 sequential change taking place in the relations of the hydrogen
 and palladium.
    The palladium, after use, is not found to have increased in
 speci<U+FB01>c heat, but rather the reverse; so that the explanation can
only rest on some altered condition of the bodies when united.
 So far as my experiments have led me, 1 am inclined to regard
this alteration as a kind of molecular dissociation that increases
 with diminished charge of hydrogen.      I  am led to this conclu
 sion from observing that the rate at which palladium loses hy
 drogen at constant temperature is dependent on the amount
 present increasing with diminished charge. In conducting these
 speci<U+FB01>c-heat experiments, a greater variation in the results has
 always been observed when small charges were under experi
 ment, especially in the <U+FB01>rst two or three determinations.       This
increase of dissociation may be explained in part from the for
 mation of regular cracks or channels in the mass of palladium,
 together with the effect of pressure resulting from the contrac
 tion of the external layers of palladium from the loss of hydrogen.
 It is, however, premature to discuss the cause of this increase
 of dissociation untila    more extended series of experiments     is
 made, and the behaviour of the alloy to pressure    is investigated.

                      Coe<U+FB02>icient  of Expansion.
    As the observations on the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion had to be
made with the same pieces of palladium used in the former ex
periments, the only method that could be employed was to weigh
the hydride in distilled water of different temperatures, as Mat
thiessen did in his well-known paper “' On the Expansion of
Metals and Alloys” (Phil. Trans. 1866), and to deduce the
mean cubical expansion from the difference of weights and the
known density of water.      Experiments made in this way require
great care in execution, and, when every precaution is taken, are
yet liable to considerable variation.     Any difference of tempe
rature in different portions of the water in which the alloy is
weighed at the time of the observation, causing currents in the
<U+FB02>uid, or the condensation of moisture on the <U+FB01>ne platinum wire
used to suspend the substance, renders the results useless. But
in this case the dif<U+FB01>culties are greatly increased from the minute
bubbles of hydrogen that are apt to accumulate at any angular
point of the mass, and must be rem0ved by suddenly depressing
or lifting the mass. . After making a great many observations in
this way, it became clear that the method would not yield results
of very great accuracy when applied to the case of palladium
containing hydrogen ; in the mean time the results obtained are
provisionally stated.    Generally a mass of palladium containing
hydrogen nearly equivalent to the atomic proportion Pd8 H2,
yields the following values for the mean coef<U+FB01>cient of cubical
expansion   :—             O       0
                 Between 0 and 50             0000058
                 Between 0 and 80             0000066
    The cubical expansion of palladium being 0'000033, we may
 say the alloy with hydrogen is just twice as great.     If the ex
pansion of Graham’s alloy is assumed to be equal to the sum of
the expansion of the respective volumes of the constituents, then
 the calculated result for the cubical expansion of hydrogen is
 0'000246, a number about one and a half times the coef<U+FB01>cient
 of exPansion of mercury.
    With a fused mass of palladium containing a small charge of
 hydrogen, the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion was found to be 000048,
 and the calculated value for the occluded hydrogen became then
0'00059.
              Absorption   of Hydrogen   at a Red Heat.
    Graham’s theory of the rapid passage of hydrogen through
 palladium at high temperatures, assumes at <U+FB01>rst a direct absorp
 tion of the gas, and then a transmission of it by a kind of
 “ cementation                That an absorption of hydrogen takes
                 process.”

342        M. F. Kohlrausch     on the Absolute   Value of the
place with its attendant increase of volume at high temperatures
may be shown as follows :—
   Take a strip of thin sheet palladium, 4 or 5 centims. long
and about 5 millims. in breadth, clamp it <U+FB01>rmly by the end in
a suitable support so that the strip is free to vibrate, and insert
it edgeways in the middle of a hydrogen-<U+FB02>ame burning from a
nozzle about a millimetre in diameter.        If the palladium is now
depressed into the inner dark cone, it immediately begins to vi
brate, producing a low musical note.
    If the <U+FB02>ame be extinguished by stopping the current of hy
drogen for an instant, or allowing the gas to <U+FB02>ow, the vibration
commences again, and may be kept up without any actual <U+FB02>ame.
    The motion in this position in the <U+FB02>ame is due to the absorp
tion of hydrogen on the cool side next the inner cone, with its
attendant increase of length, producing a bending of the sheet
into the hot portion of the <U+FB02>ame, where the hydrogen is instantly
expelled from the palladium, which is forced to return to its
original position from its natural elasticity.
    The experiments detailed in this paper have been made with
palladium very handsomely placed at my' disposal by Messrs.
Johnson, Matthey, and Co. of Hatton Garden, London; and I
gladly avail myself of this opportunity of thanking them for the
means of conducting this research.

      OR. determining the three fundamental magnitudes, length,
         mass, and time, there Were used the original platinum
metre belonging to the Cabinet for Metals and Machinery in
Glittingen (and kindly lent for the purpose by Professor Ulrich),
a Fortin’s set of platinum weights belonging to the Physical
Institute, and the normal clock of the Astronomical Observatory
 (by which that in the Physical Observatory was regulated).      Oert
ling’s.comparator, which formed the basis of all the measure
ments, was compared with the platinum metre.             It was found
that the parts   of this bar  at  —8°  were  equal to the divisions of
the platinum metre at 0°.
   For measuring the larger distances,      a wooden rod 5 metres   in
length, divided into centimetres and provided with a slider di
vided into millimetres, was used.       The divisions were afterwards
compared    with  the Oertling.     This was also the case with the
divisions of the paper scale which was used for observation.

   Professor Klinkerfues had the goodness to arrange that, du

of the scale of the bi<U+FB01>lar magnetometer at that time 1 found to
be equal to 0000105 in parts of the whole.       The intensity cor

 of Inclination” (Abh. der Gb'tt. Ges. 1853, vol. v. p. 53). The
 surface of the coil is there given at 39216930 square millims.
 From a comparison of the standard then used with the normal
 metre, one part of the former is equal to 100086 millim.; so

     The galvanoscope (Pl. IV. <U+FB01>g. 1 in % of the true size) consists
 of a   multiplier of about 250 coils of copper wire 3 millims. in dia

weighs nearly 200 grms.       The inner one had about 45 million
units of magnetism, the outer one 2 millions fewer.        (It follows
from this that the local in<U+FB02>uence on the inductor, which was

about 5500 millims. distant, amounted at most to the 100,000th
part of the terrestrial magnetism.)
   The magnets lie with two grooves in the double forks of a
stirrup, which hangs to a torsion-circle with a mirror, and half
encircles the multiplier.    The upper horizontal part of the stir
rup   is extended, and bears  at its ends, each at a distance of 100
 millims. from the centre, two small vertical rods, which are in—
tended to support two cylindrical brass weights perforated axially,
for the determination of the moment of inertia. The weights
are each 28 millims. in diameter, and haVe each a mass of 100
grms.     After removing the upper magnet, a small rod may be
fastened in the centre of the stirrup, and the weights may be
placed on it on the top of each other.     By a small sliding weight
not seen in the <U+FB01>gure, the centre of gravity is so regulated that
the superposition of the weights does not alter its position.
   The whole was suspended by a steel wire, about                   i

  The times   of oscillation corresponding to each other were
always  measured with nearly equal arcs, so that   reduction    a                   is

     Now the <U+FB01>rst mode of determination is open to the objection
 that it has not as yet been determined whether the elasticity of
 torsion of     a wire      is entirely independent of its load.                        In the

      it is to be observed that only one part of the directive force de
      pends   on the terrestrial magnetism ; the other is due to the clas
      ticity of the wire.   From the time of an oscillation (16 seconds
      of the suspension alone), the former portion is found to be almost
      exactly equal to half that of the second.      From this there is
      calculated from the time t observed with the are a, the time t0 for

      be nearly 34'4 seconds, and as the distance of the scale was equal
      to 4047 divisions, the correction for the are a divisions is found

   The greatest difference of these numbers corresponds to                              a

VII.   Comparison          of   the Resistance w         with Siemens’   s   Standards.
   The two standards, Nos. 1135 and 1143, each of which con
tained  4mercury units, were guaranteed to be correct at 19°‘4
and 18°‘3 respectively.   The increase of the resistance in the
German-silver wire amounted for 10 to 00004 of the whole.
Hence the ratio,      both were at the same temperature, must
                           if
have been

The di<U+FB01>'erence from the above ratio corresponds to an error of tem
perature of only O°'15, and may therefore serve as     test for the      a
accuracy of the copies and of the method of comparison.

each nearly equal to     Siemens’s units, and which in the deter

subsequently compared with the standards, which had meanwhile
reached me.

    For interpolation two tenths of Siemens unit were necessary.
                                                     a
They  were constructed of two pieces of German-silver wire, sol
dered in lengths of 325 millims. to copper rods.      As    was                    it
found, moreover, that 3250 millims. of the same wire had the

352        M. F. Kohlrausch        on the   Absolute Value of     the
resistance   1 Siemens at + 12°'0, the pieces in question accurately
represent   tenths  at that temperature.
    As the circuit inductor+galvanometer had been brought to
nearly 4 Siemens by the introduction of a small load of copper
wire, a differential galvanometer could be used.               It was exter
nally  similar   to that  described    in  page   345  et seq.    To be quite
free from thermal in<U+FB02>uences, the comparison was made by means
of short currents produced by Weber’s magnet inductor by the
method of multiplication,and which were divided by the two resist
ances and the two galvanometer wires.               The heating by the very
feeble brief currents is    in any case vanishingly small ; at the same
time accidental thermOJelectromotive            forces, which in a circuit
extending over a large space are unavoidable, have no in<U+FB02>uence,
as the induction-currents alternate in direction.                The method
used, especially     with  reference    to  the  extra current   produced in
the inductor, has been described by me in Poggen dortl’ s Annalen,
vol. cxlii. p. 418; and      I  refer to that paper.
    The arrangement of the whole of the instruments is represented
schematically, <U+FB01>g. 2.        C is a stopper commutator with six copper
plates made of ebonite, massive, and very carefully worked.              Near
it are <U+FB01>ve solid clamping-screws, which can be placed in conduct
ing communication with each other by a slider. The connexion of
the other parts is shown by the <U+FB01>gure.            J and G, terrestrial induc
tor and galvanometer, form the circuit the absolute resistance
 of which is to be determined.                                 I
                                        These are closed at by stoppers.
 For comparison with Siemens’s standard, 1 is removed and 2
 stopped.     The standard E is then connected with one, and the
circuit .1 G with the other branch of the differential multiplier D.
 To change them in reference to these branches, it is simply neé
 cessary to take out the stopper at 2 and insert it at 3.             M is the
source of the current, the magnet inductor (which was removed
 during the absolute measurements).              The tenths added to E or
JG    are denoted by 0'1; by sliding and <U+FB01>xing the shunt they
 become ineffective.
    The needles of the galvanometer G were, of course, <U+FB01>xed du
ring the comparison.           It was specially ascertained that the
motion of the inducing magnet in M, which, as i well known,
consists of two magnets with similar poles presented to each
 other, had no action at a distance on the inductor.
    It is useless to detail the experiments, since the errors of com
parison cannot in any case compare with those of absolute deter
 mination. Moreover the example deduced in the memoir already
cited (p. 421) is one of these determinations.
    Nos. Ia. and lb. of the absolute measurements belong to a
 comparison made between them with the provisional standards,
 as the Siemens’s standards had not then reached me.                  11. and

parison had to be made in the air ; and therefore no great weight
must be assigned to it. The British-Association units belonging
to M. Brix (N0. 21) and M. Weber (No. 51) were also compared,

this agreement be compared with the former enormous differ

satisfactory proof is afforded as to the progress in this kind of

             accompanying       paper and letter which came from a
 lady in California P_ The paper, as you will see, is a solution
 of a geometrical problem which, more than twenty years ago,
 excited considerable interest by its discussion in your Magazine.
 The Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, to whom these documents
 were addressed, placed them in my hands ; and at his request                   I
 forwarded them to Professor Sylvester, who expresses the opinion,
 with which       I  entirely agree, that the solution is thoroughly
 sound, and authorizes me to say that he has suggested the pro
 priety of the publication of the papers in your Magazine.                    In
 this suggestion the Vice-Chancellor cordially concurs.

    S1R,—In     Number of the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin
                  a
Philosophical Magazine for the year 1852 or 1862, is a discussion
of a simple geometrical problem by J. J. Sylvester, in which
this gentleman attempts to illustrate a conjectured principle in
the Theory of Geometrical Method.        The problem appears to
have been given out at Cambridge many years before, and to
have excited the attention of some of the <U+FB01>rst mathematicians of
Europe for a number of years. A direct solution of the problem
was demanded ; and after a protracted discussion it was concluded
that none was possible.     Upon that some mathematicians lent
their attention, by a study of the nature of the problem under
question, to discovering some rule by which on inspection they
might be able to tell whether a given problem admitted of only
an indirect solution, a question of some importance in astronomy.
    I have not been able to discover that any direct solution has
been brought forth as yet; so 1 send you this, given to me by a
friend of mine, Mr. Hesse, who solved it in 1842.        I send              it,
thinking   that  every  mistake  cleared  up  in science       stepis   a

            GENTLEMEN,                             April 22, 1874.
                 J. CROLL, in a note to his last paper “On the Phy
     MR.       sical Cause of Ocean-currents’ (Phil. Mag. for March,
     p. 176), charges me with the following inaccuracy :—
        “Dr. Carpenter states that 48 miles per day is the mean
    annual rate of the Gulf-stream in the ‘ Narrows;’ but in the
     Admiralty’s Current-chart, published October 1872, the mini.
     mum rate is stated to be 32, and the maximum rate 120 nau
     tical miles per day.       This gives 87 statute miles per day, or
    fully 3% miles per hour, as the mean rate.”                 ‘
    -
        Not being a Statistician, as Mr. Croll professes to be, shouldI
     have never thought of deducing a mean rate from a maa'imum
    and minimum only, having always supposed that a correct ave
    rage could only be based upon a large number of data, the
    larger the better.     Thus, if I wanted to know the average number
   of children of one marriage, I should not take the arithmetical
    mean between a maximum of (say) 20, and a minimum of O, which
   would give 10; but should collect 1000, 10,000, or 100,000
    observations, and <U+FB01>nd the mean of the whole.
        This last is precisely what the Meteorological Department, on
    whose guidance I have relied in this matter. have done in regard
.  to the rate of the Gulf-stream. If Mr. Croll will look into their
   1‘ Currents and
                         Surface-Temperature of the North Atlantic”
     (1872), he will <U+FB01>nd the following passage (p. 23) under the
    head of “Remarks on the General Current Chart, constructed
    from the whole of the observations on the currents employed in
   this discussion, irrespective of the      ‘
                                                 time of the year in which
                                       ‘
     they were made.”            ,
        “The main part of the stream is forced into the Straits of
   'Florida, turning to the N.E. by E., in its passage between the
     Florida Reefs and Cuba, at a mean rate of 39 miles.                About
     lat. 25° N. the straits between Florida and the Bahamas Bank
    become contracted, part being known as the Narrows.                  Here
    the set becomes alniOst due N., and its rate greater, averaging
    48 miles.      This rate and set is maintained to lat. 30° N.”
   ~
        If, again, Mr. Croll will look into the General Chart itself,
  :he will <U+FB01>nd the <U+FB01>rst of these averages to be based on thirty
  eeight observations, the second on <U+FB01>fty-four observations, and
  the third on forty observations.
        Or, if he will examine the Monthly Charts, he will <U+FB01>nd that
  'while six of them give a monthly average below 48 miles per
  'day, there is only one that gives an average so high as 736 miles
  5a day.~      The average of the six months of least rapid rate is 34

360     Dr. Carpenter    on the  Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
miles per day ; the average of the six months of most rapid rate
is 606 miles per day.                                           7
    Further, as the maximum rate given by the Meteorological De
 partment is 106 miles per day, and as this rests on only a
 single observation, it is obvious that the Admiralty maximum of
 120 miles per day is a case as exceptional as that of a man who '
has twenty children by one wife.
    The annual mean assumed by Mr. Croll, on the basis of the
 maximum and minimum rates, thus exceeds the very highest
 actual monthly average, and is more than double the monthly
 average of half the year; whilst the annual mean stated by
 me, on the express authority of the Meteorological Department,
is the average of all the observations in its possession.
    The foregoing case furnishes a typical example of the arith
metical method on which Mr. Croll relies, in his laboured dis
proof of the doctrine of a Vertical Oceanic Circulation sustained
by Thermal Agency alone, which has received the full sanction,
on theoretical grounds, of numerous eminent Physicists (as, for
example, of Sir George Airy, in his Presidential Address to the
Royal Society in 1872), and which appears to the French Aca
demicians before whom        I  recently brought it (Comptes Rendus,
April 6), to be in entire harmony with the facts of Ocean-tem
                                    ‘
perature as determined by the Challenger’ observations.
    But, further, Mr. Croll asserts (p. 99) that “all we really
 require to account for the cold water which i found to occupy
 the bed of the ocean in temperate and equatorial regions,” is a
 set of polar under-currents maintained by the winds which im
 pel equatorial water towards the poles; and further (p. 175),
 that, “so far as the distribution of heat over the globe is con
 cerned, it is a matter of indi<U+FB02>'erence whether there really is or is
 not such a thing as this general oceanic circulation.     The enor
 mous amount of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream alone puts
it beyond all doubt that ocean-currents are the great agents
 employed in distributing over the globe the excess of heat re
 ceived by the sea in intertropical regions.”
    Regarding the facts of the case as better data than Mr. Croll’s
<U+FB01>gures,   I would submit whether the following considerations do
 not furnish a reductio ml absurdum of the foregoing statements :—
    1. In the Equatorial Atlantic, as is shown by the ‘Challenger’
 sections, the whole mass of water, from 300 fathoms to the bot
tom at (say) 2500 fathoms, has a temperature descending from
 40° to 32°.     The isoc/zeimenal of the Equatorial Atlantic (which,
 as is shown by the temperature-phenomena        of the Mediterranean
 and Red Sea, Would be the temperature of all but the super<U+FB01>cial
 stratum throughout the year,      if  Polar water were excluded) is
 about 75°.     Hence it is clear that the great bulk of this water
 must have travelled to the Equator from the Polar-areas._ That

      Dr. Carpenter   on the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.     361
 (1) this enormous mass of glacial water, of which, across the
whole breadth of the South Atlantic, the lowest stratum of 500
fathoms has an average temperature below 35°, exerts no cooling
in<U+FB02>uence on the Intertropical area, and that (2) it can have been
propelled thither by the agency of the Gulf-stream or of any.
other super<U+FB01>cial wind-currents, seem to me propositions equally.
opposed to common sense.
      2. That Polar water is met with at a much less depth under
the Equator than it is in the extratropical zone, seems a clear in
 dication that it is continually rising there from the bottom towards
 the surface, as would of course be the case on the theory of 21.
 Vertical Oceanic Circulation; and this inference is strikingly
 con<U+FB01>rmed by the fact (which is diametrically opposed to an
 other of Mr. Croll’s assertions, p. 100), that while the salinity
 of the bottom-water maintains its low Polar standard as far as
 the Equator, and while the salinity of extratropical surface-water
 is considerably higher, the salinity of Equatorial surface-water is
 as low as that of the Polar bottom-water.
  ,   3. Of the Polar-Equatorial <U+FB02>ow thus evidenced, a poleward
 <U+FB02>ow of the whole upper stratum is a necessary complement; and
 the observations made by my colleagues and myself between
  Lisbon and the Faroe Islands, indicate that the thickness of this
  north-moving stratum is there not less than 700 fathoms ;
  whilst the course of Dr. Petermann’s isothermal lines clearly
  shows that it extends all across the Atlantic to Newfoundland,
  where the summer isotherms turn almost due north.           That this
  vast body of water can be propelled by the vis a tergo of the
  true Gulf-stream (which off Sandy Hook has a breadth of about
  60 miles and a depth of 100 fathoms),       I  have not heard of any
  onebut    Professor  VVyville  Thomson,   Mr.   Croll, and Dr. Peter
  mann, who would seriously assert. That it exerts no heating in
  <U+FB02>uence, not even Mr. Croll would af<U+FB01>rm.
       4. That the real Gulf-stream, or Florida Current, reaches
  North-western Europe, is a pure assumption of geographers and
   meteorologists, to account for the abnormally high temperature
  vbrought thither by the sea.        On evidence which no one has
    disproved, it may be af<U+FB01>rmed that the real Gulf-stream dies

          BAROMETER               which combines with unbounded sensitive
            ness the absence of any friction, which requires only a
 single observation to be made that consumes no time, and pos
 sesses so slight a moment of inertia that it follows the variations
of the atmospheric pressure in the fraction of a second, will pro
bably excite some interest; wherefore I will describe the simple
way in which I have produced such a one (Plate IV. <U+FB01>g. 3).
      The air-exhausted metal ring from a Bourdon aneroid-I- is on
one side <U+FB01>rmly screwed on a holder; the other, free end pushes
with its rounded projection against a small mirror in a metal
frame, which is suspended on little steel springs (strips of pen
                                             I
dulum-steel). An axis, which <U+FB01>rst tried, even the <U+FB01>nest, ren
dered the sensitiveness illusory ;             I had therefore put aside as use
less the apparatus already four years old.                 The mirror-holder can
be     shifted  a  little    on  the   bottom-plate by    means   of two notches ,
at the lowest height of the barometer the mirror must rest more
securely against the projection.                 A small wing, soldered to the
ring, and dipping deep into the liquid (glycerine) contained
in a vessel, serves to rapidly still any vibrations.
      The instrument is set up <U+FB01>rmly upon a wall-stand, best by
means of a screw through the centre of the bottom-plate, after re
gulating it with the adj usting—screws; and then the observations
are effected in the usual mannerwith telescope and vertical scale I.
      My scale is placed at about 3 metres distance from the mirror.

  Thus nearly 25 scale-divisions correspond to 1 millim. of the
  mercury barometer ,' so that the variation of pressure which
  occur with us require a scale a metre in length.                      Sudden
  opening     or closing   the   door   of  the  observing-room     causes  the

   easily obviated.       Since we have, as two opposite corrections, the
   diminution of the elasticity of the metal and the increase of that
   of the internal air,       must be possible even to reduce to zero the

     .42» Elementary      Treatise on Quaternions. By P. G. TAIT, JI.A.,
         Formerly Fellow of St. Peter’s College, Cambridge, Professor of
         Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh. Clarendon
         Press Series. Oxford. 1873. (Pp. 296.)
                is the second and enlarged edition of a work <U+FB01>rst pub
    'l‘HIS lished  in the year 1867. It is designed to render the subject
    of Quaternions “ intelligible to any ordinary student ;” but it
    must be understood that the “ ordinary student” means one who
    is already familiar with such subjects as Surfaces of the Second
    Order, Homogeneous Strain, the Theory of Double Refraction,
    Electrodynamics, &c. as commonly treated, and s0 is likely to be
    interested in seeing the same subjects treated by a new method.
    It must be a matter of congratulation to all who are interested in
    Quaternions that a second edition of the present work should be
    called for after the lapse of only six years ; and this fact probably
   justi<U+FB01>es the opinion of the author, that “there seems now at last to
   be a reasonable hope that Hamilton’s grand invention will soon
   <U+FB01>nd its way into the working world of science.”
         Passing to the contents of the volume, we may say that the <U+FB01>rst
   <U+FB01>ve chapters are devoted to an exposition of the principles of the
    science, viz. to Vectors and their composition, to Products and Quo
  Vtients of Vectors, to interpretations and transformations of Quater
  nion expressions, to differentiation of Quaternions, and to the solu
  tion of Equations of the <U+FB01>rst degree. These chapters occupy 103 pp.
   The remainder of the book is taken u with applications—in the
   <U+FB01>rst place to Geometry, in the next to inematics and Physics.
         Owing to the great variety of subjects treated, it is not easy to
  give a satisfactory idea of the contents; perhaps our best course
  will be to state with some minuteness the contents of a single dis—
  cussion, and leave the reader to draw his own inferences.                  For
  this purpose we will take the articles on Homogeneous Strain, a
  branch of Kinematics which Professor Tait has made his own,
  having published three distinct accounts of the subject *. The
  author <U+FB01>rst shows that the determination of a vector whose
  direction is unchanged by strain depends on the solution of a cubic
  equation with real coef<U+FB01>cients, and obtains the form which this
' equation
                 takes when the mass is rigid. He then shows that
   a mass initially spherical becomes an ellipsoid after strain, and, on
  the other hand, that a mass spherical after strain was ellipsoidal
  before strain, the axis of the ellipsoid in either case corresponding
  to a rectangular set of three diameters of the sphere. After
 de<U+FB01>ning a pure strain, he obtains a criterion by which to distin—
 guish it from other strains, and proves that two pure strains
                                                                           “ The
 successively applied give a strain accompanied by rotation.

simplicity of this view of the question leads us to suppose
that we may easily separate the pure strain from the rotation in
any case, and exhibit the corresponding functions.”    In fact, when
the linear and vector function expressing the strain is not self
conjugate, it may be broken up into pure and rotational parts in
various ways, two of which are specially noticed :——the <U+FB01>rst leading
to the theorem (which does not seem to have been previously
noticed) that there is always one and only one mode of resolving
a. strain into the geometrical composition of the separate e<U+FB01>ects of
(1) a pure strain, and (2) a rotation accompanied by uniform
dilatation perpendicular to its axis, the dilatation being measured
by (sec 0— 1), where 6 is the angle of rotation ; the second leading
to the result that a strain p is equivalent to a pure strain N/<U+FB01>:
                                    4|?
followed by a rotation               .    An expression for the angle   be
                            17¢?
tween any two lines and planes in the altered state of the body is
then found, and the locus of equally elongated lines shown to be a
cone of the second order.     Finally, the properties of a simple shear
are demonstrated. This is perhaps a. fair specimen of the contents
of the volume. It contains a. large number of theorems, most of
them well known, worked out by a. new method, while here and
 there a new result is obtained.
     In fact one of the main objects of the work is to show how
   uestions hitherto worked out in other ways can be treated by
 austernions ; and particularly to do this with respect to questions.
 of physics.     It seems to have been in consequence of applications
 to such questions that Sir W. R. Hamilton wrote the words :—
  “ Professor Tait, who has already published tracts on other appli
  cations of Quaternions, mathematical and physical, including some
  on Electrodynamics,     appears to the writer eminently <U+FB01>tted to
  carry on happily and usefully this new branch of mathematical
  science, and likely to become in              it,

  allowed, one of the chief successors   to  its   inventor.”   (Elements,

      To work out old results by the new method           an indispensable
                                                                is

  Astronomy. Newton’s successors found               necessary to work out

  good in the present case remains to be seen; but this at least             is
  certain, that the Quaternion methods enable us to solve with ease
  many questions which are very dif<U+FB01>cult when attempted in other
   ways.

    A   second object which the author had in view was to produce
“                                                            And this he has
   a. really elementary treatise” on the subject.
in one sense accomplished; for the exposition of the subject is
 not unduly long or hard, except so far as the subject itself is
hard; and a student who is already familiar with the matter
to which the method is applied in the last two hundred pages
of the volume, would probably master its contents without very‘
serious dif<U+FB01>culty.      Still we think something more might be done
in the way of simpli<U+FB01>cation.          The student is in danger of bein
bewildered at the outset by a number of symbols which look like
what he has already had to do with, but which must be interpreted
in wholly new and unexpected ways. This dif<U+FB01>culty yields to
labour; but it might be sensibly diminished by being brought more
gradually before the learner.         There is the less need to dwell on
this, as a. still more elementary treatise on Quaternions“ has been
recently published (written in part by Professor Tait), in which
the treatment is perhaps as simple as the subject admits, and which
could be made out by any one to whom the study of the subject
would be advantageous.

The Universe and the Coming Transits.             By RICHARD A. PROCTOR,
     BA.  Oantab.     London: Longmans,           Green, and Co.      1874.
    'We shall not easily forget the intense delight with which we
perused many of the essays, on their <U+FB01>rst appearance, that Mr.
Proctor has collected in the present volume; and it is with some
regret that on reperusing them in their collected form we have
not experienced the same           leasure as on the occasions alluded to.
 Perhaps it is inseparable       rom the mode of publication adopted
that a considerable amount of repetition occurs, so much so as to
be painful in reading essay after essay on the transcendental sub
               “ construction of the universe ;” and we cannot be]
ject of the
 thinking that Mr. Proctor would have much better served this the
 highest branch of astronomy had he given us the cream of each
 essay in consecutive order, commencing with a brief history of its
 deVelopment instead of including this essential part in one of the
later essays of his series.
    The greatest problem connected with an exposition of the uni
 verse as illustrative of the construction of the heavens is doubtless
 that of the constitution of the Milky Way.            We have experienced
 some little dif<U+FB01>culty in ascertaining clearly Mr. Proctor’s views of
 the Via Lactea, principally on account of the fragmentary character
 of the work before us ; but we have marked a few passages in which
 we apprehend Mr. Proctor’s views are de<U+FB01>nitely stated.               On p. 83
we read :—“All these phenomena point to the conclusion that the
Milky Way, in this neighbourhood at any rate, is really what it
appears to be,~a belt or zone of stars separated from us by a com

paratively starless interval.”     On p. 104 we meet with this state—
ment :—“ If the Milky Way         be  really as it seems . . . a stream of
stars of many di<U+FB01>erent orders      with   an enormous preponderance of
relatively small stars   ;” and  on  p. 194   Mr. Proctor, referring to
his correspondence with the     late  Sir  John  Herschel, remarks, “ It
will be seen that Sir John Herschel here maintains at once the
reality of the aggregation of the brighter stars on the visible Milky
“lay, and the justice of the statistics which related to the Milky
Way regarded as a zone. This is undoubtedly the true explanation
of the matter, as my equal-surface chartings have since abundantly
demonstrated.”      From these extracts we gather that Mr. Proctor
regards    the Milky Way as a. zone or belt of stars which includes
many different orders, the smaller stars preponderating ; and these
he endeavours to show in other parts of his essays to be greatly in
ferior in size and brilliancy to the lucid stars, which he says, on
          “ do unquestionably crowd upon the real Milky Way—that
p. 194,
altogether irregular region of star-streams and star-clusterings
which has been aptly compared to a band of broken cirrus clouds.”
    In several of the matters brought before the reader in these Essays
Mr. Proctor claims “originality of conception ;” and it is of some
importance that these claims should be substantiated.             Any one
looking at the beautiful charts (plate 8) showing the distribution
of star-clusters and nebulae with the Milky \Vay encompassing
the heavens, must come to the conclusion that the Galaxy is an ap
parently reentering lucid zone; but is this idea. really new ‘2 Is it
 not rather the development of conceptions originating in the mind
 of Wright, of Durham, who, supposing the sun to be plunged in a
vast stratum of stars of inconsiderable thickness compared with its
 dimensions in other respects, considered that it was not dif<U+FB01>cult
to see that the appearance of the heavens might be explained ? Mr.
Proctor has been at vast pains to destroy the preexisting theories
 of the Herschels and Struve ; but are they not successive steps in
the process of unravelling the complex and tangled phenomena
 which alone are cognizable to us from our stand-point on the sur
face of our little globe, circling around a star by no means, as we
suppose, the largest in the universe ? Might not Mr. Proctor have
saved himself the labour of writing down these theories ? for as
suredly no man has as yet given to the world at <U+FB01>rst a. perfect
theory of any one group of phenomena in the natural world.             The
earlier conceptions of Wright in 1734 were moulded into shape by
the elder Herschel, and again those of his father by the younger
Herschel; for, as Mr. Proctor states on p. 84, “ In the conclusions
                I
just deduced am in agreement with Sir John Herschel, who indeed
says in one place that the Galaxy, looked at according to a certain
iiew, would ‘ come to be considered as a <U+FB02>at ring.’ ” The idea of the
zone or belt was entertained previously to Mr. Proctor taking up
his pen, the difference being (and an important difference it is)
that (whereas Sir John Herschel considered the ring to be <U+FB02>at,
 Mr. Proctor, if we mistake not, regards it as having the form
 of a hoop, its breadth being generally at right angles to the visual

ray.    He does not indeed say this; but we gather the idea from
many passages in his Essays.
    Next in importance to the Milky Way is the zone of lucid stars
which fringes, and indeed intersects the Galaxy as seen from our
stand-point on earth.     It is in the treatment of this zone of lucid
stars that we trace the commencement of Mr. Proctor’s develop—
ment of his views of the starry heavens. This zone he conceives
as consisting of a stream of stars, the components of which are im
mersed in, and intimately associated with, the Milky \Vay.             In
connexion with this association, Mr. Proctor lays considerable stress
on the irregularity of outline of the Galaxy produced by the long
lateral oifsets consisting of wisps and sprays of the really small
stars composing that wonderful zone, and adduces instances of
lucid stars occupying the apices of sharply de<U+FB01>ned projections from
the llIilky “ray.
    Closely associated with the galactic zone are found those remark
able objects in the heavens, the irregular nebulae, which, with very
few exceptions, as stated by Mr. Proctor, are found on the Milky
Way. “ Corresponding,”says our author on p. 86, “to the association
between the Milky Way and lucid stars is a phenomenon which falls
here to be considered . . . . the irregular nebulae . . . . the wisps and
sprays of nebulous light which stream from the central convolu
tions of such nebulae correspond, quite closely in many instances,
 with streams of small <U+FB01>xed stars. In many of these nebulze also
 there are streams of faint nebu10sity extending towards <U+FB01>xed stars,
and acquiring a sudden brightness around them.              In connexion
with the views of Mr. Proctor, based on these apparent associations,
we would remark that our author, in our opinion, depends almost
 solely on the application of the theory of probabilities for substan
 tiating his views. Now probability is not proof; and before a
theory can or ought to be received as an exponent of natural phe_
 nomena, it is necessary that it be demonstrated; and until this is
e<U+FB01>ected, the theory remains in the category of guesses. A true guess
 it may be nevertheless ; but it requires crucial observation to estab
lish it. In the quotation from p. 83 Mr. Proctor speaks of the
Galaxy as being separated from us by a comparatively starless in
terval ; but- in no part of the work does he indicate, as we can <U+FB01>nd,
where this starless interval is situated.    We know the sun exists
in a barren or starless portion of space.     For example, in a region
of 120 billions of miles in diameter four stars only, three of which
are lucid, are found; beyond this space the more lucid stars are ar
ranged as a. ring, nearly, but not quite, in the same visual direction
as the Galaxy.     In addition, there are many lucid stars scattered
over the heavens apparently unassociated with the Milky Way.
Now does the starless interval of which Mr. Proctor speaks exist
between the lucid stars and the Galaxy ? oris it the barren space
in which the sun is situated ? Mr. Proctor’s remarks on p. 86 are
opposed to the idea of a starless space between the lucid stars and
the Milky Way, the brighter stars drawing the smaller stars of the
Galaxy towards them.

   An important feature of the Galaxy consists of the large number
of starr clusters found within it. The projection by Sidney Waters
6f the 1%ebulae and Clusters in plate 7 exhibits this feature in the
most striking manner, as but few clusters are found in other parts
of the heavens.     It was the elder Herschel who <U+FB01>rst drew atten
tion to this feature of the Milky Way. “ The stars,” said Sir Wil
liam, “ of which it is composed are very unequally scattered, and
show evident marks of clustering together into many separate
allotments.”     Alluding to his equal—surface charts of the brighter
orders  of  stars as being the <U+FB01>rst step towards just views of the
constitution of the Milky Way, Mr. Proctor mentions on p. 221
this View of Herschel as a previous one, and therefore, in his
opinion, the <U+FB01>rst to lead us to form an accurate conception of the
Galaxy.     He speaks of it as “ the great, but little noticed discovery
of Sir William Herschel’s, that the bright clouds of the Milky Way
are for the most part spherical clusters of stars.     The excess in the
number of lucid stars       in the Milky Way proves that the stars of
our constellations are among the leading orbs of gthe spherical
aggregations.”     To this statement of Mr. Proctor we would solicit
particular attention.     It appears remarkable that the “lucid stars
                        ”
of Our constellations     should be the “ leadin orbs of the spherical
aggregations” of      the Milky Way. This         r. Proctor regards as
             “ the excess of the number of lucid stars in the Milky
proved by
'Way ;” but does the apparent superposition of the lucid stars on
the visible area of the Milky Way really prove the connexion assumed
by Mr. Proctor? We fail to trace on plate 8 that very close con
nexion between the lucid stars and clusters which is indicated by
Mr. Proctor’s statement ; besides, he himself, on p. 9, shows that the
two streams are not absolutely coincident, the lucid stars lying on
one side of the Milky Way near Scorpio, crossing it in the neigh
bourhood of Crux, and passing to the other side a ong Canis major,
 Orion, and Taurus. \Vhat if the starless interval of which l\f[r.
Proctor speaks should lie between these zones of lucid stars and
the very much smaller stars of the Galaxy?           In this case could
 these same lucid stars be the leading orbs of the spherical aggrega—
tions of the Milky Way? We think not.
    If we <U+FB01>nd it dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive of the lucid stars being thus
imbedded in the Galaxy, we <U+FB01>nd it still more dif<U+FB01>cult to regard the
collection of nebulae which, in the neighbourhood of the pole of the
Milky Way, constitutes the rich region of Virgo, as forming part
 of the Galaxy.     Messrs. Proctor and waters could not have fur
nished us with more important information as to the distribution
 of lucid stars, star-clusters, and the a parent relation of these
orders to the Milky Way than they have one in the beautiful charts
which illustrate their views; but when Mr. Proctor tells us that
the nebula are, as well as the lucid stars, portions of this same
wonderful zone, we must simply say we fail to see such a relation.
We can understand that the starry cluster, of which our sun is a
component member, is bounded, at any rate apparently, by a zone
or ring of lucid stars, the plane of which intersects the plane of that

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   371
zane of smaller stars which appears to bound our view    of the heavens
when we look towards the Galaxy; and we can also understand
that these two collections of larger and smaller stars may be ar
ranged as two comparatively thin disks—one in which the larger
stars are scattered (more or less congregated or otherwise) over
its area, the other in which the smaller stars (those constituting
the Milky Way) are congregated towards its edges ; but we can
not understand how large collections of nebulae forming entirely
a di<U+FB01>erent class from the two before mentioned can exist above
and below these planes, and at the same time form intimate por
tions of the far distant zone of small stars; indeed the zone in
which nebulae are very sparsely distributed so distinctly separates
the region of these bodies from those of the larger and smaller
stars, as shown in the charts, that it is a matter of surprise that
they should ever have‘been associated together.‘ If, however, Mr.
Proctor considers that the four orders of aggregation mentioned by
him constitute “ the universe,” we fully agree with him; but that
universe must, from his own showing of the distribution of nebulae,
greatly exceed the dimensions of the Milky Way properly so
called.
   Passing from the consideration of the three great phenomena of
the starry heavens, the Milky \Vay, with its clustering aggrega—
tions of stars of inferior magnitude and brilliancy, the regular and
irregular nebulm, and the zone of lucid stars, we proceed to examine
the views set forth by Mr. Proctor under the title of “ Star Streams.”
This is the subject of his opening Essays; and in them he en
deavours to show that all the brighter stars are arranged in
streams, adducing in the second Essay the connecting—band            of
Pisces and other collections of stars of nearly the same order of
brightness as examples. If these are considered in connexion with
the foregoing classes of phenomena, it becomes apparent that our
author recognizes (although it may be dif<U+FB01>cult for him to enunciate
its nature) the exitence of a force that draws the stars together,
not into the spherical aggregations suggested by Sir William Her—
schel, but into long narrow thin streams, and this alike in every
part of the heavens reached by our telescopes. The wisps and
sprays characterizing as well the borders of the Milky Way as the
convolutions and spires of the irregular nebulae, the great stream
of lucid stars encircling the heavens, and the streams of various
extent seen in our nocturnal skies, are alike phenomena of the same
class, and betoken, should their existence be established, the opera
tion of a force di<U+FB01>ering, it would seem, from that great and mighty
force to which the spherical aggregations of Sir William Herschel
are due ; and it becomes an important point to ascertain if the star
streams advocated by Mr. Proctor are only apparent or have a real
existence.
   In the consideration of the evidence of the actual and real exist
ence of star-streams it is necessary to take distance into account.
Apparent star-streams, according to Mr. Proctor’s own showing,
extend over vast spaces of the hollow celestial sphere as recognized

by the eye.    Now we have evidence from actual measurement that
the stars a and [3 Centauri and 61 Cygni, with our sun, are certainly
the only stars within a sphere of something like 120 billions of
miles in diameter.     Ought not the stars composing a stream to be
su<U+FB01>ciently near each other to alford some degree of similarity of
parallax?     We can easily understand that a group similar to the
Pleiades may be physically connected. From double-star measure
ments we are certain of the physical connexion of a large number
of pairs, and also of many triple combinations, without calling in
                                                                      ”
the aid of the theory of probabilities to “absolutely demonstrate
such a connexion; and from the certainty thus aftorded by mea—
 surements we may pass on by analogy to infer that the larger star
clusters, as for example the Pleiades, are also physically connected.
When, howeVer, we extend this analogy to “star-streams,” the
<U+FB01>rst point that striEes our attention is the great distances at which
the component stars of the stream must be from each other. Any
 two stars situated on the connecting band of Pisces (one of Mr.
 Proctor’s illustrations) at an angular distance of 1 degree would,
 with a parallax equal to that of 61 Cygni, be more than a billion of
 miles apart; and as we are ignorant of their parallax, they may,
 for aught we know, be much further asunder. Consequently each
 portion of the double star—stream of Pisces, it it have a real exist—
 ence, must be very long; in fact, if the stars be not optically near
 each other, they must be at pretty nearly equal distances from our
 sun, and would, of course, present nearly similar parallaxes.
     We have been particularly struck with the constant appeal by
 Mr. Proctor, on the one hand, to the application of the theory of
 probabilities to substantiate his views, and, on the other, the reite
 rated improbability that the present arrangement of the components
 of the starry heavens is a chance arrangement.        As regards the
 latter, we cannot for a moment conceive of an astronomer holding
 such a view.     Upon reading Mr. Prootor’s argument against chance
 distribution, and examining his illustrations from Argelander and
 Chacornac 0n pp. 30, 31, 33, and 34, we took in the palm of our
 hand a pinch of <U+FB01>ne sand (the silver sand of commerce) ; and having
 got rid of the super<U+FB02>uous grains by depositing them in the other
  palm, so as to leave on the hand a mere dust of sand, we sprinkled
  this dust lightly on a black japanned tea-tray.   Having done this
  a few times we obtained a <U+FB01>ne collection of clustered grains, a mi
 niature cluster in Perseus for example, and specimens as <U+FB01>ne as any
  engraved by Mr. Proctor, of star-streams and star—sprays, which
  were <U+FB01>nely seen by the aid of an ordinary reading-lens.     Now the
  mode of production of these clusters, streams, and sprays of sand
  would by most persons be attributed to “ chance ;” but such is not
  the case, as shown by Mr. Proctor on p. 100. It was altogether
  out of our ower to produce any speci<U+FB01>ed form on the tray; yet we
  cannot don t the presence of “forces” so operating as to give to
 each grain of sand the exact position it occupied on the tray.
  Every feature insisted on by Mr. Proctor was there ; the very vacant
  spaces which he considers so signi<U+FB01>cant were seen; and although

                       Notices respecting New Boo/cs.                373
in this experiment the clustering, the streaming, and the produc
tion of vacant spaces were not the result of the force of gravity
acting among the particles themselves so as to occasion these clus
terings and segregations, yet this same force, combined with the
muscular force which determined the passage of the grains from
the hand, determined and <U+FB01>xed for the time being the position of
each individual grain on the tray.      The assumption of stars of uni
form size being distributed at uniform distances in space cannot be
regarded in any sense as a “ chance” distribution; for uniformity
of such a character implies design, a design manifestly absent in
the simple experiment above named. Mr. Proctor’s star-streams
are but the results of forces operating on and_among the stellar
orbs, the principal of which must doubtless be gravity; but how
star-streams are produced we have yet to learn.
    The remaining subject in Mr. Proctor’s book is “ star-drift;” and
here we feel we are upon much more substantial ground than when
engaged in the examination of the other portions of his work.        His
                        ”
views of “ star-drift are based, not on conjecture, but upon obser—
vation.    His two charts of the proper motions of stars form a va—
luable contribution to the records of observational astronomy; and
we venture to predict that, in pursuing the course opened up by
Mr. Proctor, astronomers will become much better acquainted with
the distribution of the stars in space than by any other method
whatever.     We would, however, call attention. to that which we
consider to be a great defect in a work specially treating on the
“ universe.”     It is the absence of any, except the most incidental,
mention of the binary and multiple systems. Surely, if           Proctor
desires to place the important subject of “ star—drift” on an impe
rishable basis, it must be by showing that the drift-systems of
Taurus, Cancer, and Ursa Major partake of the nature of multiple
systems ; and that the reader may be able to form a clear concep
tion of this link in the great systematic chain, it is essential that he
be led upwards step by step by the careful study of the binary
systems. 'It maybe said that Mr. Proctor has provided for this in
some of his other works; but it is this fragmentary character of
some of his writings, the work before us especially, that we object
to.   We should have perused it with much greater interest had it
been arranged differently.      And while upon this point, we would
just say that an index is an essential part of a work like the present ;
there are many portions of it to which reference may often be ne
cessary, and which may be dif<U+FB01>cult to <U+FB01>nd without such a help.
    The restriction of the term “ star-drift” to the motions <U+FB01>gured
to the eye on p. 141, as distinguished from that which may be de
signated “sun-drift,” is a happy one; and we cannot close this
notice of the <U+FB01>rst part of the volume without congratulating Mr.
Proctor on a discovery by which that of binary systems by the elder
Herschel is extended to portions of the starry universe containing
systems of a much more imposing character.           Mr. Proctor repu
diates the principle, so far as he  is personally concerned,   of examij
ning detail ; but, if we mistake   not,  his most successful  result has

    This discourse embraced the scienti<U+FB01>c results’of an inquiry on
 fog-signals, undertaken at the instance of the Elder Brethren of
 the Trinity House, and communicated, with their friendly concur
 rence, to the Royal Society and the Royal Institution.
    The investigation was begun on the 19th of May, 1873, and con
 tinued till the 4th of July.    It was resumed on the 8th of October,
 and continued to the end of November.          It also includes observa
 tions made during the dense'fog which enveloped London on De—
 oember 9 and the succeeding days.
    Gongs and bells were excluded from this investigation, in conse
   uence of their proved inferiority to other instruments of signalling.
     e experiments were made with trumpets          blown by powerftu
 compressed air, with steam-whistles, guns, and a steam syren asso—
 ciated with a trumpet 16 feet long.
    Daboll’s horn, or trumpet, had been highly spoken of by writers
 on fog-signals.      A third-order apparatus of the kind had been
 reported as sending its sound to a distance of from 7 to 9 miles
 against the wind, and to a distance of 12 to 14 miles with the wind.

 Holmes had improved upon Daboll; and with two instruments of
 Holmes, not of the third but of the <U+FB01>rst order, our experiments
 were made. On the 19th of May, at 3 miles distance, they became
 useless as a fog-signal; at a distance of 4 miles, with paddles
 stopped and all on board quiet, they were wholly unheard.                At a
 distance of two miles from the Foreland the whistles tested on
 May 19 became useless. The 12-o’clock gun, <U+FB01>red with a 1-lb.
 charge at Drop Fort in Dover, was well heard on May 19, when
 the horns and whistles were inaudible.              On the 20th of May the
 permeability of the atmosphere had somewhat increased, but the
 steam—whistle failed to pierce it to a depth of 3 miles.            At 4 miles
 the horns, though aided by quietness on board, were barely heard,»
                              I
 By careful nursing, if may use the expression, the horn-sounds
 were carried to a distance of 6 miles.           The superiority of the 18
 pounder gun, already employed by the Trinity House as a fog-signal,
 over horns and whistles was on this day so decided as almost to
 warrant its recommendation to the exclusion of all the other signals.
    Nothing occurred on the 2nd of June to exalt our hopes of the
 trumpets and whistles.          The horns were scarcely heard at a dis
 tance of 3 miles; sometimes indeed they failed to be heard at 2
 miles.    By keeping every thing quiet on board, they were after
 wards heard to a distance of 6 miles—a result, however, mainly due
 to the improved condition of the atmosphere.                  Considering the
 demands as to sound-range made by writers on this subject, the de
 monstrated incompetence of horns and whistles of great reputed
 power to meet these demands was not encouraging.                 On the 3rd of
 June the atmosphere had changed surprisingly. It was loaded
 overhead with dark and threatening clouds ; the sounds, neverthe—              ~
 less, were well heard beyond 9 miles.              On June 10 the acoustic
 transparency     of the  air  was  also  very   fair, the distance penetrated
 being upwards      of 8%  miles.    The  subsidence     of the sound near the
 boundary of the acoustic shadow on the Dover side of the Foreland,
 and before entering the shadow, was to-day sudden and extraordie
 nary, a<U+FB01>ecting equally both horns and guns.              We were warned on
>
 June 3 that the supremacy of the gun on one occasion by no means
 implied its supremacy on all occasions, the self—same guns which
 on May 20 had so- far transcended the horns being on this day their
 equals and nothing more. The 11th of June was employed in mas
 tering still further the facts relating to the subsidence of the sound
 east and west of the Foreland—the cause of this subsidence being
 in part due to the weakening of the sonorous waves by their diver
 gence into the sound—shadow, and in part to interference.
    The atmosphere on the 25th of June was again very defective
  acoustically.    The sounds reached a maximum distance of 6% miles ;
  but at 4 miles, on returning from the maximum distance, they were
  very faint. The day had, as it were, darkened acoustically.               On
 this day the guns lost still further their preeminence, and at 5%
  miles were inferior to the horn.           No sounds whatever reached
 Dover    Pier  on  the  11th;   and  it was   only towards the close~of the
  day. that they   succeeded    in reaching   it  on the 25th.    Thus by slow

376        Royal Institution :—Prof. Tyndall on             the  Acoustic
degrees   the caprices of the atmosphere made themselves known to
us, showing us subsequently that within the limits of a single day,
even within a single minute, the air, as a vehicle of sound, under—
went most serious variations.            The 26th of June was a far better
day than its predecessor, the acoustic range being over 9% miles.
The direction of the wind was less favourable to the sound on this
day than on the preceding one, plainly proving that something else
than the wind must play an important part in shortening the sound
range.
    On the 1st of July we experimented upon a rotating horn, and
heard its direct or axial blast, which proved to be the strongest, at a
distance of 10% miles.         The sounds were also heard at the Varne
light-ship, which is 122 miles from the Foreland. The atmoaphere
had become decidedly clear acoustically, but not so optically; for
on this day thick haze obscured the white cliffs of the Foreland. In
fact, on days of far greater optical purity, the sound had failed to
reach one third of the distance attained to-day.                1n the light of
such a fact, any attempt to make optical transparency a measure of
acoustic transparency must be seen to be delusive.                On the lst of
July a 12-inch American whistle, of which we had heard a highly
favourable account, was tried in place of the 12-inch English whistle;
but, like its predecessor, the performance of the new instrument
 fell behind that of the horns. An interval of twelve hours suf<U+FB01>ced
 to convert the acoustically clear atmosphere of July 1 into an
 opaque one; for on the 2nd of July even the horn-sounds, with
 paddles stopped and all noiseless on board, could not penetrate
 further than 4} miles.
     Thus each succeeding day provided us with a virtually new atmo—
 sphere, clearly showing that conclusions founded upon one day’s
 observations might utterly break down in the presence of the phe—
 nomena of another day. This was most impressively demonstrated
 on the day now to be referred to. The acoustic imperviousness of
 the 3rd of July was found to be still greater than that of the 2nd,
 While the optical purity of the day was sensibly perfect.            The cliffs
 of the Foreland could be seen to-day at ten times the distance at
 which they ceased to be visible on the 1st, while the sounds were
 out OK at one sixth of the distance.            At 2 ram-neither guns nor
 trumpets    were   able   to  pierce  the   transparent air to a depth of 3,
 hardly   to a depth    of  2 miles.  This  extraordinary opacity was proved
 conclusively   to  arise    from  the  irregular admixture with the air of
 the aqueous vapour raised by a powerful sun.              This vapour, though
 perfectly   invisible,    produced    an   acoustic cloud  impervious to the
 sound, and from which the sound-waves were thrown back as the
 waves of light are from an ordinary cloud.             The waves thus refused
 transmission produced by their re<U+FB02>ection echoes of extraordinary
  strength and duration.                I
                                 This, may remark, is the <U+FB01>rst time that
  audible echoes have been proved to be re<U+FB02>ected from an optically
  transparent atmosphere.          By the lowering of the sun the produc—
  tion of the vapour was checked, and the transmissive power of the
  atmosphere restored to such an extent that, at a distance of 2miles

              Transparency   and Opacity   of the Atmosphere.        37 7
from the Foreland, at 7 P.M.,the intensity of the sound was at least
thirty-six times its intensity at 2 P.M.
     That layers of dried air alternating with layers of air saturated
with the vapour of a volatile liquid can powerfully intercept sound,
has been experimentally established.
     On October 8 the observations were resumed, a steam syren and
a Canadian whistle of great power being added to the list of instru—
ments.      A boiler had its steam raised to a pressure of 70 lbs. to the
 square inch; on opening a valve this steam would issue forcibly in
 a continuous stream ; and the sole function of the syren was to con—
 vert thi stream into a series of separate strong puifs.       This was
done by causing a disk with twelve radial slits to rotate behind a
<U+FB01>xed disk with the same number of slits. When the slits coincided
a pu<U+FB01> escaped; when they did not coincide the out<U+FB02>ow of steam
 was interrupted.      Each puff of steam at this high pressure gene
 rated a sonorous wave of great intensity, the successive waves link—
 ing themselves together to a musical sound so intense as to be best
 described as a continuous explosion.
     During the earlier part of October 8 the optical transparency of
 the air was very great; its acoustic transparency, on the other
 hand, was very defective.       Clouds blackened and broke into a rain
 and hail-shower of tropical violence.      The sounds, instead of being
 deadened, were improved by this furious squall; and after it had
  lightened, thus lessening the local noises, the sounds were heard at
  a distance of 7% miles distinctly louder than they had been heard
  through the preceding rainless atmosphere at a distance of 5 miles.
  At 5 miles distance, therefore, the intensity of the sound had been
  at least doubled by the rain—a result entirely opposed to all pre
  vious assertions, but an obvious consequence of the removal by con—
  densation and precipitation of that vapour the mixture of which
  with the air had been proved so prejudicial to the sound. On this
  day a dependence was established between the pitch of a note and
  its penetrative power—the syren generating 480 waves being
   slightly inferior to the horns, while generating 400 waves a second
  it was distinctly superior. The maximum range on October 8 was
   9 miles.   On October 9 the transmissive power had diminished, the
  maximum range being 7 % miles.         On both these days the syren
  proved to be superior to the horns, and on some occasions superior
  to the gun.
      On the 10th and 11th, a gale having caused our steamer to seek
   safety in the Downs, we made land-observations.       The duration of
   the aerial echoes was for the syren and the gun 9 seconds, for the
   horns 6 seconds. The duration varies from day to day. We sought
   to estimate the in<U+FB02>uence of the violent wind, and found that the
   sound of the gun failed to reach us in two cases at a distance of
   550 yards to windward, the sound of the syren at the same time
   rising to a piercing intensity.    To leeward the gun was heard at
   <U+FB01>ve times, and certainly might have been heard at <U+FB01>fteen times the
   distance attained to windward.      The momentary character of the
   gun-sound renders it liable to be quenched by a single pu<U+FB01> of wind;

378        Royal Institution :—Prof. Tyndall      on the Acoustic
but sounds of low pitch generally, whether momentary or not, suffer
more from an opposing wind than high ones. We had on the 13th
another example of the powerlessness of heavy rain to deaden sound.
   On the 14th the maximum range was 10 miles, but the atmo—
sphere did not maintain this power of transmission.       It was a day
of extreme optical clearness ; but its acoustic clearness diminished
as the day advanced.     In fact the sun was in action. We proved
to-day   that by lowering the pitch of the Canadian whistle its sound,
which had previously been inaudible, became suddenly audible.
The day at <U+FB01>rst was favourable to the transmission of the longer
sound—waves.      After a lapse of three hours the case was reversed,
the high-pitched syren being then heard when both guns and horns
were inaudible.     But even this state of things did not continue, so
rapid   and surprising are the caprices of the atmosphere.    At a dis
tance of 5 miles, at 3.30 P.M., the change in transmissive power
reduced the intensity of the sound to at least one half of what it
possessed at 11.30 A.M., the wind throughout maintaining the same
strength and direction.     Through all this complexity the knowledge
obtained on July 3 sheds the light of a principle which reduces to
order the apparent confusion.
    October 15 was spent at Dungeness in examining the perform
ance of Daboll’s horn.      It is a <U+FB01>ne instrument, and its application
was ably worked out by its inventor; still it would require very
favourable atmospheric conditions to enable it to warn a steamer
before she had come dangerously close to the shore. The direction
in which the aerial echoes return was <U+FB01>nely illustrated to-day, that
direction being always the one in which the axis of the horn is
pointed.
    The 16th was a day of exceeding optical transparency, but of
great acoustic opacity.      The maximum range was only 5 miles.
 On this day the howitzer and all the whistles were clearly over—
 mastered by the syren.      It was moreover heard at 3% miles with
 the paddles going, while the gun was unheard at 2% miles.        With
 no visible object that could possibly yield an echo insight, the pure
 aerial echoes, coming from the more distant southern air, were di
 stinct and long continued at a distance of 2 miles from the shore.
 Near the base of the Foreland cliff we determined their duration,
 and found it to be 11 seconds, while that of the best whistle—echoes
 was 6 seconds.      On this day three whistles, sounded simultane
 ously, were pitted against the syren, and found clearly inferior
 to it.
    On the 17th four horns were compared with the syren and found
 inferior to it. This was our day of greatest acoustic transparency,
 the sound reaching a maximum of 15 miles for the syren, and of
 more than 16 for the gun.       The echoes on this day were continued
 longer than on any other occasion. They continued for 15 seconds,
 their duration indicating the atmospheric depth from which they
 came.
    On October 18, though the experiments were not directed to de—
 termine the transmissive power of the air, we were not without

             Transparency   and Opacity  of the Atmosphere.        379
proof that it continued to be high. From 10 to 10.30 A.M., while
waiting for the blasts of the syren at a distance of 3 miles from
the F oreland, the continued reports of what we supposed to be the
musketry of skirmishing parties on land were distinctly heard by
us all.    We afterwards learned that the sounds arose from the
 ri<U+FB02>e-practice on Kingsdown beach, 5% miles away.          On July 3,
which, optically considered, was a far more perfect day, the 18—
    under howitzer and mortar failed to make themselves heard at
half this distance.    The 18th was mainly occupied in determining
the in<U+FB02>uence of pitch and pressure on the syren-sound.          Taking
the <U+FB02>uctuations of the atmosphere into account,       I am of opinion
that the syren, performing from 2000 to 2400 revolutions a second,
 or, in other words, generating from 400 to 480 waves per second,
 best meets the atmospheric conditions.       We varied the pressure
 from 40 to 80 lbs. on the square inch; and though the intensity
 did not appear to rise in proportion to the pressure, the higher
 pressure yielded the hardest and most penetrating sound.
     The 20th was a rainy day with strong wind.       Up to a distance
 of 5.1; miles the syren continued to be heard through the sea- and
 paddle-noises.     In rough weather, indeed, when local noises inter
 fere, the syren-sound far transcends all other sounds.     On various
 occasions to-day it proved its mastery over both gun and horns.
  On the 21st the wind was strong and the sea high. The horn—
  sounds, with paddles going, were lost at 4 miles, while the syren
 continued serviceable up to 6% miles.        The gun to—day was com—
 pletely overmastered.     lts pu<U+FB01>s were seen at the Foreland; but
 its sound was unheard when the syren was distinctly heard. Heavy
  rain failed to damp the power of the syren.        The whistles were
  also tried to-day, but were found far inferior to the syren.       On
                                               ’
  the 22nd it blew a gale, and the ‘ Galatea quitted us. We made
  observations on land on the in<U+FB02>uence of the wind and of local noises.
  The shelter of the Coastguard Station at Cornhill enabled us to hear
  gun-sounds which were quite inaudible to an observer out of
  shelter ; in the shelter also both horn and syren rose distinctly in
  power ; but they were also heard outside when the gun was quite
v unheard.    As usual, the sound to leeward was far more powerful
  than those at equal distances to windward.      The echoes from the
  cloudless air were to-day very <U+FB01>ne.    On the 23rd, in the absence of
  the steamer, the observations on the in<U+FB02>uence of the wind were
  continued. The quenching of the gun—sounds in particular to wind
  ward was well illustrated.    All the sounds, however, gun included,
  were carried much further to leeward than to windward.            The
  effect of a violent thunderstorm and downpour of rain in exalting
  the sound was noticed by observers both to windward and to lee
  ward of the Foreland. In the rear of the syren its range to-day
  was about a mile.     At right angles to the axis, and to windward,
  it was about the same. To leeward it reached a distance of 7%
  miles.
     On the 24th, when observations were made a<U+FB02>oat in the steam
       ‘
  tug Palmerston,’ the syren exhibited a clear mastery over gun and

380        Royal Institution      :——Prof'.             Tyndall      on the    Acoustic
horns.      The maximum range was                71'}
                                              miles.    The wind had changed
from W._S.\V. to S.E., then to E. As                consequence of this, the
                                                             a
syren    was    heard   loudly   in  the  streets  of  Dover.      On the 27th
the wind was E.N.E., and the syren-sound penetrated every
where through Dover, rising over the moaning of the wind and all
other noises. It was heard at a distance of miles from the Fore—     6
land on the road to Folkestone, and would probably have been heard
all the way to Folkestone had not the experiments ceased.                  A<U+FB02>oat
and in the axis, with     a    high  wind   and  sea,  the   syren,  and     only,         it
reached to   a    distance of 6    miles at
                                       ;         miles  5  was heard through
                                                                     it
the paddle-noises.         On the 28th further experiments were made
on the in<U+FB02>uence of pitch, the syren when generating 480 waves                                      a
second being found more eifective than when generating 300 waves
a second.       The maximum range in the axis on this day was 7%
miles.
    The 29th of October was day of extraordinary optical transpa
                                   a
rency, but by no means transparent acoustically.                   The gun was
the greatest sufferer.       At <U+FB01>rst was barely heard at miles but
                                       it                                          5           ;
afterwards   it    was tried at 51}, 44,-, and 2% miles, and was heard at
none of these distances.         The syren at the same time was distinctly
heard.      The sun was shining strongly              and to its augmenting
                                                             ;
power    the   enfeeblement     of the  gun—sound    was   doubtless due. At
3!;  miles,   subsequently,    dead    to  windward,    the   syren was faintly
heard; the gun was unheard at                miles.
                                            2%         On land the syren and
horn-sounds were heard to windward at                 to      miles, to leeward
                                                                 2        2%

  a 7

at    distance of  5    miles, or <U+FB01>ve times as far as they had- been heard
on October 23.
  The 30th of October furnished another illustration of the fallacy of
the notion which considers optical and acoustic transparency to go
hand in hand.         The day was very hazy, the white cliifs of the Fore—
land at the greater distances being quite hidden; still the gun- and
syren-sounds reached, on the bearing of the Varne light-vessel, to                                 a
distance of 11% miles. The syren was heard through the paddle—
noises at    9%   miles, while at 8!; miles      became ef<U+FB01>cient as
                                                        it                  signal         a
with the paddles going.          The horns were heard at            miles.    This
                                                                               61
was during calm.          Subsequently,    with     wind   from

no sounds were heard at         6.},miles.    On land, the wind being across
the direction of the sound, the syren was heard only to                  distance      a
of miles N.E. of the oreland; in the other direction

plainly on olkestone Pier,

Dover side, and on the Sandwich side, with the same intensity, at
6 miles.
    A gap (employed by the engineers in making arrangements for
pointing the syren in any required direction) here occurred in our
observations.     They were resumed, however, on November 21,
when comparative experiments were made upon the gun and syren.
Both sources of sound, when employed as fog-signals, Will not un
frequently have to cover an arc of 180°; and it was desirable to
know with greater precision how the sound is affected by the direc—
tion in which the gun or syren is pointed.                  v
    The gun, therefore, was in the <U+FB01>rst instance pointed on us and
<U+FB01>red, then turned and <U+FB01>red along a line perpendicular to that join
ing us and it. There was a sensible, though small, di<U+FB02>erence be—
tween the sounds which reached us in the two cases.             A similar
experiment was made with the syren; and here the falling off
when the instrument was pointed perpendicular to the line joining
us and it was very considerable.       This is what is to be expected;
for the trumpet associated with the syren is expressly intended
to gather up the sound and project it in a certain direction, while
no such object is in view in the construction of the gun. The expe~
 riments her-e referred to were amply corroborated by others made
                              ‘
 on November 22 and 23.

    On both of these days the ‘ Galatea’s guns were <U+FB01>red to wind—
 ward and to leeward.     The ae'rial echoes in the latter case were di—
 stinctly louder and longer than in the former. The experiment has
 been -repeated many times, and always with the same result.
    In front of the Cornhill Coastguard Station, and only 1% mile
 from the Foreland, the syren, on the 21st, though pointed towards
 us, fell suddenly and considerably in power.           Before reaching
 Dover Pier it had ceased to be heard. The wind was here against
 the sound ; but this, though it contributed to the e<U+FB01>ect, could not
 account for it; nor could the proximity of the shadow account for
 it. To these two causes must have been added an acoustically
 <U+FB02>occulent, though optically transparent, atmosphere.         The experi
 ment demonstrates conclusively that there are atmospheric and
 local conditions which, when combined, prevent our most power
 ful instruments from making more than a distant approach to              .
 the performance which writers on fog-signals have demanded of
  them.
     On November 24 the sound of the syren, pointed to windward,
  was compared at equal distances in front of and behind the instru
  ment.    1t was louder to leeward in the rear than at equal distances
  to windward in front. Hence in a wind the desirability of point
  ing the instrument to windward.        The whistles were tested this
  day in comparison with the syren deprived of its trumpet.           The
  Canadian and the 8-inch whistles proved the most effective; but
  the naked syren was as well heard as either of them. As regards
  opacity, the 25th of November almost rivalled the 3rd of July.
  The gun failed to be heard ata distance of 2'8 miles, and it yielded
  only a faint crack at 2% miles.                                  -

    Meanwhile this investigation has given us a knowledge of the
atmosphere in its relation to sound, of which no notion had been
previously entertained.       While the velocity of sound has been the
subject   of re<U+FB01>ned   and  repeated   experiments,  I am not aware that,
since the publication of a celebrated paper by Dr. Derham in the
                                 ’
‘
  PhilosOphical Transactions       for 1708, any systematic inquiry has
been made into the causes which a<U+FB01>ect the intensity of sound in the
atmosphere.       Derham’s results, though obtained at a time when
the means of investigation were very defective, have apparently
been accepted with unquestioning trust by all subsequent writers—
a fact which is,   I  think, in some part to be ascribed to the d prior-i
probability of his conclusions.
    Thus Dr. Robinson, relying apparently upon Derham, says,
“Fog is a powerful damper of sound,” and he gives us physical
reason why it must be so.        “ It is a mixture of air and globules of
water, and at each of the innumerable surfaces where these two
touch, a portion of the vibration is re<U+FB02>ected and lost.”          And he
adds further on,
                     “ The remarkable
                                         power of fogs to deaden the re—
port of guns has been often noticed.”
    Assuming it, moreover, as probable that the measure of “ a fog’s
                              ”
power in stopping sound bears some simple relation to its opacity
for light, Dr. Robinson, adopting a suggestion of Mr. Alexander
Cunningham, states that “the distance at which a given object,
say, a <U+FB02>ag or pole, disappears may be taken as a measure of the
               ”
fog’s power      to obstruct the sound.      This is quite in accordance
with prevalent notions ; and granting that the sound is dissipated,
as assumed, by re<U+FB02>ection from the particles of fog, the conclusion
follows that the greater the number of the re<U+FB02>ecting particles, the
greater will be the waste of sound.        But the number of particles,
or, in other words, the density of the fog, is declared by its action
upon light; hence the optical opacity will be a measure of the
acoustic opacity.
           I
    This, say, expresses the opinion generally entertained, “ clear
still air” being regarded as the best vehicle for sound. We have
not, as stated above, experimented in really dense fogs; but the
experiments actually made entirely destroy the notion that clear
weather is necessarily better for the transmission of sound than
thick weather.        Some of our days of densest acoustic opacity
have been marvellously clear optically, while some of our days of
thick haze have shown themselves highly favourable to the trans
mission of sound.        Were the physical cause of the sound-waste
that above assigned, did that waste arise in any material degree
from re<U+FB02>ection at the limiting surfaces of the particles of haze, this
result would be inexplicable.
    Again, Derham, as quoted by Sir John Herschel, says that
“
   falling rain tends powerfully to obstruct sound.” We have had
repeated reversals of this conclusion.         Some of our observations
have been made on days when rain and hail descended with a per
fectly tropical fury; and in no single case did the rain deaden the
sound; in every case, indeed, it had precisely the opposite e<U+FB01>ect.

  '
    But falling snow, according to Derham, olfers a more serious
obstacle than any other meteorological agent to the transmission of
sound.      We have not extended our observations at the South Fore
land   into snowy weather ; but an observation of my own made on
December 29, in the Alps, during a heavy snowstorm, distinctly
negatives the statement of Derham.
                                     I
    Reverting to the case of fog, am unable in modern observations
to discover any thing conclusive as to its alleged power of deaden
ing sound.       I  had the pleasure of listening to a very interesting
lecture on fog-signals delivered by Mr. Beazeley before the United—
 b‘ervice Institution; and     I have carefully perused the printed re—
port of that lecture, and of a paper previously communicated by
Mr. Beazeley to the Institution of Civil Engineers. But in neither
                                            I
of these painstaking compilations can <U+FB01>nd any adequate evidence
of the alleged power of fogs to deaden sound.
    Indeed, during the discussion which followed the reading of Mr.
 Beazeley’s paper, an important observation in an opposite sense
was mentioned by Mr. Douglass, to whose ability and accuracy as
 an observer    I  am able to bear the strongest testimony.    Mr. Dou—
glass stated that he had found in his experience but little difference
in the travelling of sound in foggy or in clear weather. He had
 distinctly heard in a fog, at the Smalls rock in the Bristol Channel,
 guns <U+FB01>red at Milford Haven 25 miles away.           Mr. Beazeley, more—
 over, has heard the Lundy-Island gun “ at Hartland Point,” a dis
tance of 10 miles, during dense fog.          Mr. Beazeley’s conclusion,
 indeed, accurately expresses the state of our knowledge when he
 Wrote. In winding up his paper he admitted “that the subject
 appeared to be very little known, and-that the more it was looked
 into the more apparent became the fact that the evidence as to the
 eifect of fog upon sound is extremely con<U+FB02>icting.”         When, there
 fore, it is alleged, as it is so often alleged, that the power of fogs
 to deaden sound is well known, the disjunctive not is to be inserted
 before the predicate.
    The real enemy to the transmission of sound through the atmo—
 sphere has,    I  think, been clearly revealed by the foregoing inquiry.
 That enemy has been proved to be not rain, nor hail, nor haze, nor
 fog, nor snow—not water in fact in either a liquid or a solid form,
 but water in a vaporous form, mingled with air so as to render it
 acoustically turbid and <U+FB02>ecculent.        This acoustic turbidity often
 occurs on days of surprising optical transparency.        Any system of
 measures, therefore, founded on the assumption that the optic and
 acoustic transparency of‘tne atmosphere go hand in hand must prove
 delusive.
     There is but one solution of this dif<U+FB01>culty: it is to make the
 source of sound so powerful as to be able to endure loss by partial
 re<U+FB02>ection and still retain a suf<U+FB01>cient residue for transmission.      Of
 all the instruments hitherto examined by us, the syren comes
 nearest to the ful<U+FB01>lment of this condition; and its establishment
 upon our coast will, in my opinion, prove an incalculable boon to
 the mariner.

    An account of the observations made during the recent fog adds
the force of demonstration to others recorded in the paper, that fogs
possess no such power of sti<U+FB02>ing sound as that hitherto ascribed
to them. Indeed the melting away of fog on December 13 was
accompanied by an acoustic darkening of the atmosphere so great
that at a point midway between the eastern end of the Serpentine,
 where a whistle was sounded, and the bridge, the sound possessed
less than one fourth of the intensity which it possessed on the day
of densest fog.
    Thus,  I  think, has been removed the last of a congeries of errors
which for more than a century and a half have been associated with
 the transmission of sound by the atmosphere.

    “ Researches in
                       Spectrum-Analysis in connexion with the Spec
trum of the Sun.”——Part       III.   By J. Norman Lockyer.
    The paper commences with an introduction, in which the general
 line of work since the last paper is indicated.      Roughly speaking,
 this has been to ascertain the capabilities of the new method in
 a quantitative direction.     It is stated that while qualitative spec
 trum-analysis depends upon the positions of the lines, quantitative
 spectrum-analysis on the other hand depends not on position but
 on the length, brightness, and thickness of the lines.
    The necessity of maps carefully executed and showing the in
 dividuality of each line is shown ; and it is stated that the execu
tion of these maps required the use of the electric arc to render
the vapours of the metals incandescent.          A battery of 30 Grove’s
 cells of one pint capacity was accordingly employed in the researches
about to be described.
    The dif<U+FB01>culties of eye-observations of the characters of the
lines compelled the application of photography, another reason for
the use of which existed in the facility it afforded for confronting
spectra with each other, and so eliminating coincident lines, since
the lines, if due to impurities, would be longest and thickest in
the spectrum to which they really belonged.
    The portion of the spectrum at present worked upon is that from
H to F.
    Another branch of the research has been the construction of a
Table of all the named Fraunhofer lines, showing the lengths and
thicknesses of the metallic lines to the absorption of which they were
due ; this Table enabled the author to allocate upwards of 50 lines
in the solar spectrum, presumably overlooked by Angstrom and
Thalén.      The Table was intended as a preliminary to a new photo
graphic map of the spectrum from H to F, on a larger scale than

    touching coincidences—and to have below it complete maps of all the
    solar elements with their long and short lines.     This map is incom
    plete at present, but is making rapid progress.
        A preliminary search for elements supposed not to be in the
    sun
    '     has also been commenced.
        Of the above-named researches the subsequent parts of the
    paper refer to :—
        I. The experiments made on a possible quantitative spectrum
    analysis.

       .After the two former papers were sent in to the Royal
                                                                  Society,
   an investigation of the general changes undergone by spectra given
                                                                          '
  .by alloys was commenced.
       A micrometer eyepiece was mounted on the observing—telescope
   of the spectroscope. ‘Vith this the following phenomena were ob
   served :—
       I. The lines which remained varied their length as the per-          -
  centage of the elements to which they were due varied.
       II. Some of the lines appreciably varied their thickness or bright
  ness, or both, in the same way.
       III.  In cases where the brightness of a line was estimated
  through a considerable range of percentage composition by compa
  rison with an air-line, the air-line was observed to grow faint and
  then disappear as the brightness of the metallic lines increased.
      IV. In cases where the brightness or thickness of the line
 of one element was estimated by comparison with the line adjacent
 of the other constituent of the alloy, the point of equal bright
 ness was observed to ascend or descend ; this method was used
 to avoid the uncertainty of micrometric measurements 'of the tips
 of the lines in consequence of their variation in length due to the
 unequal action of the spark.
      V. In some cases, where the percentage of a constituent was so
 small that none of its lines were visible, there yet seemed to be an
 e<U+FB01>ect produced on the vapour of the opposite pole.
      As these conclusions were derived from coarse alloys, and it was
 desirable to observe the elfect of very <U+FB01>ne gradation, Mr. O. Fre
mantle, the Deputy Master of the Mint, was begged to allow obser
vations to be made on the gold-copper and silver—copper coinage
alloys; and he immediately responded most courteoust to the
request.
     Examples of the behaviour of some coarse alloys of silver and
lead are given; they were irregular in their action; but it was ob
      Phil. May. S. 4. vol. 47. No. 313. May 1874.              2 c

386                            Royal Society
~served  that silver lines remained in the alloy as long as from "05
to '02 per cent. of silver was present.           The alloys, however, were
very uneqlml.          Experiments on     cadmium     and tin alloys are de
scribed, the cadmium forming 10, 5, 1'0, 0'15 per cent. In the
last but one cadmium line was permanent; in the <U+FB01>rst at least <U+FB01>ve
were seen.        In an alloy of 0-099 per cent. of cadmium With a mif
ture of lead, tin, and zinc constituting the rest of the alloy, the
behaviour of the cadmium lines was sensibly the same as in a mix
ture of 0'1 per cent. of cadmium and 99-9 of tin.
   In the Mint specimens the same phenomena were observed on
petit as the coarser alloys showed en grand.           In a gold-copper alloy
T6136  increase      in the gold made   the lines  shorter, and a similar in
crease in the copper made them longer.
   In the silver-copper alloy an increase of T6151; in the silver
lengthened the lines, a similar increase in the copper shortened
them.
   These       henomena can be explained by assuming such alloys
          '
to be         erent physical things, and that the spark acts upon the
alloy as a whole as well as upon each vapour separately.
   Thus, in these Mint alloys, copper is common to both, and their
melting—points are :—
      Gold.    . . .  1200° (Pouillet).
      Copper.      .  1200° t0 1000°, the precise point not determined.
      Silver ..       1000° (Pouillet).
   The intermediate position of copper explains the di<U+FB01>erent action
on its lines of gold and silver.
            II.   The Method of photogmwhing Spectra adopted.
   A camera carrying a 5 x 5-inch plate and a 3—inch lens of 23 inches
focus, replaced the observing—telescope           of the spectroscope.   The
lens focused from 3900 to 4500 very fairly upon the plate.               The
beam passing through collimator and prisms was, as in Mr. Ruther
ford’s researches, very small. As the electric arc in its usual ver
tical position gave all the lines from pole to pole, the lamp was
placed on its side, and the are used in a‘horizontal position, the slit
being vertical.         The dense core of the are then gave all the short
lines in the centre of the <U+FB01>eld, the longer ones extending beyond
them on either side. In order to obtain a scale, it was resolved
to photograph the solar spectrum immediately adjacent to the
metallic spectrum under examination.
   To eifect this a portion of the slit was covered up while the
solar spectrum passed through the free part, and then the part
used for the solar spectrum was covered, while the formerly covered
part was opened for the metallic spectrum.                 This was e<U+FB01>ected
by a shutter, with an opening sliding in front of the slit; a dia
gram of its action and form is given.

   The bearing of the former papers on the lengths of the lines
of the elements is brie<U+FB02>y recapitulated.                            ,
   The examination of the various spectra of metals and alloys in
dicated the great impurity of most of the metals used, and suggested
the possibility of the coincidences observed by Thalén and others
being explained in the light of former work.
   It is observed that coincidences are - particularly numerous in
the spectra of iron, titanium, and calcium, and that nearly every
other solar metallic spectrum has one or more lines coincident with
lines of the last element.   These coincident lines are, as a rule, very
variable in length and intensity in various specimens of the metals
in which they occur, and are sometimes altogether absent.
 ; One of the longest calcium lines, that at wave-length     4226-3, is
also seen in the strontium spectrum as a line of medium length; and
4607 '5, a very long line in strontium, appears in calcium as a short
line.   Another very long strontium line, 42153, is asserted by
 Thalén to be seen in calcium; but the author has never seen it till
lately, and than only in a specimen of calcium known to contain
strontium.                                                            .
   We have here, then, a case of coincident lines, in which the one
that is long and bright in one spectrum is short and faint in the
other, and a case of a line said to be coincident in two spectra
being, though always visible in one, sometimes absent in the other
of them, and only appearing in it when the two substances were
mixed.    The hypothesis of impurity at once explains the whole
case, even without the third line, which renders the fact of mixture
'certain.
   The longest lines of calcium occur iniron, cobalt, nickel, barium,
strontium, &c. ; and the longest lines of iron occur in calcium,
strontium, barium, and other metals.
f Other cases are adduced; and the following general statements
     hazarded, with
    8111'6
                        premise that further inquiry may modify

t    em.
   1.        If
        the coincident lines of the metals be considered, those cases
are rare in which the lines are of the <U+FB01>rst order of length in all
the spectra to which they are common: those cases are much more
          in which they are long in one spectrum and shorter in the

appear in the spectra-0E the other metals are shorter than the
longest lines of those metals. Hence we are Justi<U+FB01>ed in assuming
that short lines of iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium, and manganese,
coincident with long and strong lines of calcium, are really due to
traces of the latter metal occurring in the former as an impurity.
    3. In cases of coincidences of lines found between various spectra
 the line may be fairly assumed to belong to that one in which it
                                                 -
 is longest and brightest.
    A description     of  some    photographs of spectra is then given, a
 photograph     of   the    coincident      lines of calcium and strontium
 being amongst      them,     and   proving that strontium occurs in the
  sun; and   the   section    concludes       with a brief description of the
  method employed        in   making      the   new map, showing lengths and
  thicknesses, and enumerating coincident lines.                This is done thus :
  papers are pasted       on   to  photographs        of the  solar  spectrum on
  glass;  the  lengths     of  the   lines    of  the  metallic   spectrum   under
  examination (e. g.     that   of  iron)    are   marked   on  this paper  in pro
  longation  of  the   solar  lines    to   which   they  correspond.     They  are
  then copied upon a map; and another piece of paper being <U+FB01>xed
  down, another spectrum is proceeded with in the same way.
 IV.   The preliminary inquiry into the existence of elements in          the   Sun
                         not previously traced.
    The previous researches having shown that the former test
 for the presence or absence of a metal in the sun, namely the pre
 sence or absence of its brightest or strongest lines in the average
 solar spectrum, was not conclusive, a preliminary search for other
 metals was determined on; and as a guide, Mr. R. J. Friswcll was
  requested to prepare two lists, showing broadly the chief chemical
  characteristics of the elements traced and not traced in the sun.
      'The Tables showed that, in the main, those metals which had been
  traced formed stable compounds with oxygen.
       The author therefore determined to search for the metals which
  formed strong oxides, but which had not yet been traced.
       The result up to the present time has been that strontium, cad
  mium, lead, cerium, and uranium would seem with considerable
  probability to exist in the solar reversing layer.    Should the pre:
   sence of cerium and uranium be subsequently con<U+FB01>rmed, the whole
  of the iron group of metals will thus have been found in the sun.
       Certain metals forming unstable oxides, such as gold, silver,
  mercury, 800. were sought for and not found. The same was the case
  when chlorine, bromine, iodine, &c. were sought by means of their
   lines produced in tubes by the jar-spark. These elements are distin
   guishable as a group by forming compounds with hydrogen.
       It _is observed that certain elementary and compound gases
   e<U+FB01>'ect their principal absorption on the most refrangible part of
   the spectrum when they are rare, and that as they become dense
   the absorption approaches the less-refrangible end—that the spectra
   of compounds are handed or columnar, the bands or columns lying

               Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer   on. Spectrum-Analysis.            389
 at the red end of the spectrum—that the absorption spectra of
  chlorine, iodine, bromine, &c. are columnar, and that these are
  broken up by the spark just as the band spectra of compounds are
  broken up—and that it is probable that no compounds exist in
  the sun.     The following facts, gathered from the work already
 accomplished by Rutherford and Secchi, are stated.
     There are three classes of stars :—
     1. Those like Sirius, the brightest (and therefore hottest ?) star
 in the northern sky, their spectra showing only hydrogen lines
 very thick, and metallic lines exceedingly thin.
    2. A class of stars with a spectrum di<U+FB01>ering onlyin degree from
 those of the class of Sirius ; and to this our sun belongs.
    3. A class of stars with columnar or banded spectra indicating
 the formation of compounds.
    The question is asked whether all the above facts cannot be
 grouped together in a working hypothesis, which assumes that in
 the reversing layers of the sun and stars various degrees of “ celes
                     ”
 tial dissociation     are at work which prevents the coming together
 of the atoms which, at the temperature of the earth, and at all arti—
 <U+FB01>cial temperatures yet attained here, form the metals, the metal
 loids, and compounds.                                                A
    In other words, the metalloids are regarded as quasi compound
 bodies when in the state in which we know them; and it is sup
 posed that in the sun the temperature is too great to permit them
 to exist in that state in the reversing layer, though they may be
 found at the outer portions of the chromosphere or in the corona.
    It is suggested that, if this hypothesis should gain strength from
subsequent work, stony meteorites will represent the third class
 of metalloidal or compound stars, '
                                         and iron meteorites the other or
 metallic   stars.
    The paper concludes as follows :—
    “ An
           interesting physical speculation connected with this work
 ing hypothesis is the effect on the period of duration of a star’s
 heat which would be brought about by assuming that the original
 atoms of which a star is composed are possessed of the increased
 potential energy of combination which this hypothesis endows them
 with.     From the earliest phase of a star’s life the dissipation of
 energy would, as it were, bring into play a new supply of heat
 and so prolong the star’s life.                                         I
    “May it not also be, if chemists take up this question, which
 has arisen from the spectroscopic evidence of what         I have before
 termed the plasticity of the molecules of the metalloids taken as a
 whole, that much of the power of variation which is at present
 accorded to metals may be traced home to the metalloids?          I need
                                         I
 only refer to the fact that, so far as can learn, all so-called changes
 of atomicity take place when metalloids are involved, and not when
 the metals alone are in question.
    “As instances of these,      I   may refer to the triatomic combi
 nations formed with chlorine, oxygen, sulphur, &c. in the case of

be investigated by means of their action on polarized light.                    This

parts as  it becomes dry.
I     have enumerated these instances of the application of polarized
light to the study of the structure of solid bodies as suggestions
with respect to the application of the same method to liquids so
as to determine whether        a  given liquid differs from a solid in
having   a  very small “rigidity,” or in having       asmall “ time of re
laxation”, or in both ways. Those which, like Canada balsam,
act strongly on polarized light, have probably           asmall “ rigidity,”
but  a  sensible  “ time of relaxation.” Those which do not show this
action are probably much more “rigid,” and‘ owe their <U+FB02>uidity to
the smallness of their “ time of relaxation.”

   CALORIFIC    EFFECTS OF THE MAGNETISM IN AN ELECTROMAGNET
                   WITH SEVERAL POLES- BY A. CAZIN.
  I   HAVE     observed the calori<U+FB01>c effects which accompany the disap—
       pearance of magnetism in the core of a rectilinear electromagnet
  presenting several consequent points, and have arrived at a very
  simple law :—
      When a rectilinear core of iron is magnetized by a series of identical
  coils through which the current passes in alternately opposite directions,
  if the coils determine equal concamerations, the quantities of heat pro
  duced in the core by the disappearance of magnetism are inversely
  proportional to the squares of the numbers of concamerations.
     The apparatus     I used is a sort of differential air-thermometer,
  the reservoirs of which are formed by iron cylinders 42 centims. in
-
  length, 5 centims. in diameter, and about 2 millims. in thickness.
  The bases of these cylinders are closed by plates of copper. A
  glass tube having an internal diameter of 2 millims., bent in the
  shape of a U and containing water, unites the two cylinders: it
  serves as a manometer to measure the di<U+FB01>e‘rence of pressure, H,
  which establishes itself between the two reservoirs when one of
  them is heated; and if it is only a question of relative thermic
  e<U+FB01>ects, we may content ourselves with observing this di<U+FB01>erence of
  pressure; it is proportional to the difference of temperature of the
  two reservoirs.
     In order that these reservoirs may be in the same conditions in
  regard to their surroundings, each of them is enVeloped in a coating

  axis of two identical bobbins of wood without contact between the
  wood and the pasteboard. The copper wire which receives the cur
  rent is coiled round one of the series of bobbins, and can magnetize
  the corresponding core.        These precautions are necessary in order
  that the voltaic heat of the wire may not be transmitted to the core.
  I  ascertained that this condition was satis<U+FB01>ed: the current remain

  insigni<U+FB01>cant change.
     To make an experiment, a discontinuous current is thrown into
  the magnetizing coils ; a tell-tale registers the number n of the in
  terruptions; at each minute the di<U+FB01>erence of the levels in the ma~
  nometer is noted; and the noting is continued when the current is
  suppressed, until the initial levels are restored.     A graphic sketch
  of these data makes known, on the one hand, the total e<U+FB01>ect H pro
   duced during the action of the discontinuous current, and, on the
   other, the correction h due to the cooling action of the surrounding
  bodies. Dividing H+h by the number n of the interruptions, we
  have the e<U+FB01>ect of the disappearance of magnetism at each breaking of
  the voltaic circuit.     This quantity serves as a relative measure for
  the heat generated by the magnetism.

  The following is an example of this class of experiments.
  The core is magnetized by four coils of 18 centims. external dia
meter and 8 centims. depth; the iron core extends 5 centims.
beyond the extremities of the coils; the copper wire is 2 millims. in
diameter.
   The pile consists of eight rectangular Bunsen elements; and the
intensity of the continuous current is 00218, the unit being that
which disengages in a voltameter 1 milligramme of hydrogen per
second.

the corresponding duration in minutes, and the values H and h are
millimetres of water.

    of the electric light, in order to solve,     possible, the question of.

    sought  to determine  the surface  of the  radiating part    of the carbons
    by comparing   their dimensions   with  those of  glass  tubes  placed very
    near, and valuing the distance at which a <U+FB01>ne platinum wire entered
    fusion without touching them. We have thus obtained                  surface                a
    almost rectangular, equal to that of      circle of     centim. diameter.

    The radiation from the parts outside this limit was intercepted by
    diaphragms.    The pile consisted of 50 Bunsen elements supplied
    with fresh acids (nitric acid of 40 degrees, sulphuric acid diluted
    with nine times its weight of water). The elements had diameter                             a

and the blackened thermometer at a distance of 395 millims., there
was found, at the end of half an hour, a di<U+FB01>erence of 3°‘63 between.
the temperature of the other thermometers and that of the black—
bulb; this di<U+FB01>erence remained constant for an hour, the <U+FB02>uctua-.
tions being insigni<U+FB01>cant.
    The temperature produced by solar radiation was determined
about noon on several days in July, and with the same instrument.
For the diiference there was found 17°'16, a quantity which agrees
very well with that which was obtained several years since. To
this value, however, must be applied the correction due to the ab—.
sorption produced by our atmosphere; taking into account the
height of the sun at the time of the observation, we are led to the
                                                                              -

    Substituting these values in the preceding formula and calculate

 radiant areas, we get
                               L=Lx%4%;
 so that the solar radiation would be       thirty-six and a half times that
 of the carbons. Nevertheless this valuation is below the truth;
 for we know that the correction made for the absorption by the
 atmosphere is too small.        M. Soret found directly, on Mont Blanc,
 21°13; probably the value at the upper limit of our atmosphere
 would be about 27°.        These two values would give respectively—

     These ratios differ considerably from those which have been given
 by other observers.       In the fear that there might be some cause of
  enormous error in my electric light,        I compared it with the light
  of a stearine taper;    I found that it was equal to 1450 tapers of
  commerce; it possessed therefore quite the intensity ordinarily
  exhibited by a good pile.       In another series of experiments, made
                                                        I

  a result not very far from that at which         I  arrived above with the
  temperature   21°13    obtained    directly by  M.   Soret.
     Adhering,   then,   to  this  temperature    of  21°13,   which is inconé
  testable and certainly less than the reality, and supposing that the
  temperature of the radiating surface of the carbons is 3000° (a
  number which is not exaggerated, since the whole extent of the
  platinum submitted to the experiment was fused), and supposing
  the radiation proportional to the temperature, we obtain for the
  potential temperature of the sun l33780°. This value may even

             in that case the upper currents completely conceal the lower; so
             that the mass of the photosphere has no sensible transparency.’
             This observation of the crossing of the currents has lately been con

                     ON HYDROGENIZED PALLADIUM.
               BY MM. L. TROOS'I.‘ AND P. HAUTEFEUILLE.
     The remarkable property possessed by palladium, of absorbing as
 much as 982 times its volume of hydrogen gas, discovered by Gra
 ham, was at <U+FB01>rst presented by him as a phenomenon comparable
 to solution or condensation; and for it he invented _ the term 00
 clusion.
     Graham subsequently thought that palladium forms with hy
                            “
 drogen an alloy with         equal equivalents.”   This opinion is stated
 in the memoir in which he proves that the density of palladium
 charged with from 800 to 900 volumes of hydrogen is sensibly in—
 ferior to that of the pure metal, that the tenacity and electric con—
 ductivity are diminished as in the case of alloys in general, and the
  magnetism augmented as when palladium is combined with a very
  magnetic metal.
      His conclusions have been generally accepted, although (as the
  author himself remarks) the maximum of 982 volumes of hydrogen
  <U+FB01>xed corresponds to only 0'77 2 of an equivalent of hydrogen for 1
  equivalent of palladium (H=1 ; Pa =106'5).
                                                                             ‘
      In a recent work M. Favre, like Graham, thinks that “the hy-
  drogen <U+FB01>xes itself on its equivalent of palladium,” on the ground
  that, within the limits of his experiments *, the metal disengages
  sensibly equal quantities of heat in absorbing equal weights of hy
  drogen.
      Weshall prove that the phenomenon is more complex than has
  hitherto been supposed.
       We will examine successively the two following points :—(1) Does
  the hydrogen form a true combination with the palladium, or is it
  merely dissolved in that metal?          (2) If there is a combination,
   what is the formula of the compound produced?
       The study of the tensions taken by the hydrogen disengaged at
   various temperatures by hydrogenized palladium will furnish us
   with the elements necessary to solve both these questions apart
   from any hypothesis. We know, in fact, that compounds formed
   directly, by‘ the combination of a solid with a gaseous body, are
   partially decomposed by heat, the decomposition being measured by
   a tension invariable for each temperature and independent of the
   quantity of undecomposed product; it is the tension of dissocia—
   tion of the chemical combination.         On the contrary, substances
       * M. Favre has not indicated the volumes of gun corresponding  to his
   different determinations.

  which have     dissolved gases (such as water charged with carbonic
 Mid), and those which          have condensed it (such as platinum-black
 charged with hydrogen), emit gases which, for one and the same
 temperature, have tensions variable with the state of saturation of
 the material. It is by the study of the tensions that we have arrived
 at the recognition of the simultaneous production of a de<U+FB01>nite
                                                               '

      The palladium, saturated with hydrogen at the negative pole of
 a   voltameter,   was introduced into a glass tube communicating-at
 One'extremity with a manometer, and at the other with a Sprengel
 Pump, which permitted a vacuum to be produced at the commence,—

 Quantities of gas being taken away, we obtain, with either cast or
spongy palladium, the results inscribed in the following Table, which
contains the observed pressures for di<U+FB01>erent degrees of saturation.

     The Table shows us :-—(1) that as long as the volume of hydrogen
<U+FB01>xed is more than 600 times the volume of the palladium, the pres
 sure decreases very rapidly at each subtraction of hydrogen, which
is the character of a solution; (2) that the pressure becomes con
     * As palladium saturated with gas disengages hydrogen at the ordinary
temperature, it is necessary, if we wish to know exactly the total volume
,of gas absorbed, to put the metal, on taking it out of the voltameter, into
 a small'balloon full of boiling water and furnished with a discharge-tube.
 The temperature of the balloon is raised to the boiling-point of water, and
 the gas discharged is collected.      After cooling, the metal can be handled
in order to introduce it into the manometric apparatus without fear of
losing any gas. This preliminary operation is indispensable when the
 forged metal is operated on, which, when withdrawn from the voltameter,
grows rapidly hot in contact with the air, in conequence of the combustion
of the hydrogen.

   Remarks.-The numbers in this Table were obtained with a palladium
 wire; this was preferred to a heet for these determinations, because the
boundary tension is more rapidly reached. Besides, a sheet leads, although
more slowly, to the same results.            The cast and the forged metal present
no difference in respect of the tensions; and the behaviour is the same,
whether the metal has been charged by the pile or by a prolonged stay in
 hydrogen.
   The above numbers show that Pa2 H does not sensibly emit gas
at the ordinary temperature.                The hydrogen-tensions which limit
the decomposition of the compound increase at <U+FB01>rst slowly; but
from 140° very small additions to the temperature are attended by
arapid augmentation of the pressure. Between 130° and 140°
the tension becomes equal to the pressure of the atmosphere.
   This compound, then, cannot be prepared at a higher temperature
than 130°, unless the hydrogen be compressed. The most conve—
nient temperature for its production is that of boiling water, at
which the dissociation tension is below one third of the atmospheric
pressure.                                                                               .
   In brief, our experiments prove that palladium forms with hy—
drogen a de<U+FB01>nite compound, of which the formula is Pa2 H.                          This
combination, once formed, can dissolve hydrogen gas after the
manner of platinum, and in quantity variable with its physical
state. This property of PafH explains the diiference between the
numerical results obtained by, Graham according as he employed
palladium wire or spongy palladium.
   In another communication we will show that potassium and
sodium form combinations with hydrogen which have the formqu
K" H, Na’H (K=39, N =23). These, together with hydrogenized
palladium, form a series parallel to that of which M. Wurtz dis
covered the <U+FB01>rst term in the combination of copper with hydrogen
Ci12H2(Ou=63'5), and to which he gave the name of hydride
of copper.—Cmnptes Rendus dc Z’Acad. des Sciences, vol. lxxviii.

         L.   On the new Contact Theory      of the Galvanic Cell.
                 By  J. A.  FLEMING, B.Sc.,     F.C.S.*
          contest that has for so long been waged between the sup
THEporters      of the two theories of the galvanic cell, the contact
and the chemical, can hardly be said to have been brought even
now to a decisive issue.       For although the contact theory, as
originally proposed by     Volta,  received a fatal blow when the law
of conservation of energy became clearly understood, yet in its
place a new contact theory has arisen, supported by novel and
important experimental evidence, which has again been placed
by recent writers on electrical science in formidable opposition
to its old rival.
   The old contact theory of Volta had its origin in an entire
ignorance of the science of energy.        It simply referred the cur
rent produced through the circuit of a pile to the effect of the
metallic contacts, and it ignored the thermal and chemical
changes which are also necessarily present; but it had to be
<U+FB01>nally abandoned when once it became clearly understood that
the appearance of a current involved the disappearance of some
other energy, actual or potential, as an invariable accompani
ment.     The new contact theory may be said to have had its
 source in the discovery of Sir W. Thomson, that there is un
doubtedly a difference of potential produced when dissimilar
metals are placed in contact—a fact not only abundantly proved
by Thomson by direct experimental evidence, but, as he has

402                 Mr.   J.   A. Fleming   on the new
pointed out, con<U+FB01>rmed in a remarkable way by the phenomena
of the Peltier effect, which, when interpreted by the dynamical
theory of heat, furnish the most reliable measure of its amount.
These facts, together with others presently to be referred to,
have been made to furnish the key to a fresh explanation of the
dynamics of the galvanic cell, which             I
                                           have ventured to call
the new contact theory, as opposed to the old or voltaic one.
   It is not possible, however, to de<U+FB01>ne in a few words the pre
cise details of the new theory; they can only he arrived at by
collecting together the statements as we <U+FB01>nd them laid down by
their authors.    The object of the present paper is to draw the
attention of those interested in this question to the objections
that may be raised against this new contact theory—objections
based on facts, some old and some which perhaps may prove new,
but all of which alike seem to throw fresh dif<U+FB01>culties in the way
ofthis theory, although capable of simple explanation by the old
chemical hypothesis.     It will be necessary then to review brie<U+FB02>y
the precise statements of this new contact theory, in order to
show exactly what are the points against which objection may
be taken.     This will be best accomplished by collecting the
statements of its principal supporters and arranging together
their explanations of the phenomena which arise
   (I) when dissimilar metals at the same temperature are placed
in contact,
   (2) when one insulated metal is placed in a liquid capable of
acting chemically upon         it,
     (3) "when two different metals are placed insulated and uncon
nected in one such liquid,
     (4) when the two metals are joined across       by  ametallic are or
when two or more cells are joined up in series.
     1. That the contact of metals           always attended with the

production of di<U+FB01>'erence of potential between them was for
                a                                                      a
 long time denied     by  ardent supporters of the chemical theory.
 Dela Rive endeavoured to show that the effects observed might be
attributed to oxidation    ;  but his experiments are not conclusive   ;
 and to Sir W. Thomson belongs the credit of having established
 the fact  by  experiment, irrespective of his theoretical deductions
 from the facts of thermoelectricity. _ He thus describes his de
 cisive experiment :—

         Sir W. Thomson concludes that there             suf<U+FB01>cient evidence to

         distance    ifconnected         <U+FB01>ne wire, and that, as Professor Tait
                                                   by   a
         remarks, “when any two bodies of different kinds are brought
         into contact, there        certain amount of exhaustion of the po
                                         is    a
         tential energy of chemical af<U+FB01>nity between them, and that the
         equivalent of this              is,
                                  partly at least, developed in the new poten
         tial form of separation of the so-called electric <U+FB02>uids, one of

          the quantity depending on the nature and form of the b0dies”*.
               This  is  equivalent to saying that at the surface of contact
          there is    perpetually    force tending to separate the two electri
                                           a
          cities in  a  direction perpendicular to that surface, while at all
          points ever so little within         there   no such force.

               Professor Maxwell reiterates essentially the same facts.          He
         gives Thomson’s proof that the electromotive contact-force at                                       a.

         is   Joule’s equivalent. He remarks that the electromotive force, as
          determined         this method experimentally, does not account for
                               by
          the whole electromotive force of simple couple.          a This latter                             is
          in general far greater than that given                                by

          the same pair of metals.         “Hence the greater part of Volta’s
          force must be sought for, not at the junctions of the two metals,
         but at one or both of the surfaces which separate the metals
         from the air or other medium which forms the third element of

               Professor Jenkin, referring to these experiments of Thomson,
          adds that “In cases where no known chemical action occurs, as

     3. But  if   we ask what are the conditions when two dilferent
 metals are so immersed, we <U+FB01>nd the most contradictory state
 ments given.         Sir W. Thomson expresses his opinion thus in
  1862 :—“ For nearly two years             have felt quite sure that the
                                                I
 proper explanation          of voltaic action in the common voltaic
  arrangement         very near Volta’s.
                      is                       now think
                                                  I           quite certain  it
  that two metals dipped in one electrolytic liquid will (when p0
 larization      isdone away with) reduce two dry pieces of the same
  metals when connected each to each                      by
                                                 metallic arcs to the same
  potential”*, which seems equivalent to saying that there               no            is
  difference of potential produced other than that due to dissimilar
  contact.     Thus also Professor Tait :—“ By interposing between
  two metals which have been electri<U+FB01>ed               contact      by
                                                                 compound         a
  liquid or electrolyte, these metals are at once reduced to the
  same potential—a result which could not have been obtained by
  connecting them by any metallic conductor.             By the passage of
  the electricity a portion of the electrolyte           decomposed, andis
  the potential energy thus developed             equal to that possessed
                                                          is
 by    the electricity while separated in the metals”1'.
       Professor Jenkin advocates essentially the same views :—
  “ When two dissimilar metals are plunged side                  side into        by         a
  liquid such as water or dilute sulphuric acid, they do not exhibit
  any sign of electri<U+FB01>cation; the three materials remain at one
  potential, or nearly so. If while the two dissimilar metals are in
  the liquid they are joined               by
                                       metallic contact to terminal pieces
  of one and the same metal, these terminal pieces will be brought
  to the same difference of potentials as that which would be pro
  duced   by   direct contact between the dissimilar metals”I.          This
  amounts simply to saying that, as long as no wires are attached
  to the plates of       single cell, there
                           a                   no difference of potential
                                                     is                                      ;
  but that when wires are joined on, the observed difference of
                  due to the contact of the wire with that metal plate
             it is
  potential
  to which           dissimilar.

negative, but less so than zinc.         If, however, the two metals are
plunged together into water, the Copper, zinc, and water forming
a galvanic cell, all remain at one potential, and no charge of
electricity is observed on any part of the system.”                “If a piece
of copper be now joined to the zinc, it (the copper) will become
negative, and the other copper plate positive, the difference of
potentials being that due to the direct contact between the zinc
and piece of copper only, the water having the effect of simply
conducting the charge from the zinc to the copper plate and
maintaining them at one potential”*.
    The foundation for these statements is found apparently in an
 experiment due to Sir W. Thomson.               He <U+FB01>nds that if half-disks
 of zinc and copper be arranged under a movable metallic needle
 maintained at a high positive potential, if they are connected by
 a wire or by contact, the needle moves in such a way as to show
 that the copper is negative and the zinc positive; while if they
 are separated by a slight interval and connected by a drop of
 water, no difference of potential is observed.             Professor Jenkin
 also lays great stress on the fact that, whereas copper in contact
 with zinc becomes negative, in a single cell with wires. attached
 it is the wire attached to the zinc that shows a negative poten
 tial. This he holds to be conclusive that the junction of the
 wire with the zinc plate is the real seat of the electrical separa
 tion; although he admits that there may be a slight difference
 due to the liquid, and that different liquids may augment or de
 crease this difference.
     In another place he says :—“ If the voltaic theory of the
  cell were absolutely correct, the electromotive force of the cell
  would depend wholly on the plates in the electrolyte, and not at
  all on the solution employed to connect them”1'. But it has been
  found that the potential series of the metals is slightly changed
  by the solution employed to join the plates: in order to account
  for this fact it is necessary to treat the voltaic theory as incom—
  plete.     He adds, however, that the potential series of the metals
  for water, dilute acids, and ammonia chloride do not differ so
  much as to invalidate the theory, although the series for alkaline
  sulphides is quite different and anomalousI.
     '  Electricity and Magnetism, p. 44.             1' Ibid. p. 215.
     I  It may be remarked in passing, that this identity of the potential
  series for different acids may perhaps arise from a different cause, and not
  be altogether such a proof of the contact theory as Professor Jenkin con
  cludes it is. Andrews has shown that, whenvone metal combines chemically
  with di<U+FB02>‘erent acids, the amount of heat liberated is the same, or nearly so.
  Hence, if the metals be arranged in the order of their heat-producing power
  when combined with the same acid, that order will remain the same for
  most other acids.     But the order is quite different when the metals are
  combined with sulphur or oxygen.        It is true that this order is not the

closed by a wire, we <U+FB01>nd it stated that there is a constant sepa
ration of the electricities at the point of contact of different
metals and a constant recombination,            attended with decomposi
tion, through the electrolyte.          “ Perhaps it is strictly accurate
to say that the difference of potential is produced by the contact,
and that the current which is maintained by it is produced by
chemical action”*.          And, lastly, that in a series of cells the
electromotive     force  is due to the sum of the di<U+FB01>'erences of poten
tial produced by all the contacts.
    The above quotations may be taken as affording the plainest
notion of the new contact theory ; and it will be seen that its fun
damental propositions are brie<U+FB02>y these :—
    1. That two plates of different metals in one liquid are at the
same potential when insulated and separated ; i. e. there is no
difference of potential due to chemical af<U+FB01>nity.
    II. In a cell series the gradual rise in potential, or the electro
motive force, is due only to the dissimilar metallic contacts.
    III.  The chemical action in the battery is the result rather
than the cause of the difference of potential, and is looked upon
as an accompanying action rather than as the actual creator of
the current, it having little or no share in the production of the
difference of potential between the terminals.
    These are,    I  venture to think, points not to be admitted as
proved    without     further inquiry, and against which, as          I  shall
hope‘to show, some grave          if not insuperable objections may be
urged, founded on other experimental evidence.
    The <U+FB01>rst question to be settled is, then, whether in a series
of cells the whole of the difference of potential between the ter
minals is due to the contacts, as above stated, or whether any
p0rtion is due to the tendency toWards chemical combination
existing between the metals and the electrolytes ,- and, as a con
sequence, whether in a single'cell the-plates are at the same
potential or at different potentials, owing to the difference of
chemical action upon them.              Now   I  think this point will be
suf<U+FB01>ciently proved if we can establish by experiment,                   that a
battery   of cells   can   be  constructed   without   any  dissimilar    me
tallic contacts and with terminal plates of the same metal, and
electrochemical one; but various causes may interfere to disturb it.        At
any rate it is suf<U+FB01>cient to show that this fact of the partial identity of the
potential series for different acids cannot by any means he claimed as con
clusive of the contact theory.     Moreover, although the order may be the
same for the different liquids, we do not know that the coe<U+FB01>icie'nts are the
 same for each metal in every dilute acid.

which shall yet exhibit difference of potential and continuous
current; for if this is possible, it must follow that chemical
af<U+FB01>nity alone is capable of creating electromotive force as well as
of maintaining a current, and that, in an ordinary cell-series,
some part at least of the electromotive force is due to this cause,
whilst 'the remainder is the result of the metallic contacts that
may exist.    Or (ii) if we can establish directly that the two
plates in one cell are not at the same potential, as stated by
more than one authority.
   With regard to the <U+FB01>rst point, it will be remembered that an
old experiment of Faraday’s proved that a current can be main
tained and decomposition effected by a single cell where there is
no dissimilar contact.   It is not easy to see how this experiment
can be explained by any form of contact theory; indeed it ap
pears unanswerable.     But in order to leave no point unsettled
by experiment, it seemed desirable to try and arrange a series of
cells in which all dissimilar contact was absent, so that the dif
ference of potential due to chemical action might be separated
from that due to the contacts and rendered visible by the clec~
                       >
troscope.
   It is obvious that we can make no attempt to do this unless
we can in some way or other obtain a battery with terminals of
the same metals; for otherwise the very junctions with the electro
scope introduce what we want to eliminate, viz. dissimilar metallic
contact.   But the following is a method by which this can be
accomplished.     If plates of lead and copper be placed in nitric
acid the lead is positive to the copper, since it is most acted
upon; but it lead and copper be placed in solutions of alkaline
persulphides, then the copper is most readily acted upon and is
positive to the lead; that is, the positions are reversed.
   Now, if we place in a cell A dilute nitric acid and a copper

          the electrolyte (that is,at the seat of the chemical action), and that
          therefore two metals in one electrolyte cannot be at exactly the

                  is
          to have escaped the notice of the contact theorists.
              In his ‘Experimental Researchcs’ he gives the following fact.
          “ took voltaic apparatus, consisting of single pair of large
          I             a                                                     a

          thu arranged, there was no chemical action whilst the plates
          were not connected         on making the contact
                                         ;                           spark was ob     a
          tained.     In this case        evident
                                           it   is that  the  <U+FB01>rst spark must have
          occurred before metallic contact was made, for            passed throughit
          an interval of air; and also that           must have tended to pass

          before the electrolytic action began, for the latter could not take
          place until the current passed, and the current could not pass
           before the spark appeared.”

advantage compare the statements of the contact theory with
certain other well-ascertained          facts.    Such statements, for in
stance, as these :—~“lf we c10se the circuit by connecting the
metals by a wire, we then have constant separation of electricities
at the point of contact of different metals, and constant recom
bination attended with decomposition through the electrolyte”*.
“ The electricities
                         separated at the metallic junctions recombine
through the water,”
                            “ whilst the current <U+FB02>ows the water is de
composed”1-,—which seem based on the assumption that the
principal seat of the electrical actions is not to be looked for at
the seat of the chemical actions.           But, now, how does this <U+FB01>t in
with those cases of electrochemical inversions noticed by De la
Rive, where the direction of the current in a cell is reversed by
simply diluting the electrolyte.           Thus zinc is negative to tin in
strong nitric acid, and mercury negative to lead; but in weak
nitric acid the positions are reversed. Hence, if couples be formed
of these metals in strong nitric acid, and the acid be gradually
diluted, the current <U+FB01>rst ceases and then is reversed in direction.
    Here, without altering the metallic junctions, we can at plea
sure alter the direction of the current, and therefore also the
direction of the fall in potential, since the current must <U+FB02>ow
from high to low potential. This seems conclusive that the
chemical electromotive force must be even greater than the con
tact electromotive force.          This reversal of the current, by chan
ging the seat of the chemical activity, may be shown in another
way, depending on the application of a very old principle.                  If
plates of copper and clean iron be connected by copper wires with
a galvanometer, and the iron rendered passive by immersion for
a moment in strong nitric acid, then if these plates are plunged
into dilute nitric acid the galvanometer indicates a strong current
going through the cell from the copper to the iron.                   If they
be removed for an instant and the iron plate touched, on again
immersing the current is found to be reversed.                   Or we may
again change the conditions, and           notice   that it  is not suf<U+FB01>cient
to have merely two different metals and an electrolyte to form a
cell.   If plates of pure gold and platinum be placed in nitric
acid, the most delicate galvanometer detects no current, and the
same for many other pairs of metals and electrolytes.
   Here we have contact of different metals producing its differ
ence of potential; yet no current <U+FB02>ows round “ decomposing the
electrolyte,” as, according to the contact theory, it should do;
but the instant we give play to chemical combination the ordi
nary results ensue.         If the extremities of the copper wires from
a galvanometer be attached to iron plates, and these plunged

into separate cups of dilute nitric acid, on making connexion
between the two cups by a bent iron plate dipping into each no
current is detected.         On making one limb of the connecting
plate passive and re-immersing,a strong current is visible; and
we <U+FB01>nd that we have the direction of the current completely
 under command by making any of the four plates more or less
acted on than the other three.
     If   these experiments are to have any importance attached to
them, it can scarcely be doubted that they land us in conclusions
 similar to the others, namelyz—that We must look for the principal
 source of the electrical disturbance          at that place where the
greatest chemical activity       is being brought into play; and that
whereas contact of metals is in itself productive of de<U+FB01>nite elec
trical separation, there is in the battery another cause assisting
in the production of difference of electrical potential between the
 terminals, viz. the potential chemical combination between the
 metals and electrolytes existing when the circuit is open—the
 energy of the current produced when the circuit is closed being,
 of course, the equivalent of this potential energy which dis
 appears.
 LI.    Tke Boundary- Conditions of Re<U+FB02>ection and Refraction for
     the Principal Section of Media in motion.        By Professor KET
      TELER, of Bonn*.
          H'ILE investigating the intensity of re<U+FB02>ected and refracted
 “T          light,  I have arrived at equations which, as the most
 general,     I believe include every possible special case, and there
 fore seem to deserve‘a peculiar interest.
      Imagine two isotropic media (or even two anisotropic, under
 the limitation that the planes of symmetry of both coincide with
 the plane of incidence) divided by a partition, and. both moving
 in space, i. e. in the still aether, with any velocity of translation,
 p'novided only it be small in comparison with the velocity of
 1i   ht.
    5I assume that the light incident on the dividing surface is
 linearly polarized; and accordingly         I  distinguish two cases—
 that its vibrations (1) are perpendicular to the incidence-plane,
 or (2) coincide with it.
      For the <U+FB01>rst case two pure continuity-conditions are suf<U+FB01>cient,

vibration, and the suf<U+FB01>xes specify whether they refer to the inci

for the particles of the boundary-surface, consequently for w=0,
when, namely, through it is placed a system of coordinates,
moving with      it,

   Therefore not merely will the vis viva of the re<U+FB02>ected and the
refracted wave result from that of the incident, but the algebraic
sum of the just-noted components of the quantities of the motion
in the incident and the reflected wave will also be equal to the
corresponding components in the refracted wave.
 I    have here to elucidate the two new notions of the edective
dividing plane and the reduced tether-masses.
    In regard to the former, the particles of the incident wave do
not all reach the moving partition in one and the same position.
The effect of this     as  isthe partition were turned through
                                      if                                                              a

direction of the motion, and                    g     the ratio of the velocities of trans
lation and light.    The actual partition     thus, so to say, indifis
ferent toward the incident wave; and the <U+FB01>ctive rotating plane
is at the same time also the e<U+FB01>ective one.
    If, further, both media consisted of homogeneous aether of
different densities, then the reduced masses would be equal to
the actual ones.    But now ponderable transparent medium
                                            a                                                         is
an aggregate of particles of aether and particles of ponderable
matter.     Nearly the same constitution maybe attributed to the
aether in the interior of the medium as to the aether in cosmical
 space; and the material particles oscillating with         which are                  it,
certainly not hurried along entirely without resistance, but per
form oscillations according to laws of their own (in the state of
rest isochronously, and in general in smaller amplitudes than
the tether particles), will act almost entirely as ballast, and
usually contribute little to the development of force.      Hence,                                    if
  by m be understood   the mass of aether, and         m' that of the             by

    The further investigation is attended by a certain dif<U+FB01>culty in
ascertaining the three masses or volumes mE,mR,mD set in motion
under the in<U+FB02>uence of the translation. The solution of this
problem, however, is facilitated by the fact that, referred to the
moving isotropic medium, the continuity-conditions of Case I.
permit the form of the equation of the vires vim belonging to
 them to be deduced; and this gives a hint for the behaviour of
anisotropic media generally.              .

the two systems would differ neither in intensity of re<U+FB02>ection

LII.     On Warren’s Method of <U+FB01>nding Faults in Insulated Wires.
    By   THOMAS T. P. BRUCE WARREN, Electrician to Hooper’s
    Telegraph Works, Limited *.
       HE following directions for performing this              test are given
          by Mr. Latimer Clark (Clark and Sabine’s Electrical
Tables and Formulae).            The object of the present paper is to
give  the  more  recent     methods    of employing this test.
   “ The coil of wire is wound on two separate drums, both insu
lated, and an electrometer connected to each.               A powerful bat
tery  is connected    to  one   end   of the conductor,   the  induction and
leakage through      the    dielectric   causing  each  of the   electrometers
to become de<U+FB02>ected.           Both drums are now discharged by touch
ing them with the hand, and the electrometers fall to zero. The
drum which has a defect on              it,   however, soon acquires its
tension again,    and   its  electrometer is   de<U+FB02>ected, the other remain
ing unaffected.      More wire     is     then unwound till the fault ap
pears on the other drum.             The outside of the wire between the
drums must be wiped very dry the other parts should be moist.”
                                   ;
   This method of performing the test was soon abandoned from
its being cumbersome and badly adapted for locating very mi
 nute faults, as    by  the use of two electrometers with different
 degrees   of sensitiveness   it     was impossible, unless by carefully
 comparing them, to say on which drum the fault was. Although
a  galvanometer can be used for the test, an electrometer was
 preferred, from the fact that the de<U+FB02>ected position of the needle
 or indicator  is independent of the length under test, which,              by
 the implied condition of the test,           is variable.    Obviously with
a  galvanometer the de<U+FB02>ections alone could be but little depended
u on.

    The electronieters <U+FB01>rst used were a modi<U+FB01>ed form of Coulomb’s
 torsion instrument by Mr. Latimer Clark, which was replaced
 by a more sensitive arrangement of Peltier’s electrometer which
 I had constructed.    This in turn gave way to Sir William Thom
 son’s quadrant electrometer, which under skilful manipulation
is the most certain and convenient instrument, espeCially for
demonstration, as a few yards of core will suf<U+FB01>ce for the expe
 riment.
    In practice an ordinary re<U+FB02>ecting astatic galvanometer is go
nerally used, in which case, instead of being guided by the
de<U+FB02>ections, we note the rush of current into the core when each
drum alternately is connected to earth after a few moments’
previous insulation.
    I will <U+FB01>rst describe the method employed when an electro
meter is used.                  1
    The length of wire to be operated on is immaterial, provided
that the whole or a portion of it can be coiled on an insulated
drum, and that between the parts coiled the surface of the core
for a length of 6 or 8 inches can be cleaned and dried so as to
prevent conduction.

    In  the <U+FB01>rst case (when the whole can be coiled on a drum),
one half is coiled off on a second drum, and the two drums A
 and B afterwards carefully insulated.     The surface of the core
 CD between the drums is well cleaned and dried. The con
ductor is attached to an electrometer, and the two drums are
connected to earth by an attendant at each drum, when by con
necting the battery to the electrometer and core the whole will
become charged ; the battery is then disconnected from the elec
trometer, and the earth-wires simultaneously taken off the drums.
It is best to leave the battery on until the earth-wires are re
moved from the drums.
   The insulation of the drums A and B and the electrometer E
should be such that no loss can be perceived after a few minutes,
when, if the earth-wire be applied <U+FB01>rst to one drum and then to
the other, the fault will be found on that drum which causes the
greatest fall in the electrometer.    The wire is coiled from the
faulty side to the other, and the test repeated as often as is
required. A mile of core with a small fault in it can by a little

practice be put right in an hour or two, involving no more waste
than the insulator, which can be held between the <U+FB01>ngers, and
without even cutting the conductor.       The position of the fault
can be reduced into a length represented by CD by cleaning
and drying the surfaces on each side of it.
   It is obvious if C D represent a joint, it may be tested by this
method with great case.     In fact so delicate is this test when
used for joints in this way, that if A and B each be 2 or _3
miles in length, and C D, a length of 10 inches, be slightly heated
above the portions on A and B, the difference in insulation will
be readily perceptible on the electrometer when this portion is
connected to earth.    The limits to the delicacy of the test are
only  reached  when  A  and B are absolutely insulated.
   A very interesting lecture-experiment may be formed from
these circumstances.
   Let A F represent a length of insulated wire (a series of insu
lated Leyden jars would answer as well). Clean the outer surface
at B,C,D, and E ; charge the core on an electrometer, connecting
the portions A B, BC, 0 D, DE, and             EF
                                                to earth.   Remove

the earth-wires and <U+FB01>nally the battery wire. We can if we wish
remove the whole of the charge from any of these sections with
out affecting the charge in any of the other sections.
   Suppose we wish to remove the charge from the section D E ;
we <U+FB01>rst connect the earth-wire to the surface between D and E,
and touch A or the electrometer if still left on, when the needle
will instantly fall to zero; we remove the earth-wire and after
wards test the other sections, when we shall <U+FB01>nd that their
charges have been unaltered ; and if the spaces have been well
cleaned and dried, we shall <U+FB01>nd that, although the conductor is
continuous, no charge will <U+FB02>ow into D E; the charge in E F can
be noted on the electrometer ; and although a section D E be
tween it and the electrometer be empty, it will not communicate
a particle of its charge to it.                             ~,
   In the second case, where the bulk would prevent the whole
from being insulated, we should continue to coil the core upon
an insulated drum until the fault disappeared—that         is, until it
was coiled on'the drum.      This is   auseful method when dealing
with “ served core” at cable factory.

 from-a theoretical point of view, more important than the cases
 in which the rule holds good.      Indeed I should prefer to reverse
 the statement, and say that    the  neighbourhood of a resonator in
 unison with a sounding body diminishes the loudness thereof.
    As the subject is rather a delicate one, we will begin by sim~
 plifying the conditions as much as possible.       Let us suppose
 that the source  of  sound  is a piston, A, imbedded  in an in<U+FB01>nite
 rigid plate. In the neighbourhood of A is
 another piston, B, backed by a spring, whose
 natural period is exactly the same as that of
 the vibration imposed upon A.          ED is a
 rigid surface, enclosing A and B, and only
 allowing the communication of motion to
 the external atm0sphere by means of a mo                          /
 vable piston, C.    The space enclosed by this                     c
 surface is supposed to be occupied by gas
 devoid of inertia. It is easy to see that under   “gal      l
 these circumstances the piston C, though
  free to move, would yet remain at rest. For                l

 B must be such as to leave the capacity of
 the vessel and the pressure constant; and
 then there is no force tending to move C, or rather to keep up
 the motion of C in the face of the dissipation which would be
 the necessary consequence of such motion.          We may express
this effect by saying that the condensations and rarefactions
 emitted by A are absorbed by B ; and since if B were <U+FB01>xed, C
 would certainly move on account of the variation of pressure

   nator may be said to absorb sound that would otherwise diffuse
   itself in surrounding space; or, if the non-emission of energy
   be thought incompatible with the existence of sound, we may say
   that the effect of the resonator is to dry up the source.            For
   the present purpose it will be most convenient to use the ex

       We see then that, as far as external space is concerned, the
   neighbourhood of a resonator, far from augmenting the effect of
   a source, annuls it altogether, by absorbing the condensations
   and rarefactions into itself.     The resonator acts, in fact, in the

 than  a double source, composed of two neighbouring equal and

              Lord Rayleigh    0n the Theory     of Resonators.           4'23
opposite   sources; the representation of the complete tuning
fork will require at least four simple sources.             The fact is that
the simple source of theory, or even a reasonable approximation .
thereto, is rarely met with in practice.             When a solid body,
such as a string, bar, or bell, vibrates, there is usually but little
change of volume; and thus the algebraic sum of the sources is
approximately zero, the effect depending mainly on the different
situation of the positive and negative parts.            It is true that the
resonance-board of a musical instrument may be regarded as
more nearly a simple source, in the sense that the principal
component parts have the same sign; but the diffusion would
generally be great enough to separate it considerably from the
ideal simple source concentrated in one point.
     In order to see how materially the action of a resonator de
 pends upon the character of the source, we need only take the
 case of a double source, whose components are suf<U+FB01>ciently far
 apart to be dealt with separately, but not so far that the interval
 amounts to a sensible fraction of the wave-length.                 In conse
 quence   of  the  last  supposition, the joint effect at    a moderate    dis
 tance is but a very small part of what would be due to either
 component separately; the <U+FB02>uid emitted by the one is instantly
 sucked up by the other, and vice versd.               Now suppose that a
 resonator of the same pitch is presented to         one  of the component
 sources.     Its effect, we have seen, will be to neutralize the
 source in question, and thus to leave the other free.              The result
 is a considerable augmentation of loudness, which, however, to
 the eye of theory still appears as the absorption rather than as
 the production of sound.
      In general, whenever a resonator is so situated that there
  would be at its mouth, supposed to be closed, a sensible varia
  tion of pressure due to external sources, the opening of the
  mouth will entail a great alteration in the mechanical conditions.
  There will be developed such a transfer of air backwards and
  forwards through the mouth as would, if it existed alone, pro
  duce a variation of pressure at the mouth equal and opposite to
  that above spoken of. Until this condition of things is attained
   (that
        is, until the total pressure at the mouth               constant)‘ the

  vibration of the resonator must increase.          Now the characteristic
  of resonator
    a              is   that vibrations escape from         it slowly, that   a
  large vibration within    it corresponds to but       a  small variation of
  pressure   at  the   mouth.    Hence      follows

loudness; otherwise it may happen that a part or the whole of
the previously existing sound is extinguished.
    The <U+FB01>rst case is that of the tuning-fork.             In consequence of
 the comparative thinness of the prongs, the positive and negative
 sources nearly neutralize each other at a little distance, the air
 displaced by the advancing faces readily taking advantage of the
 room afforded by those retreating.            Although the <U+FB02>uid moves
 nearly  as  though   it  were  incompressible, there is in consequence
 of the inertia a certain variation of pressure, of which a reso
 nator whose mouth is suitably placed can take advantage.
    One of the best examples of this use of a resonator is afforded
 by a vibrating bar of glass or metal held at the nodes.                A strip
 of plate glass about a foot long and an inch broad, of medium
thickness (say       inch), supported at about
                      ,1;                                   inches from the

choosing     a hammer of suitable softness.           This        consequence is   a
of the small dimensions of the bar in comparison with the wave
length, which allows of the easy transfer of air from one side to
the other.      If now the mouth of resonator of the right pitch*

   strongly the bar be excited, there is but little sound heard.        If
   about a second after the stroke the resonator he suddenly with

   conclusively that the presence of a resonator does not always
   augment the loudness of a sound.           The second resonator may
    be held in such a position that it would by itself have little effect.
   The experiment may also be made with atuning-fork held in the
   hand, or by some soft support.
        The reader may perhaps be inclined to suppose, as         I did at
-  <U+FB01>rst, that the theory might be tested in the case of a simple
   tone produced in one room and heard in the next through a
   hole in the intervening wall.         But a little consideration will
      how that the requirements of theory are not properly satis<U+FB01>ed
   by this arrangement, in fact that the intensity of the source (at
    the hole) is itself largely dependent on the presence or absence
    of the resonator.     Thus, if we supp0se that the hole is small and
    the original source distant, the pressure in the neighbourhood
    of the hole on the <U+FB01>rst side of the wall will be nearly the same
    as if the hole were stopped; so that if the inertia of the air near
 ‘
    the hole can be neglected, we have on the second side a given
    pressure, and not, as the theory assumes, a given <U+FB02>ow. With a
    tuning-fork mounted on a resonance-box and held rather close
    to the hole, I have, however, succeeded in proving that the sound
    coming through the wall may sometimes be diminished by the
    neighbourhood of a resonator.
        In order to obtain more exact ideas of the operation of a re
     sonator, let us take one whose mouth is furnished with an in<U+FB01>nite
    <U+FB02>ange, and which vibrates in response to a source of any kind
     at a distance.    The whole potential outside the resonator may
     be divided into two parts—one of which is the same as if the
     mouth of the resonator were closed, and the other the same as
     if there were no external source, but the motion at the mouth
     were maintained according to the same law as actually obtains.
     Over the area of the mouth, which is supposed small, the poten
     tial of the former part will be nearly constant, and may be de
     noted by \Iro.    For the second part, qbo, we have already had
     occasion to form the expression

426               Mr. O. Heaviside on Telegraphic
of the resonator.      We here suppose that the natural pitch of the
resonator, agreeing with that of the external source, is estimated
after allowance for this correction, and may then leave this term
out of account.       Otherwise, of course, the condition of synchro
nism is not properly satis<U+FB01>ed.        In order that the force tending
to increase the vibration without limit may vanish, we must
have
                             ¢0 +  To = 01
so  that
                               = _ik'lll‘oo
When the pitch is given, the total current through the mouth
of a resonator in synchronism with the source is independent of
the form of the resonator, provided that the mouth is furnished
with the <U+FB02>ange. In the absence of a<U+FB01>ange, the relation between
X   and  1110
              would  be sensibly altered.   The effect of the resonator
in external space depends only on X, and is therefore always
the same, but inside the reservoir will be inversely proportional
to the capacity S. Hence, in order to get a great internal effect,
 the reservoir should be made small, and the pitch kept down to
the required point by elongating the neck.
    It is proper to state that the preceding theory is at variance
with that given by Helmholtz*, who treats the potential 11!“, as
vanishingly small in comparison with that due to the resonator
¢o.     Helmholtz is thus led to the conclusion that a simple
source would be intensi<U+FB01>ed by the neighbourhood of a resonator.
If  it be thought strange that the very powerful motion within
the resonator should produce no more effect than the external
source, it must be remembered the small tendency to escape is
the very reason of the accumulation.

              an insulated conductor called the line connecting two
GIVEN   places, there may be said to be in present use two distinct
methods by which signals made at one end of the line are ob
served at the other.      The <U+FB01>rst, which is that in most general use,
is to connect the line with one end of the coils of an instrument
affected by electric currents, and the other end of the coils with
earth.     The battery at the sending-end being also placed between
the line and the earth, a circuit is established, through which a
current will <U+FB02>ow so long as the battery and instrument remain
undisturbed. This current will in a short time after the <U+FB01>rst nio

                    Signalling  201th  Condensers.                427
ment of contact with the battery become approximately constant
at any one part of the line—and, if there be no leakage, will attain
the same strength at every part of the circuit, including the bat
tery and receiving instrument.       The second method, <U+FB01>rst intro
duced by Mr. Varley, and now in pretty general use on subma
rine lines, is somewhat different.       The end of the coils of the
receiving   instrument,   which   in  the <U+FB01>rst method is connected
with the earth, is now joined to one armature or inductive sur
face of a so-called condenser, properly speaking an electrical
accumulator, the other armature of which is to earth; or, which
comes to the same thing, the condenser is placed between the
line and the receiving instrument. As there is now no longer
a complete conductive circuit, no permanent current can <U+FB02>ow
through the receiving instrument, or indeed through any part of
the line, if the insulation be perfect.
   Imagine the condenser to be a continuation of the cable, in
fact a length of cable having the same capacity as the condenser,
insulated at its further extremity, and the receiving instrument
connecting the main cable with its imaginary continuation, as
shown in <U+FB01>g. 1 3 where    f is the battery at the sending-end of the
line, one pole of which is to earth, K a key for making contact
between its other pole and the cable A, and e the receiving in
strument placed between A and the continuation B.

   Then when contact is made at K it is evident that only so
much electricity will pass through e as will charge B up to the
potential of the further end of A. The current through e will
therefore be transient, rising to a maximum and then dying
 away.   This method of representation would be perfect if we
could neglect the resistance of the conductor inside B ; as, how
ever, in practice the capacity of the condenser is only a fraction
of that of the line, there will be little difference due to this cause.
And if the capacity of B be very small, we may consider the <U+FB02>ow

    To <U+FB01>nd an' expression for the potential and the current at any
point of a cable insulated at one end, at any time after contact
is made with a battery at the other end, the only way, as far as
I  am aware, is to follow the method given by Sir William Thom
son in 1855 (Proc. Roy. $00.), making the necessary alterations
to suit the changed conditions of the problem.        It is to express
the actual potential at any time as the difference of two func
tions, one being the known <U+FB01>nal distribution of- potential, and
the other the departure from the <U+FB01>nal potential, the latter being
expressed by an in<U+FB01>nite convergent series every term of which
is of the form

  By comparison     with the arrival-curve for the current at the
remote end when to earth, we see that, broadly speaking, it takes
about four times as long for the potential to nearly attain its
maximum when the end is insulated as it takes for the current
to nearly attain its maximum when the end is to earth.     Thus,
when the end is to earth, the current reaches 98 per cent. of its
maximum strength in 20a; and when the end is insulated, the
potential reaches 98 per cent. of its maximum in 80a. This
relation does not hold good throughout the whole extent of the
curves; but there is a general similarity. We may conclude that
signalling by means of an electrometer connected with the insu
lated end of a cable would be much slower than the ordinary
plan of a galvanometer or recording instrument worked by the
current.

   The strength of the current will of course depend on the
capacity of the condenser, and will be proportional thereto so
long as    it small compared with the capacity of the line.

the line, the maximum strength of the current will not be so
soon reached with the larger capacity: although the signals will
be stronger, they will be more retarded.     Hence the best capa
city to  be used  on  any  line, which  should  theoretically be as
small as possible, must be determined                         by
                                               the delicacy of the

 432               Mr. O. Heaviside    on Telegraphic
 manent current which would <U+FB02>ow were the end of the line put
 to earth.
    The effect of a condenser on the signals varies according to the
 description of instruments used for observing the signals, on the
 system of currents forming the signals, and on the value of the
 unit of time a for the particular line under consideration. Thus
 on an overland line worked on the Morse system with single
 currents, where the signalling consists in alternately connecting
 the sending-end of the line with one pole of a battery and to
 earth, it would be impossible to make dashes, because on land
 lines the length of a contact is always so great compared with
 the unit a, even in rapid signalling, that the current at the re
 ceiving-end would have come and gone long before the contact at
 the sending-endwas <U+FB01>nished. On cables of any considerablelength
 it would be different.    There would then be only a shortening of
 the dashes, its extent depending on the length of the contact;
 and it would consequently lead to an increase in the speed of
 working.      There would similarly be very little direct advantage,
 save immunity from earth-currents,        in using on land lines the
 condenser with polarized relays and reversing-keys,         although
 there would be no shortening of the marks, as the armature of a
 polarized instrument will, if properly adjusted, remain in the
position in which it is placed by a transient current. On cables
 worked with the same instruments, a considerable increase in
 the speed of working results.
    But the condenser is peculiarly applicable to those systems of
 signalling where the currents sent are of equal duration and
 alternately positive and negative; for example, Sir C. Wheat
 stone’s automatic system.      A succession of reversals, each con
 tact of' the length 4a, produces through the receiving instrument
 reversals alternately 50 per cent. plus and 50 per cent. minus,
being a whole range of 100 per cent.          Without the condenser
the whole amplitude of variation of the current is only 24'42
per cent.      On a certain circuit worked by the automatic system,
on which the value of a was about 00175 second, the speed of
working with condenser was 75 per cent. greater than without.
    With Sir W. Thomson’s mirror and recording instruments
there does not at <U+FB01>rst sight appear any reason why the speed of
working should be much raised, as they indicate in the one case
and record in the other every change in the strength of the cur
rent. Yet the condenser is of great advantage here, as it keeps
the spot of light and siphon within very narrow ranges, never
departing much from the zero line, and naturally the signals are
much more distinct.

 strument, 'C' the condenser, and R the resistance introduced
 between the end of the line and earth.              This resistance is ne
 cessary   in    order to  raise the    potential of  the end of the cable,
 and give signals of a workable strength.              That this plan does
 increase the speed, I have veri<U+FB01>ed on the circuit before men
 tioned, using a polarized instrument and double current key.
 The increase in speed was about 20 per cent., compared with
 the speed obtained by making R in<U+FB01>nite.                The signals were, of
 course, weaker in the former than in the latter case.
     The effects of defective insulation may be traced by giving h
 different small values in equation                  In the <U+FB01>rst place the
 signals are weakened; and next, the e<U+FB01>'ect of loss is to decrease
 the time required for the signal to arrive at its maximum
 stren g th.      Thus when    h: 2"

                                       the maximum is reached in 4a, as
 against    7a when      11:0.    This is an extreme case, and would
 nearly correspond       to  the French    Atlantic cable if its insulation
  resistance were 3 megohms per knot, instead of more probably
 300. Whether loss does or does not increase the speed of work
  ing depends on a great many circumstances.              It is an undoubted
  fact that, under some systems of signalling, a cable with a very
  bad fault in it has worked quicker than when it was perfect;
  and it is also a demonstrable fact that under other systems the
  e<U+FB01>'ect of loss is greatly to diminish the speed.            In a particular
  case which I have examined theoretically and practically, the fact
  that each signal should be more quickly made through a faulty

434.-     Mr.   J. Croll on    the Physical Cause of Ocean-currents.
     Another method of receiving signals has been tried, though
not adopted anywhere.            The current is passed through the pri
mary wire of an induction-coil, in the secondary circuit of which

is the receiving instrument.           The signal here depends on 2?,
 the rate of increase of the current; and the arrival-curve has its
 maximum at about 3'5a, while with condenser pure and simple
 it is 7a. It does not, therefore, appear evident why, as Mr.Var
 ley states, he found the condenser more satisfactory.               Mr. G.
 K. Winter reinvented this system, and reports very favourably
 on its e<U+FB01>'ect (British Association, Brighton, 1872).

        GENTLEMEN,
            lecture at the Royal Institution, and also in the ‘Athe
 IN naeum,’
         a
                   ‘
                      Nature,’ Philosophical Magazine, and other quar
 ters, Dr. Carpenter has been advancing a somewhat plausible
 look-ing objection to my views in reference to under-currents.
 As this objection bears upon a point which in my last commu
 nication I omitted to consider, perhaps you will permit me,
 through your columns, brie<U+FB02>y to refer to it. The objection in
 question, as statedin Dr. Carpenter’s own words, is as follows :—
      “Accordi-ng :to Mr. Croll’s doctrine, the whole of that vast
  mass of water in the North Atlantic, averaging, say, 1500 fa
  ;thoms in thickness and 3600 miles in breadth, the temperature
                                                                     ‘
  of which (from 40° downwards), as ascertained by the                  Chal
  lenger’ soundings, clearly        shows it   to be mainly  derived  from   a
  polar source, is nothing else than the re<U+FB02>ua'ofihe Gulf-stream.
  Now, even if we suppose that the whole of this stream, as it
  passes Sandy Hook, were to go on into the "closed Arctic basin,
  it would only force out an equivalent body of water. And as,
  on comparing the sectional areas of the two,~          I  <U+FB01>nd that of the
  Gulf-stream to be about one 900th that of the North Atlantic
  under<U+FB02>ow; and as it is admitted that a large part of the Gulf
   stream returns into the Mid-Atlantic circulation, only a branch
  of it going on to the north-east, the extreme improbability (may
   1 not say impossibility?) that so vast a mass of water can be
  put in motion by what is by comparison a mere rivulet (the
  north-east motion of which, as a distinct current, has not been
   traced eastward of 30° W. long.) seems still more obvious."
      The objection seems to me to be based upon a series of mis
   apprehensions :—(1) that the mass of cold water 1500 fathoms
   deep and 3600 miles in breadth is in a state of motion towards

     Mr.    J   .   Croll   on the   Physical Cause           of Ocean-currents.       435
the equator; (2) that it cannot be the re<U+FB02>ux of the Gulf-stream,
because its sectional area is 900 times as great as that of the
Gulf-stream ; (3) that the immense mass of water               according    is,
to my views, set in motion                 by
                                  the Gulf-stream.
 I    shall consider these in their order.     (1) That this immense
mass of cold water came originally from the polar regions              of             I,
course, admit, but that the whole          in   state of motion
                                                         is   a     cer            I
tainly do not admit.      There no warrant whatever for any such
                                           is
assumption. According to Dr. Carpenter himself, the heating—
power of the sun does not extend to any great depth below the
surface;   consequently there     nothing whatever to heat this mass
                                           is
'but the heat coming through the earth’s crust.         But the amount
.of heat derived from this source         so tri<U+FB02>ing, that an under
                                                     is
current from the Arctic regions far less in volume than that of
the Gulf-stream would be quite suf<U+FB01>cient to keep the mass at
an ice-cold temperature.      Taking the area of the North Atlantic
 between the equator and the tropic of Cancer, including also
the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, to be 7,700,000
square miles, and the rate at which internal heat passes through
the earth’s surface to be that assigned         Sir William Thomson,
                                                              by
 we <U+FB01>nd that the total quantity (of heat derived from the earth’s
.crust by  the above area     equal to about 88 X 1015 foot-pounds
                                     is
 per day.    But this amount        equal to only 3%,; that conveyed
                                               is
 by the Gulf-stream, on the supposition that each pound of water
 carries 19,300 foot-pounds of heat.         Consequently an under
current from the polar regions of not more than              the volume
vof the Gulf-stream would suf<U+FB01>ce to keep the entire mass of water
 of that area within 1° of what        would he were there no heat
                                                    it
 derived from the crust of the earth; that            to say, were the
                                                                     is
 water conveyed             by
                       the under-current    at 32°, internal  heat would
 not maintain the mass of the ocean in the above area at more
 than 33°. ~The entire area of the North Atlantic from the
 equator to the arctic circle somewhere about 16,000,000 square
                                          is
 miles.    Au under-current of less than             that of the Gulf
                                                                    117
 stream coming from the Arctic regions would therefore sut<U+FB01>ce to
  keep the entire North Atlantic basin <U+FB01>lled with ice-cold water.
  In short, whatever theory we adopt regarding oceanic circulation,
it  follows equally as    necessary consequence that the entire mass
                                 a
of the ocean below the stratum heated                          by   the sun’s     rays must
consist of cold water. For    cold water   if     continually coming
                                                                   be
from the polar regions   either  in the  form  of  under-currents, or
win the form of   general under-<U+FB02>ow as Dr. Carpenter supposes,
                         a
the entire under portion of the ocean must ultimately become
 occupied           by
              cold water   for there ;    no source from which this

 effect.    For example, a polar under-current one half the size of
  the Gulf-stream would be suf<U+FB01>cient to keep the entire water of the
 globe (below the stratum heated by the sun’s rays) at an ice
 cold temperature.       Internal heat would not be suf<U+FB01>cient under
 such circumstances to maintain the mass 1° Fahr. above the
 temperature it possessed when it left the polar regions.
     (2) But suppose that this immense mass of cold water occu
 pying the great depths of the ocean were, as Dr. Carpenter
 assumes it to be, in a state of constant motion towards the
 equator, and that its sectional area were 900 times that of the
  Gulf-stream, it would not therefore follow that the quantity of
 water passing through this large sectional area must be greater
 than that <U+FB02>owing through a sectional area of the Gulf-stream ;
 for the quantity of water <U+FB02>owing through this large sectional
 area depends entirely on the rate of motion.
     (3) I am wholly unable to understand how it could be supposed
 that this under-<U+FB02>ow, according to my view, is set in motion by
 the Gulf-stream, seeing that       I have shown that the return under
 current is as much due to the impulse of the wind as the Gulf
 stream itself.
     I am also wholly unable to comprehend how Dr. Carpenter
 should imagine, because the bottom-temperature of the South
 Atlantic happens to be lower, and the polar water to lie nearer
 to the surface in this ocean than in the North Atlantic, that
 therefore this proves the truth of his theory.           This condition
 of matters is just as consistent with my theory as with his. When
 we consider the immense quantity of warm surface-water which,
 as has been proved, is being constantly transferred            from the
 South    into  the  North   Atlantic   (a quantity  which  to a large ex
__tent is compensated by a cold current from the Antarctic regions),
 we readin understand how the polar water comes nearer to the
 surface in the former ocean than in the latter.        In fact the whole
 of the phenomena arejust        as  easily explained upon the principle
 of under-currents as upon Dr. Carpenter’s theory.
     Dr. Carpenter lays considerable stress on the important fact
                       ‘              ’
 established by the Challenger expedition, that the great depths
 of the sea in equatorial regions are occupied by ice-cold water,
 while the portion heated by the sun’s rays is simply a thin
  stratum at the surface.      It seems to me that it would be dif<U+FB01>cult
 to <U+FB01>nd a fact more hostile to his theory than this. Were it not
for this upper stratum of heated water there would be no differ
_encc between the equatorial and polar columns, and consequently
 nothing to produce motion. But the thinner this stratum is
,the less is the difference, and the less there is to produce motion.

is much easier to prove (3) in an elementary way than         In
fact, although (5) is demonstrated at once by Fourier’s theorem,
it does not admit of being established very simply by ordinary
algebra (see De Morgan’s ‘Di<U+FB01>'. and Int. Calc.’ p. 668).       It
will be observed that in the proof given above, with the ex
ception of the series for the cotangent, nothing higher than
algebra is required, as the continued differentiation may, as
usual, be replaced by a comparison of coe<U+FB02>icients.

a point 0, C, 8:0. as the case may be, but not to another
point H), we_may without breaking up the diagram remove all
the points H with the links belonging to them, and thus obtain
a diagram without any points H : such a diagram may be termed
a “ kenogramz” the valency is obviously that of the original
diagram plus the number of removed H’s.
   If from a kenogram we remove every point 0, C, 860. connected
with the rest of the diagram by a single link only (each with the
link belonging to it), and so on inde<U+FB01>nitely as long as the pro
cess is practicable, we arrive at last at a diagram in which every
point 0, C, &c. is connected with the rest of the diagram by two
links at least: this may be called a “ mere kenogram.”
   Each or any point of a mere kenogram may be made the
origin of a “ rami<U+FB01>cation ;” viz. we haVe here links branching out
from the original point, and then again from the derived points,
and so on any number of times, and never again uniting.        We
 can thus from the mere kenogram obtain (in an in<U+FB01>nite variety of
ways) a diagram.      The diagram completely determines the mere
kenogram; and consequently two diagrams cannot be identical
unless they have the same mere kenogram.        Observe that the
mere kenogram may evanesce altogether; viz. this will be the
case if the diagram or kenogram is a simple rami<U+FB01>cation.
   A rami<U+FB01>cation of n points C is (2n+2)valent': in fact this is
so in the most simple case              n:
                                1 ; and admitting it to be trile for
any value of n, it is at once seen to be true for the next suc
ceeding value.    But no kenogram of points C is so much as
(2n+2)-valent; for instance, 3 points C linked into a triangle,
instead of being B-valent are only 6-valent. We have therefore
plerograms of n points C and 2n+2 points H, say plerograms
C 112"“;    and in any such plerogram the kenogram is of ne
cessity a rami<U+FB01>cation of n points C; viz. the different cases of

thus accounted for, the theory holds good without modi<U+FB01>ca

 Professor James Thomson, LL.D., Queen’s College, Belfast.
    In two communications made by me to the British Associa—
 tion, at its Meetings at Edinburgh in 1871 and at Brighton in
 1872, and printed as abstracts in the Transactions of the Sections
 for those years, considerations were adduced on relations between
 the gaseous, the liquid, and the solid states of matter.    The new
 subject of the present paper constitutes      further development of
                                                 a
 some   of those previous considerations     ;   and   a   brief sketch of these

  448             Royal Society .---Prof.       J. Thomson      on the
  is necessary here as an introduction for rendering intelligible what
  is to follow.
      Taking into consideration any substance which we can have in
  the three states, gaseous, liquid, and solid, we may observe that,
  when any two of these states are present in contact together,
  the pressure and temperature are dependent each on the other, so
  that when one is given the other is <U+FB01>xed.             Then, if we denote geo
  metrically all possible points of temperature and pressure jointly by
  points spread continuously in a plane surface, each point in the
  plane being referredto two axes of rectangular coordinates, so that
  one of its ordinates shall represent the temperature and the other
  the pressure denoted by that point, we may notice that there will
  be three curves—one expressing the relation between tempera
  ture and pressure for gas with liquid, another expressing that for
  gas with solid, and another expressing that for liquid with solid.
  These three curves, it appears, must all meet or cross each other
  in one point of pressure and temperature jointly, which may be
  called the triple point".
      The curve between gas and liquid, which may be called the boil
  ing-Zinc, will be a separating boundary between the regions of the
  plane corresponding to the ordinary liquid and those corresponding
  to the ordinary gaseous state. But by consideration of Dr. An
  drews’s experimental results (Phil. Trans. 1869), we may see that
  this separating boundary comes to an end at a point of tempera
     * In making this statement, that it appears that the three curves must all
                                  I
  cross each other in one point, would wish to offer it here (as   I previousl did in
  the 1871 British-Association paper) subject to some reserve in respect 0 condi
  tions not yet known with perfect clearness and certainty.          I have to suggest
  that we might not be quite safe in assuming that, within a cavity containing
  nothing but pure water-substance partly gaseous, the melting temperature and
  pressure of ice solidi<U+FB01>ed from the gaseous state would be the same as the melting
  temperature and pressure of ice frozen from the liquid state, and in making other
   suppositions, such as that the same quantity of heat would become latent in the
  melting of equal quantities of ice formed in these two ways, and in neglecting
   conceivable but, I presume, as yet imperfectly known distinctions of capillary
  conditions between ice amply wet with water and ice only moistened with the
  last vestiges of water before the whole liquid may be either evaporated or frozen.
  It might be a question in like manner whether we can be sure that there can be
  theoretically a condition of repose in a cavity containing only perfectly pure
  water-substance   in which the three states are present together, each in Contact
  With the other two, so that there would be ice partly wet with water, and partly
  dry in contact with gaseous water-substance, or steam as it may be called, while
  the water and steam were also in contact with each other.     I offer these remarks
  by way of caution, as they force themselves into notice when we attempt to
  sketch out the features of the three curves under consideration, and because they
  may serve to suggest questions for experimental and theoretical investigation
  which may have been generally overlooked before.        In the present paper, how
  ever,  I proceed on assumptions, such as are usually tacitly made, of identity in
  the thermal and dynamic conditions of pure ice solidi<U+FB01>ed in different ways,
  assumptions which, so far as is known, may be, and probably are, perfectly true;
   and  I proceed on the supposition that there can be theoretically the condition
  of repose here alluded to, ofthe‘solid, liquid, and gaseous states, present together
  each in contact with the other two—and consequently that the three curves would
‘
  meet or cross each other in one point, which   I have called the triple point.

  ture and pressure which, in conformity with his language, may be
  called the critical point of pressure and temperature jointly; and
  we may see that, from any liquid state to any gaseous state, the
  transition may be gradually e<U+FB01>ected by an in<U+FB01>nite variety of courses
  passing round the extreme end of the boiling-line*.
      The accompanying <U+FB01>gure serves to illustrate these considerations
  in reference to transitions between the three states, the gaseous,
  the liquid, and the solid.     The <U+FB01>gure is intended only as a sketch
  to illustrate principles, and is not drawn according to measure
  ments for any particular substance, though the main features of
  the curves shown in it are meant to relate in a general way to the
  substance of water, steam, and ice. A X and A Y are the axes
  of coordinates for temperatures and pressures respectively, A
  (the origin) being taken as the zero for pressures and as the zero
  for temperatures on the Centigrade scale. The curve L represents
 represents the line between liquid and solid. It is drawn showing
 in an exaggerated degree the lowering of the freezing tempera—
 ture of water     by pressure,    the exaggeration     being necessary to
allow small changes of temperature to be perceptible in the dia
 gram.     The line T N represents the line between the gaseous and
the solid states of water-substance. The line L T N appears to have
 been generally (in the discussion of experimental results on the
pressure of aqueous vapour above and below the freezing-point) re
garded as one continuous curve; but it was a part of my object in
the two British—Association         papers referred to, to show that it
ought to be considered two distinct curves (L T P and N T Q)
crossing each other in the triple point T.

ferred to (the one read at the Brighton Meeting, 1872),          gave                                  I
demonstrations showing that these two curves L T and N T should
meet, as shown in the accompanying <U+FB01>gure, with a re-entrant angle
at T, not with a salient angle such as is exempli<U+FB01>ed in the vertex of
a pointed arch, and offered in conclusion the suggestion that the
reasoning which had been adduced might be followed up by a quan—
titative calculation founded on experimental data, by which calcu—
lation the di<U+FB01>erence of the pressures of steam with water and steam
with ice‘for any given temperature very near the triple point may
be found with a very close approximation to the truth.
    In the month of last October (October 1872) explained to my          I
brother, Sir William Thomson, the nature of that contemplated
quantitative calculation:           I
                              mentioned to him the method which                                                     I
had prepared for carrying out the intended investigation, and in
quired of‘him for some of the experimental data, or data already
deduced by theory from experiments, which         was seeking to ob  I
tain.    On his attention being thus turned to the matter, he noticed
that the desired quantitative relation could be obtained very di
rectly and easily from a simple formula which he had given in his
paper on the Dynamical Theory of Heat, Transactions of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh, March 17, 1851, § 21 (3), to express
the second law of thermodynamics for a body of uniform tempe
rature throughout, exposed to pressure equal in all directions.

or whether we may suppose that possibly there may have been
some experimental observations which attracted the curve down
wards, but were afterwards rejected on a supposition of their being
untrustworthy, it appears that such a bend is a feature which
the curve really ought to possess, and is one which even after
being partially smoothed off by way of correction is not obliterated,
but still remains clearly discoverable in the <U+FB01>nal numerical tables of
results.
    This is best brought to light by means of the empirical for
mulae devised and employed by Regnault for the collating of
his results.      He proceeded evidently under the idea of the curve
being     continuous     in its nature, so that a single formula might
represent     the  pressures of aqueous vapour throughout the whole
of his experiments; but before seeking for such a formula he pro
ceeded to calculate several local formqu of which each should
represent very exactly his experiments between limits of tempe
rature not wide apart; and afterwards he worked out several general
 formula), each adapted sineg for the Whole range of his experi
 ments.
     In regard to the one of these general formulae which he desig—
nates as formula (H) *, he says that it represents the aggregate of
 his determinations of the pressures of the vapour of water, referred
 to the air-thermometer, and extending between the extreme tem
 peratures of ~33° and +232° with such precision that there could
 not be any hope of attaining to representing them better by any
 other mode of interpolation,         because the di<U+FB01>erences, he says, be
 tween the calculated numbers and the numbers deduced from his
 graphic constructions are always smaller than the probable errors
 of observation. Still, for making out his <U+FB01>nal general Table of
 pressures of steam for every degree of the air-thermometer from
  ~30° to +230°, he used three local formulae, <U+FB01>nding that by them
 he could get slightly closer agreements with his experimental deter
 minations than by using the single formula (H) for the whole
 range. Thus between —-32° and 0° he used his formula designated
  as (E); from 0° to 100° he used his formula (D); and between
  100° and 230° he used his formula (H). He points out (page 623)
 that he might have calculated this Table throughout its entire ex
  tent by the single formula (H), and that he would thus have got
  almost identically the same values by it from 100° down to 40° as
  those he calculated by the formula (D), but that between +40° and
  --20° the pressures given by the formula (H) would be slightly too
  small.    This gives indication of the existence of the feature which
  it is my object at present to bring into view; and an examina
  tion of the column of Differences in Regnault’s Table on his page
  608, adapted for comparing the pressures got from experiments as
     * This and other formube in M. Regnault's memoir are here referred to only
  by their letters of reference, because to cite the formulas themselves with their
  necessary accompanying explanations, would extend the present paper to too
  great a length; and any person wishing to scrutinize the formula: would na
  turally prefer to have recourse to the original memon'.

 454         Royal Society          :——Prof.       J.    Thomson   on the
  expressed by his graphic curve with those got from the formula (H),
  shows distinctly a re—entrant angle, or at least a <U+FB02>attened place, in
  the curve at or about 0°,   Several other like comparisons, by means
  of his other formulas, give like indications ; but most of these may
  for brevity be passed over without further mention here. The most
  decisive indication comes out in the following way. We may ob
  serve that for temperatures adjacent to the freezing—point and ex
  tending both ways from it, Regnault <U+FB01>nally adopted as <U+FB01>tting best
  to his experiments the formula (E) for temperatures descending
  from 0°, and the formula (D) for temperatures ascending from 0°.
 He tried (at pages 598, 599 of his memoir) the continuing of the
 application of his formula (D) beyond the inferior of the two limits
 0° and 100°, for which he had specially aimed at adapting it to his
 experimental determinations ; and he found that in calculating by
 it the pressures which it Would give for temperatures below 0°,
 these pressures come out always slightly in excess of those which
 were given by his experiments.                   I
                                         have developed this mode of
 comparison in a more complete manner, and have arrived at remark
 able results.   The formula (D) may be regarded as the formula for
 giving the pressure p of steam with water, and (E) as that for
 giving the pressure    for steam with ice. The following two Tables
 show the pressures    p 10’
                         and     for temperatures, in each case, both

 below and above the freezing-point, as calculated from these two
 formulae; and they show, also in each case, the consequent diifer
 ences of pressure for 1° change of temperature at several diiferent

     Regnault gives in the same memoir (page 627 and following
  pages) another Table, one intended chie<U+FB02>y for meteorological pur
  poses, and in which the pressures are stated from -10° to +35°
  for every 116 of a degree.       In this Table the numbers inserted as
  representing the pressures below the freezing-point are slightly
  different from the corresponding ones in his general Table already
  referred to ; and he mentions that this slight discrepance has re
  sulted from the fact that the two Tables were formed at different
  periods, and were not calculated by the same formula; but he re
  marks that the differences are insigni<U+FB01>cant, as they scarcely amount
  to '02 millimetre.     Here, too, as in the general Table, the feature
  expected shows itself, though in a diminished degree. By a careful
  examination of its column of Diiferences for 110- of a degree, and
  by making a few small arithmetical adjustments which may be re
  garded as amendments in the way of interpolation in that column,
  I  <U+FB01>nd that, according to the experimental results as they are re

  culation, based on theory, in the present paper that it ought to be
  1'13 ; so here the feature is found showing itself in about half
  the degree in which, according to the new quantitative calculation,
  it ought to be met with. When we consider that Regnault’s re
  ductions of his experimental results in the making out of curves,
  formulae, and tables for representing them in the aggregate were,
  as we have su<U+FB02>icient ground to suppose, carried out under the idea,
  now proved to be erroneous, of there being, for aqueous vapour,
  continuity in variations of pressure with variations of temperature
  past the freezing-point, just as past any other point of temperature,
'
  and when we further consider that the quantities with which we are
  here concerned are indeed very small, it is not surprising that there
  should have been a tendency to smooth oif this feature on the sup
  position that any departures of the experimental observations from
  the course of a continuous or smooth curve were only slight irreL
  gularities due to experimental errors or imperfections.

important quantities so connected that improved determinations of
one or more of them may lead to more correct evaluations of others.                  -

of Geology in King’s College, London.
   In this paper the author referred to certain minute fossils from
the Carboniferous rocks of Scotland, described by himself and Mr.
Jenkins in     paper read before the Royal Society, as belonging to
                    a

Wright. He stated that numerous specimens since received from the
Geological Society of Scotland threw some further light on the
nature of these fossils, and showed especially that in all probability
the base     not really cellular, but that the cellular appearance
               is                                                               is

to slickensides.   The author adduced reasons for doubting the
mechanical origin of these striations, and argued that they are of an
organic nature.     He ascribed them to corals, and remarked that
similar striae occur in all limestone formations.

    The two species of fossil Fishes noticed in this paper were de
 scribed by the author in the 13th Decade of the Memoirs of the
 Geological Survey, published in 1872. They are both from the
 Lies of Lyme Regis. He now described some new specimens which
 add to our knowledge of their characters.       An example of Platysi—
 agum shows the position of the dorsal <U+FB01>n, which is placed very far
 back, occupying a place opposite to the interval between the ventral
 and anal <U+FB01>ns, and the form of the trunk, which is of nearly uniform
 depth from the occiput to the base of the dorsal <U+FB01>n. The structure
 of the dorsal <U+FB01>n was described in detail. The new specimen of
 Palwospinaw prisms shows especially the position of the second
 dorsal spine, which is placed over the 50th vertebra, the <U+FB01>rst being
 on the 16th, the <U+FB01>sh thus most nearly approaching the existing
 Cestracion, which it also resembles in its dentition.      In other re
 spects it seemed to be most nearly allied to Acanthias.

   The specimen described showed the outline of a small Star<U+FB01>sh,
with    a large disk and short rays, in a slab of Wenlock Limestone
from Dudley.       The outline of the ten rays wasldescribed as marked
out by the border of small triangular spines, the other plates of the
disk and rays being absent.        Each ray was terminated by a stem
like mul<U+FB01>articulate process as long as the ray, from towards the
extremity of which spring slender lateral processes, giving it a tufted
appearance.       This Star<U+FB01>sh, which is in the collection of Dr. Grind
rod, is named by the author Trichotaster plumiformis.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. “ The Glaciation of the Northern part of the Lake-district.”
By   J.   Clifton Ward, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author stated the leading questions to be settled by his in
vestigation of the northern part of the Lake-district as follows :—
The fact of the glaciation of the district being granted, and of this
he adduced abundant evidence, the questions that arose were whether
the glaciating agent worked from north to south, whether it came
from within or from 'without the district, and <U+FB01>nally, whether the
agent was <U+FB02>oating ice, a system of local glaciers, or an unbroken
ice-cap. As the result of his investigation, he maintained that there
is no evidence that a great ice-cap from the north ever swept over
this district. The ice-scratches trending along the principal valleys,
but sometimes crossing watersheds, indicate a great con<U+FB02>uent
glacier-sheet, at one time almost covering a great part of the dis
trict, the movement of which was determined by the principal water
shed of the Lake-district.       In the part of the Lake—district under

 Mr. Drew      on the Alluvial Records of the Upper  Indus Basin.   459
 consideration the ice, during its increase, carried forward, from
 south to north, a great quantity of rocky material.       There are no
 signs in the district of the occurrence of mild periods during the
 epoch of primary glaciation ; but the author thought that the climate
 had probably become moderate before the great submergence of the
 land commenced.       The author noticed the effect of the submergence
 upon the results of previous glacial action, and maintained that when
 the land had sunk 800 or 900 feet there was a recurrence of cold,
 and boulders were transported by <U+FB02>oating ice.        Until the submer
 gcnce reached 1500 feet there was no direct communication between
 the northern and southern halves of the Lake-district, except by the
 Straits of Dunmail Raise.        From the directions which would be
 taken by the currents in the sea at this peried, it would appear that
 boulders may then have been transported by <U+FB02>oating ice in some of
 the same directions as they had previously been carried by glacier
 ice. The extreme of submergence appeared to have been about 2000
 feet.    The author further maintained that on the reelevation of the
 district there was a second land-glaciation, affecting the higher
 valleys and clearing them- of marine drift.
     2. “  Alluvial and Lacustrine Deposits and Alluvial Records of the
 Upper Indus Basin.”        By Frederic Drew, Esq., F.G S.
     First stating that the alluvium of that country had been noticed
 by several travellers, especially by Major Godwin-Austen, who had
 given much important information about them, the author said that
 he felt the necessity for a careful classi<U+FB01>cation of the phenomena of
 alluvial deposits ; for the want of recognition of the different kinds
 was likely to lead to incorrect deductions; the classi<U+FB01>cation he pro
 posed was the following :—
     I. Loosened material, which consisted of disjointed rocks or loose
 angular stones, sometimes mixed up with mud, which had been sepa
  rated and disintegrated, but since that had remained unmoved.
     II. Taluses, the substance of which had fallen by its own weight,
 and not been transported by streams.       These were the great heaps
 of angular matter that were found at the foot of cliffs, with a slope
 generally of near 35°. A special form was the fan talus, which
  occurred where the falling matter had either originated from, or
  collected to, one spot, from which again it spread, and made a. partial
  cone of the same slope as the ordinary taluses.
     III.  Alluvial Fauna—These were the fan-shaped extensions of
 alluvial or torrential matter that spread out from the mouths of
 gorges, Where these debouched into a more open valley. They were
 in form cones of a low angle, commonly 5° or so; they had accumu
 lated by layer after layer on a cone-shaped surface, as shown by the
 radial sections exhibiting layers of a straight slope, and the chord
 sections showing curves, which were by the theory hyperbolas.
 Many complicated phenomena were produced by the denudation of
  these fans, and the production of secondary ones, some of which
-were illustrated by diagrams.
     IV. Alluvium, which was de<U+FB01>ned as a deposit which sloped down

        460                      Geological Society       :—
        the direction of the valley of the stream which had made it, and
        did not appreciably slope or curve over in a direction at right angles
        to that.
           The alluvium of the country in question consisted mostly of
        pebble-beds, well strati<U+FB01>ed;      was common at all heights, from
                                             it
        16,000 feet or more downwards.       Sections of some 100 feet thick
        were to be observed at intervals along the valleys of most of the
        rivers: one of 500 feet was described as occurring near Sumkiel, in
        Rupshu; and 200, 300, and 400 feet heights of the alluvial terraces
        above the rivers were very general.
           In few cases there were wider openings, <U+FB01>lled with similar de
                a
        posits. The tableland of Deosa'l', where the alluvium made <U+FB02>ats at
        an elevation of 12,500 and 13,000 feet, surrounded by          ring of      a.
        mountains 16,000 and 17,000 feet high, was the most remarkable
        of   these.
             A special phenomenon was described           as now and then occurring
        in the alluvium, namely sloping of the alluvial strata, looking at
                                     a
        <U+FB01>rst like false-bedding on large scale, and, further,
                                         a                      curving or a
        bending of them till they reached round even beyond the perpendi
        cular.   This the author attributed to the ploughing of the foot of a
        glacier against the alluvium that had been formed in front of      by            it
        its own streams.
           The last class of alluvial deposits would be the Iacustn'ne; but a
        description of these was reserved for   future portion of the paper.
                                                      a
                                Summary and Inferences.
             There was evidence of   a   succession   of three   states   :—
               1st. The cutting of the valleys.
               2nd. The accumulation of alluvial matter.
               3rd. The cutting down of the streams through that alluvial
                  matter.
          Accumulation denotes an excess of supply of material from the
        rocks (by disintegration) over what can be carried away by the
        streams.
           Denudation, or the cutting down of the streams through their
        alluvium (the lowering of their beds), denotes  de<U+FB01>ciency of supply
                                                                 a
        of material from the rocks as compared with the transporting power
        of the streams.  Hence the author inferred that the period of great
        accumulation of these alluvial deposits was one of great disintegra
        tion of rocks, one of intense frost (in other words,        was the    it
        Glacial period), and that the denudation occurred when the cold
        lessened and there came to be        smaller supply of disintegrated
                                                  a
        material.
           The connem'on   ofvarious glacial phenomena with the alluvinm,
        such as the one described above, was taken to corroborate the infer
        ence that the greater deposits were made during the Glacial epoch.

  Blanford, Esq., F .G.S.
    In this paper the author described the general characters of the
 super<U+FB01>cial deposits of Central Persia, and noticed the physical geo
 graphy and rainfall of that country.      He described especially the
 desert plains of the interior of the country, the
                                                      paucity and scanti
 ness of the streams, most of which terminate in salt
                                                              swamps and
 lakes, and the occurrence of vast slopes of gravel on the
                                                                margins of

 surrounding mountains. The desert plains he regarded as in general
 the beds of ancient lakes.     His general results may be summed up
 as follows :—Persia has undergone a gradual
                                                 change from a moister

SOME     EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFECTS OF MAGNETISM ON THE
     ELECTRIC DISCHARGE THROUGH A RAREFIED GAS WHEN IT

INtism on gases passed   through by the electric discharge, we studied
<U+FB01>rst the case of the magnet acting upon a discharge perpendicular

with the nature of the     gas, being as much more considerable as the
gas   is a better  conductor  of electricity.
    Inthe same memoir, we next studied the e<U+FB01>ect of the magnet
upon a discharge which takes place along the line joining its two
poles. In this case we observed, on the contrary, a very percep
tible augmentation of the intensity of the current.             We con<U+FB01>ned
ourselves to establishing that this diminution of resistance, occa
sioned in the Geissler tube placed axially between the two magnetic
poles, is the more marked the better conductor the gas and the less
its pressure. \Vith a view to complete our <U+FB01>rst observations. we have
resumed and varied this experiment.            May we be permitted to ex
plain    here brie<U+FB02>y, though they    are   still far from complete, the re
sults to which our latest researches have conducted.
    Instead of arranging our electromagnet in the shape of a horse—
shoe as in our former experiments, with the two horizontal bobbins
in a line with each other and the two opposite magnetic poles, se
parated by an interval of 10 centims., which compelled the Geissler
tube to be introduced into the cylindrical aperture pierced in the
axis of each of the two soft—iron cores, we here employed the elec
 tromagnet in a column, so as to cause only one of the magnetic
 poles to act upon the discharge.        The apparatus in which the dis—
 charge took place (Geissler tube or a large bell) rested on the upper
 extremity of the soft-iron cylinder, the line of the electrodes being
 in the prolongation of the axis of the magnet.                            '
     We commenced by operating with cylindrical Geissler tubes of
 30 centims. length and 32 millims. breadth, presenting interior
 electrodes of platinum wire.       One of these tubes contains nitrogen,
 the other hydrogen, both at a very low pressure, about 1 millim. or
 even less-—at least, judging from the appearance a<U+FB01>ected by the dis
 charge in their interior. The induction-current,             furnished by a
 Ruhmkor<U+FB01> machine of medium size excited by four of Grove’s
 couples, passed through the Geissler tube and then the derivation
 apparatus employed in our previous researches. It was on a very
  small portion of the current, derived into a galvanometer placed far
 enough from the magnet to be unin<U+FB01>uenced by          it,   that we observed
 the variations of intensity of the discharge, according as     it    was or
 was not submitted to the action of the magnet, which was excited
 by 20, 25, 30, and sometimes even 40 Bunsen couples.
     Traversed by the discharge from the Ruhmkor<U+FB01> machine, each
 of the two Geissler tubes exhibits around the negative electrode a
  beautiful blue aureola extending to the sides of the tube, beyond this
 along dark interval, and thence to the positive electrode streaks
  wide apart.     The appearance of this discharge is     completely changed
  as soon as it   issubmitted to the action of the magnet and when the
  negative electrode   is at the bottom or under the immediate action
  of the magnetic pole. Indeed, as soon as magnetization commences,
  the negative aureola, which, with length of about 35 millims., oc
                                      a
  cupied the whole diameter of the tube,   is     transformed into cylinder
                                                                a
  of only8    or millims. diameter, very luminous, extending to the

  dark space and the streaked positive jet, presenting, except the
  streaks and the colour, an appearance analogous to the narrow
 positive jet observed at about 8 or 10 millims. pressure.
     When, instead of a Geissler tube, we employed a large bell or one
 of the balloons by aid of which the experiment was made of the
 aurorae boreales with a central negative electrode encircled by the
 positive ring, we still obtained the same effect ; that is, the large
 spherical aureola, developed at very low pressures isolated around
 the negative electrode, was replaced by a narrow blue jet of vivid
 splendour, having sometimes the appearance of a brilliant blue <U+FB02>ame
 escaping from the positive electrode.        This negative jet is always
 produced in the continuation of the axis of the electromagnet, even
 when the positive electrode is a ring situated in the same horizontal
 plane as the negative electrode.        The electricity, which escaped
 equally in all directions from the negative electrode, now issues
 only in one direction, as if projected to a distance from the mag
 netic pole. But it is only at very low pressures (1 millim., and
 even lower) that the e<U+FB01>ect is produced with this degree of inten
 sity.   The greater the elastic force of the gas, the shorter becomes
 the negative dart, giving place to the positive jet. It is at about
 2 millims. that the repulsion apparently exerted by the magnet
 upon the negative aureola commences to become sensible.
     Such is the modi<U+FB01>cation produced by magnetism in the appear
 ance of the electric discharge.    It is accompanied by quite as marked
 an alteration in the resistance opposed by the rare<U+FB01>ed gas to the
 passage of the discharge. As we had already observed, and recorded
in the memoir before cited, the magnet has the e<U+FB02>’ect, in the case
 of an axial discharge, of notably augmenting the intensity of the
current.
     With the above-described Geissler tube containing           hydrogen,
 placed vertically on the upper extremity of the soft-iron cylinder,
the negative electrode beneath the positive, the galvanometer placed
in the derived current marked 20° when there was no magnetization,
and 40° when the electromagnet was excited by 25 Bunsen couples.
The nitrogen-tube, placed in the same conditions, gave 20° without
magnetization, and 30° with. In another case, on throwing into
the electromagnet the current from 40 Bunsen couples, we saw the
de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer increase, with the hydrogen-tube,
from 12° (before magnetization) to 55°, with the nitrogen-tube from
10° to 35°.     These examples, taken at random from a great num
ber of analogous results, show that the intensity of the discharge
transmitted through the Geissler tube may be quadrupled by the
action of an electromagnet suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful *.             They show,
moreover, what we have already recognized, that the effect On hy
drogen is more marked than on air, that the augmentation of inten
sity of the current is greater with the gas which is more conductive
than with that which is less conductive of electricity.
    * This augmentation of intensity is perceived by imple inspection of the
tube, from the fact that the negative electrode becomes red-hot and shows
traces of fusion as soon as magnetization commences.

    When it is the positive electrode that is submitted to the imme
diate action of the magnet, there is scarcely any appreciable modi<U+FB01>
cation in the appearance and intensity of the discharge.       The e<U+FB01>iect,
however, is exactly the same, whatever the direction of the magne—
tization.
    When the circuit contains several consecutive Geissler tubes all
placed in the same way upon the upper extremity of the soft iron,
each having its negative electrode below, the effect upon the inten
  ity of the current which traverses them all is still greater. But            if,
inaddition to the tube or tubes placed under the action of the mag
net, there  is  one in the circuit out of this action, no eifect upon the
intensity   of its  current      produced by the magnet, although the
                                        is
modi<U+FB01>cation which the appearance of the discharge undergoes in the
other tubes, placed over the magnetic pole, remains the same.            It
seems, then,     that     it special and peculiarly
                               is   a                  intense resistance,
having its seat at the issue from the negative electrode, which                is
thus overcome by the intervention of the magnet.
    A <U+FB01>nal series of experiments support this view, and have shown
us that the dimensions of the negative electrode, Which notably in
 <U+FB02>uence the dimensions of the aureola and the resistance to the
passage of the electricity, in<U+FB02>uence also the augmentation of inten
 sity produced by the magnet in the case of an axial discharge.
Working with the large bell, we had very great, less, or almost
                                               a

     EXPERIMENTS              ON APPARENT    ADHESION-   BY M. STEFAN.
   By the name of apparent adhesion the author designates the
phenomenon that, when two <U+FB02>at plates are laid one upon the other,
they cannot be again separated without the expenditure of        force.
                                                                      a

millim. in 7 minutes. From this it is intelligible how, limiting the
observation to a short time, one may be misled to the assumption
of a static equilibrium.
    The author measured, in his experiments, the times which elapsed
While a given initial distance, measured by a wire placed between
the plates, increased by a certain quantity.           Between these times
and the other quantities which varied with the experiments the
following relations were found.            The times are inversely propor
tional to the separating force; they are, but not exactly, inversely
proportional     to the square of the initial distance; for plates of
di<U+FB02>erent sizes they are to one another as the fourth powers of the
radii of the plates; for diiferent liquids, as the times in which,
under equal pressure, equal volumes of the liquid <U+FB02>ow through a
 capillary tube.
    From this it evidently results that with this phenomenon the
 question is a problem of hydrodynamics ; and it is now easy, at least
 in general, to describe it. When the separating force begins to
 act, the distance between the plates receives an in<U+FB01>nitely small in
 crement,     Thereby the space limited by the plates is augmented,
 and the <U+FB02>uid within undergoes a dilatation, in consequence of which
 the hydrostatic pressure becomes less. The excess of pressure of
 the exterior <U+FB02>uid acts in opposition to the separating force.         N ever—
 theless equilibrium does not ensue, because the diminution of the
 hydrostatic pressure between the plates has for its result a <U+FB02>owing
 in of the exterior <U+FB02>uid and thereby, again, a diminution of the dif
 ference of the pressures.         The distance of the plates can be again
 increased by the separating force, and the same process repeats itself
 in a continuous manner.
     The author gives also an approximative theoretical solution of
 the problem, starting from the following consideration.              The vis
 viva acquired by the plates through the separating force          is,  on ac—
  count of the great slowness of the motion, vanishingly small in com—
 parison with the work of that force.           This work must consequently
 have its equivalent in another work     ;   it   has it in that which   is ne
  cessary for maintaining the <U+FB02>ow of the <U+FB02>uid from the outside into
  the space included between the plates.
     The equation deduced from this assumption gives again all the
  di<U+FB01>erent laws to which the experiments have conducted.             It    per
  mits us also to derive from the experiments the coef<U+FB01>cients of in
  ternal friction for the experimental <U+FB02>uids.          lf  the centimetre be
  chosen  as the  unit  of  length, the mass of   1   gramme as the unit of
  mass,  and  the  second    as  time-unit,
                                        it     follows that for water of the
  temperature   of  19°  C.   this  coef<U+FB01>cient =   00108, for air = 0'00183,
  which values almost exactly coincide with those deduced from the
  experiments of Poiseuille, Maxwell, and O. E. Meyer.—Kaiserliche

           A SPARK—ADJUSTER         FOR THE HOLTZ      MACHINE.
                            BY JAMES    J. MINOT.
    In the Annalen der Physik and       Chemie, Bd. cxxxvii. p. 452, and
Ed. cxxxix. p. 509, under the title of “ Schwache elektrische Funken
in Luft, von P. Riess,” a method is described of obtaining different
kinds of electric sparks from the Holtz machine.
    The following method seems to be preferable to that described in
the above-mentioned articles:—-Having insulated the outer coating
of the two Leyden jars which form a part of the ordinary Holtz
machine, short thick wires were connected with these outside
coatings and terminated in two brass pointers or conductors, so
arranged that the distance between them could be varied at pleasure.
At <U+FB01>rst the conductors were placed in connexion with each other;
it was then found that a series of sparks were given oif between
the conductors of the machine.         The extreme length of spark 0b
tainable with the machine which was used was 20 centims.               The
sparks so obtained were large and luminous, passing only at inter
vals, and requiring a certain electric tension before they would
leap across the space.       Then the pointers connected with the outer
coatings of the Leyden jars were drawn apart about 13 millims. ;
it was then found that a succession of <U+FB01>ne thread-er sparks
passed across the space separating the conductors of the machine,
whereas there was no such appearance between the pointers con
nected with the jars.        But at intervals a larger spark, not so bright
as the normal spark of the machine, would jump across the con
 ductors ; and simultaneously with this a similar spark passed
 between the pointers.        This <U+FB01>ne line of sparks was found to have
a peculiar form, being brightest and largest at the ends of the con—
ductors of the machine, fading away to a lighter and redder tint,
and being of a thread-like character in the space between the knobs
 of the conductors.
    It was found, if the distance between the conductors of the
 machine exceeded a little that between the pointers connected with
 the Leyden jars, that no large sparks passed between either set of
 conductors, but only a series of thread-like discharges.        When the
 distance between the conductors of the machine was less than that
 between the pointers, a similar result was obtained.           When the
 pointers were but a few millimetres apart, a continuous loop—like
discharge passed between them, which was not interrupted by the
 occasional passage of abright spark, and was not coincident in path
 with the latter. By varying the distance of the pointers of the
 Leyden jars, the number and character of the sparks could be
 changed at will.       This method possesses the advantage that by an
 easy adjustment of these pointers the form of the electric-spark can
 be readily studied.        In experimenting upon the passage of the
  spark through different media, we can by this method diminish the
 diameter, so to speak, of the spark, and can change quickly from
 the spark discharge to that of the brush.         The change in tone of
 the sound of the discharge, when the distance between the pointers
 is varied, is quite marked.—Silliman’s      American Journal, May 1874.
