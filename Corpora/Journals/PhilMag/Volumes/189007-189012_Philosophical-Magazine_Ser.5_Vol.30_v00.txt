I.   On the Application of Interference Methods to Astro
      nomical Measurements. By Albert A. Michelson*.
                            [Plates I. & H.]
IN a recent paper on " Measurement by Light-Waves " t it
       was shown that the limitation of the effective portions of
an objective to the extreme ends of a diameter converted the
instrument into a refractometer ; and although definition
and resolution are thereby sacrificed, the accuracy may be
increased ten to fifty fold.
   The simplest way of effecting this in the case of a telescope
is to provide the cap of the objective with two slits adjustable
in width and distance apart. If such a combination be focused
on a star, then, instead of an image of the star, there will be a
series of coloured interference-bands with white centre, the
bands being arranged at equal distances apart and parallel to
the two slits. The position of the central white fringe can be
marked from ten to fifty times as accurately as can the centre
of the telescopic image of the star.
   One of the most promising applications of the method is the
measurement of the angular magnitudes of small sources of
light.
   This may be accomplished by taking advantage of the well-
known principle that in order to obtain clear interference-

2           Mr. A. A. Michelson on the Application of
bands from two pencils diverging from the same source (width
a) at an angle /3, it is necessary that either $ or a be very
small.
                               Fig. 1.
   Thus, in fig. 1, let us take
   a= eei = width of the source.
   d= distance of source from the objective.
   b = SSj = distance between the slits.
   Also put S,P=A,-| =«, j=£.
   Then the usual statement is that the interference-fringes
vanish when S«i - Se = i/3a = \ba =       or when
                                  \
                              a=V
   But ^ is the " limit of resolution " of the telescope of
aperture b, and if this be denoted by a0 we have
   Or, in words, the fringes disappear when the source subtends
an angle which can just be resolved by the telescope.
   The experiment was first tried with an objective of 45
millim. effective diameter (distance between the slits) at a dis
tance of ten metres from an adjustable slit which served as
the source.
   It was found that the first indication of indistinctness
occurred when a was 0'08 millim. wide, and at 0'14 millim.
the fringes almost vanished.
   But on continuing to widen the slit they again became clearly
visible, to disappear and reappear at regular intervals.
   Now, though it might with truth be urged that the ob
servation of the indefinite vanishing of interference-fringes
depends so much on the attendant circumstances, and especially
on the condition of the observer, that it can scarcely be called
a precise measurement, yet the statement applies no longer

     Interference Methods to Astronomical Measurements.          3
 when the disappearance depends on the existence of well-
 marked minima of distinctness ; and, as will appear below, it is
possible to measure, with accuracy, by the observation of these
minima the width of a source of light, which in a telescope
can with difficulty be ascertained to have an appreciable size.
   The theory of these successive appearances and disappear
ances is as follows:—
   Returning to fig. 1, let x be the distance of any element of
the source from the axis of the telescope, dx the width of the
element, and y=<f>(x) the length.
   Then the difference in the two paths xS and #S,P terminating
at the wave-front P, which makes an angle 7 with the plane
perpendicular to the axis of the telescope, will be 0x- 76, and
the resulting intensity in the direction 7 for the whole source
will therefore be

    The successive values of the maxima, disregarding signs,
 calculated from the above equation, are :—

                                V       - 0-091
    The negative values mean that during the corresponding
 period the fringes are reversed9.
    As the expression for V contains \, the wave-length of
 the light employed, the fringes can disappear for that colour
 (and the complementary one) only; and as this will be most
 decided for the brightest colour in the spectrum, the yellow
 or greenish yellow (and therefore also for violet), there will
 be a residue of red and blue-green mixed with much white
 light. Both of these deductions have been fully verified by
 experiment.
    * Probably the expression for V should be (j^qTjy , but this will not
 affect the position of the points for which V = 0.

   The curve V = A (fig. 3) shows that the maxima are con
 siderably smaller than in the case of the slit, and, accordingly,
 the disappearances are not quite so sharp ; but in one case it
 was possible to note four of them, and in this case also the
 average error was less than 2 per cent.

8         Mr. A. A. Michelson on the Application of
            Case III.—Illumination not Uniform.
   On applying the preceding formulas to observations on
images of the sun's disk the angles obtained were all too small
by about 10 per cent., the cause of the discrepancy being the
want of uniformity of illumination.
   The curve (fig. 4) represents the intensity at any point of
the sun's disk as a function of its distance from the centre,

   Table IV. exhibits the results of observations made upon
two circular apertures whose diameter is given under the

    The measurement of the angular magnitude of sources of
 light too small to be resolved by the telescope may also be
 effected with a considerable degree of accuracy by providing
 the telescope objective with a slit or diaphragm which can be
 varied in width or size, and measuring the distance between
 the centres of the diffraction-fringes by means of a micro
 meter eyepiece. In case the slit is used (as found most
 convenient in practice), the expression for the intensity of
 illumination at a distance y from the centre of the central
 bright band will be

   The results of some observations by this method on the
size of a slit and of circular openings of varying diainoters,
gave, in the case of the slit, errors varying from one to fifteen
per cent., the average error being about eight per cent. ; and
in the case of circular openings errors of from three to twenty-
five per cent., the average error being about twelve per cent.
The accuracy of both this and the preceding method would
undoubtedly be increased by taking the mean of a number of
 observations.
    Of the two methods, the first is by far the most accurate;
 but even the second gives results which are from eight to ten
times as accurate as those which can be obtained by using
 the telescope directly.
    The apparatus by which the observations in the preceding
 tables were made is shown in Plate II. fig. 1. The objective
 of the telescope (a very fine four-inch glass, for the use of
 which I am indebted to the Worcester Polytechnic Institute)
 was fitted with a pair of adjustable slits, whose distance apart
 could be regulated by a right-and-left-hand screw geared to
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 30. No. 182. July 1890.            C

 18         Mr. A. A. Michelson on the Application of
 a rod (as shown in the Plate), so as to be controlled by the
 observer, and the distance between the slits was read off by a
 small telescope beside the eyepiece of the large one.
    This simple and effective device has but one disadvantage.
 When the angle to be measured is so small as to be just
 beyond the power of the telescope, it is necessary, in order to
 observe the first disappearance of the fringes, that the slits
 should be separated to the full width of the aperture. Under
 these circumstances the two pencils meet at a very large
 angle, usually several degrees, and the corresponding distance
 between the inteference-fringes is but a few thousandths of a
 millimetre, and in order to be visible as such must be highly
 magnified and accordingly very faint.
    This difficulty may be entirely overcome by using instead
 of the telescope one of the forms of refractomcters shown in
figs. 10 and 11.
                Fig. 10.                          Fig. 11.
   The first of these will be recognized as one of the forms
already described *.
   The apparatus being adjusted so that interference-fringes
are visible, the telescope (a comparatively small one) is
adjusted until the two images of its cross-hairs in the mirror
mi coincide with the cross-hairs themselves.
   When this is the case, it is clear that when the whole
apparatus is pointed at a star (the mirror m being now

removed) the two pencils will meet in the focus in the same
phase, and the breadth of the interference-bands may be
regulated by slight alterations of the pieces of the refracto-
meter, without in any way affecting the intensity of the light.
But beside this incidental advantage is the much more
important one, that it is possible, by simply increasing the
distance between the mirrors a b, to enormously increase the
effective aperture of the telescope.
    Plate II. fig. 2 shows, on a scale of one-fourth actual size,
a plan of a proposed instrument for effecting this object.
The optical arrangement adopted is that shown in fig. 1 1 .
    This form, notwithstanding the greater number of glasses,
has some decided advantages over that of fig. 10. In addition
 to greater facility and ease of adjustment, it has the important
advantage of preserving constant the width of the fringes
notwithstanding the angular displacement of the whole
 apparatus *.
    The instrument figured in Plate II. would be used as
 follows :—The mirrors a and b being moved as close together
 as possible, and the auxiliary mirror m being in place, the
 mirror a is adjusted by the screws SS till the two images of
 a source of light L as viewed in the telescope T appear to
 coincide. Next the mirror m is adjusted in azimuth by the
 screw K till the paths of the two pencils are equal. (As
 before mentioned, this angular motion does not affect the
 mutual inclination of the pencils, and therefore the breadth
 of the fringes is unaltered.) The telescope T is then adjusted
 till the two images of its illuminated cross-hairs coincide with
 the cross-hairs themselves, and is then clamped.
     The mirror m is now detached and the instrument is ready
 for use.
     Suppose the object to bo measured is a minor planet or
 satellite. The whole instrument, which would have to be
 placed on an equatorial mounting, is pointed so that the
  image of the body is exactly on the cross-hairs. The inter
  ference-fringes will at once appear if the adjustment has been
  properly made.
     Next, by means of a right-and-left-hand screw, the mirrors
  a and b are separated until the fringes disappear. If this
  disappearance is due to an accident, it will immediately
  become evident by observing any star in the neighbourhood.
  If the examination of the star shows the fringes while they
     * The same advantage obtains in the use of the instrument as a refrac-
  tomer for measuring extremely small variations of the angular position
  of the mirror or mirrors m.

are absent in the case of the planet, it may be considered
certain that the cause of the disappearance in the latter case
is its appreciable disk.
   The angular diameter of the latter can be found (on the
supposition of uniform illumination) by the formula
where X is the wave-length of the light, and b the distance
between the centres of the mirrors a and b *.
   From what has gone before, it will be inferred that the
chief object of the method proposed is the measurement of
the apparent size of minute telescopic objects, such as plane
toids, satellites, and possibly star disks, and also double stars
too close to be resolved in the most powerful telescope. But
it is clear that interference methods may also be employed
for the measurement of star-places.
   Thus, in observations for right ascension, the slits would be
placed parallel to the meridian, and the instant of passage of
the central white fringe across the spider-lines noted ; and
in observations for declination, the slits would be horizontal,
the cross-hair being brought to coincide with the centre of
the white fringe.
   The increase in accuracy to be expected from this method
would, however, be limited by the imperfections of our
present means of measuring time and angles ; still, it would
appear that by ifa use a one-inch glass may be made to do
the work now required of a ten-inch.
                              Conclusion.
    (1) Interference phenomena produced under appropriate
conditions from light emanating from a source of finite mag
nitude become indistinct as the size increases, finally vanishing
when the angle subtended by the source is equal to the
smallest angle which an equivalent telescope can resolve,
multiplied by a constant factor depending on the shape and
distribution of light in the source and on the order of the
disappearance.
    (2) The vanishing of the fringes can ordinarily be deter
mined with such accuracy that single readings give results
 from fifty to one hundred times as accurate as can be obtained
with a telescope of equal aperture.
   * Better, the distance between the centres of the apertures in front of
these mirrors.

       Electrification of Effluvia from Chemical Reactions.        21
    (3) The principal applications of the methods herein
described are the measurement of the apparent magnitudes of
very small or very distant sources of light such as planetoids
and satellites (though larger bodies are not excluded) , and of
the angular distances between very close double stars.
    (4) On account of the narrowness of the interference-
fringes when a very minute body is under examination, the
method of obtaining these fringes (by a pair of adjustable
slits in front of the objective of a telescope) is open to objec
tion, from which the refractometer method is entirely free.
Further, this last modification makes it possible to extend the
effective aperture of the equivalent telescope without limit.
Thus, while it would be manifestly impracticable to construct
objectives much larger than those at present in use, there is
nothing to prevent increasing the distance between the two
mirrors of the refractometer to even ten times this size. If
among ihe nearer fixed stars there is any as large as our sun,
it would subtend an angle of about one hundredth of a second
of arc ; and the corresponding distance required to observe
this small angle is ten metres, a distance which, while utterly
out of question as regards the diameter of a telescope-objective,
is still perfectly feasible with a refractometer. There is,
however, no inherent improbability of stars presenting a
much larger angle than this; and the possibility of gaining
some positive knowledge of the real size of these distant
luminaries would more than repay the time, care, and
patience which it would be necessary to bestow on such a
work.
    In concluding, I wish to take this opportunity of expressing
my appreciation of the disinterested manner in which my
efforts have been so ably and zealously seconded by Mr. F.
L. O. Wadsworth, Fellow of Clark University.
   II. On the Elect rification of the Effluvia from Chemical or
            from Voltaic Reactions. By J. Brown *.
 1. T7ROM the series of very interesting experiments pub-

 Mr. J. Enright concludes that nascent hydrogen and other gases
 become positively electrified by contact with acids, and nega
 tively by contact with salts in solution. The line of experiment
 struck out by Mr. Enright will, I think, afford valuable aid
 in investigating electrochemical hypotheses ; but it would
    • Communicated by the Secretaries of the Electrolysis Committee of
 the British Association.

 22          Mr. J. Brown on the Electrification of the
 seem improbable that the mere contact of any two substances,
 without anything further, could perform the work necessary
 to produce a difference of potential of 42 volts, as found by
 Mr. Enright, or indeed any considerable fraction of a volt.
 The experimental evidence appears to be entirely against
 such a supposition, and I felt that some other explanation
 would probably be found to be the true one, more especially
 on considering Mr. Enright's observation that the passage of
 de-electrified gas through an acid did not electrify it, and his
 statement on page 63 that " whatever tended to electrically
 connect the charged liquid with the oppositely charged
 escaping gas, also tended to lessen the charges on both."
 If " contact " produced the charges, it is difficult to see how
further "contact" coidd lessen them.
    2. On carefully reading Mr. Enright's paper, and before
 making any experiments of my own, the following hypothesis
 suggested itself to me from consideration of the typical
 experiment, viz. zinc dissolving in hydrochloric acid, in which,
as Mr. Enright shows, the issuing gaseous matter is positively
electrified and the acid solution negatively electrified, until
finally, owing to the formation of a certain amount of zinc
chloride, a reversal of the electrifications of both gas and
liquid occurs.
    I use the word " gas " throughout the first part of this -paper
for convenience. As will appear further on, it is not certain
what the nature of the electrified matter is.

metals—iron, arsenic, &c.

    Suppose a b, fig. 1, to represent a portion of the surface of
such zinc, where a is pure zinc in contact with the foreign
metal at I), the whole being immersed in hydrochloric acid.
The solution of the metal takes place by the formation of
little local voltaic circuits, the chlorine combining with the
pure zinc at a, while the hydrogen is evolved at b, and the
local current flows with the arrows.
   There may of course be a larger number of HOI molecules
involved than in the circuit shown, in considering which it

        Effluvia from Chemical or from Voltaic Reactions.     23
seems best to adopt an electrolytic hypothesis similar to that
of Grotthus.
    A film of zinc chloride is now by the action interposed
between the zinc at a and the hydrochloric acid, as repre
sented in fig. 2, where (since zinc chloride forms at a only,
and not at h) we have a little double fluid cell, and the
current passes successively through zinc-chloride and hydro
chloric-acid solutions, instead of through the latter only as in
fig. 1.
    The only difference in the two actions seems to be, that in
 fig. 2 certain atoms of zinc take the place of hydrogen in
fig. 1, and are intermediate in the decomposition of the acid
by the metallic zinc ; but there seems at first sight no a priori
reason why this should cause the negative electrification of
the evolved gas.
    It may be pointed out, however, that if we think with
Faraday that, while the source of the energy of the current in
the cell is the potential chemical energy of the active ions,
 the production of that energy in the form of current instead
 of heat is closely related to the decomposition of the electro
 lyte, we may presume that the method of the decomposition
 will probably exercise considerable influence on the electric
 phenomena. It seemed not improbable that in the case under
 consideration the reversal of potential in tho gas was due to
 the change in the electrolytic action, as described above.
    4. I therefore thought it worth while to test the above
 hypothesis, and after repeating Mr. Enright's experiment
 with zinc dissolving in hydrochloric acid, and observing the
 very remarkable electrification and reversal of sign which he
 describes, I determined to make trial of a cell with the b part
 of the metallic surface in fig. 2 represented by platinum.
    A piece of platinum foil was attached to a small piece of
 sheet zinc by bending the zinc over it and clipping it tight,
 and the couple so arranged was placed in a beaker, the zinc
 lying flat on the bottom, the platinum standing upright.
 The zinc was covered with strong zinc-chloride solution, on
 which was carefully placed hydrochloric-acid solution of
 constant boiling-point, in contact with the platinum only.
 Gas was given off rather slowly from the platinum. The cell
 was now placed on an insulated metal plate connected with
 an electrometer, giving a deflexion of (JO divisions on each
 side of zero for one Daniell cell. The spot moved very
 slowly to 10, and showed the cell to be positive. I repeated
 the experiment, using acid diluted with an equal measure
 of water, and the spot went to 35, cell positive. In both cases

24          Mr. J. Brown on the Electrification of the
there was a slight haze of minute buhhles rising from the
zinc, which I thought might affect the result.
   5. To avoid this and to get a freer evolution of gas from
the platinum I platinized it, and clipped it to the end of a strip
of zinc 12 centimetres long by 1^ wide which was bent into a
flat spiral and amalgamated. Strong zinc-chloride solution
contained in a small beaker covered the zinc to about 3 mil
limetres above its upper edge, and on this strong hydrochloric
acid was carefully poured with a specially constructed pipette,
so as to avoid as much as possible any mixture of the two
liquids. There was a moderate evolution of gas from the
platinum, none visible from the zinc. On connecting the
cell as before with the electrometer, the spot went to 350 in
four minutes, indicating the cell to be positive, and, by im
plication, the issuing gas or vapour negative.
   6. There was not in any of the trials the slightest indication
of any positive electrification of the issuing gas, though it was
in two of them evolved in immediate contact with strong
hydrochloric acid.
   7. The same experiment was now repeated, using strong
zinc-sulphate solution surrounding the amalgamated zinc and
a 5-per-cent. solution of sulphuric acid in contact with the
platinum. Again the cell was positive from the first and the
spot went to 350 and off the scale in 9 minutes.
   8. When the zinc-platinum couple was immersed in acid
only, the sign of electrification of the cell varied according to
circumstances. It was positive (i. e. the issuing gas negative)
for both strong and dilute hydrochloric acid, except in two
cases with dilute acid when the zinc had been standing so as
to oxidize in the air, and evolved gas from itself. With
sulphuric acid the cell became quickly positive with a 5-per
cent, solution, but slowly negative with a 10-per-cent.
solution.
   Although the results in this form of experiment are not
inconsistent with the hypothesis of § 3, the conditions seem
not sufficiently determinate or distinct to warrant any certain
conclusion beyond the obvious fact that here also negatively
electrified gas can be evolved from acid solutions without any
admixture of salt.
   9. It was felt, however, that the employment of a zinc-
platinum couple as an expression of the conditions stated in
§ 3 was perhaps open to objection, and an endeavour was
made to get nearer the supposed conditions. A strip of zinc
was cleaned, bent into a spiral, and placed with its lower edge
in zinc-chloride solution on which was poured hydrochloric-
acid solution. This cell, however, became negative and

        Effluvia from Chemical or from Voltaic Reactions.           25
subsequently positive, as in Mr. Enright's experiment. The
conditions here also -were not sufficiently distinct.
    A strip of zinc 10 centim. long by about 1 wide had a
gutta-percha-covered copper wire soldered to it and the joint
protected by a covering of gutta-percha. It was then bent
into a spiral to lie on the bottom of the small beaker, the wire
rising vertically from it. It was cleaned but not amalgamated,
and was covered to a depth of 1^ centim. with strong zinc-
chloride solution. A bent copper sheet was then clamped
to the wire with its lower edge about 1 centim. above the
zinc chloride, and a solution of hydrochloric acid, con
taining 20 per cent, strong acid, was carefully poured in
until it rose 2 or 3 millim. on the copper.                  Gas was
sluggishly evolved from the copper, and the deflexion altered
about 3 divisions in 12 minutes, apparently indicating a
feeble negative electrification of the cell. In a second experi
ment, using a 5-per-cent. acid solution, the cell seemed feebly
positive, the index moving 10 divisions in half an hour.
But the results of both trials are so small as to be incon
siderable.
    10. The copper was now removed and replaced in a new
experiment by a piece of zinc cut from the same sheet
as that already in the cell, but not cleaned, in order that it
might be less active towards the liquid and represent b in
fig. 2.
     Its lower edge was about 3 centim. above the zinc-
chloride solution, and was immersed to a depth of 5 millim.
in a mixture of 1 part strong hydrochloric acid with 4 of
water. Gas was sluggishly evolved from the upper zinc and
the spot moved in 7^ minutes to 35, cell positive. It then
returned and the cell became negative, 110 divisions, wben
the experiment was stopped.
    11. The experiment was repeated with a 10-per-cent. acid
solution, with the interesting results given in tabular form
below, where the first column indicates the number of minutes
which elapsed after immersion of the upper zinc in the acid
 solution, and the second the potential of the cell, positive or
 negative, in scale-divisions as indicated by the electrometer.
 No gas was evolved from the lower zinc.

   Whether these conditions be considered a sufficiently near
approximation to those involved in the hypothesis of § 3 or
no, it is at all events improbable that the electrification of
the gas is due to any effect of " contact " in its nascent state
with either solids or liquids. Its electrification is rather
connected, in an as yet somewhat obscure but interesting way,
with the particular molecular arrangement in the voltaic
action by which it is evolved.
   12. Some experiments were now made in the hope of
deciding whether it be the gas itself that is electrified, or if
the charge be on something like spray carried up with the
gas. The effluvium experimented on was that from zinc
dissolving in hydrochloric acid, which, as is well known,
contains much foggy matter. This may be of the nature of
fine spray, but it comes up with the gas in the bubbles as
they rise through the liquid, and is probably formed at, or
nearly at, the same time and place as the gas itself. It is
distinct from the larger droplets thrown off from the free
surface of the liquid by the effervescence. There was some
doubt whether it should be called spray or fog. The latter
word has been decided on as best describing its appearance
without reference to its origin or actual constitution.
   13. A beaker was fitted with a paper hood so as to deflect
the issuing gas and direct it upon the jets of an insulated
water-dropping funnel, whose drops fell into a separate insu
lated vessel connected with the electrometer. Now, if the
charge were on spray-drops which would adhere to the funnel
and so communicate their positive charge to it, the drops
falling from it would carry down some of this charge to the
receiver and the electrometer would accordingly be affected.
The experiment was repeated, with modifications, a number of
times, but the results were not uniform, and were apparently
complicated by imperfect insulation of the funnel (which was
supported on a paraffin bar) permitting negative electricity

    14. Various other forms of experiment all indicated that the
effluvium was highly electrified but did not readily part with
its charge to bodies immersed in it. Of these the following is
typical. A large beaker was suspended by silk threads mouth
 downwards, so that it could be filled by gaseous displacement
 with the effluvium from zinc dissolving in a beaker of hydro
 chloric acid. An insulating stand, on Mascart's principle,
 was made by cementing with paraffin a glass rod upright on
 a flat-bottomed flask and drying the glass surfaces by strong
 sulphuric acid placed on the paraffin. On the top of the rod
 could be placed either a brass ball 4 centim. in diameter,
 an inverted glass flask about (5 centim. in diameter with
 moistened surface, or a smooth-skinned apple a little smaller
 than the flask. Each of these could be immersed in the freshly
 generated gas for a given time in order to receive any charge
 communicated by contact with the electrified matter, or else
 caused to take a charge inductively by a momentary earth
 connexion while so immersed. They were each then carried
 to the electrometer, and when put in contact with it gave the
 following deflexions :—

    In the last experiment five minutes were allowed to elapse
 after filling the large beaker, when the greater part of the
 fog had disappeared. In the others the amount of charge
 was doubtless influenced by the greater or less volume of
 electrified matter that happened to bo present.
     15. In order to test the electrification of the hvdrogen itself
  immediately after its generation and with the fog removed,
  drying by calcium chloride or other substances was suggested.
     A small flask was fitted with a chloride-of-calcium tube 1'3
  centim. wide by about 10 centim. long, filled with the chloride
  in the usual granulated form and kept in place by a cotton
  wool plug at each end. Zinc and hydrochloric acid were
  placed in the flask, and a water-dropping funnel connected
     ' The electrification of the proof-plane used by Mr. Euri^ht, ns
  described on p. 65 of his paper, was perhaps due to the same cause -
  imperfect insulation allowing leakage.

28           Mr. J. Brown on the Electrification of the
with the electrometer was employed to test the potential of
the gas, after it had passed through the drying-tube, which
was bent at the neck to an inclined position, and provided
with a paper bood to direct the gas upon the funnel-jets. In
the first trial no fog was observed to issue from the tube, and
the index, moved only about +10 or +12 divisions. In a
second trial some fog issued, and the deflexion was about
 + 20, afterwards falling to about +10 while the gas was still
forming but no fog visible.
   The experiment was repeated with the calcium chloride
replaced by particles, of about the same size, of fine clean
gravel. Very little fog appeared, and deflexion was +G0 to
 + 200.
   In a third modification of the experiment with the drying-
tube full of cotton-wool there was a slight issue of fog at first
with a deflexion of +50; afterwards less fog and no readable
deflexion.
   16. Tbe results of these experiments point towards the
conclusion that the electric charge is on the fog particles.
But it is to be remembered that if it be on the hydrogen
(supposing a gas can be electrified, which appears to be
doubtful *) the gas particles might themselves become de-
electrified by the processes used to remove the fog, or part
with their charges by contact with conductors, or, indeed, in
this way electrify the fog particles themselves.
   The question really is, which was originally electrified—
gas or fog ? And in considering this it is to be noted that the
fog here dealt with is, as explained in § 12, probably formed
at the source of evolution of the gas itself, and therefore its
electrification (if it be electrified) may be connected with the
kind of chemical or voltaic conditions under which the gas is
produced.
   17. As evidence bearing on this latter point, it was suggested
to me to try if any electrification would occur during the evo
lution of gas without chemical change from an effervescing
liquid such as soda-water. The contents of a freshly-opened
bottle were quickly poured into an insulated beaker connected
with the electrometer. The effervescence produced no sensible
deflexion. If, however, a little dilute alcohol was first placed
in the beaker there was a slight positive electrification.
   18. Among a number of miscellaneous experiments made on
the subject in general, it may be noted that barium carbonate
thrown into dilute sulphuric acid causes strong electrification,
while in dilute hydrochloric acid it produces a much weaker

effect; the liquid is negative in both cases. The human breath,
although containing visible fog as well as gas resulting from
chemical action in the lungs, does not appear to be sensibly
charged.
    19. From considerations connected with the first series of
experiments in this paper, as described in § 3 to § 11, it was
thought worth while to try whether there was any similar
electrification of a liquid from which gas was evolved by the
current from a separate battery as in the voltameter, and
 some experiments were made with this object.
    The battery and decomposing-cell were arranged on an
 insulating stand and connected to the electrometer. Some
 times the mixed gases were evolved from platinized platinum
 electrodes in dilute acid ; sometimes one or the other gas was
 absorbed by suitable arrangements. I was, however, unable
 to arrive at any general law governing either the sign of the
 electrification or its rate of increase. The latter varied from
 one division per minute to ten or even twenty times as much
 in the same time. In a majority of cases the evolution of the
 mixed gases electrified the cell negatively, and where either
 oxygen or hydrogen was evolved alone by the use of a double
 fluid arrangement the cell became positive ; but there were
 exceptions to both rules. The question as to the cause of this
 electrification is very interesting, and 1 hope it will not
  remain long unanswered.
     20. Mr. Enright's remark uear the end of his paper on the
  improbability of the so-called "air effect" having any con
  nexion with the theory of the galvanic cell (referring, I
  presume, to the supposed contact-action between metals and
  air or free oxygen), prompts me to point out that what I
  believe will be ultimately adopted as the true theory of Volta's
  fundamental contact-experiment, or at least the first hint of
  this theory, was given by De la Rive*; and considerations
  relative to its further elucidation and support will be found in
  papers by the present writer in vol. xli. of the Proceedings of
  the Royal Society, and in vols. vi. and vii. of this Journal.
     My best thanks are due to Professors Everett and Letts, of
  Queen's College, Belfast, for permission to use the apparatus
  of the College in these experiments, and for suggestions and
  advice during the investigation.
                       Summary of Conclusions.
      When gas is evolved in a chemical or voltaic reaction, the
   effluvium (i. e. this gas or something carried up with it) is

30            Lord Eayleigh on Huygens's Gearing in
usually, as shown by Mr. Enright, electrically charged (§ 4).
So far as these present experiments show, no electrification is
produced by simple effervescence unaccompanied by chemical
change (§ 17).
    The sign of the electrification is influenced by the kind of
chemical or voltaic action taking place, and is apparently not
due to any " contact effect" (§§ 4 to 11).
   When the effluvium is that given off from zinc dissolving
in hydrochloric acid (taken as a typical experiment), and
consists of hydrogen accompanied by foggy matter, it is not
decided whether the charge is given originally to the gas or
the fog particles, though the balance of evidence inclines
perhaps towards the latter view (§§ 12 to 1G). The fog in
question is formed apparently at, or nearly at, the same
time and place as the gas (§ 12) ; and the nature of its
charge (if any) is therefore possibly influenced by the voltaic
conditions there present.
   The gas, or effluvium, from the decomposition of a liquid
by a current from the poles of a separate batter}- immersed in
it (voltameter) appears also to be electrified (§ 19).

III. On Huygens's Gearing in illustration of the Induction
    of Electric Currents. By Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S., Pro
   fessor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Institution* .
AS a mechanical model of the electric machinery at work
         in the induction of currents Maxwell employed differ
ential gearing ; and an apparatus on this principle, designed
by him, is in use at the Cavendish Laboratory. Wishing to
show something similar in a recent course of lectures, and not
 having differential gearing at my disposal, I designed more
 than one combination of pulleys, the action of which should
 be analogous to that of electric currents. These eventually
 resolved themselves into Huygens's gearing, invented, I
 believe, in connexion with the winding of clocks. As this
 apparatus is easier to understand than differential gearing,
 and the parts of which it is composed are more likely to be
 useful for general purposes in a laboratory, I have thought
 that it might be worth while to give a description, accom
 panied by an explanation of the mode of action.
     Two similar pulleys, A, B, turn upon a piece of round steel
 fixed horizontally f. Over these is hung an endless cord, and

the two bights carry similar pendent pulleys,           A
C, D, from which again hang weights, E, F. .»
The weight of the cord being negligible, the
system is devoid of potential energy ; that
is, it will balance, whatever may be the ver
tical distance between C and D.
    Since either pulley A, B may turn inde
pendently of the other, the system is capable
of two independent motions. If A, B turn
in the same direction and with the same
velocity, one of the pendent pulleys C, D                   E
rises, and the other falls. If, on the other
hand, the motions of A, B are equal and op
posite, the axes of the pendent pulleys and
the attached weights remain at rest.
     In the electrical analogy the rotator}'
velocity of A corresponds to a current in a
primary circuit, that of B to a current in a
secondary. If when all is at rest the rota-               v^L/
tion of A be suddenly started, by force applied
at the handle or otherwise, the inertia of the
masses, E, F, opposes their sudden move
ment, and the consequence is that the pulley B turns hack-
wards, i. e. in the opposite direction to the rotation imposed
upon A. This is the current induced in a secondary circuit
when an electromotive force begins to act in the primary.
In like manner, if A havin been tor some time in uniform
movement suddenly stops            enters into motion in the direc
tion of the former movement of A. This is the secondary
current on the break of the current in the primary circuit.
    It must be borne in mind that in the absence of friction
there is nothing to correspond with electrical resistance, so
that the conductors must be looked upon as perfect. The
frictions which actually enter do not follow the same laws as
electrical resistances, and only very imperfectly represent
them. However, the frictions which oppose the rotations of
 A and B have a general effect of the right sort ; but the
 rotations of C and D, corresponding to dielectric machinery,
 should be as free as possible.
    The effect of a condenser, to which the terminals of one of
 the circuits is joined, would be represented by a spiral spring
 (as in a watch) attached to the corresponding pulley, the
  stiffness of the spring being inversely as the capacity of the
 condenser. The absence of the spring, or (which comes to
 the same thing) the indefinite decrease of its stiffness, corre
  sponds to infinite electrical capacity, or to a simply closed
 circuit.

32               Induction of Electric Currents.
    The equations which express the mechanical properties of
the system are readily found, and are precisely the same as
those applicable in the electrical problem. Since the potential
energy vanishes, everything turns upon the expression for the
kinetic energy. If x and y denote the circumferential velo
cities in the same direction of the pulleys A, B where the
cord is in contact with them, %(x+y) is the vertical velocity
of the pendent pulleys. Also \{x-y) is the circumferential
linear velocity of C, D, due to rotation, at the place wThere the
cord engages. If the diameter be here 2a, the angular velocity
is(x-y)/2a. Thus, if M be the total mass of each pendent
pulley and attachment, M&2 the moment of inertia of the revol
ving parts, the whole kinetic energy corresponding to each is
For the energy of the whole system we should have the
double of this, and, if it were necessary to include them, terms
proportional to x2 and y2 to represent the energy of the fixed
pulleys. The reaction between the pulleys A, B depends upon
the presence of a term xy in the expression of the energy.
 We see that this would disappear if h? = a> ; as would happen
 if the whole mass of the pendent pulleys and attachments
were concentrated in the circles where the cord runs. The
 case discussed above, as analogous to electric currents, occurs
 when A?<a2, a condition that will be satisfied, even without
 non-rotating attachments, if the cord run near the circum
 ference of the rotating pulleys. The opposite state of things,
 in which P>a2, would be realized by carrying out masses
 beyond the groove, and thus increasing the rotatory in com
parison with the translatory inertia. In this case the mutual
action between A and B is reversed. If when all is at rest
A be suddenly started, B moves forward in the same direction.
 Otherwise C and D would have to rotate, and this in their
character of fly-wheels they oppose.
    Generally, if L, N be the coefficients of self-induction, and
 M mutual induction, we have (constant factors being omitted)
                         L = N = a2 + &2,
                             M = a2-F.
 In order to imitate the case of two circuits coiled together in
 close proximity throughout, we must have in the mechanical
 model F = 0 ; that is, the rotatory inertia of the pendent pulleys
 must be negligible in comparison with the translatory inertia.
 Also the energy of the fixed pulleys, not included in the above
 expressions, must be negligible. If these conditions be
 satisfied, a sudden rotation imposed upon A generates an
 equal and opposite motion in B.

IV. On Relations between the Lines of various Spectra, with
   Special Reference to those of Cadmium and Zinc, and a
   Redetermination of their Wave-lengths. By Joseph
   Sweetman Ames, Assistant in Physics, Johns Hopkins
    University.*
IN this paper I shall give a sketch, as complete as possible,
      of the many theories which have been advanced concern
ing spectral relations, with a short statement as to their agree
ment with the most recent investigations ; and then I wish to
call attention to a few new relations suggested by my own
studies.
                Relations between Different Spectra.
   Alex. Mitscherlich f was the first, apparently, to seek
numerical relations between the spectra of different substances.
Having proved, independently of Roscoe, that the spectra of
compounds were different from those of the elements them
selves, he examined and compared the spectra of the haloid
salts of barium, calcium, and strontium. He selected certain
lines in each as most prominent, and found in the case of the
salts of barium that the distance apart of these lines was
directly proportional to the atomic weight of the salts them
selves, wnile in the calcium and strontium salts the proportion
ality was an inverse one. He could find no relations in the
spectra of the elements. Those found in the compounds were
chance ones; for, using a prism spectroscope, his wave-lengths
are arbitrary. A few years later, Mascartj called attention
to the series of doublets in the spectrum of sodium and to one
of triplets in the spectrum of magnesium. He thought there
was some connexion between the relative distances of the lines
in these similar groups, which could not be attributed to
chance, and which might point to some " harmonic" relations.
   In the same year M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran § announced, as
the result of his study of the flame-spectra of the alkalies and
the alkaline earths, a simple law. He selected certain lines
in each spectrum, which he called " homologous," as they
appear (with certain changes) in the spectra of homologous
substances, such as barium, calcium, and strontium. These
lines do not, however, have the same wave-length in the
different spectra; and his law was that the heavier the mole-

34            Mr. J. S. Ames on Relations between
cule of the element, the more were these lines shifted towards
 the red end of the spectrum. The main objection to all this is
 that until recently the selection of homologous lines has been a
purely personal matter : any observer has had the privilege of
 calling " homologous " any lines he saw fit ; and even now,
 as I shall show, it is mainly in the ultra-violet part of the
 spectrum that homologous lines and series can bo definitely
 determined. To verify bis law, M. de Boisbaudran takes the
 average of wave-lengths lying often far apart. This process
 can be justified only when each line separately obeys the law.
 But far more important than this relation is one which M. de
 Boisbaudran deduced some years later *. He states it as
follows :—
   " In the natural families (of elements), the variation in the
increment of atomic weights is proportional to the variation
in the increment of the wave-lengths of homologous rays (or
groups of rays) in the ' third harmonic ' of the spectra."
   I cannot better explain the meaning of his terms than by
giving in detail the application of the law to the determination
of the atomic weight of germanium f.
   Aluminium, gallium, and indium belong to the same "natural
family;" and their atomic weights and spectra are known, so
the ratio of the " variations in the increments " can be deter
mined once for all. The average of the wave-lengths of a
prominent pair of aluminium lines is, according to him, 3952;
and homologous pairs in the spectra of gallium and indium
give similarly 4101 and 4306. He takes as the atomic
weights of the three metals 27'5, (>9'9, and 113'5 respectively.
   Hence we have:—

must be a constant for all the natural families.
    The spectrum of germanium is partially known ; and it can
be shown chemically that it belongs to the same family as
silicon and tin. So, treating its atomic weight as an unknown
quantity, and assuming certain values for the wave-lengths
and atomic weights of silicon and tin, we have :—

    So M. de Boisbaudran succeeds in getting identically the
same value for the atomic weight as Winckler afterwards
found by chemical means. This is surely a wonderful con
firmation of the law, if the lines assumed to be homologous are
so in reality. It is true that the atomic weights of the ele
ments are not known so accurately as to justify M. de Bois
baudran in attributing such exactness to his deductions ; and
so the method ought not to be applied to the determination of
atomic weights. But, if the law is correct, it may well serve
to identify nomologous lines. Let us apply it to the case of
magnesium, zinc, and cadmium. The ratio of the "varia
tions," which is a constant for all natural families, is not
known more accurately than 13-0 ; but this will do very well
 for our purposes. The variation in the increment of the
                                  D 2

36            Mr. J. S. Ames on Relations between
atomic weights of magnesium, zinc, and cadmium is -146.
 Hence the variation in the increment of the wave-lengths is
 -146 x 13 = r898. I have recently studied the spectra of zinc
 and cadmium with much care ; and, as will be shown later,
 each line in the one spectrum has an homologous one in the
 other. Two of these lines have the wave-lengths 2800-9 and
 2980-8 respectively. This law of M. de Boisbaudran should
 enable us to find the corresponding line in the magnesium
spectrum. (Ja1ling it x, the variation in the increment is
                             *-2621-0
                             2800-9-a;'
 But this must equal 1-898. Hence ^ = 2738-8. In reality
there is a line 2736-9 ; but its physical properties do not
correspond to those of the two zinc and cadmium lines. Two
other lines of zinc and cadmium, which are undoubtedly homo-
logous,are 3345-land 3610-6; and the hypothetical magnesium
line corresponding to these would have the wave-length
3253-6. There is, however, no line in this neighbourhood
which can possibly be homologous with the zinc and cadmium
lines. Therefore, while this law may apply roughly to certain
lines, it surely cannot be considered general.
   After H. de Boisbaudran several investigators, including
Ditte and Troost and Hauteville*, endeavoured to trace rela
tions between atomic weights and " displacement " of the
spectra. But, as remarked above, it was impossible at this
time to make any accurate statements as to homologous lines
or their displacement. This fact is clearly shown by the dis
agreement of observers of the same spectra in regard to homo
logous lines. Cimicianf examined the spectra of a great
many substances in search of lines, and tried by a study of
them to prove the compound nature of the elements. The
dispersion of his instrument was, however, so feeble that he
could not properly decide upon similarities in different spectra.
He opposes M. de Boisbaudran's law of the shifting of the
spectra, and says that instead of increasing with the atomic
weight the wave-lengths increase with the intensity of the
" chemical kinetic energy." (See Mohr, Meek. Th. der Chem.
Aflinitat, Wien, 1867.) The first really scientific work on
the relations between the lines of spectra was that of Hartley %.
In studying the spark-spectra of the elements, his attention
was attracted to the many points of resemblance between the
spectra of chemically similar elements, notably magnesium,

zinc, and cadmium. But it is hardly safe to draw inferences
from spark-spectra ; for, although they are undoubtedly charac
teristic, yet the state of affairs in the spark-discharge is so
unnatural, if I may use the term, that similar molecules could
not be expected to act alike. The study of the arc-spectra of
the elements leads to many modifications and additions, as will
be shown later. Prof. Hartley called attention also to a most
remarkable relation connecting the lines in the series of
triplets in the spectra of magnesium, zinc, and cadmium. He
corrected the wave-lengths for atmospheric refraction, and
then calculated their reciprocals ; that is, he deduced quantities
proportional to the frequencies of the waves. He then found
 that the differences of tlieso frequencies for each triplet in any
 one series is a constant quantity. This law holds also for
 series of doublets. I will return to this point when the
 spectra of cadmium and zinc are discussed. That there are
 mathematical expressions connecting the many series of rays
 in the spectra of the elements no one can doubt. Their regu
 larity and analogy are evidently not accidental. But there
 are two ways of arriving at such a mathematical formula :
 one is to deduce it from theoretical considerations and to test
 it by experiment ; the other is to give up all preconceived
 ideas and simply to " guess," as Kepler did. Cornu * advises
 the latter method. He thinks that relations are to be found,
 if at all, between the lines which are "reversed." It is
 true that most of the lines in these series which obviously
 obey some common law are reversed ; but different observers
 are continually finding different reversals. The conditions
 must be specified. While studying, then, the reversed lines
 of aluminium and thallium, Cornu noticed the resemblance
 between the series which they formed and the one of hydrogen
 lines. He thought he could trace a linear relation between
 them. That is, for all the ultra-violet reversed lines of
 aluminium (and of thallium) the following formula held :—
                             \ = a + b \j,
 where \i is the wave-length of one of the lines in the hydrogen
 series, beginning with wave-length 4340. That this for
 mula is not true will be shown later when the wave-lengths
 of the aluminium lines are given.
    In the spectra of zinc and cadmium some new points of
 resemblance were noted by Mr. Bell f quite recently ; but he
 worked with the spark-spectra, and so was at a disadvantage.

38               Mr. J. S. Ames on Relations between
the recent attempt by Prof. Anton Griinwald * of Prague to
deduce a mathematical theory of spectra and spectral relations.
A synopsis of his theory and the objections to it have been
given by myself f, and later by Kayserf. In his last paper
Prof. Griinwald claims to find coincidences between lines in
the spectra of antimony, tellurium, and copper, and then to
deduce the proof of a new element. In fact, there is not a
single coincidence between these three spectra. It is evident
from his writings that Prof. Griinwald has never had the
benefit of using and working with a spectroscope.
                  Harmonic and Combinational Lines.
     There has been an attempt to solve the question of the
origin of lines in spectra, which is quite different from the
theories and relations already discussed. Since the motion
imparted to the aether and ktiown to us as light is a periodic
one, it seems but natural to apply Fourier's series and to see
if the presence of the various harmonics of the fundamental
can be found. The first to find such simple relations was
M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran §. He thought that line for line
the two visible bands of nitrogen were related to each other
in the ratio 3 : 4. Later and more accurate measurements
have shown this relation to be inaccurate. Soon after Prof.
 G. Johnstone Stoney // pointed out some harmonic relations in
the spectrum of hydrogen. At the same time he studied the
absorption spectrum of OrO2Clz with a view to testing his
theory ; but the result was not satisfactory. At the best all
the harmonics are never present ; all the lines are not ac
counted for ; and several fundamentals have often to be
supposed. The ultra-violet lines of magnesium and cadmium
were examined by Soretlf in the search for harmonic ratios ;
but his coincidences are very rough.
    Liveing and Dewar** also engaged in the quest for these
harmonic relations in the spectra of lithium, sodium, and
potassium, but with indifferent success. A few such relations
can be found in every spectrum ; but is this number greater
than that which a chance-distribution would give? This
question occurred to Schuster, while he was working on the
spectrum of iron. He proposed the following problem :—

    " Given n quantities distributed arbitrarily between 1 and
 A, what is the probable number of quotients of two of these n
 quantities, which will be equal to a + 8, where 8 is small ? "
    He finds* the probable number to be
                         n(n-l)(AV-l)8
 where A<~.        Applying this result to the spectrum of iron
 he finds, on the whole, fewer harmonics actually present than
 the formula demands. His conclusion, however, is that the
 law of distribution, although a complicated one, may in special
 cases resolve itself into the harmonic one. Since this investi
 gation of Schuster's, the search for harmonic ratios has nearly
 ceased ; but, giving a broadened meaning to the word, Liveing
 and Dewar f have called attention to certain " harmonic '
 relations in spectra. These are, the repetition of similar
 groups, a certain sequence in distance, and a law of physical
 quality such as intensity and clearness.
   A more recent attempt to apply dynamical reasoning and
 formulae to the spectra of the elements has been made by
 M. V. A. Julius I. On dynamical grounds there should be,
 he thinks, present in spectra lines whose frequencies are the
 sums or differences of the frequencies of other lines (the com
binational tones of Helmholtz). So he deduces the probable
number of coincidences, within limits +8, if the differences
are taken between each two of n quantities lying at random
between P and Q. He then actually calculates the differences
in the case of eight spectra, and finds more coincidences than
his formula says mere chance would give him. This theory
of combinational rays would account also for the regularity of
 doublets and triplets, which was first noticed by Hartley, but
which M. Julius apparently rediscovered. Until the wave
lengths of the lines in the various spectra are known much
more accurately than they are at present, such work as this is
almost thrown away. The objective existence of combina
tional tones is now generally acknowledged, however ; and we
may certainly expect corresponding phenomena in light-waves.
This idea is not a new one ; but M. Julius is the first to
elaborate it. In doing so, however, he neglects too much, I
think, the physical properties of the lines. We would expect
the strongest lines, if any, to be the ones to produce combina-

40              Mr. J. S. Ames on Relations between
tional lines; but M. Julius gives equal importance to each
line, faint or strong, hazy or sharp. The spectrum of calcium
has some very strong lines in the red ; and, as their wave
lengths have recently been carefully determined by Prof.
Rowland, I thought I would test this theory by means of
them. My search was in vain : not a combinational line
could I find.
                          Distribution of Lines.
     For many years spectroscopists have sought to reduce the
distribution of lines in any one spectrum to a mathematical
formula, but without much success. There are, however, one
or two brilliant exceptions.
    In 1885 J. J. Balmer* gave a formula for the lines in the
hydrogen spectrum, which is most simple and which, as will
be seen later, is remarkably accurate. His formula is
                                      ~a 4a~f'
                             ^- = \) wr-
where \0 is a constant and m takes in succession the values
3, 4, 5 ... . More will be said of this formula when the hy
drogen spectrum itself is discussed.
    A formula was also advanced by Nordenskiold f, the Arctic
explorer ; but it is quite inaccurate.
    These two formula? were found by trial ; but it is interest
ing to note that one similar to Balmer's has been deduced
theoretically. A general theory of radiation has been devised
by Herr Kovesligethy f, and in the course of this he arrives at
the following wave-length formula :—
where /t0 is the value of /x. for the temperature of dissociation,
fi being a function of the temperature and constitution of the
body ; and R is a function containing a parameter which
must be determined for each substance. This formula is most
suggestive ; and the appearance of the elaborate treatise on
the general theory, which is promised us, is eagerly expected.
    In their first contribution to the " Spectra of the Ele
ments " § Kayser and Runge announce that they have found
a general law for all spectra, which includes Balmer's as a
special case. The uncertainty of the measurements of the

wave-lengths of the elements is so great, though, that they
have been unable to test it sufficiently. In a more recent
paper* they give a formula for one of the cyanogen bands ;
but this is not, I judge, their general formula, nor even a
special case of it.
   The various bands found in the spectra of carbon and its
compounds, and of many other substances also, seem at sight
to be especially suitable for mathematical investigation ; and
many of them have been studied most carefully.
   The first to hit upon an approximate law was Prof. A. S.
Herschel t of Newcastle-on-Tyne. On seeing Piazzi Smyth's
map of the green band of CO, which was plotted in wave-
numbers or frequencies, he at once noticed that the differences
of the lines were in arithmetical progression. This was in
November 1883. He announced his intention of studying
other bands ; but I can find no record of his having done so.
Prof. Rowland, independently, detected a similar law as soon
as he began his work on the solar spectrum, which was in
1885. He investigated the A, B, and a. bands first, and after
wards all the carbon bands. He found that the law was not
so exact as the accuracy of his measurements demanded, and
so never published his work.
   Later on, M. H. Deslandres, working in Oornu's laboratory,
came upon the same approximate 1aw. Oornuf had noted
that the reciprocals of the wave-lengths of the homologous
lines in the three bands A, B, and a were nearly in arithmeti
cal progression ; and in his monograph on these telluric bands
(Paris 1886) he says that the law of distribution of the doub
lets is sensibly the same in all three. This law, stated
analytically, is
                           AX_ AX' _ AX"
                            \ ~ \' " X" '
where AX, AX', AX" are the distances from the homologous
lines to the "isolated" ones; and X, X', X" are the averages
of the rays whose intervals are AX, AX', A". This law is
only the roughest approximation. Cornu does not seem to
have thought of testing the lines of each group separatelv.
But in 1886 Deslandres § published his investigation of the
nitrogen bands ; and stated that for all of them, and in fact
for all bands so far examined, the following law is true :—
" In general, the rays composing a band can be divided into

42            Mr. J. S. Ames on Relations between
several overlapping identical series ; and in each series the
intervals from one ray to the next (measured in wave-
numbers) form approximately an arithmetical progression."
As Deslandres remarks, for most bands it is immaterial which
we use, \, - , or ^ ; but - seems to apply most generally. In
             \     \        A,
a later paper Deslandres says that the bands themselves form
groups, and that the same law governs the distribution of bands
as governs the lines in any one band. Thus for any ray,

         C = Dn2 + En + F,             n   = 0, 1, . . .
   .-.    \ = Am3 + Bm + Dn2 + En + F.
   Deslandres gives reasons for believing the general formula
is of the form :—
                 1 =/(n8,/) m" + Bn* + tf> {p*).
This he compares with that of a vibrating rectangular prism,
which likewise is a function of three positive parameters.
These laws of Deslandres apply fairly well to all banded spec
tra ; but they are only approximations. I had made measure
ments of many of the bands of carbon and cyanogen to test
their accuracy, but have been anticipated in their publication
by Kayser and Bunge*. They find, as I had done, that these
laws fail in some cases. They study with particular care the
most regular of the cyanogen bands, the one at wave-length
3883-5, and find that the empirical formula
                       i = a + be°* sin (dn2),
where a, b, c, d are constants and n=0, 1, 2,... applies
reasonably well. But in testing this formula they make no
correction for atmospheric refraction, which would, I think,
make some difference. They come to the conclusion that no
exact formula, which is reasonably simple, can be found by
trial. If one is ever to be known it must be deduced
theoretically.
                       Some New Relations.
   The two elements between whose spectra there is the most
striking resemblance are, as is well known, zinc and cadmium.

  Their great similarity has often been noted ; but, as the spark-
  spectra have nearly always been studied, the exact correspon
  dence between them has so far escaped notice. It is to be
  regretted, too, that in general so little attention has been
  paid to the physical properties of the lines, when homologous
  groups or series were selected. It is only, I think, by means
  of the physical similarities that correct inferences can be
  made. For these two reasons a great many of the relations
  given by Prof. Hartley are inaccurate. All of my measure
  ments and descriptions of the zinc and cadmium spectra are
  taken from the photographs of the arc-spectra recently made
  by Prof. Rowland. My measurements are only provisional
  and do not possess a greater accuracy than 0-l of a unit (i. e.
  0'01fifi). This is sufficient for present purposes, and Prof.
. Rowland, who has nearly completed a systematic study of the
  spectra of the elements, will soon publish his tables of wave
  lengths, which will be accurate to 0-01 of a unit. There will
  be noticed a discrepancy between my wave-lengths of cadmium
  and those given by Mr. Bell* The reason for this was dis
  covered by Mr. Bell and myself, when we were working on
  the spark-spectrum of cadmium two years ago. A mistake of
  one unit in one of Mr. Bell's micrometer-readings vitiated one
  of the standard wave-lengths (which were used for the de
  termination of the others). The scale of my wave-lengths is
  that of Rowland's map, as its superiority is now universally
  acknowledged. The wave-lengths are afterwards corrected for
  atmospheric refraction by means of interpolations in Ketteler's t
  determinations. These corrections become very uncertain
  in the extreme ultra-violet ; but no better values are known.

   This last line is a broad reversal ; and 2980-8 is probably
triple. As usual, " r " means reversed ; and " d " double.
   This list of lines does not pretend to include all ; for a
very few faint ones could not be measured as accurately as I
wished.
   The two spectra, as will be noticed, consist mainly of
groups of three lines ; these triplets overlap in the cadmium
spectrum, but owing to the physical similarity of the lines
forming any one triplet it was a matter of perfect ease to
select them. Thus it is evident that line for line, group by
group, the two spectra correspond. The only possible excep
tion is in group       In cadmium the first two lines are plainly
double, while in zinc they are not resolved. The lines are
broad and nebulous ; and the zinc lines will, I think, be proved
double. The more closely the two spectra are examined the
more perfect does their agreement appear.
   If we observe either spectrum, it is at once evident that
groups /3, 8, $, rj, 6 form a series. Taking the differences
of the wave-numbers of the last lines in each of these triplets,
we have for zinc :—
                   581-0, 263-1, 141-4, 84-5;
for cadmium :—
                   586-7, 263-7, 140-8, 84-3.
The correspondence is again evident. These series resemble
greatly the series of hydrogen lines ; and, as so many spectra
nave these series, it may be well to describe them in detail.
These series always run in the same direction ; that is, the
relative distances of the lines grow smaller as the wave
lengths become smaller. The lines forming the series are
always nebulous ; they are strong towards the red end, but
rapidly become faint and hazy as we go down the series.
The spectrum of the substance has, in general, other lines than
those forming the series : the hitter are the ones that always
appear in the solar spectrum, the former ones may not. Their
regularity is perfect. Returning to the zinc and cadmium
spectra, and taking differences in wave-numbers between the
first and second and the second and third lines of each triplet
in the two spectra, excepting /3 and 8, we have :—
   For zinc,
           39-0 38-8 39-0 38'9             39'2 38-7
           19-0 19-0 18-8 18-8 18-9               19-3
   For cadmium,
          117-1 117-1 117-0 116-5 116-6 117-0
           54-2 54-1 54-3 54-0 54-1 53-8

4t>             Mr. J. S. Ames on Relations between
 Groups /3 and 8 are excluded because, containing doublets and
 triplets, it is impossible to determine just what wave-number
 should be used.
    It is difficult to say whether or not the agreement in the
above figures would be better if the wave-numbers were
known more accurately; but I am inclined to think that
natural constants for the two metals are indicated by them.
    It will be noticed that nearly all the homologous groups are
in the ultra-violet. This seems to be true of all spectra. It
is only, apparently, when the wave-numbers, or frequencies,
are sufficiently large, that the similar modes of vibrations of
the molecules become evident.
    The resemblance of the spectrum of magnesium to those of
zinc and cadmium is much less marked than the one just
noted. In fact, I think nearly all the points of similarity
given by Prof. Hartley are wrong. Magnesium has, it is
true, ten groups of triplets ; but their physical properties bear
no apparent relation to those of the zinc and cadmium triplets.
The beautiful series of five lines at wave-length 2779-9 in the
magnesium spectrum surely has no companions in the zinc
and cadmium spectra. There is, however, one striking feature
common to all three. This is the presence of one broad re
versed line. In magnesium it is at wave-length 2852-2 ; in
zinc, at wave-length 2138-3 ; in cadmium, at wave-length
2288-1. Liveing and Dewar have observed the line at wave
length 2852-2 in the arc-, spark-, and flame-spectra of mag
nesium ; so it is evidentl}' in some sense a fundamental line.
The differences of the wave-numbers in each magnesium
triplet are also nearly constant, being close to 4 and 2.
    The spectra of calcium, strontium, barium, and mercury
also contain triplets ; but their number is small in comparison
with that of the lines not so included.
    It is hardly necessary to refer to the series of pairs in the
spectra of sodium, copper, and silver ; but it may be well to
note that each of these spectra has in the ultra-violet one
prominent pair, always occurring as impurity lines, very " per
sistent," and coinciding with the solar spectrum. The sodium
pair has the wave-length 3303-0 and 3302-4 ; that of copper,
3274-0 r. and 3247-7 r.; that of silver, 3282-9 r. and 3280-7 r.
The presence of silver in the sun is at last proved. From a
study of their physical properties 1 think the series of sodium
pairs is in reality made up of two overlapping series, thus
bearing a resemblance to the two series of potassium pairs.
    The spectrum of lithium is similar to that of hydrogen. It
has a series similar to the hydrogen one and obeying almost
identically the same law, beginning at wave-length 3232-8.

In order to test Cornu's theory of the connexion between
aluminium and hydrogen, I have measured with some care
the wave-lengths of the aluminium pairs as photographed by
Prof. Rowland. The wave-lengths of the hydrogen lines
were determined by myself. Cornu's theory, stated con
cisely, is that for aluminium
                             \ = a + b \,
where X, is the wave-length of a hydrogen line. According
to Cornu the following lines correspond :—
                  Al.                          H.
                 2373-2                     4340-I56
                 2269-2                     4101-85
                 2210-15                    3970-25
                 2174-0                     3889-15
                 2150-4                     3835-6
 If his theory is true, the ratios of the differences of each two
 consecutive lines should be the same for each series. Taking
 the first three lines of each, we find the ratio 1'76 for
 aluminium and 1-81 for hydrogen. The other ratios agreo
 better ; but still the difference is too great.
    As noted above in the historical sketch, the law that the
 second differences of the wave-numbers of the lines forming a
 band is constant, is approximately true. No general law more
 exact than this can, I think, be deduced with our present
 knowledge. But there seems to be some connexion between
 the lines forming a band and those in a series like the
 hydrogen ones : the former may be regarded as forming the
 " head " of this latter series. There is this true, however :
 the bands can run in either direction, towards the red or
 towards the ultra-violet ; while the series always turn one
 way. But, in spite of this, it may not be without use to
 show that the bands and the series are connected mathe
 matically.
    Banner's law for the distribution of the hydrogen lines,
 stated in a slightly more general form, is :—
               i = a(1+H^)' W = 0'
 If we substitute in this
                    m = M — n, n — 0, 1, 2 . . .,
  where M is a constant many times as great as n, we have
                     ^ = A + Bn + Cn2 + &c,
                     At

where the coefficients rapidly grow smaller. This formula is»
of course, the analytical statement that for lines near the
head of a band the second differences of the wave-numbers are
constant. So, if these series and bands represent in any
degree the fundamental or original vibrations of the " mole
cule," as I think probable, it is of interest to note that a
similar law applies to both. The exact law of distribution
which must come from theoretical considerations will there
fore include this as a special case.
   Addendum.—Since writing the above the Philosophical
Magazine for April (1890) has reached me, and it contains
an article by Dr. Rydberg, of the University of Lund, " On
the Structure of the Line-Spectra of the Chemical Elements,"
which demands notice. In this paper, which is only pre
liminary, Dr. Rydberg calls special attention to the many
series in the spectra of the elements, divides them into various
classes, gives formulae for their distribution, and states that
the wave-lengths are periodic functions of the atomic weights.
This last relation, which is barely indicated in the article,
seems to be nothing but the one of M. de Boisbaudran, which
has already been discussed*. The law of distribution is
nothing but Buhner's slightly generalized. The valuable part
of the paper lies in the division of the lines of the spectra into
different series and in showing the relations between them.
He does not state how he gets his wave-lengths ; but they
scom to be a combination of Hartley's and Liveing and
Dewar's. So he has confused the spark- and arc-spectra.
V. On some Gaseous Spectra :—Hydrogen, Nitrogen. By
   Joseph Swbetman Ames, Assistant in Physics, Johns
   Hopkins University^ .
MY investigations on the spectra of gases were begun at
       the suggestion of Professor Rowland, and were designed
primarily to ascertain the exact wave-lengths of the line-
spectrum of hydrogen. Incidentally some other spectra have
also been studied.
                     Method and Apparatus.
   A concave grating, mounted in the well-known Rowland
manner, was used. It was ruled especially for this research,
was 6 inches (15-2 centim.) wide with 20,000 lines to the
inch, and had a radius of curvature of 13-5 feet (4-11 metres).
   The experiments were conducted according to the method

 designed by Prof. Rowland for concave gratings, and de
 scribed in my paper in the Johns Hopkins University
 Circular 73, 1889 *.        Photographs were taken of the
 gaseous and solar spectra on the same plate. Some of the
 hydrogen plates were measured on a dividing-engine ; but in
 most cases the wave-lengths were simply read off from the
coincidences between the gaseous lines and certain places in
the solar spectrum, the wave-lengths of which were taken
from Rowland's map. The error in any wave-length is, I
think, not more than 0-05 of a unit (i. e. 0-005/t/*), or about
one part in one hundred thousand. To guard against any
displacement of the gaseous spectra, the positions of certain
mercury-lines, which were present on all the plates, were
carefully noticed and measured. The complete arc-spectrum
of mercury has recently been photographed by Prof. Row
land ; and so the lines are accurately located on the map.
No plate was used in the present work in which these lines
were not exactly in their proper places. Their wave-lengths
are:—

   Several forms of spectrum-tubes were tried, but that finally
adopted was the one shown in the cut (p. 50). As is apparent,
it was used " end on." It consists essentially of two tubes
containing thin cylinders of aluminium and connected by a
finer tube. This tube was in one case circular, having a bore
of about I millim., and in another it was elliptical. This latter
form is preferable, because it keeps the light in the tube
better, and because it produces an elongated image on the
slit. The use of the aluminium cylinders was suggested by
Prof. Rowland. They were in connexion with an induction-
coil by means of platinum wires which entered each end-tube,
and which were bent so as to make good contact. The cylin
ders make, as it were, a lining for the two end-tubes ; and
since, when the vacuum is high, the discharge takes place
from the whole surface of the electrode, the brilliancy of the
light in the capillary tube is much greater than in the ordi
nary form of apparatus. A quartz plate was fastened to the

end of the spectrum-tube by a cement of sodium silicate
(liquid glass). The light from the tube was focused on the
 slit by a quartz lens, having an aperture of 1 inch (2-54 cen-
 tim.) and a focal length of 6 inches (15-2 centim.). The air-
 pump used was an ordinary Sprengel ; and the arrangement
 for admitting gases into the tube was the one recommended
 by Cornu*. In this there is, in connexion with the spectrum-
 tube, a barometer-tube whose lower end is joined to a movable
 cup by a rubber tube. When the spectrum-tube is exhausted,
 the mercury which is poured into the movable cup rises in the
 barometer-tube and forms a trap. A U-shaped tube in which
 water can be electrolysed is in communication with this
 barometer-tube near the bottom. So, if the cup is lowered,
 a bubble of gas or air will be forced into the spectrum-tube
 by the atmospheric pressure. Drying-tubes of caustic potash
 were introduced ; and on each side of the spectrum-tube
 several inches of sulphur, held between plugs of glass-wool,

were placed so as to stop the mercury-vapour. In my entire
apparatus there were only three joints where the glass tubes
were not fused together. In each of these the following plan
was adopted to render it air-tight. One tube was sligntly
coned out, the other inserted for about an inch, and the entire
joint was filled and covered with a preparation of Venice-
turpentine and beeswax, known in the laboratory as " uni
versal." This " universal " is easy to mould when slightly
warmed, is quite tough, and sticks closely to glass which has
been thoroughly heated. These joints proved to be absolutely
air-tight, and no gases of any kind were given off after a few
days' use. In some cases, for greater security, I put " uni
versal " over the sodium-silicate joint between the spectrum-
tube and the quartz-end. The apparatus was cleaned and
filled by first pumping dry air through, then washing the
interior with ozone as proposed by Cornu, and finally admit
ting the gas desired. There were, however, certain impurities
always present. Mercury and sulphur, and sometimes traces
of air, could be detected ; but in no case was I troubled with
any bands of carbon or its compounds.
    The induction-coil was driven by a storage-battery of twenty
volts, and was most regular and satisfactory.
    The photographs were taken on dry plates made specially
for this research by the M. A. Seed Dry-Plate Company
of St. Louis, Mo. Lantern-slide glass was used, as the
plates must be held bent to a radius of 6-75 feet (2-06 metres).
I cannot speak too highly of the quality of the plates, or of
their fitness for photographing gaseous spectra. Ten seconds'
exposure was sufficient for the solar spectrum at w.-l. 3700 ;
and an exposure of an hour was more than sufficient for the
weakest gaseous spectrum. The plates were 1 inch wide and
11-5 inches (29 centim.) long. The dispersion of the instru
ment was such that, using the second spectrum of the grating,
one plate included wave-lengths differing by 400 units (40/i/x) .
The definition was perfect over the entire length.

    The spectrum of hydrogen is of unusual importance owing
to its supposed presence in the light emitted by the white
 stars, and also because of Balmer's formula for the distribution
of its lines which form a series.

 spectrum of hydrogen has been shown by Hasselberg * to be
 due to this gas, and the wave-lengths of many of its lines have
 been measured by him. Cornu does not say whether he
 observed the secondary spectrum as well as "the stellar
 series " or not, but I judge from a chance remark that he did.
 I was entirely unable to get the stellar series by itself, although
 my hydrogen was pure I am confident, and I varied the tubes,
 the current, the vacuum, and the exposure. I also introduced
 large condensers without any noticeable change. Cornu's
 plates were 5 centim. long, and one was sufficient for the
 entire hydrogen spectrum from G/ to 6. His time of expo
 sure was often three and a half hours. My plates were surely
 more sensitive than his ; and, as the secondary spectrum
 includes the stellar series, I think the lines observed by him
 appear on my photographs, especially as he speaks of the
 " brilliant rays coming from his tube, in contrast with the
 nebulous lines in the spectra of the stars. If his lines had
 been faint and hazy, I might suppose my dispersion too great.

 measured on my plates, with their intensities, and the corre

   Of course my scale is different from Cornu's ; but it seems
remarkable that the measurements of Cornu and Huggins
should vary so much, as they used the same standards. I
have marked 7 (3798-0) nebulous ; but besides this back
ground there is a sharp line there, which undoubtedly belongs
to the secondary spectrum. It is strange, too, that the first
four lines of the series should coincide with solar lines, while
none of the others do. There are, however, on Rowland's
map certain hazy places which are approximately where the
most nebulous hydrogen-lines fall ; but there are no lines
corresponding to H, «, and (9, which are strong and clear on
my photographs.
   Knowing that Balmer's formula applied most exactly to
the visible nydrogen-lines, I calculated the constant and used
it to foretell lines. Indeed it was in this way that I selected
the last three of the lines in the series. There was never any
ambiguity in the selection. These lines were the only nebu
lous ones in the spectrum ; but they were so faint as sometimes
to escape notice until looked for.
   Correcting my wave-lengths for atmospheric refraction as
best I could, I found that the constant in Balmer's formula
should be 3fi47'20. Making the calculations, then, with this
constant, and comparing the deduced wave-lengths with mine
(corrected) we have :—

   The agreement is striking ; and it is possible that atmo
spheric refraction may fully account for most of the discre
pancies.
   As stated before, the formation of series similar to this one
of hydrogen is a feature common to many spectra. Balmer's
law with slight modifications probably applies to all. The
similarity between them is evident at once to the eye ; but
mathematically it is more apparent if we consider the wave-
numbers, or rather their differences. So, for purposes of
comparison, I will give these for the hydrogen series. The
values are corrected, as before, for atmospheric refraction.

   As to the secondary spectrum of hydrogen, Hasselberg has
 shown, conclusively I think, that it is not due to impurities,
 but to hydrogen itself. All of my observations on this point
 are in complete accord with his. But in his list of lines there
 are two mistakes. That the line at w.-l. 4347-71 (4347-10 on
 his map) is a mercury one is now certain, as it appears strong
 in the arc-spectrum as photographed by Prof. Rowland.
 Then, on Hasselberg's map and in his list of wave-lengths,

56          Mr. J. S. Ames on some Gaseous Spectra.
the lines at w.-l. 4790-0 and 4077-98 (4078-31 and 4077-32 on
his scale) are interchanged : 4079-0 is the hydrogen-line,
4077-98 the mercury one. This is at once seen on viewing
Prof. Rowland's photographs.
   There is the possibility that some of the lines which I have
attributed to hydrogen are due to sulphur, as its ultra-violet
spectrum is not known. I am at present engaged on this
spectrum, however, and shall soon be able to decide whether
or not my present list of hydrogen-lines is correct.
                             Nitrogen.
   The spectra of air and its constituents have been studied
with special care by Wullner *, Hasselberg t, and Deslandres }.
In this paper I do not wish to refer to any of the disputed
points concerning the immediate cause of the different gronps
of bands in the spectrum of ordinary air or nitrogen, but
merely to give measurements of the lines which form the
"second group" of nitrogen, and to mention some of its
properties.
   In this group there are nearly fifty bands, each band con
sisting of three series, the three first lines of each forming a
"head" for the band. The bands all have their heads
towards the red end of the spectrum, while the group itself
is turned the opposite way. At first sight the bands are
gathered in companies of five, except towards the head of the
group, where there is a series of two bands, then one of three,
one of four, and finally the sequence of fives. It seems as if
the group should begin with a single band ; but I have
sought it in vain. The three lines forming the heads are
double for all the series, without exception I think.
   In the following Table the wave-lengths refer to the second
line in each head. The first column gives my measurements
of the wave-lengths in air ; the second the corresponding
wave-numbers ; the third the measurements of the wave
lengths by Hasselberg and Deslandres.

   The study of these bands is most interesting. We have
here the best means of testing the accuracy of Deslandres's
so-called laws. Measurements show that the series of lines in
each band obey his law fairly well, and in this sense are iden
tical. The physical properties of the series are not always,
however, the same. We can also arrange the bands themselves
in five series as Deslandres* did, and in each of these series
the same law of distribution holds with considerable accuracy.

VI. Galvanometers. By Prof. W. E. Ayrton, F.R.S.,
            T. Mather, and W. E. Sumpner, D.Sc*
IN order that a number of students may be able to work at
      the same time in the Physical Laboratories of the City
and Guilds of London Central Institution we have en
deavoured, as far as possible, to arrange the apparatus so that
each of the many experiments should be complete in itself.
This has led to the necessity of our constructing, and having
constructed for us, a large number of galvanometers of various
types, and from the specimens that are on the table it will be
 seen that several of the galvanometers contain points of novelty.
 A long series of comparative tests has been carried out with
 all the more important types that are in our laboratories, and
we have therefore thought that a record of the results ob
 tained by the students, and by ourselves, will be of value in
 affording data to guide others in the selection of instruments
 most suitable for the objects in view, as well as in suggesting
future improvements in the manufacture of galvanometers.
                      I. Astatic or Non-Astatic.
    One of the first questions that arises is whether it is desirable
to employ the astatic type in the construction of sensitive
    * Communicated by the Physical Society: read January 17, 1800.

                        on Galvanometers.                       5(J
galvanometers. Prof. A. Gray, in his treatise on ' The Theory
and Practice of Absolute Measurements in Electricity and
Magnetism/ maintains that it is not, for he says (page 31 1) :—
" Sensibility is sometimes obtained by the use of astatic
galvanometers, but these are rarely necessary and are more
troublesome to use than ordinary non-astatic instruments."
   This opinion carries special weight as it may be very
probably taken as expressing Sir William Thomson's view
on this subject, seeing that the usual method adopted by Sir
William for measuring small currents is to employ a galva
nometer with a single set of magnetic needles, and to weaken
the magnetic controlling field as far as requisite by means of
adjustable magnets. Theoretically there is no limit to the
sensibility obtainable in this way; but with any strength of the
resultant controlling field due to the earth and the adjustable
magnets an astatic combination of magnetic needles must
give a more sensitive arrangement than a non-astatic one.
For let F be the resultant strength of this controlling field,
let M be the magnetic moment of a needle within the coil
whose magnetic constant is G, and let CL be the current
flowing, then, if « be the deflexion, we have for small deflexions
                                 C,G
                          . a-~F-'
   Next, let a needle of moment m be attached to the sus
pended system outside the coil, so as to form an approximately
astatic system with the needle inside, then, even if we neglect
the action of the coil on the needle outside, an action which
of course assists the action of the coil on a needle inside, we
have, if C2 be the current now flowing,
                            _ C,GM.
                          a_ F(M-ro)'
Hence, if the deflexions be the same in the two cases,
Now M may be made large, and M — m small, hence C2 may
be a small fraction of C,. Consequently for any adjustment of
the controlling magnet, the current required to produce a given
deflexion can t>e much diminished by using an astatic combina
tion instead of a non-astatic one.
   But, perhaps, the most important advantage of an astatic
over a non-astatic instrument is its much greater freedom
from outside magnetic disturbance. In order that Cj, the

 60          Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
current with the non-astatic galvanometer, may be small for a
given value of the deflexion a, the resultant controlling field
F must be small; whereas with the astatic combination there
is no necessity to make F small in order that C2 may be small,
         M
since jj—- may be made large. Now the disturbance that an
extraneous magnetic body can bring about depends on the
strength of the magnetic field it sets up compared with that
of the field F produced by the earth and the adjusting mag
net combined. Hence the moving about of a magnetic body
in the neighbourhood of the galvanometer will produce more
disturbance on a non-astatic galvanometer than on an astatic
galvanometer of the same sensibility. The preceding are
very important considerations ; hence, so far from agreeing with
Prof. Gray that it is more troublesome to work with astatic
galvanometers than with non-astatic ones, the preceding con
siderations, which we find fully borne out by experience, have
led us to regularly employ the astatic principle with sensitive
galvanometers.
   And generally we may conclude that when it is desired to
utilize a magnetic control, for example, with electrometers,
&c, it is better, when a small controlling moment is required,
to obtain this by the use of a weak magnet on the suspended
system than by attempting to simply weaken the controlling
field. Indeed, we may mention that even in the case of elec
trometers, where there is no question of the action of currents
on magnets, and where (when a magnetic control has been em
ployed in place of a bifilar or torsional control) it has been
usual to attach a single little magnet to the aluminium elec
trometer-needle, to be acted on by a stationary outside magnet,
we have found it more convenient to attach an astatic com
bination of magnets to the moving needle, and to direct the
system by a fairly strong permanent magnet, which acts of
course differentially on the suspended astatic system of mag
nets, since with such an arrangement great freedom from out
side magnetic disturbance is secured, combined with the
power of employing a wide range of sensibility.
   It is worth noticing that in galvanometers, where the dis
tance of the controlling magnet from the needles is varied by
simply raising the magnet M, as in the case of the galvano
meter seen in fig. 1, it is more convenient to place the
galvanometer so that the plane of the coils is in the magnetic
meridian of the laboratory when the controlling magnet is
removed; or, in other words, to place the galvanometer so that
the spot of light comes to the zero of the scale for no current

                      on Galvanometers.                       Gl
passing through the instrument and with no controlling
magnet. For in that case the sensibility of the instrument
can be subsequently varied by simply raising or lowering the
                            Fig. 1.
controlling magnet parallel to itself ; whereas, if the galvano
meter be fixed in any other position, it is necessary, when
raising or lowering the controlling magnet, to give it a care
ful screwing motion to prevent the spot of light going off the
scale.

62           Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
                     II. Position of Miitor.
   According to the ordinary method of constructing a
Thomson's reflecting-galvanometer, a tubular space at the
centre of the coil is left unwound, and the mirror, with the
magnets at the back of it, hung at the centre of this unwound
space (see fig. 2, which illustrates a well-known form of this
type of galvanometer). To allow the ray of light to pass out
                              Fig. 2.
of the coil after reflexion at the mirror, when the mirror is
deflected, the end of the tubular space has to be made
trumpet-shaped, which leads to still more space in the
neighbourhood of the needle being left unwound. And when
the galvanometer is an astatic one, a somewhat similar tubular
space is left unwound on each side of the lower coil to allow
room for the diamond-shaped aluminium vane to turn.
   In this way the most valuable part of each coil, viz. that
close to the magnetic needles, is left unwound. This disad
vantageous mode of construction so impressed itself on Mr.
Mudford, while a student at the City Guilds' Institute, that
he suggested that the needles alone should be placed within

                         on Galvanometers.                      G3
the coil, and that the mirror (which is, of course, employed
to reflect a ray of light, and not, as its position inside the coil
would seem to infer, to be acted on electromagnetically)
should be placed outside the coil, or between the upper and
lower sets of coils when two pair of coils are employed. A
specimen of a galvanometer constructed in this way and con
taining certain other improvements, which wi1r -be referred to
later on, was submitted some years ago by Mr. Mudford to
Sir William Thomson, who expressed approval of the devices
employed, and, since that time, many galvanometers differing
in other details, but all embodying the principle of not wasting
valuable space in the coils, have been constructed for the
Central Institution.
   It is interesting to notice that the common method of placing
the mirror inside the coil is an irrational survival of an old
custom kept up, like the two buttons at the back of a coat,
when its use is almost forgotten. Gauss and Weber put their
mirror inside the coil because the mirror was made of polished
steel and was also the magnetic needle. Sir William Thomson
put the mirror inside the coil in his " speaking galvanometers,"
for receiving messages on submarine cables, because he desired
to render the space near the mirror as air-tight as possible in
order to obtain great damping. And the ordinary maker of
astatic galvanometers puts the mirror inside the coil, because
he has seen it there in other galvanometers, and it has never
occurred to him to put it anywhere else.
    If the ray of light has not to go into the coil no hole need
be left and the coil may be wound practically to the centre.
It is necessary, however, that the space left unwound inside
the coil should be somewhat larger than is required simply to
allow the needle to turn through a small angle, because if the
windings were carried to the axis of the coil in the immediate
neighbourhood of the needle the effect on the latter of the
current passing through the innermost coils would be opposed
to that of the rest of the coil. To find the shape and volume
of the least space that should be left unwound we proceeded
 as follows : —
   Let OA (fig. 3) be the radius of a convolution of wire whose
plane is perpendicular to the paper, the section of the convo
lution being represented by the small circle at A, then, from
 Maxwell's ' Elect, and Mag.' vol. ii. plate xviii., the lines of
force due to a current passing round this convolution are as
 indicated. Therefore, if a magnet whose half length is NP be
 placed at a distance ON from the plane of the convolution
 such that NP is a tangent to the line of force at P, no torque
 will be exerted on the magnet by a current passing round the

 64          Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
convolution, since the direction of the force at P is along the
magnet NP. But if the magnet be placed nearer to the con
volution, as at N'P', or farther from it, as at N"P", there will
                              Fig:. 3.

             o     P       3r
be a torque exerted on it due to this convolution of radius
OA ; the two torques, however, will be in opposite directions.
Now as the radii of the greater number of convolutions con
tained in the coil are greater than the half length of the
magnet, it is clear that the torque exerted by the convolution
OA when the magnet is to the right of NP is in the same
direction as that exerted by the coil as a whole, and that the
torque exerted on the magnet by this convolution when the
magnet is between OA and NP is opposed to the torque
exerted by the rest of the coil. In other words, if NP be the
position of the half-magnet in the coil, a convolution of
smaller radius than OA must not be wound in the plane that
passes through OAM at right angles to the paper. And if a
line APQ be drawn so as to cut all the lines of force at points

                          on Galvanometers.                       65
  where the tangents are perpendicular to the axis of the coil,
   OA gives the smallest radius that a coil must have in the
  plane passing through OAM at right angles to the paper,
  whether the magnet Toe at N and its half length be NP, or the
  magnet be at W' and its half length be N"P'".
     For our purpose, however, we have not to consider the
  problem of magnetic needles of different lengths at different
  distances from a fixed plane, but the converse problem of a
  magnetic needle of a fixed length in a fixed position, which is
  at different distances from different planes, the critical radius
  of convolution in each of which we wish to determine.
     If NP were the fixed half length of the magnet, then, as
  already seen, OA would be the critical radius of a convolution
 at a distance NO from N, and the critical radius of a convo
  lution for another distance can be obtained by imagining the
 figure 3 reduced in the proportion of NP to N"P'", in which
                          NP
 case a critical radius ^„^tll x OA will be obtained at a dis-
         NP
 tance ^yp^ON" from N.         Or, lastly, if we take OA as the
 half length and position of our magnetic needle, the critical
 radius of convolution at every distance from O will be ob
 tained by taking every such ordinate as N"P"' and multiply
 ing OA by the ratio of OA to N"P"', and the distance from
                                                      OA
 O for which this is the critical radius is equal to 1^gp^/> x ON".
A curve giving the locus of such critical radii of convolution
 is shown in fig. 4 for a needle of length 2, shown therefore in
 the figure about twelve times its full size, and we learn from
it that at a distance from the centre of the coil equal, say, to
 0-4 of the half length of the needle, the smallest convolution
should have a radius about 0-75 of the half length of the
needle, and that the wire must not be wound close to the
axis until the distance from the centre along the axis is about
0'72 of the half length of the needle.
    With an ordinary reflecting-galvanometer the needle re
quires to have a free angular space for turning of about 15°,
represented by the space between the two lines LOL'. In
this region the radii of the smallest convolutions must be a
little greater than theory allows, otherwise the needle would
touch the coils, and generally a sufficiently near approxima
tion can be made to the cavity which theoretically ought to be
left unwound by making it an oblate spheroid with a polar
axis about 0-72 of its equatorial diameter, the latter being of
course slightlv larger than the length of the needle.

66           Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
   Since winding wire inside the surface whose section is
given in fig. 4 would oppose the effect of the wire wound
outside this surface if the current flowed in the same sense
throughout the whole coil, it is possible, by causing the
current to circulate in opposite directions in the two portions,
to wind all the space and to cause all the convolutions to help
one another. Tnis we have not yet tried, but in view of the
fact that the space which has been left unwound in the gal
vanometers constructed according to Mr. Mudford's suggestion
is very near the needle, and therefore very valuable, it seems
important to try and utilize it in the way just suggested. In
that case the surface we have theoretically determined would
be the surface separating the coil into two parts, wound
respectively in opposite directions.

                       on Galvanometers.                    (>7
    As the coils of a reflecting-giilvanometer have to be suj>-
ported by a central framework, there is necessarily a certain
distance left between the coils when they are in position.
This space we find when drawn to scale is that contained be
tween the two vertical lines MM', and which therefore allows
more than sufficient room for the needle to turn. Hence if
the plan of opposite winding that we have suggested be tried,
the face of the coils may be made quite plane and no portion
whatever of the coils left unwound, even to allow the needle
space to move.
                 III. Damping the Oscillations.
    Since no hole is left in the lower coil for the aluminium
damper, as is the case with Messrs. Elliott's reflecting-gal-
vanometers, a different mode of damping is adopted. The
plan we find best is to attach the mirror M (fig. 5) to the
                             Fig. 5.
middle of a long vertical strip of mica, S, across the upper
and lower ends and the middle of which the magnets mi, ws,
and m2 are fixed. Such an arrangement is also seen in
position in the galvanometer shown in figure 6 later on.
With this arrangement, which requires very little space,
we find that when the controlling magnet is adjusted so
that the periodic time of vibration is 7 seconds or more
the spot of light does not visibly pass through the zero
or the instrument is dead-beat, and even when the period
 is much shorter than this, the spot of light does not pass

68             Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
through the zero more than twice*. With galvanome
ters in which less damping is desired, a portion of the strip of
mica is cut away, so as to make it narrower, and in extreme
cases, when for example no damping is required, as in the
case of a ballistic galvanometer, the mica strip is replaced by
a vertical piece of wire.
   With a ballistic galvanometer, especially when intended
for teaching-purposes, it is desirable to have some easy means
of adjusting the amount of damping. In the case of the
galvanometer used by our students for experimenting on the
variation produced in the swing of the needle of a ballistic
galvanometer by variations in the amount of damping, this
variable damping is effected by enclosing the mirror in a cell
whose glass ends can be simultaneously made to approach or
recede. This motion of the ends of the cell is effected by
turning a milled head outside the instrument which works a
right-and-left-handed screw inside.
   In order to correct the throw of a ballistic galvanometer for
the damping of the oscillations of the needle, it is well-known
that it is necessary to multiply the sine of half the angle of
throw by the expression
where X is the logarithmic decrement of the oscillations.
The value of this quantity when X is so small that its square
may be neglected is
                              V = l + iX.
It seemed, however, desirable to work out the value of V
more fully and also to express it in terms of the numerical
ratio of each amplitude to its successor, since in this way the
need of finding the Napierian logarithm is avoided. This we
did at first by direct calculation, but while forming a table of
values connecting V and the decrement we observed that the
matter could be treated much more simply as follows :—
    By taking logarithms of the complete expression for V we
have
   * Quickness in the needle coming to rest, which is produced by using
a powerful controlling field, must not, of course, be confounded with
considerable damping, since, other things being the same, the decrement
is the greater the weaker the controlling field and the slower the motion
of the needle.

Differentiate both sides of this equation once, twice, and thrice

or substituting for x, and working out numerically, we
obtain
                V=l+0'5\-0-027X9-0'05-lX3,
which shows that until X approaches unity the approximate
value for V generally used is sufficiently accurate. Now if
the ratio of the amplitude of any swing to that of its successor
is (1 +y) we have
              X=log(l+y)=y-|' + |'-&c,
Neglecting powers higher than the third, we obtain by sub
stitution
                V= 1 + 0-5^-0-277 y* + 0-130y2,
from which we can at once calculate the value of the complete
correcting factor when we have observed the decrement.
   It is usual to determine the sensibility of a ballistic galva
nometer either by the employment of an earth-inductor, or
by dischargingthrough the galvanometer a condenser charged
to a known P J). The first method, however, necessitates an
exact knowledge of the horizontal or vertical component of
the magnetic intensity at the spot, while the second requires
an exact knowledge of the value of the capacity of the con
denser and of the P.D. employed. But now that it is possible
to obtain an ammeter calibrated with a high degree of
accuracy, the simplest method of determining the sensibility of
a ballistic galvanometer is to first calibrate it absolutely as a

70           Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, a?ul Sumpner
galvanometer for measuring currents by direct comparison
with the ammeter. Its absolute calibration as a ballistic gal
vanometer can then be determined from the fact that
   The swing per micro-coulomb in scale-divisions
        = the deflexion per micro-ampere x
where T is the periodic time of oscillation of the needle in
seconds.
                   IV. Supporting the Coils.
   In olden days Messrs. Elliott supported the coils in their
galvanometers by simply employing three long screws to
squeeze each coil between a bross plate and the framework of
the instrument to which the plate was screwed. The disad
vantage, however, of such an arrangement was made painfully
clear in the use of a galvanometer constructed by this firm
for one of the authors in 1 868. For on transporting this gal
vanometer across India, soon after it was made, the brass screws
expanded more than the coils, and the coils consequently slipped
down, shearing away the needles, the mirror, and the alumi
nium vane. It was therefore suggested to Messrs. Elliott that
                              Fife. 0.
the coils should be supported in boxes B, preferably hinged,
as shown in fig. 6, so that when the coil-boxes are opened, as
in this figure, the suspended system S could be got at and

                       on Galvanometers.                      71
even removed without detaching the connecting wires from
the coils. The galvanometer shown in fig. 6 is, when in use,
covered up by the brass case supporting the . controlling
magnet, illustrated in fig. 1.
   Hinged boxes containing the coils of a reflecting-galvano-
meter appear to have been employed even earlier than this by
Mr. Pepper, at the Polytechnic, but that form of construction
was, apparently, in 1868 unknown to, or at any rate unused
by, instrument makers.
   In the case of galvanometers intended to be highly insulated,
these hinged boxes may with great advantage be made of
ebonite, and to prevent the boxes becoming electrified and
acting on the suspended needle electrostatically, one terminal
of the galvanometer should be joined to the outside brass case.
   In the galvanometer shown in fig. 6, the boxes are kept
closed by a screw which is screwed into the framework of the
instrument, but in the galvanometer shown in fig. 7 this
screw is replaced by a spring button, which is a more con
venient arrangement.
              V. Insulation of Coils and Terminals.
   In the ordinary method of constructing reflecting-gal-
vanometers the wires are brought under the base to terminals
fastened on to it. But such an arrangement is most un
satisfactory, since, no matter how thoroughly the upper
part of the ebonite base may be cleaned and dried, leakage is
almost sure to take place between the two wires, between the
terminals, and between both the wires and the terminals to the
ground along the inaccessible under surface of the ebonite
base. In fact, when one of the authors was engaged, on be
half of the Indian Government, in 1872 testing telegraph
insulators at Messrs. Siemens's works at Charlton, it was the
common practice every morning to light a gas-burner near
the galvanometer to dry it, and to diminish the leakage to a
workable amount. And it appears to the authors that the form
of expensive astatic reflecting-galvanometer, that is still made
by some firms, with the wires underneath the base, is but a sur
vival of the antiquated type of leaky electrostatical apparatus,
to use which required that the whole air of the room should
be first dried. Fig. 6 shows the obvious way of overcoming
this difficulty, and which consists in supporting the frame
work and the coils of the apparatus as well as the terminals on
paraffined corrugated ebonite pillars p, which are maintained
clean and dry by their being^ kept entirely inside the brass
cover of the instrument Q (hg. 1 ). The terminals T at the

72             Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
ends of the wires W project through holes H in the brass
case, these holes being kept closed by tightly-fitting ebonite
collars 0, tig. 1, E, fig. G, when the galvanometer is not in
use, or when it is being employed for some test where a small
amount of leakage is not important.
    Still higher insulation is obtained with the galvanometer
shown in fig. 7, since in this instrument the coils are sup
ported from two corrugated ebonite rods which hang from
a brass ring R, carried on the top of three corrugated ebonite
                                  Fig. 7.
        Very high resistance galvanometer with brass case removed.
pillars fixed to the slate base-plate. This instrument, the four
 coils of which have a joint resistance of nearly 400,000 ohms,
 was constructed by Messrs. Nalder Bros.; but the device, by
means of which the shortest path along which surface-leakage
can take place from the coils, or from the terminals, to the
 base of the instrument is between 30 and 40 inches of ebonite

                        on Galvanometers.                      73
artificially dried by sulphuric acid, is due to Messrs. Eidsforth
and Mudford. To prevent any possible overflowing of the
sulphuric-acid vessel, a syphon passes through the base on the
Tantalus cup principle, and which empties the liquid when it
rises to the level of the bend of the syphon.
          VI. Proportionality of Deflexion and Current.
    Some authorities are of opinion that it is of comparatively
little consequence what is the law connecting deflexion and
current, since for very accurate work any galvanometer must
 be carefully calibrated experimentally, and the exact law
connecting deflexion and current thus ascertained. But, on
 the contrary, although the necessity of calibration for accurate
 work is perfectly true, experience has shown us that for
 ordinary practical work much time is saved if the readings on
 the scale are approximately, even if not quite accurately, pro
 portional to the currents producing them. This latter result
 can, of course, be obtained either by fitting the lengths of the
 divisions on the scale to the peculiarities of the galvanometer,
 or by starting with a uniformly divided scale and constructing
 the galvanometer in such a way that equal additions to the
 current produce equal angular deflexions.
     In certain cases, when, for example, the galvanometer is
 mainly employed for measuring currents all having about one
 definite value, as for example in the case of a voltmeter used
 on an electric-lighting circuit, it is obviously desirable
 to have the scale widely extended at the part where it is
 most used, and to obtain this result it is better to have
 the divisions crowded together elsewhere. But, since the
 power of accurately subdividing the spaces on a scale by eye
 is much increased if all the spaces be of equal length, it is
 preferable, in the case of galvanometers for general use, and
 when all parts of the scale are equally valuable, to judiciously
 construct the galvanometer in such a way that the whole scale
  may be divided into equal distances which are directly pro
 portional to equal increments of current, than to give the
  coils and needle a shape arrived at in a haphazard fashion, and
 then attempt to experimentally subdivide the scale to suit the
  vagaries of the galvanometer.
     In a former paper communicated by Prof. Perry and one of
 the authors to this Society, it was pointed out that while a
  galvanometer may be a " proportional " instrument if the zero
  for no current be that corresponding with the needles being
  in a symmetrical position to the coils, the same instrument
  may be very far from proportional if the zero for no current

 74              Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
 be taken at one end of the scale and the spot of light deflected
 right across the scale for increasing currents, since in this
 latter case a variation in the law occurs as the plane of the
 needles passes through the symmetrical position. This want
 of proportionality is exhibited by the following figures :—

   This defect is even more marked in some parts of the scale
with the ordinary d'Arsonval galvanometer when the zero for
no current is at one end of the scale. This instrument, as
usually made by Messrs. Cnrpentier, has a tubular iron core
supported from a standard which carries the top suspension of
the coil, and the stationary permanent magnets are not pro
vided with pole-pieces. In consequence ot the core and the
suspension not being supported independently, there is great
difficulty in centering the coil relatively to both the core and
the stationary magnets ; further, neither the core nor the coil
can be readily removed. And partly because of this difficulty
of centering the coil, partly because its centre of gravity is
generally not in the line of suspensions, and partly because
the stationary magnets have no properly shaped pole-pieces,
there is (as may be seen from the following sample of the
results of many experiments we have made on d'Arsonval
galvanometers) an error in different parts of the scale far less
regular in its value than in the case of the ordinary reflecting-
galvanometer with stationary coil.

   We find that it is possible, however, to obtain with a
d'Arsonval galvanometer a far more exact proportionality
between the deflexion and the current than is given in the
preceding table by:—
   Supporting the coil independently of the iron core, so that
      fairly accurate centering becomes possible. This result
      has been to a certain extent accomplished in the small
      type of d'Arsonval galvanometer constructed by Messrs.
      Nalder.
    Allowing the coil to hang freely from the top suspension
       so that the centre of gravity of the coil is always in the
       axis of rotation. Electric continuity at the bottom of
       the coil is then maintained by a spiral of fine wire
       offering little torsional rigidity.
    Fitting iron pole-pieces to the stationary magnets, and
      shaping these pole-pieces so that the rate of cutting lines
       of force by the moving coil is practically constant.
   The following gives the results of tests made on a d'Arsonval
galvanometer constructed in this way, each divisional length
on the scale being 1'05 millim., so that the total deflexion of
600 divisions represented a motion of the spot of light over
about 63 centimetres, or about 25 inches. The deflexion
could be read easily to 0-2 of a division, and it will be ob
served that the greatest want of proportionality is only
0'15 per cent., which occurs with a deflexion of 480 scale-
divisions.

   To improve the magnetic circuit in d'Arsonval galvanome
ters some English makers replace the original tubular core
by a solid iron core ; and Messrs. John of Bristol form the
core of a series of short horizontal magnets laid vertically one
above the other. A comparison that we have made of the
sensibilities of the instruments constructed in these different
ways has not shown that the English instruments are superior in
this particular respect to the French. This may be, however,
due to the fact that the horseshoe permanent magnets employed
by the English manufacturers are inferior to those used by
Messrs. Carpentier.
   The ordinary methods adopted for attaching the suspension
wires of the d'Arsonval coil to the supports seem to have been
designed with total disregard of the fact that these wires con
vey the current into and out of the coil. This is particularly
serious when a d'Arsonval galvanometer is used as a volt
meter, especially when it is employed to measure a small
fraction of a volt, and when therefore the total resistance in
the circuit must be small.
   In fact we have found that before any reliance can be
placed on the indications of a d'Arsonval galvanometer em
ployed in this way, it is necessary to solder all the joints.
And instead of trusting to contact through the supports to
which the torsional suspension-wires are attached, we have
found it desirable to solder wires coming from the terminals
of the instrument directly to the hooks to which the suspen
sion-wires are attached. Perhaps the best plan is to solder
wires at one of their ends to the terminals of the instru
ment, and at their other ends to an extension of the torsional
suspension-wires.
   In devising very low-resistance d'Arsonval galvanometers

                        on Galvanometers.                       77
careful consideration must be given to the suspension-wires
which lead the current into and out of the moving coil, since
being usually made of German silver they may easily become
slightly heated by the relatively large current employed with
a very low resistance-galvanometer, and in consequence
their elasticity temporarily diminished. This would of course
have the effect of making the instrument more sensitive
for large currents than for small; but as the sensibility
for large currents would, until a limit was reached, increase
with the time the current was kept flowing through the gal
vanometer, such an instrument could not be used for accurate
measurement. One method of overcoming this difficulty is to
make the suspension of very thin phosphor-bronze strip, such
as is employed in the construction of delicate " Ayrton and
Perry magnifying-springs." For a thin strip has, for its
 cross-section, a very small torsional rigidity and a very large
radiating surface, and therefore is the very thing to employ
 when we want a conductor with small torsional rigidity, and
 which will be very slightly raised in temperature by the
passage of a current through it.
    D'Arsonval galvanometers, when used as voltmeters, are
 subject to the error that affects all electromagnetic voltmeters
 arising from a variation of the resistance of the coil due
 to a variation in the temperature of the room ; if, however,
 both the coil and the suspension-wires are made of platinum-
 silver, a very curious compensating effect is brought about,
 since the percentage increase of resistance with temperature
 of platinum-silver is almost exactly equal to the percentage
 diminution in its torsional rigidity. Hence when a rise of
 temperature diminishes the current flowing through the
 instrument for a given P.D. maintained at its terminals and so
 diminishes the deflecting couple, a proportional diminution in
 the torsional rigidity of the suspending wires, and therefore
 in the controlling couple, is produced at the same time. It is
 thus possible to construct an electromagnetic voltmeter of one
 metal only, which has no temperature error.
      VII. Sensibilities of Different Types of Galvanometers.
    Apart from differences in detail (as, for example, in the size,
  shape, or number of the coils, &c), galvanometers may be
  divided into four distinct classes, viz.:—
  1. Galvanometers in which the moving system consists of one
       or more magnetic needles turning about an axis at right
       angles to the magnetic axes of the needles.
  2. Galvanometers in which the needles have a motion of

78            Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
     translation along their own magnetic axes, the magnetic
     needles being drawn into, or pushed out of, coils acting
     like solenoids.
3. Galvanometers in which the magnetic system is stationary,
     and the moving system consists of a coil turning about
     an axis on its own plane.
4. Instruments based on the heating of a conductor by the
     passage of a current through it.
  Type 1 includes tangent-galvanometers, Thomson's reflecting-
galvanometers—in fact, so many well-known instruments that
further description is unnecessary. In addition to galvano
meters with straight magnetic needles, it may be noticed that
             Fig. 8.
                                             Fig. 0.
type 1 also includes instruments containing a bell-shaped
horseshoe-magnet ; since the bell-shaped magnet is only a
device for producing the equivalent of a very powerful and
permanent short flat magnet.

                           on Galvanometers.
   We may here mention that the instrument shown in fig. 5
is spoken of in this paper as a galvanometer with " one pair of
coils," while those illustrated in figs. 6 and 7 are referred to
as having each " two pairs of coils."
   Type 2 has been employed by Lord Rayleigh, the Profs.
Gray, Mr. Rosenthal, by ourselves, and others. Figs. 8 and 9
illustrate an instrument of this type, constructed by Messrs.
Edelmann of Munich, and called a Rosenthal Micro-galvano
meter, since this instrument has the peculiarity that the coils
into which the ends of the magnet are sucked are extremely
small, having an outside diameter of only 11 mm. and a thickness
of 2 mm. Fig. 9 shows the suspended magnet of the Rosenthal
galvanometer as constructed by the makers, the arrangement
being non-astatic ; but we have also made and used with this
galvanometer an astatic combination, constructed as in
fig. 10.

At its lower end it carries a small magnetic needle, m,
to be acted on by a pair of coils, 0, joined up in series

These coils are quite independent of the main coils of
the instrument, and are employed for damping the oscil

damping-coil attached ; but since to all our galvanometers

    Type 3 includes the well-known d'Arsonval galvanometers,
with the modification described to this Society some two years
ago for obtaining " invariable sensibility " by replacing the
ordinary torsional suspension with one having extremely small
torsional rigidity, and inserting a number of small magnets in
the moving coil, which, being attracted by the large stationary
magnet, produce the control.
    Type 4 we do not propose touching on in this paper, as that
type of instrument formed the subject of communications pre
viously made to this Society by Prof. Perry and by one of the
authors on " Hot-Wire Voltmeters " and " Twisted Strip
Voltmeters."
    It is important that the results of the numerous tests on
many specimens of each of the first three types of galvano
meter that have been carried out in the laboratories of the
Central Institution, as well as the tests that have been made
elsewhere, and the results of which we have collected together,
should be reduced to the same standard ; so that the relative
merits of the different types of galvanometer, as well as of the
different specimens of each type, should be able to be usefully
compared. A satisfactory standard of comparison, however,
cannot easily be arrived at ; and we are not aware that the
question of comparing galvanometers of totally different types
has previously received much attention. The " figure of
merit" of a galvanometer is sometimes defined as "the
 amount of current which will produce one division or degree
of deflexion " *. But although the figure of merit, so defined,
tells us the sensibility of a particular galvanometer with a
particular adjustment of the controlling magnet, and with a
particular distance of the scale, it gives us no means of com
paring this galvanometer with other forms, since this figure of
 merit can be varied by altering the position of the controlling
 magnet &c.—in fact, is not a constant of the particular galva
nometer. Something much more definite than this is there
fore required for our purpose.
    A little consideration shows that the sensibility of a galva
nometer in actual practice is made up of many factors, some
 of which depend on the skill of the experimenter himself. In
view of the sensibility of any particular galvanometer being a

                       on Galvanometers.                        83
complex result depending on many factors, it is desirable to
record the results of experiments on galvanometers in such a
form that the influence of each factor can be separately esti
mated. We have therefore endeavoured to distinguish, as far
as possible, the three chief causes that affect the sensibility of
renecting-galvanometers, viz. the arrangement and winding
of the coils, the construction of the magnetic system, and the
optical method of magnifying the angular deflexion produced.
With the same view the question of the susceptibility of
various galvanometers to outside magnetic disturbances has
been considered separately, since, first, the electrical qualities
of the instrument are not altered by such disturbances, and,
secondly, their influence is dependent, not only on the kind of
instrument, but on the place of test. In the Table that is
given later on recording the results of a large number of
experiments, we have classified galvanometers in four divisions
of decreasing susceptibility to outside magnetic disturbance,
comprising :—
   ^Ton-astatic instruments working in a weak field having
      strongly magnetized needles.
   iVon-astatic instruments working in a strong field and
     having somewhat weakly magnetized needles.
   Astatic galvanometers, working in a fairly strong field.
   Galvanometers of the d'Arsonval type, working in an
      extremely strong field.
  At the end of the Table are given the constants of a collection
of non-reflecting instruments. These instruments, being all
of a rougher type, have been simply grouped together at the
end of the list ; consequently their position on the list has no
reference to their sensitiveness or unsensitiveness to outside
magnetic disturbance.
   The optical sensitiveness of an instrument is dependent on
many conditions that have no necessary connexion with the
electromagnetic qualities of the instrument ; for example,
the goodness of the mirror, the brightness of the light, the
distance of the scale, &c. are important factors. We have
therefore given the number of scale-divisions per micro
ampere or per micro-coulomb, assuming the scale to be
placed at a distance from the mirror equal to 2000 scale-
divisions. As the scale-distance most generally used is
a metre, and as the scale-divisions are frequently in half-
millimetres, the conditions assumed are often fulfilled in
practice. The sensibilities for a steady current, and for a
discharge, are thus directly expressed in angular measure,
irrespective of optical magnification.

 84           Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
     An important and difficult question to decide is whether the
 factor of merit of a galvanometer should be stated for a con
 stant periodic time of oscillation of the suspended system, or
 for a constant controlling-moment for unit angle-deflexion, or
  for a constant controlling-field irrespective of the magnetic
 moment of the suspended system. The first condition is the
 most simple to realize experimentally with different instru
 ments, and the results so obtained are the most convenient for
 use in subsequent calculations; this condition is, further, the one
 most easily understood. We therefore give, in columns 3 and
 4, the values of D and S, which respectively denote the deflex
 ion per micro-ampere and the swing per micro-coulomb, each
 in scale-divisions, when the period is 10 seconds and the scale-
 distance is 2000 scale-divisions. The corresponding values at
 any other period T are of course DT3/100 and ST/10. It
 would, however, be unfair to rest satisfied with the results
 given in these tables for the purpose of comparing different
 galvanometers. For a galvanometer having a large mirror,
 and intended to be used at a considerable distance from the
 scale, would appear to be an inferior instrument, because on
 the one hand the large moment of inertia of the mirror would
 necessitate the controlling-moment being large to reduce the
 period to 10 seconds, while, on the other hand, the magnifica
 tion arising from the much greater distance that separated,
in practice, the scale from this particular galvanometer would
have no weight in the values given in the columns for D and
 5. We have therefore given in column 2 the values of M,
which are the millimetres deflexion per micro-ampere when
the period is 10 seconds and the scale placed as in the ordinary
use of the instrument. We have further, in the following way,
reduced the numbers to their corresponding values under the
condition of constant controlling-moment, the condition of
constant controlling-field being rejected, because it is inappli
cable to instruments of the d'Arsonval type.
    The periodic time T equals
         2^ /           Moment of inertia x sin 0
             v Controlling-moment for a deflexion 6 '
therefore, in order to obtain the comparative deflexions that
would be obtained with the same controlling-moment per
unit angle, we must find the deflexions that would be pro
duced with periodic times proportional to VI, where I is the
moment of inertia of the suspended system, the values of
which for the various galvanometers are given approxi
mately in C.G.S. units in column 6. Hence, to obtain the
values in columns 7 and 8, which give numbers respec

                         on Galvanometers.                      85
tively proportional to the steady deflexion per micro-ampere
and the first swing per micro-coulomb for the same con
trolling-moments for all galvanometers, we must multiply
D by I and S by VI- Now the stability of the zero of any
galvanometer depends on the controlling-moment per unit
angle of deflexion ; hence columns 7 and 8 give numbers pro
portional to the angular deflexion per micro-ampere and the
angular swing per micro-coulomb for the same amount of
stability of the zero for all the instruments. The periodic
times, however, will be very different for the different numbers
either in column 7 or for the different numbers in column 8,
the periodic time corresponding with any particular number
being equal to 10 VI seconds, where I is the moment of
inertia given in column 6 for the particular instrument
in question. For example, the numbers 3200 and 283, given
in columns 7 and 8 for Profs. T. and A. Gray's galvano
meter, correspond with a periodic time of 10 V50, or about
70 seconds ; while the numbers 542 and 3400, given in the
same columns for the 360,000-ohm galvanometer at the
Central Institution, correspond with a periodic time of only
10 V0-01, or 1 second. The numbers, then, in columns 7
and 8 give a fair comparison between the various galvano
meters when the time required to take an observation is
unimportant.
    The influence of resistance has next to be considered. If
two galvanometers differ only in the gauges of wire with
which they are wound, and the convolutions are similarly
distributed, then the sensibilities should be proportional to the
 number of turns. If, again, the thickness of the insulating
 covering bears a constant proportion to that of the wire, then
 the resistance of the coils would be proportional to the square
 of the number of turns ; so that the values of D/r^, S/r^
 would be constants for the same pattern of instrument, where
 D and S are the number of scale-divisions per micro-ampere
 and micro-coulomb respectively, and r is the resistance of the
 galvanometer. The proportion in question, however, varies
 not only for coils of different resistances, but also in the same
 coil, for several different gauges are generally used in winding
 the various portions. To get some idea of the relation between
 resistance and sensibility, we have made tests on galvanometers
 of the same pattern but of different resistances, the same sus
 pended system of magnets being used successively in each
 instrument, the controlling magnet being adjusted to produce
 the same periodic time in each experiment, and, when the gal
 vanometers were reflecting ones, the scale being placed at the

86            Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
same distance from each of the instruments. The following
were the results obtained with three astatic reflecting-galva-
nometers having coils of exactly the same size in each case,
but of very different resistance.
           Resistance of
          Galvanometer,          D.   D/r*.      D/r*.
             in ohms.
                  26             349   685        94-4
               2457             2160   43-5       954
               6410             3360   42        101
   From this it would appear that, if the only thing altered in
a galvanometer be the gauge of wire with which it is wound,
the sensibility is more nearly proportional to the resistance
raised to the power § than to the resistance raised to the
power i.
   Another set of experiments was now made with four non-
astatic galvanometers, the coils of each of which were made in
the same mould, totally different, however, in shape from that
employed in constructing the coils of the three reflecting-gal-
vanometers given in the last list. When tested with the same
suspended system, the controlling magnet being adjusted to
produce the same periodic time in each case, the following
results were obtained :—
    Resistance of           M,
   Galvanometer,        Fraction of   ji/A            M/r*.
      in ohms.        one degree per
                       micro-ampere.
         0-87             0-0149     0-01597         0-0157
         430              00333      0-01604         00185
        6423              01120      001397          0 02415
       399 25             0-2700     0-01352         0033
   In this case the sensibihty appears to be more nearly pro
portional to       than to r'. We have, therefore, in the large
table given two columns, one (No. 9) for D/r* and one
(No. 10) for D/r', which represent (according as r* or r'
may be regarded as the more accurate divisor to employ) the
deflexion per micro-ampere on a scale whose distance is

                          on Galvanometers.                          87
 2000 scale-divisions for a periodic time of 10 seconds that
 would be obtained if all the different forms of galvanometers
 were wound with such a gauge of wire that the resistance of
 each instrument was 1 ohm. Column 11 gives the swing per
 micro-coulomb on the same hypothesis, but in this case we
have only used        as the divisor.
   And whereas columns 9, 10, and 11 give the relative values
for the same periodic time, columns 12 and 13 give the
deflexion per micro-ampere and the swing per micro-coulomb
on a scale whose distance is 2000 scale-divisions for the same
controlling-moment that would be obtained if all the galvano
meters had 1 ohm resistance—the periodic time in any case
being equal to 10          seconds, I being the moment of inertia
of the suspended system given in column 6.
   Another question to be considered is the factor of merit in
connexion with the volume of the coils. As this is important
as regards the cost of high-resistance galvanometers, a separate
column (5) is therefore given, showing the approximate volume
in cubic centimetres occupied by the wire in each instrument,
and other columns (14, 15, 16, 17) give the values obtained
by dividing this quantity into the various factors of merit.
The results of comparison in these latter columns are very
interesting. It appears that galvanometers of the Rosenthal
or Gray and the d'-Arsonval types are by far the most sensitive
in proportion to the volume of coil ; and we believe that the
best way to make a very sensitive galvanometer with a movable
magnetic system is to employ several small coils, instead of
one or two large ones*, and that the magnets should be horse
shoe-shaped, with the line joining the poles vertical, as in
Prof. Gray's instrument, hut modified so as to give smaller
moment of inertia. Such a magnetic system can be made very
delicately astatic, and the weakening of the magnets with time
does not greatly influence the astaticism. We also conclude
from our investigations that the most sensitive galvanometer
of all would be one of the d'Arsonval type suitably modified.
The poles of the magnet should be very close together, the coil
should be very long and narrow, and no stationary iron corf-
should be used inside the coil as in the ordinary d'Arsonval
galvanometer. The sensitiveness could be further increased by
employing electro-magnets instead of permanent ones to pro
duce the deflecting field, the current flowing round the electro
magnet being kept constant by means of an auxiliary reflecting
  * Mr. C. V. Boys, F.li.S., in his Cantor Lectures on "Instruments for
Measuring Radiant Heat" (April 1889), has also shown that galvano
meters with small coils may be made very sensitive(pp. 22, 23).

 88             Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
 " set-up ammeter " producing an image on the same scale as
 is used for the electromagnetic d'Aisonval galvanometer.
  With a " set-up ammeter " the suspended system is supported
 by means of an almost torsionless phosphor-bronze strip,
 requiring many twists to be given to it to bring the spot of
 light on to the scale when the current, that is to be kept
 constant, is flowing through it. A motion, then, of the
 spot of light over 100 divisions of the scale corresponds
 perhaps to a variation of only               in this current ; and con
 sequently, by means of such an instrument and a suitable
 adjustable resistance, a current can be kept constant to a very
 small fraction per cent.
    It might be objected to our conclusions that, in the papers
 read by Prof. Threlfall before this Society, and published in
 the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for December 1889, he comes
 to the conclusion that coils used in what we may shortly call the
 Mudford way (figs. 5, 6, and 7) give greater sensibility than
 when used in the Gray way (figs. 8-12). But on studying
 Prof. Threlfall's papers we find that, from various numerical
 errors, he makes his coils when used as a Gray galvanometer
 one ninth as sensitive as they really were, and when used
 as a Mudford galvanometer seventeen times as sensitive as they
 were ; so that Prof. Threlfall's ratio of the sensibility of the
 Gray galvanometer to the sensibility of the same coils when
 used as a Mudford galvanometer requires to be multiplied by
 the very large number 153*.
    In order to correct Prof. Thelfall's calculations, the following
 alterations must be made :—
    Phil. Mag., Dec. 1889 : Page 465, line 11, for " The cur
 rent was therefore P26x 10-7 amperes," read " The current
was therefore 1-43 x 10"8 amperes."
    Same page, line 25, for " 2'5 x 10-8 amperes " read
" 2-8 x 10-9 amperes."
    Page 469, line 1: " The galvanometer having been brought
to a state of sensitiveness of 5 scale-divisions for 10~n amperes,
the measurement of the resistance of the sample of sulphur
in question became a tolerably easy matter." On examining,
however, the results obtained in the actual measurements
with the sulphur (p. 471), we find that the sensibility of the
galvanometer was not as above stated, 500,000 divisions per
micro-ampere, but 34,200. And, as his scale was 3 metres
away from the galvanometer, and his scale-divisions 1 millim.,
this number 34,200 reduced to our standard becomes 22,800 f.
   * These errors were also noticed by Prof. A. Gray, and referred
to in an article in the Phil. Mag. for February 1890.
   t Prof. Threlfall says, in a letter published in the Phil. Mag. for June
1800, in reply to these criticisms, that his galvanometer was not in a state

Granting this, and looking at the observations given on page 472 of the

determined, we find that there was considerable vagueness of the zero,
amounting in some cases to more than 4 per cent, of the double deflexion,
as -well as a gradual change in the position of the zero from 105 to 78.
If, then, the control were diminished to about -fa of the value it then had,
and which would be necessary to give the galvanometer the sensibility
claimed for it, the vagueness of the zero would probably become too
serious for the instrument to be used for any but the very roughest
measurements.

 92            Messrs. Ayrton, Mather, and Sumpner
           VIII. Self-induction of Galvanometer-Coils.
    We have already seen that the sensibilities of two precisely
similar galvanometers, which differ only in resistance, cannot
easily be predicted from their resistances, since, in consequence
of the varying thickness of the insulating covering of the
wire, there is no simple connexion between resistance and
the number of convolutions of wire occupying a given space.
 It therefore occurred to us to consider whether, since the self-
induction of a coil of a given size and shape depends mainly on
the square of the number of convolutions, and but little on the
thickness of the wire or of the insulating covering, the square
root of the self-induction would be proportional to the mag
netic constant of the coil. The following table gives the
results of the tests on the three astatic reflecting-galvanometers

gives the ratio of the values of D, of the square roots of the
self-inductions, of the square roots of the resistances, and of
the resistances to the power § :—

    From the preceding list it appears that the ratio of the
square roots of the self-inductions gives the ratio of the
galvanometer-constants of coils, not only much more accu

   From the above it appears that a coil of the ordinary size and
shape used in Thomson galvanometers has a coefficient roughly
equal, numerically, to one thousandth of its resistance in ohms.
If the coils of the instrument are in series and placed near each
other, as in actual use, the coefficient is increased by about
half its former amount, owing to mutual induction ; so that,

for Thomson galvanometers whose resistances vary between
1000 and 10,000 ohms, the time-constant is about 0-0015
second. With very high-resistance instruments the time-
constant falls to 0-0005 second, in consequence of the in
creasing importance of the insulating covering of the wires.

    The needles of the first and last of these four galvanometers
 have lost much more magnetism than have the needles of the
 second and third galvanometers. As regards the Rosenthal
 instrument it might have been expected, in view of the powerful
 nature of its magnetic needle (see fig. 9) and of the fact that
 the current only acts on small projections of this magnet, that
 the magnetism would not be much diminished by use. But
 it has to be remembered that, whereas with the ordinary
 reflecting-galvanometers the zero-position of the needles is
 that in which the lines of force due to the coil are at right

                 On the Kinetic Theory of Gases.                  05
angles to the axes of the magnetic needles, and therefore the
needles are not in a position to have their magnetism much
altered by the passage of a current, unless that current
be very strong, the suspended magnet of the Rosenthal
galvanometer will tend to have its magnetism diminished
by every current sent through the instrument in such a
direction as to push the poles of the suspended magnet
out of the coil, since the lines of force of the two coils will pass
along the axis of the suspended magnet. Care not having been
taken to send the current round the Rosenthal galvanometer,
so as to always suck the ends of the magnet into the coils, is
probably the explanation of the weakening of its suspended
magnets during four years in the ratio of 5 to 1. Whereas
the falling-off in the sensibility of the first of the four gal
vanometers in the preceding list in the ratio of 4 -3 to 1 during
 a shorter time is probably due to inferior steel having been
 used in the construction of its magnetic needles.
    In view of the great difference which exists between various
specimens of magnet-steel, it is most important that only the
very best magnet-steel should be employed in the construction
of galvanometers which are intended to have a high sensibility,
since the factor of merit of the instrument depends largely on
 the goodness of the magnetic needles.
VII. Note on Boltzmann's Kinetic Theory of Gases, and on
    Sir W. Thomson's Address to Section A, British Association,
    1884. By E. P. Culverwell, M.A., Fellow of Trinity
    College, Dublin*.
BOLTZMANN has shown that, whatever be the law of force
        between the particles of a gas, the configuration of the
gas will remain unchanged provided the mini bur of particles
moving in a particular way be proportional to e~kI , where I is
 the total energy of a particle moving in that way. This may
be termed a permanent configuration. Mr. Watson has ex
 tended this to a system of molecules with any number of
degrees of freedom.
    But, so far as I know, no one has attempted to show that a
set of particles having any given initial conditions will, as
time goes on, approximate more and more to this permanent
configuration. Sir William Thomson indeed has stated (see
 Montreal Presidential Address, Section A) that he believes it
 " to be rigorously demonstrable that the whole translatioual
 energy [of a perfectly elastic molecule] must ultimately
                     * Communicated by the Author.

 96               Mr. E. P. Culverwell on the
become transformed [by repeated collisions] into vibrational
energy of higher and higher nodal subdivisions, if each mole
cule is a continuous elastic solid." If this were true there is, I
think, no doubt that the proof would involve also a proof that
 Boltzmann's permanent configuration is that which all dyna
mical systems will finally assume.
    Barely touching on the difficulty, dwelt on by Sir W.
Thomson at Montreal, that elastic molecules would not on his
theory, or indeed on Boltzmann's theory either, possess the
known properties of a gas, I will take as an example the
only case in which the equations of motion can be integrated
in finite terms, i. e. that in which the stress between two par
ticles varies directly as the distance. Taking attractive action,
each particle moves harmonically round the centre of Mass
of the system, and the mutual actions of the particles do not
on the whole tend to distribute the energy equally among all
the degrees of freedom. For instance, let there be a system
comprising any number, great or small, of balls or points
following this law, the balls being in motion with, say, very
small velocities. Let two of the particles be given very
violent blows in opposite directions, so that the total momentum
of the system is unaltered, then the interaction of the balls
will not cause any of the energy given to the two balls to be
shared among the other balls. Observe that the particles must
either be mathematical points or else able to move through
each other, but this makes no difference to my argument,
which is that there is nothing in the nature of dynamical
equations in virtue of which their solutions tend to a perma
nent average distribution of energy.
   This instance shows that it is impossible to prove in general
that a set of particles will tend to the Boltzmann configura
tion, in which the energy is equally distributed among all
the degrees of freedom (though it does not show that they
would not do so for certain laws of force other than the
direct distance) ; and it shows also that the assumption
commonly made, that permanent states are independent of
initial conditions, is really not based on dynamical grounds
but on physical experience, and that it involves some
principle analogous to the second law of thermodynamics.
   But surely no instance is required to show the impossibility
of proving that, whatever be the initial conditions, the effect of
repeated intermolecular collisions is to equalize the energy
among the different degrees of freedom. For the well-known
property of reversal, which all complete and purely dynamical
systems fulfil, shows that for every configuration which tends
to an equal distribution of energy, there is another which

                       Kinetic Theory of Gases.                  J) 7
  tends to an unequal distribution, for a considerable time at
  all events, and this quite independently of the number of
  degrees of freedom, or the continuity, of the molecules ; and
  it is safe to state that no demonstration such as Sir William
  Thomson has hinted at can be given as a result of dynamical
  equations, in which a simultaneous reversal of velocities is
  equivalent to a mere change in the sign of t.
     This may be tested by examining in a common-sense way
 the case of a molecule striking a rigid wall, for it would be
 too laborious to calculate the circumstances of the collision
 even for the law of direct distance among the particles of the
 molecule, because fresh equations would be necessary after
 each collision of any particle of the molecule with the wall.
 For, taking a molecule formed of two particles onlv, which
 attract with any law of force, let the collision take place
 against a wall perpendicular to X ; then, if when the first
 particle Pt hits the wall, the other particle P2 happens to be
 at rest relatively to the wall, it is evident that after Pj has
 hit the wall, x, the x velocity of the Centre of Mass, is exactly
 reversed (and should P2 reach the wall, x will be increased).
 Hence whether P3 hit the wall or not, and whatever be the laio
 offorce, the numerical value of .i will be increased whenever
 P2 is moving from the wall at the instant Pj hits it, and
 similarly if P2 were moving rapidly towards the wall when Pj
hit it, and if P2 did not hit the wall violently, then x would bo
smaller than before the collision. In fact if to Pj and P2 be
given the positions and reversed velocities that they have after
the collision, then the result would be a new collision after
which x would have its original value. Hence it is as likely
that the energy of the particle relative to its Centre of Mass
will be transformed into translational energy as that the
translational energy will be transformed into relative energy ;
and it seems evident that similar reasoning would apply to a
 molecule formed of 3, or of 4, or of any number of particles.
    The conclusion I draw from these observations is that no
success can attend an attempt to prove that the temperature-
equilibrium results from dynamical actions between molecules
alone. I can see no reason for supposing that, if the particles
of a gas could be enclosed in a vessel not containing aether
(and such that no energy were transferred to the vessel
in its collision with the particles), the gas would ever attain
a temperature-equilibrium at all. If it did always attain such
an equilibrium, it would be to my mind a proof that the
ultimate particles of matter did not individually obey those
laws which they are known to obey when collected in the
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 30. No. 182. July 1890.            H

5)8                On the Kinetic Theory of Gases.
enormous numbers which compose the bodies for which the
laws of motion have been experimentally proved.
    But when one of the most important purposes for which
the existence of the aether is required is the communication
to, or abstraction of, heat-energy from material particles, it
seems absurd to try to derive temperature-equilibrium from
molecular action. We know that by means of the aether,
bodies at a distance and wholly prevented from acting on
each other molecularly, come to exactly the same temperature-
equilibrium as the particles of a gas are expected to do by
interaiolecular collisions, although the' aether between them
is perfectly competent to settle their temperature-equilibrium
without any assistance from their collisions. Hence there is
every reason to suppose that it is by the molecules interacting
through the aether that the temperature-equilibrium is de
termined. Hence taken by themselves the molecules do not
form a complete dynamical system, for we cannot consider the
aether (or any medium having kinetic properties) as merely
limiting the number of degrees of freedom of the molecules,
and thus replace it by (geometrical) equations of condition.
Indeed it is no harm to observe here that equations of con
dition should not be employed in atomic theories, though
perhaps they may have a place in molecular theories. For an
equation of condition either indicates that the force between
two particles J>1 and P2 is not a function of the distance be
tween them (and is therefore inadmissible) or else it is
resolvable into /(r12)=0, and then it should be discarded,
and a distinct expression of the law of force it implies should
 be substituted for it.
    It would be very interesting if Sir W. Thomson would
 give some outline of the way in which the initial conditions
 could be introduced in a demonstration such as he believes
 possible, for it appears to me that the fundamental error in all
 assumptions about permanent states is that they persistently
 ignore the initial condition on which obviously the whole
 theory must depend, if the system be reversible. It is interest
 ing, too, to remark that in the case of vortex motion (in which
 one attends simply to the dynamical equations and does not
 reason from preconceived physical ideas), Sir W. Thomson
 " has found no indication of the dissipation of translational
 velocities, or of vibrations of slow period, into those of
 shriller and shriller vibrations." Of course I do not mean to
 say that things do not actually come to a permanent state,
 but only to assert that permanence is a consequence of the
 interaction of molecules and wther and not of the interaction of
 molecules among themselves. No doubt the mode in which

               The Elast ic Constanta of Quartz Threads.
the aether produces those permanent states in which there
is no transference of energy from one place to another is
difficult to explain, but it is an experimental fact which any
theory of the a>ther must necessarily explain, for it must ex
plain the radiation-equality of temperature.
    If the views here put forward be correct, Sir W. Thomson's
objection to the kinetic theory of gases is disposed of, and
the many difficulties arising from the nature of the Boltz-
mann permanent configuration are avoided*. But the diffi
culties are only avoided ; all that is done is to reduce the
number of properties explained by the kinetic theory, and to
shift the temperature difficulties to the ajther, so that in some
shape or other they will crop up again.
VIII. The Elastic Constants of Quartz Threads. By Richard
    Thkelfall, Professor of Physics in the University of
    Sydney \.
 SINCE there can be little doubt as to the great superiority
        of quartz over silk threads for all purposes of suspension
 where accuracy is required, I have thought it worth while to
obtain some detailed numerical information of their elastic
 properties. My attention has been directed to the following
 points suggested by the needs of instrument^making:—
     1. The determination of the strength of quartz fibres.
     2. The determination of the modulus of torsion and the
 modulus of simple rigidity from vibration experiments.
     3. The determination of the temperature-coefficient of the
 coefficient of torsion}.
     4. The determination of the coefficient of expansion of
 fused quartz for the purpose of enabling a calculation of the
 temperature-coefficient of the simple rigidity to be carried
 out.
     5. An investigation of the amount of " Nachwirkung " ex
 hibited by quartz fibres with the view of finding a practical
 limit to the rate of twist which may be safely applied.
    » I mean such difficulties as those connected with specific heats and
 with the proportion of the energy in the different radiations of gases ; for
 instance, it may be urged that the molecules of sodium gas must have an
 infinite number of degrees of freedom, since when heated sufficiently and
 in sufficient numbers per unit volume they give out a continuous spec
 trum, and yet in ordinary states of vibration they give out merely, or
 at all events chiefly, the characteristic sodium-line.

  requisite to twist the lower end of the thread through one radian, the
  upper end being fixed.

   I shall describe the experiments and computations made

     Production of Threads, and Conditions of Experiment.
   For the purpose more especially of the experiments on
Young's modulus it was necessary to make threads much
thicker than those usually employed for purposes of suspen
sion. This was partly due to the fact that in determining
both the rigidity and the Young's modulus the diameter of
the threads requires to be known with greater accuracy than
any of the other data, as it enters the result raised to the
fourth power. On the other hand, it is probable that the
properties of thick threads are not quite identical with those
of tnin ones. This is certainly the case with the breaking-
strength, but whether the relative difference of strength of
thin and thick threads is to be attributed to the difference in
thickness per se, or to the consequent difference in annealing,
which necessarily accompanies difference of thickness, I cannot
say, but I incline to the latter view. In experimenting
therefore it becomes a matter of judgment and experience to
decide what thickness of threads it is best to work with. I
have endeavoured to proceed in such a way as to have the
threads neither too thin for tolerably accurate measurement,
nor so thick as to be entirely removed in properties from the
thin threads which are used in practice. I have in general
found that it is impossible, with my apparatus, to be sure of
the thickness of threads of about -015 centim. diameter
within less than three or four per cent, by a single measure
ment, and have consequently adopted the plan of making
many observations of each thickness, with a view to elimi
nating the accidental errors—which, I have satisfied myself,
are of the chief importance. I have also experimented in
each case on several samples of threads so as to eliminate any
possible individual peculiarity of the threads employed.
   I have to thank Mr. Adair for making all the observations
of time of vibration, and computing most of the results ; Mr.
Pollock for determining the coefficient of expansion of fused
quartz and the coefficient of expansion of a brass vibrator,
and also for determining the breaking-strength of many

                Elastic Constants of Quartz Thread2.         101
 threads, and their limits of perfect torsional elasticity. The
 measurements of the threads, as well as the rest of the work,
 has been attended to by myself.
    I have found it convenient to abandon the bow-and-arrow
 method of making threads in favour of a rather more manage
 able method—applicable to the production of comparatively
 short, thick thread?. On a board about seven feet long a brass
 rod three quarters of an inch in diameter and six feet long
 was fastened so as to lie parallel with the board at a distance
of about an inch and a half above it. On this brass rod a
 light boxwood traveller was adjusted to slide freely, and this
traveller carried a rough and ready clamp. A clamp was also
 established on the board at one end of the brass rod. A bit
of quarter-inch catapult elastic was fastened to the slider, and
fixed as to its other end to a hook screwed into the board at
the end furthest from the fixed clamp. This elastic was
brought into tension by pulling the slider up towards the
clamp. When in position the slider was held by a trigger,
actuated by foot. A combination of springs and india-
rubber was arranged near the hook, so as to act as a break
on the slider, and also to jam it in such a way that there was
no rebound. The slider was prevented from turning round
by its proximity to the board. In order to draw a thread,
a bar of quartz of the required thickness was clamped
as to its ends in the two clamps and was heated in the
middle. Of course, on pulling the trigger, a thread of any
desired thickness and about 5 feet long was produced. From
the middle of this thread a portion of the required length for
the experiment in hand was cut, and the diameters of the two
ends were measured. If the difference in diameter observed
was within the range of experimental error of measurement,
the thread was considered sufficiently uniform for the work in
hand. Some threads shot in the ordinary way were also used
in the breaking and vibration experiments. I venture to
think that in practice the catapult method of production will
be found useful, as it is certainly possible by means of it to
get a thread about four feet long at least as fine as I can
manipulate, though one improves in manipulation so much
that the experimental limit is continually moving away. It
must be admitted, however, that a little practice is necessary
in order to draw fine threads by the catapult method. The
strength of the fibres is such that for galvanometric purposes
the limit of thinness is imposed by our skill in manipulating
the fibres, not by their inability to carry a load. For this
reason, and also because the strength of fibres appears to differ

fastened to a fibre by a silk thread, so as to avoid giving the
fibre any lateral strain. The load was applied by allowing
mercury spray from a fine pipette to gradually pass into the
bucket. The weight of the bucket of mercury was ascertained
as soon as the fibre broke. The second method was certainly
 more convenient, and considerably more accurate, in that it
did not lead to vibration being set up in the thread. In it use
 was made of a brass spring. A microscope stand was taken,
 and the top of a spiral bard brass spring (made of wire -044
 centim. diameter of some thirty-one convolutions, and having
 a diameter of -95 centim.) was fastened to the structure which
 normally carries the sliding-tube of the microscope. The
 upper straight part of the spring had a point of reference
 moving over a scale engraved on looking-^lass, and to the
 bottom of the spring the top of the thread was attached by
 hard paraffin or shellac; the bottom of the thread was fastened
 to the base of the apparatus, and the rack and pinion was
 worked till the spring was just on the point of beginning to
 be stretched. The position of the point of reference on the
 scale was then noted, and the rack screwed slowly and steadily
 up till the thread broke. Watch was of course kept on the
  point of reference, and its position when the thread broke was
  noted. By afterwards loading the spring with known weights
  —the mercury-bucket for instance— the tension exerted by
  the spring could be estimated. It elongated 1'45 centim.
  with 5 grammes weight, and 2-9 centim. with 10 grammes
  weight. The method is open to the objection that a twisting
  couple, due to the uncoiling of the spring, as well as a pull,
  acts on the fibre. This was eliminated as far as possible by
  making the convolutions close together, and the twist was not
  in any case more than a few degrees per inch of length of
  fibre. The length of the thread varied in different experi
  ments, as will be seen from the table. The fracture was some
  times curious, and in one instance, owing presumably to
   splitting, the lower end of the thread was found to present
   a perfect point at the position of fracture. The following
   abstract of results will be sufficient:—

        The diameter of these threads was measured with the help
of a stage-micrometer by Zeiss, which was afterwards found
to be correct by stepping it with a measuring-microscope
against the millimetre-divisions of a standard metre-scale, and
of a scale by the Darling, Brown, and Sharp Co.
        It is rather an interesting question as to what finally de
termines the point where fracture shall take place. All the
threads were from very long pieces which had been shot, and
were very uniform. Some of the fractures indicate that at
the instant of fracture the material near the exact point of
fracture was in a very unstable condition. This is strengthened
by the observation that the pieces afterwards broke more
easily as a ride. The results are of value only as showing
what sort of loads can be carried by quartz threads of moderate
thickness, and as showing that Boys's estimate of a breaking-
 strength of from fifty to seventy tons weight per square inch
 of quartz section is confirmed.
                       Measurement of Diameter of Threads.
          As the measurement of the thread-diameter was the funda
 mental operation in all the other experiments, it is as well to

  104             Prof. Richard Threlfall on the
  state at once exactly how it was done. A thread having
  been selected by preliminary trial for uniformity, was broken
  to the required length. A sample about a quarter of an inch
  long was then broken off each end and placed on a microscope
  slide. The refractive index of quartz is about the same as
 that of Canada balsam, which therefore had to be avoided;
  consequently the ends were mounted in 50-per-cent. glycerine
  stained with aniline blue, and a carefully chosen cover-slip
 placed over all as in ordinary microscope practice. The object
 of colouring the glycerine was to make the quartz more visible.
 The objective used was a Zeiss D, giving a magnifying power
 of about 230 diameters with the eyepiece used. The ordinary
 camera was employed to give a simultaneous view of a scale
 pinned to a stand on the table at such a height that parallax was
 almost entirely avoided. The thread to be measured was then
 brought to the centre of the field, and a reading of the scale
 was taken. The process was repeated with the other end,
 and finally the threads were replaced by the micrometer. It
 was found necessary to use the same part of the field for the
 micrometer that had been occupied by the thread in making the
 comparison by the aid of the step-scale. A most laborious pre
 liminary examination was made in order to avoid constant
 errors due to the micrometer. The Zeiss scales divided into
 hundredths of a millimetre were compared with a very fine
scale by Powell and Lealand. The Zeiss scales were found to
 agree, but to give readings differing from the Powell and
 Lealand scale by about 3 per cent, in the direction of making
 the divisions of the latter too large. The millimetres of each
of these scales (i. e. the end divisions) were then compared
directly by means of a very fine comparing-microscope by the
Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co. The screw of this
instrument had been minutely examined previously by Mr.
Pollock for another purpose, and had been found more correct
than it was possible to set the head (to '0001 inch) for a
certain short part of its run. The result of this comparison
again showed that the Powell and Lealand differed from
the Zeiss micrometers by from 3 to 4 per cent. The divisions
of all the micrometers were then stepped on the stage and
foTind to be all correct as nearly as could be estimated ; in
other words, they were identical in length, or did not differ
from each other by more than 3 per cent, of their whole
length. The sensitiveness is indicated by the observation that
at the centre of the field 3-7G division of the step-scale corre
sponded to -01 on the micrometer. Finally, to decide which
micrometer was the best to use, the Cambridge Instrument
Co.'s comparing-microscope was used to compare the milli-

                Elastic Constants of Quart: Threads.          105
 metres of the various scales with several millimetres taken
 from the standard metre, with several taken from a callipers
 by the Darling, Brown, and Sharpe Co., and with several
 from a large callipers by Elliot Bros. The result was to
 show that the Zeiss scales were as nearly right as I found
 possible to estimate, and the Powell and Lealand wrong by
 about 3 per cent. In order to check the method some very
 thick threads, up to -3 millimetre diameter, were measured
 under the microscope, and callipered directly both with
 American and English micrometer-callipers. The result was
 entirely satisfactory, though the experiment involved using a
 lower power on the microscope. Some thin threads were also
 measured, and though less suited to the callipers allowed the
 high power to be used on the microscope and gave, as nearly
as could be read, identical results. At first there was a want
of consistency because care had not been taken always to use
the middle of the field. The advantage of using the glycerine
 mounting was that it was much easier to focus on the edge
 of the thread with certainty than was the case in air. It is
perhaps fair to say that the engraving of the Powell and
Lealand scale was very superior to that of the Zeiss, but it
was not so convenient, as only one tenth of a millimetre was
divided into hundredths, and, as has been said, was wrong by
3 per cent. 1 have to thank Professor Haswell and Dr.
Wright for the use of these scales. To get the best results I
found it necessary to use a variety of shades and screens so as
to obtain uniform illumination. In the thread measurements
the divisions and parts of a division occupied by the image of
the thread on the step-scale were estimated first, and then the
micrometer having been substituted for the threads the value
of a step-scale division was got by taking the number of
divisions occupied between the two nearest coincidences,
covering the part of the scale previously occupied by the
image of the thread. This is more accurate than using pencil
marks. I have dwelt on this measurement with more detail
than is perhaps necessary, because as the accuracy attained
here really conditions the final accuracy of the results, I have
wished to give an idea of what sort of accuracy I have suc
ceeded in reaching. Most, if not all, of the threads were too
coarse for the optical method of measurement.
     Determination of the Coefficient of Torsion and of its
                      Temperature- Coefficient.
   In these experiments an arrangement was made permitting
the torsion to be investigated by the method of vibration at

106               Prof. Kichard Threlfall on the
all temperatures up to 98° C, and at pressures ranging from
76 to one or two centimetres of mercury.
    A cube of brass, measuring about four inches on the side,
was bored through the centre of one face to a depth of about
three inches, the diameter of the bore being about one inch.
This block served as a support to the vibration-tube, which was
jacketed and projected into the hole in the block. The tube
was provided with a flange so that it could be connected air
tight to the block. A hole about one inch in diameter, and
whose axis was horizontal when the vibration-tube was vertical,
was cut through the block and opened into the bore. This
hole was glazed with carefully selected glass and allowed the
 motion of the vibrator to be observed. In order to get the
 window air-tight, the necessity for considerable pains was
 anticipated and experienced. Rubber washers, coated with
 white lead, and compressed against the glass by a good and
powerful screw, enabled me finally to dispose of the difficulty.
 Additional light was let into the cavity in the block by means
 of a solid glass rod running horizontally into the block at an
 angle of about 40° to the axis of the window-hole. This bar
 was secured by screw-packing in the usual manner. Every
 thing was straight and all the parts true, so that the vibration-
 tube could be made truly vertical by setting the brass block
 horizontal. This was done in the usual way. The vibration-
 tube was about 24 inches long, and was furnished with
 a small side tube so as to allow of its being put in connexion
 at will with a Bunsen pump, a Sprengel pump, and an air-
 drying apparatus. The jacket was furnished in a similar
 manner with an inlet and outlet for steam or other vapour, and
 was wrapped in cotton-wool and paper to a thickness of about
  half an inch all round. The ordinary brass-rod suspender
  was passed through a rubber bung, fitting the top of the
  vibration-tube, and surrounded by a movable circular wooden
  trough which could be filled with mercury, and thus form a
  mercury seal for the bung. In spite of all the trouble taken,
  the apparatus was never absolutely air-tight, the high tem
  perature at which it was used preventing me from reaping
  the advantage of covering doubtful places with marine glue.
  The vibrators used were (1) :—A pure silver anchor-ring sup
  ported by a disk of aluminium foil, through the centre of which
  passed a short bit of aluminium wire to which the thread was
  attached. (2) A cylindrical vibrator of brass, vibration being
  about the axis of the cylinder. (<5) A similar but larger
  vibrator for measuring the temperature-coefficient with thick
  threads. (4) A disk vibrator of brass, vibration taking place
  about its axis of revolution.

  Determination of Change produced in Modulus of Torsion
                   of Quartz Fibre by Heating.
   For this experiment it was not essential that the fibre
should be uniform. On the other hand, the vibrator required
to be heavy, or rather to have a large moment of inertia, so
that the energy possessed by it might be sufficient to carry it
through a good many vibrations. The cylinders were used in
these experiments. One was about -8 centim. in diameter and
weighed about 10 grammes. The other, similar in figure,
weighed about 25 grammes. It was very necessary to devise
a means of fastening the fibre rigidly to the suspender and to
the vibrator, as, of course, at the upper temperature all
ordinary cements become unreliable.
   I finally hit on a method which I have since found useful
for some purposes in the case of glass. It was suggested by
Professor Kundt's method of preparing metal surfaces on
glass. Two thin needles of quartz, each about two centim.
long and one millim. in diameter, were coated each on one
end for a distance of, say, five millim. with metallic platinum.
This was done by dipping the end in strong solution of
platinum tetrachloride, and subsequently reducing the same
by heating in a Bunsen flame. The heating requires to be
done with judgment. If the oxyhydrogen jet is used the
platinum gathers into drops ; if, on the other hand, the
temperature be below a good red heat, the platinum does not
reduce or stick properly. Having got the ends of the quartz
needles platinized, they are dipped in solution of chloride
of zinc and then tinned in the ordinary way with a small
iron. A hole is drilled in the vibrator and another in the
suspender, and these holes are tinned. It is then easy to
solder each needle into its respective hole, just as if it were a
wire. Unless care be taken not to cool the soldered parts
too rapidly, the quartz will be found to be rotten near the

110                Prof. Kichard Thrclfall on the
points of soldering. The thread is prepared by simply
drawing down a needle by hand, leaving the thicker portions
attached. The thin part was generally about 12 inches long.
The-ends are then easily joined to the similar ends, project
ing from the brass work. The whole having been clamped
so as to let the vibrator swing freely, it is brought into order
by heating the thick portions till they become soft and stretch
slightly. Two sets of observations were made with threads
prepared and supported in this way. Of these, one was much
better than the other—that with the heavy vibrator—and
that alone will be used, for the reason that the small vibrator
was of unknown brass ; while the coefficient of expansion of
the other was determined from a sample cut from the same
rod. The time of vibration (taken from sets of two hundred
vibrations each) was first determined under a pressure of a
few centim. of mercury, and at a low temperature. Steam
was then turned through the steam-jacket, and after a known
period the time of vibration was again taken. The tempera
ture inside the vibration-tube and in the hollow in the block
was determined in a subsequent experiment, where the
conditions as to steam-supply were made as nearly identical
as possible with those obtaining during the vibrations. The
observations made were very numerous and very concordant.
 Two hundred vibrations took about 11 minutes 39 seconds, and
 the sets differed only by two or three tenths of a second.
 Time was taken from a rated stop-watch. Nineteen sets were
 taken at a mean temperature of 22° C, and fourteen sets at a
 mean temperature of 98-5° 0. for the fibre, and 67° C. for
 the brass. In order to obtain a result from these measure-
 ments we require to know the coefficient of expansion of the
 brass, and for some purposes of the quartz also. The coeffi
 cient of linear expansion of the brass was found, by the method
 of Matthiessen (Phil. Trans. 186(i), in a manner that will be
 described, to be -000020264 between 79° and 35° C. This
 was considered to be the coefficient of expansion over the
 range 23°-68° used in the observation. For most practical
 purposes we are only concerned to know the change in the
 torsion produced by heating a twisted quartz fibre, and for
 this it is sufficient to know the expansion of brass. To get
 the coefficient of the modulus of rigidity we require to know
 besides the expansibility of fused quartz and the length of
 the thread used. The former we have attempted to get by
 Matthiessen's method applied to masses of fused quartz, but
 with only partial success. Even assuming that an extension
 to threads of the coefficient so found were admissible, the

                  Elastic Constants of Quartz Threads.          Ill
actual length of the active part of the fibre is also uncertain ;
but of course it is easy to see that almost all the work must
be done by the thin part, since the resistance to torsion varies
as the fourth power of the diameter. This enables the results
to be applied to really uniform cylindrical fibres without
appreciable error. We can easily estimate the total change
in the force of torsion induced in any thread by raising its
temperature one degree.             In any instrument, such as a
gravity-meter, this coefficient of total change is all that is
required, and, as will be seen, is the same for all fibres of
similar figure. Let $t1 be the -' moment of forces " exerted
by the fibre under given conditions at temperature tl, i. e.
        , <f>t2 be the corresponding value at t3.   Let Tj and T2
be the time of a given number of vibrations at the lower and
upper temperatures respectively ; and let a be the coefficient
of linear expansion of brass.

             Determination of Coefficients of Expansion.
      The method of Matthiessen (Phil. Trans. 1866) was em
  ployed. I have in my possession a very fine set of copper
  vessels fitted into one another, one of them being silvered out
  side and one inside. Consequently I can maintain five or six
  litres of water at a high temperature with a very slow rate of
  cooling. It was with this apparatus that the experiments
  were made. As the method is well known it will perhaps
  suffice to say that infinite pains were taken to get as good
  results as the method will allow of. Everything that thought-
  fulness could suggest was done, except the purchase of a
  special balance, and yet the expansion of quartz appeared
  irregular to a degree. In the final experiments the amount
  of fused quartz available in the form of short thick rods was
  more than 14 grammes—a quantity involving no inconsiderable
 expenditure of time and oxygen in its preparation. In the
 course of the work we plotted curves from various tables giving
 the expansibility of water, and finally used the values given
 by Mattluessen (be. cit.). The small table in Everett's
 ' Units and Physical Constants,' p. 39, is subject to a misprint
  (discovered from the curves) in that it gives the density of
 water at temperature 35° as 0'99469 instead of 099419. We
 are inclined to believe that sticks of fused quartz are in
 general in such a state of strain that the real expansion due
 solely to rise of temperature is masked by other effects. This
 suggests that the proposed use of fused quartz for thermometer-
 bulbs may turn out to present a purely illusory advantage,
 though on this point we would prefer to speak with all re
 servation. The accompanying table will give an idea of the
work done and the results arrived at. I ought to say that
many previous experiments had been made in my laboratory
by a student, Miss Robinson, and that my attention was
really drawn to the matter by the anomalous results she ob
tained. The table gives the results of only the more reliable
experiments, i. e. those against which nothing is known ; any
want of sensitiveness of the balance will not account for the
abnormalities.

    Precisely similar experiments on brass left nothing to be
 desired : in the first set the brass was more or less polished ;
 in the second it was carefully but lightly gilt. It must be
 said, however, that here we dealt with a weight of about 73
 grammes of material, and that consequently with the balance

 used the method was more accurate. The range was from
 about 80° G. to 36° C. The first experiment gave 3«=
  -000060616, and the second, 3a = -000060666. Whence we
 deduce «= -0000202.
                   Experiments on " Nachwirkung."
    The fibre used was pulled out by hand so as to leave the
 ends thick for attachment. The length of the " uniform "
 part may be taken as about twelve inches, and its thickness at
 -0102 centimetre. One of the thick ends of the fibre was
 rigidly clamped, and the other carried a fine mirror ground
 and polished in the laboratory for galvanometer-purposes. A
 cross bar was fastened to the lower thick portion below the
 mirror, and this was twisted in the usual manner by a glass
 cell. The subjective method was used. One complete rota
 tion corresponds to 2500 scale-divisions, and the scale was
 easily read with certainty to tenths of a division. At first the
 twist was put in by successive additions of five complete
 turns at a time. The fibre was usually left twisted for five
 minutes     Afiothen
 position. and                allowed to comewas

 fibre had been twisted through fifteen turns (/. e. 37,500 scale-
 divisions) and left in its place for 16 hours 40 minutes. On
 releasing the thread it seemed to take 3 hours 40 minutes to
 come back to near its zero position, and thus untwisted by 3-7
 divisions. This creeping back seemed regular and normal.
 We deduce from this and other experiments that one may
 safely twist a thread of -01 centim. diameter through one
 turn per three centimetres of length, and leave a good margin
 of safety, since Nachwirkung first appeared when the rate of
 twist rose to about one turn per two centimetres of length.
 Since the intensity of the strain is proportional to the diameter
 for a given rate of twist, this result allows us to estimate the
 maximum twist that may be used with safety with fibres of any
 thickness. Number of turns per centimetre must not be
 greater than                   .01             \

    After vibrating the thread that had been used for the

of torsional fatigue. The period of vibration remained the
same as ever. The experiments, however, were too rough to
enable us to say more than that torsional fatigue, if it exists,
is too small to affect the readings of any instrument in which
threads are likely to be used.

   Two excellent steel knife-edges were fastened rigidly to a
block of boxwood which was flat at the bottom, so that when
the bottom was horizontal the knife-edges were the same, as
tested by a spirit-level. The knife-edges were parallel and
4-043 centim. apart ; the thread to be tested was drawn out
by the catapult method and measured as to diameter by means
of the Zeiss scale in the manner before mentioned. The
weight was applied in the form of a rider of round platinum
wire, which was brought to the central point of the thread
by a gauge. The deflexion produced was measured by a
micrometer-microscope (the one mentioned above as having a
practically correct screw). Twelve observations, with the
weight alternately on and off, were made on each thread and
 were always very consistent. Errors due to " loss of time"
 in the micrometer-screw were of course eliminated. The
 errors, however, in estimating the deflexion were in any case
 wholly insignificant compared with the errors of measurement
 of the thread diameter. No observations of temperature-
 coefficient were made, as the method was not suitable. A long
 thread hung down a jacketed tube would be necessary, and in
 view of our ill success in determining a would be hardly worth
 experimenting on. The results which I obtained are exhibited

  jVote un Prof. Threlfall's Paper " On the Elastic Constants of
            Quartz Threads" By C. V. Boys, F.R.S.
    As Prof. Threlfall has asked ine to look over the proofs of
his paper on the Elastic Constants of Quartz Threads, I am
taking the liberty of sending, by way of comparison, the
results obtained at South Kensington, which were published
for the first time at one of the Cantor lectures delivered at the
 Society of Arts in the spring of 1889. It will be seen that
though we have not investigated the subject quite so systema
tically as Prof. Threlfall, our results and his agree within the
limits of experimental error.

   Quartz fibres, whether thick or thin (i. e. weak or strong),
all increase in tenacity as they are dissolved by hydrofluoric
acid ; so that no matter whether a thick or thin fibre was used
at first, the diameter is found to be the same at the moment
that it is broken by the pull of a given weight suspended
from it, showing that it is neither a vitreous skin nor an effect
of annealing that gives the fine fibres so great a tenacity.
Quartz fibres dissolve very slowly in hydrofluoric acid in
comparison with spun glass.
   The experiments on the elasticity of quartz threads were
made with a machine, for a description of which 1 must refer
those interested to the Journal of the Society of Arts.

quartz fibres, which will possibly be worth referring to by
those who may wish to acquire the easy act of handling these
delicate filaments.
   I should like to take this opportunity of publishing measures
of the refractive power of fused quartz recently made by Mr.
W. Watson in the Physical Laboratory at South Kensington,
using a prism of this material that had been ground and
polisned by my friend Mr. Cunynghame. This piece of
quartz I had annealed by allowing it to cool slowly in the
centre of a furnace of pure broken quartz heated by a large
oxyhydrogen-flame. Mr. Watson also measured the refractive
index of a piece of crystalline quartz at the same time for the
purpose of comparison.

   It will be seen that the refractive power of fused quartz is
very low ; its dispersive power is the same as that of crystal
line quartz. The material is perfectly transparent, it works
as pleasantly as the crystal, and is certainly more permanent
than any glass. Perhaps the makers of microscope-objectives

A SJiort Course of Experiments in Physical Measurements. By
   Ha hold Whiting, Instructor in Physics at Harvard University.
   —Part I. Density, Heat, Light and Sound.
HTHE above volume is issued as the first portion of an Elementary
      Course of Practical Physics, and deals with the subject in a
manner differing somewhat from that adopted in the ordinary
English text-books. The line of teaching indicated in it is one
which has been more extensively followed in Germany than in the
English colleges.
   The author has chosen for his purpose only such experiments as
can be performed without very elaborate apparatus, but which by
applying care and a few special precautions can be made to give
fairly accurate results. At the outset the student is expected to
acquaint himself with the chief sources of error in any determina
tion, and to learn how these can be got rid of either by careful
manipulation or by suitable correction. He is thus taught at the
very beginning of his course to attach more importance to his own
carefulness than to the possession of what is often only apparently
more accurate apparatus. In some respects this system possesses
an advantage over the ordinary method of teaching, in which the
 student's first course of practical physics usually consists in repeat
ing for himself the experiments which he has seen performed in
the lecture-room. At the same time some difficulties arise from
the fact that the methods of correction often involve a greater
knowledge of physics than the student is supposed to possess when
 he performs the experiment. A good instance of this is to be
 found in the case of calorimetric measurements, where the appli
 cation of a correction for the rate of cooling of a calorimeter in
 volves an acquaintance with the laws of cooling ; and these laws
 would scarcely be treated of in an elementary course of lectures.
    But perhaps the difference in the systems of examination fur
 nishes the greatest objection to the adoption of foreign methods of
 teaching. At the end of bis first year's course an English student
 is expected to know how to use almost every piece of apparatus
 which he has seen exhibited in the lecture-room, and he is thus

                         Geological Society.                      119
prevented from giving to each experiment the additional time
which would be necessary in order to secure a good result.
   The experiments described in the book before us are well arranged,
and under each experiment the methods of procedure, the prin
ciples involved, and the nature and methods of correcting the
various errors are all clearly set forth. In this respect the book is
all that could be desired. The amount of mathematics involved is
trifling, and is stated clearly and concisely, so that it could be
followed easily by most students.
   Among the experiments described in this first part we notice one
or two that are entirely new, and other older experiments have been
slightly modified in form. Foremost among the new experiments
is a method of determining the specific heat of air at constant
volume. A wire heated electrically by a measured current is used
to heat the air, and the rise in temperature of the air is calculated
from the observed increase of its pressure. We have not yet had
an opportunity of trying this experiment, but if it yields a satis
factory result it will certainly form a valuable addition to the
existing calorimetric methods. A good modification is also intro
duced into Dulong and Petit's apparatus for determining the
absolute coefficient of expansion of mercury. In order to more
easily compare the heights of the two columns of mercury they are
brought nearer together at the top than is usually the case in the
text-books. Several modifications of this kind appear throughout
the book, and furnish valuable suggestions for obtaining increased
 accuracy in the results of experiments.
   The illustrations and diagrams in the book have not been designed
with a view to artistic excellence, but they show in most cases all
the essential details of the apparatus. There is, however, room
for improvement in this respect. In conclusion we believe that
this work will be found useful by those teachers who wish to give
their students a good training in practical physical measurement,
without rushing through the subject at the pace usually required
by those who are candidates for examination.

THE following communication was read :—
     " On the Kelation of the Westleton Beds or ' Pebbly Sands ' of
Suffolk to those of Norfolk, and on their extension inland, with some
observations on the Period of the final Elevation and Denudation of

 120                     Geological Society :—
the Weald and of the Thames Valley."— Part III. On a Southern
Drift in the Valley of the Thames, with Observations on the
 Final Elevation and Initial Subaerial Denudation of the -Weald,
 and on the Genesis of the Thames." By Prof. Joseph Prestwich,
D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
    In this third part of his paper the author gave a description of
 the characters of the Southern Drift, showing how it differs from the
 Westleton Beds in the nature of its included pebbles, which consist of
 flints from the Chalk with a large proportion of chert and ragstone
 from the Lower Greensand, while there is a total absence of the
 Triassic pebbles and Jurassic debris characterizing the Northern
 Drift. He traced the drift through Kent, Surrey, Berkshire, and
 Hampshire, and described its mode of occurrence.
    Another preglacial gravel was then discussed under the title of the
 Brentwood group, and its age was admitted to be doubtful.
    The author then entered into an inquiry as to the early physio-
 graphical conditions of the Wealden area, and gave reasons for
 supposing that a hill-range of some importance was formed in the
 Pliocene period after the deposition of the Diestian beds. From the
 denudation of this ridge, he supposes that the material was furnished
 for the formation of the Southern Drift, which may have been de
 posited partly as detrital fans at the northern base of the range.
    The relation of the Southern Drift to the Westleton Shingle and
 other preglacial gravels was considered, and the Westleton Beds were
 referred to a period subsequent to that of the formation of the
 Southern Drift.
    The influence of the meeting of the earlier Wealden axis with
 that of the folding which produced the escarpments of central
 England was discussed, and it was suggested that the result would
 be the genesis of the Thames valley and river.
    The following summary gives the results of the author's inquiry
as developed in the other parts of the paper. He holds :—
    1. That the Westleton shingle ranges from Suffolk to Oxfordshire
and Berkshire, rising gradually from sea-level to 600 feet.
    2. That the lower Tertiary strata were coextensive with this
shingle.
    3. That the upraising of the Westleton sea-floor, with its shingle,
preceded the advance of the glacial deposits, and that the latter be
come discordant to the former when traced westward, occupying
valleys formed after the rise of the Westleton Beds.
    4. That the Tertiary strata and Westloton Beds on tho north
border of the Chalk-basin were continuous until the insetting of the
Glacial period, when they were broken through by denuding
agencies.
   5. That none of the present valleys on the north of the Thames
Tertiary basin date back beyond the Preglacial period.
   6. That the same date may be assigned to the Chalk, and pro
bably to the Oolite escarpments.
   7. That in the Thames basin, besides the Northern Drift, there is

          Deep Channel of Drift in the Valley of the Cam.          121
a Southern Drift derived from the Lower Greensand of the Wealden
area, and from the Chalk and Tertiary strata formerly extending
partly over it.
    8. That during the Diestian period the Weald was prohahly partly
or -wholly submerged, and that between this and the insetting of the
Glacial period, the Wealden area and the Boulonnais underwent
upheaval resulting in the formation of an anticlinal range from
2000 to 3000 feet high.
   9. That from the slopes of this range the materials of the Southern
Drift were derived, and spread over what is now the south side of
the Thames basin.
    10. That this denudation commenced at the time of the Bed Crag,
and went on uninterruptedly through successive geological stages.
    11. That consequently, though the Southern Drift preceded the
Westleton shingle, the two must at ono time have proceeded syn
chronously.
    12. That the valley-system of the Wealden area dates from
Pliocene times,—the initial direction of the transverse valleys from
Preglacial times,—and of the longitudinal valleys from Glacial times.
    13. That the Thames basin results from the elevation of the
Weald and the flexures of the Chalk and Oolites of the Midland
counties, and dates from a period subsequent to the Westleton Beds.
    14. That the genesis of the Lower Thames similarly dates from
early Pleistocene times, whilst its connexion with its upper tribu
taries and the Isis, which possibly flowed previously north-eastward,
took place at a rather later period.

    The following communications were read :—
    1. " On a Deep Channel of Drift in the Valley of the Cam,
 Essex." By W. Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.E.S., F.G.S.
     In Scotland and in northern England long and deep channels filled
 with Drift have been noticed, but not in southern England.
     For some years one deep well-section has been known which
 showed a most unexpected thickness of Glacial Drift in tho higher
 part of the valley of the Cam, where that Drift occurs mostly on the
 higher grounds and is of no very great thickness. Lately, further
 evidence has come to hand, showing that the occurrence in question
 is not confined to one spot, but extends for some miles. The beds
 found are for the most part loamy or clayey.
     At the head of the valley various wells at Quendon and Rickling
 show irregularities in the thickness of the Drift, the Chalk coming
 to or near the surface in some places, whilst it is nearly 100 feet
 below it in others.
     Further north, at Newport, we have the greatest thickness of
 Drift hitherto recorded in the South of England, and then without
 reaching the base. At one spot a well reached Chalk at 75 feet ;

122                    Geological Society :—
whilst about 150 feet off that rock crops out, showing a slope of the
Chalk-surface of 1 in 2. In the most interesting of all the wells,
after boring to the depth of 340 feet, the work was abandoned
without reaching the Chalk, the Drift in this case reaching to a
depth of about 140 feet below the level of the sea, though the place
is far inland. The Chalk crops out about 1000 feet eastward, and
at but little lower level, so that there is a fall of about 1 iu 3 over
a long distance.
   At and near Wenden the abrupt way in which Drift comes
on against Chalk has been seen in open sections. Two wells have
shown a thickness of 210 and 296 feet of Drift respectively ; and
as the Chalk comes to the surface, at a level certainly not lower, only
140 yards from the latter, the Chalk-surface must have a slope
of 1 in less than \\, and this surface must rise again on the other
side, as the Chalk again crops out. The Drift here reaches to
a depth of 60 or 70 feet below the sea-level.
   At Littlebury, in the centre of the village, a boring 218 feet deep
has not pierced through the Drift, which reaches to 60 feet below
the sea-level. As in a well only 60 yards west and slightly higher,
the Chalk was touched at 6 feet, there must here be a fall of the
Chalk-surface of about 1-2 in 1. Eastward too, on the other side
of the valley, the Chalk rises to the surface.
   The places that have been mentioned range over a distance
of 6 miles. How much further the Drift-channel may go is not
known, neither can we say to what steepness the slope of the under
ground Chalk-surface may reach ; the slopes given in each case are
the lowest possible.
   The author thinks that the channel has been formed by erosion
rather than by disturbance or dissolution of the Chalk.
   2. " On the Monian and Basal Cambrian Rocks of Shropshire."
By Prof. J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
   In a previous paper the author had suggested that the Longmynd
rocks were referable to the Upper Monian. He now finds that they
are divisible into two groups, of which the lower only can be thus
referred.
   This lower group is divisible into five parts :— 1. Dark Shales ;
2. Banded Scries ; 3. Purple Slates ; 4. Hard Greywackos : 5. Pale
Slates and Grits. These are shown to have a real dip to the west,
and not to be thrown into any folds. It is in these only that fossils
have been found. The lowest dark shales are not basal rocks, nor
derived from the eastern volcanic series.
   The junction of the upper group, which represents the true Cam
brian, is unconformable, as shown by detailed stratigraphy. It con
sists of three members, the middle one being slates which die out
northwards. There is neither synclinal nor anticlinal fold, but a
regular sequence and dip ; and pale slates follow on the west. The
base is brought into connexion with each division of the lower
series except No. 2. The conglomerates contain : —1. Quartz ;

      Composite Spherulites in Obsidian from Hot Springs.             123
2. Rhyolites ; 3. Gneissic rocks ; 4. Slates like those of the under
lying group. The supposed Archaean masses on the western
border are non-existent, being intrusive and transgressive igneous
rocks.
    The volcanic group on the east is not bounded by the main fault,
the dark shales lying to the east of that fault. Evidence is given
that the volcanic rocks have been protruded through these shales,
which they have altered. The Eurite of the Wrekin is of later date,
and the only possible older rocks are the Rushton Schists and the
fragments of schistose rocks on Primrose Hill.
    At several places patches of red grit and conglomerate are seen on
the Volcanic hills ; these are referred to the Cambrian, and their
connexion also with earlier conglomerates forming part of the Vol
canic series is suggested. The Cambrian quartzite is later than all
 these, but may be synchronous with the upper part of the western
Grits.
    The Volcanic rocks are not, therefore, Middle Monian, as formerly
supposed, but represent the interval between Monian and Cambrian.
 If classed with either, the author inclines rather to place them with
 the Cambrian, in spite of the unconformity of the quartzite. He
 regards them as probably the equivalents of the Bangor Series, and
 possibly of the St. David's Volcanic Group. If this classification be
 adopted, then the Monian system will be entirely separated from the
 Pebidian, and be established on distinct and independent obser
 vations.

  Little Lake, California." By Frank llutley, Esq., F.G.S., Lecturer
  on Mineralogy in the Royal School of Mines.
     The spherulites which form the subject of the present communi
  cation have been previously noticed, and it was then suggested that
  a smaller spherulitic structure was set up in the large spherules after
  their formation. In the present paper evidence was adduced in favour
  of a different mode of origin. It was argued that the small spherulitic
  bodies (primitive spherulites) were developed in the obsidian before it
  assumed a condition of rigidity, and that they floated towards certain
  points in the still viscid lava, and segregated in more or less spherical
  groups, though there is no evidence to show what determined their
  movements ; furthermore, that from a point or points situated at

124           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
or near the centre of each group, crystallization was set up, giving
rise to a radiating fibrous structure, which gradually developed zone
after zone of divergent fibres until the entire mass of primitive
spherulites was permeated by this secondary structuro—a structure
engendering a molecular rearrangement of the mass, such as would
obliterate any trace of structure which the primitive spherulites
might have originally possessed.
   In a supplementary note the views of Mr. J. P. Iddings with refer
ence to the spherulites in question were given. Mr. Iddings considers
that the structures here described as primary are of secondary origin.

    The author noted that nodules of ironstone occurring in the
 Pennsylvania glacial deposits of Quaternary age are scratched in
 precisely the same manner as those which he has described from the
 Permian deposits of Leicestershire and Derbyshire, and concluded
 that one and the same agency, viz. ice, has been instrumental in
producing the observed results in both cases.

 DIAMAGNETISM TESTED BY CAKNOT's PRINCIPLE. THEORETICAL
    PREDICTION. BY J. PARKER, M.A., FELLOW OF ST. JOHN'S
     COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.
 IN May 1889 I published a short paper in the Philosophical
      Magazine in which Carnot's principle was applied to diamag-
 netisni. An oversight occurs in the paper which has since been
 corrected by M. Duhem, who has adopted and extended the sub
 stance of the paper.
    The present state of experiment and theory on diamagnetism
 may be briefly stated thus :—
     (1) If a piece of bismuth be placed near a .strong iron magnet in
 the open air, the bismuth behaves as if repelled by the iron.
     (2) If the same experiment were performed in a vacuum, it is
 shown by Carnot's principle that the bismuth would not be repelled
 and might be attracted.
     We therefore conclude that if the experiment were performed in
 a place from which the air could be pumped away at will, the
 repulsive force on the bismuth would become zero when the pres
 sure of the air was sufficiently reduced, and by continuing the
 exhaustion still further it would probably become attractive.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           125
   The action of the bismuth in the open air will be explained if we
remember that both the iron and the bismuth are surrounded by a
mass of magnetized air, so that the behaviour of the bismuth is due
to three causes :—
   (1) The attraction of the iron magnet.
   (2) The attractions of the magnetized atoms of air.
   (3) The resultant of the unequal pressures of the air over the
surface of the bismuth.
   The conclusions of this paper naturally lead us to question the
propriety of making our " absolute " units of electricity and mag
netism depend on the actions between bodies surrounded by elec
trified or magnetized air about which all that is known is that, at
some distance away, the air with which it is in equilibrium has a
measurable pressure.
  AN EASY MODE OF PRODUCING THE ACTIVE SPARK IN HERTZ'S
                  EXPERIMENTS. BY H. CLASSEN.
   In repeating Hertz's experiments in the State Physical Laboratory
at Hamburg, an observation was made which shows how in a simple
manner we can overcome the difficulty experienced by many ob
servers of keeping the primary spark effective for a long time
together. In the same manner in which Eijke* used the action of a
current of air on the make-and-break spark of an induction-coil in
order to produce a stronger action in the secondary coil, so may
the spark of the coil itself, and therefore also its inductive action
on any other conductor, be similarly influenced.
   In the experiments a large Buhmkorff's coil was used which had
a very rapid contact-maker, and which gave sparks up to 14 centim.
If the ends of the secondary coil are loaded with conductors, and
 the discharging-knobs are brought within a distance of a few centi
 metres, the discharge takes place mostly in the form of a continuous
rose-coloured strip of light, and is useless for Hertz's experiments.
 But when this band is blown away so that flames a centimetre in
length project on the side, sharp brightly luminous sparks occur
between the knobs. The current of air produced by a Miinke's
 water-pump was now blown continuously between the knobs, and
thus a series of sharp cracking sparks passed quite continuously,
and could without difficulty be continuously maintained for hours.
A series of Hertz's experiments could now be repeated, and even
 when the current of air was replaced by one of steam the action
 was the same. The whole process suggests the idea that, in the
 ordinary discharge with a luminous band of light, detached metallic
 particles effect a permanent conduction, and that the essential
 discharge-spark is only produced as these particles are blown away.
 The influence of the ultra-violet illumination, too, which has been
 designated by various observers as highly disturbing, would, after
 the researches of Lenard and Wolf on the pulverization of bodies

       ON THE EXPERIMENTS OF HERTZ. BY L. BOLTZMANN.
   I have successfully demonstrated to a large audience the sparks
which pass between a knob and a point in Hertz's experiments
on rays of electrical force, by connecting the knob with a very
sensitive electroscope, and the point with the pole of a suitable
galvanic battery, the other pole of which was put to earth. As
long as there were no minute sparks or scintilla (Fiinkchen*) the
electroscope remained uncharged ; but when these were formed
they established a connexion between the knob and the point and
caused the leaves to diverge. In this manner I was able to show
with certainty the scintilla produced by a single primary spark
when the primary and secondary inductors were at a distance of
36-8 metres apart, the greatest distance available.
    At a distance of 8-7 metres all the Hertz experiments could be
most convenient^' demonstrated before an audience of about 200, so
as to be visible to every one ; only three or four primary sparks were
 required for each experiment, by which the electrodes could be kept
 brightly polished. Dust, cracks in the metal, or an impure greasy
 condition of the surface appeared more injurious than the layer of
 oxide : cleaning with dilute sulphuric acid, distilled water, and
 then dry rubbing was found to be best ; a thicker layer of oxide
 is removed by polishing with French chalk (moistened with spirit),
 in which case dry rubbing is sufficient. I was not able to perceive
 any advantage in a current of air as recommended by Dr. Classen.
    The length of the secondary spark produced at the great distance
 of 36-8 metres I estimated at j-j^-j millim. as the maximum. A.s
 the dry pile which served to charge the electroscope had a potential
 of 200 volts, the knob and the point were adjusted at a distance
 which exceeded by about 770\,T the striking distance of the dry pile,
 the discharge of which was then set up by the addition of Hertz's
 waves to the tension of the dry pile. By using a much more
 feebly charged battery instead of the dry pile, and a much more
 delicate galvanoscope, Hankel's for example, the rays might be
 perceived at still greater distances. In the latter case it might not
 be impossible to measure the deflexion with a view to quantitative
 determinations. The regulation of the distance between the knob
  and the point must then be made so much the finer.
    I also made experiments on interference by reflecting the waves
 from the primary parabolic mirror through two plane mirrors, which,
 like those of Fresnel, formed an obtuse angle, and whose planes
  were at a distance of fourfold a half wave-length. This method
    * It may be convenient to use the word scintilla, spark, or little spark, to
 denote the very minute spark produced in the secondary circuit in Hertz's
 experiments.—E. Atkinbon.

   LECTURE-EXPERIMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXCITATION OF
        ELECTRICITY BY LIGHT. BY WILHELM HALLWACHS.
    In the first experiments on the excitation of electricity by light,
only very feeble positive charges were obtained of the magnitude of
a volt. MM. Bichat and Blondlot then found a method of in
creasing the charges by directing a current of air against the irra
diated plate by which they obtained increases of potential up to
30 volts. This method of increasing the excitation afforded at the
same time an insight into the connexion between the excitation of
electricity by light and the discharge of electricity by light, which
latter was increased by the electrostatic power of the negative
charges imparted to the plates, just as by a current of air. This
connexion was made clear by the experiments of Prof. Righi, w ho
demonstrated the proportionality between the potential produced
by radiation and the electrostatic forces which occur at the surface.
 In repeating the experiments of Bichat and Blondlot, I have ob
tained charges up to 100 volts by blowing against the bottom of a
brass vessel suspended in a sheath.
    In order to show in a lecture the excitation of electricity by
light we take advantage of the current of air; for then, if the field
of observation is sufficient and the lamp does not burn too long, we
may dispense with the troublesome screens against induction. By
 means of the following arrangement 1 have been able to show the
 phenomenon to a large circle of hearers. In the luminous cone
 of the electric light, after removing any glass lenses in the lan
 tern, a freshly polished zinc plate fixed to a shellac support is
 introduced laterally. The rays of light which pass by on the side
 strike a lens at some distance, which concentrates them on the gold
 leaf of a Hankel's electrometer. After removing the eyepiece, the
 object-glass of the microscope of the electrometer projects an image
 of the gold leaves on a screen, on which a scale is affixed to observe
 the displacement of the gold leaves. When the electrometer was
 charged with 20 chromic-acid elements and when the plates of
 the electrometer were tolerably near, the desired sensitiveness was
 obtained. In order to measure the latter a rigid wire was placed
 on the electrometer-battery, a few elements removed from the
 point put to earth, and connected by the conductor with the gold
 leaf.
     In order to make the experiment, the gold leaf and the zinc plate
  are connected with each other, a disk of mica is introduced in the
  path of the rays coming from the lamp, the zinc plate is put to
  earth for a moment, and after removing the mica disk no percept
  ible change is observed in the adjustment of the gold leaves if the
  sensitiveness of the electrometer is not exceptionally great. If

128            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
there is no deflexion, it shows that the space in which the observa
tions are made is free from the products of combustion of the lamp.
When the mica disk has been again pushed forward the zinc plate
is blown on from a hand-bellows, when there is no deflexion of the
gold leaf. If then the mica disk is withdrawn, a few separate puffs
with the bellows are sufficient to produce considerable deflexions,
so as to drive the leaf off the scale. That the direction of the
deflexion corresponds to a positive electrification follows from the
sign of the potential when the electrometer is charged for deter
mining its sensitiveness, and from the deflexions thereby produced.

            INVESTIGATION OF ELECTRICAL RESONANCE.
                      BY DR. ERNEST LECHNER.
    The author describes first of all a method of observing electrical
vibrations in wires. Opposite each of the two terminal plates of a
 Hertz's arrangement for vibrations an equally large insulated plate
is arranged, and from each plate is led a wire several metres in
 length, the two wires being parallel. Over the end of the wire a
 rarefied tube, without an electrode, is placed, which becomes lumi
 nous in consequence of the electrical oscillations in the wires. If
 the parallel wires are connected by a cross wire the luminosity in
 general ceases. If this bridge is moved backwards and forwards
 along the parallel wires, a few very sharply defined places are
 found where the tube suddenly becomes luminous ; these are the
 ventral segments of the electrical motion.
    After the author had studied the conditions of the experiment,
 and had shown that the whole is an electrical phenomenon of
 resonance, the shape and position of the electrical wave was precisely
 determined by seeking the common ventral segment. The influence
 of the introduction of capacities at the end of the wires was also
 examined.
    The author invariably found that Hertz's observations were
 always confirmed ; in one important point, however, he obtained a
 different result. While Hertz found for the velocity of electricity in
 wires 200,000 kilometres per second, the author obtained within
  2 per cent, of the exact velocity required by Maxwell's and all
  other theories ; he cannot, however, explain why his results differ
 from that of Hertz. A possible source of error in the experiments
  of Hertz was found on closer inquiry to be too small. As the
  method used by the author is very simple and comprehensive, and
  can be very easily made, in the form even of a lecture-experiment,
  he considers his value not only theoretically but also practically the
  most probable.— Wiener Berichte, May 8, 1890.

XII. Some Experiments on the Velocity of Transmission of
  Electric Disturbances, and their Application to the Theory of
  the Striated Discharge throtigh Gases. By J. J. Thomson,
   M.A., F.R.S., Cavendish Professor ofExperimental Physics,
   Cambridge*.
THE velocity of transmission of an electric impulse along
       a wire is, according to Maxwell's theory, equal to the
velocity with which light passes through the dielectric sur
rounding the wire. The velocity is thus determined by the
surrounding dielectric, in which the energy resides, and the
function of the wire seems merely to be that of guiding the
discharge, which travels at a rate fixed by the dielectric.
   The equality between the velocity of light through air and
the rate of transmission of an electric impulse along a wire
surrounded by air has been roughly verified by observing the
lengths along a wire of electric waves generated by an electric
vibrator : it was found that the wave-length divided by the
calculated time of vibration was verv nearly equal to the
velocity of light. In order to test Maxwell's theory more
fully, and to illustrate the influence of the dielectric and the
subordinate part played by the conductor, I have made some
experiments to compare the velocity of transmission of electric
impulses along wires surrounded by different dielectrics.
   If an electric vibrator AC attached to an induction-coil has
connected with it a wire AB which bifurcates at B into two
circuits, BL, BM, and if the ends L, M are connected to a
spark-micrometer the sparking-distance of which can be ad
justed by means of a screw, the sparking-distance will depend

130            Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Velocity of
upon the relative lengths of the wires BL, BM. If these
wires are both surrounded by air, the sparking-distance is a
minimum when the lengths are equal. This is the case what
ever the material or cross section of the wires. This is also
the case if one of the wires is placed between two large zinc
plates at a small distance apart ; though in this case the elec
trostatic capacity of one of the wires is very much greater
than that of the other.
    If (f>0cosnt represents the potential of B, l,V the lengths of
the wires BL, BM respectively, v and vf the velocities of
transmission of electric impulses along them, then the poten
tials of L, M are respectively

                                 v          v
These potentials will be equal, and the sparks therefore have
a minimum length, when l/v=l'/v>. When v = v', 1=1', which
agrees with the effects observed when both wires were sur
rounded by air. But if v and v' are different, then the lengths
of the circuits for minimum spark-length will be unequal, and
the ratio of the two lengths will be the ratio of the velocities
of transmission of electric impulses along the wires. We have
thus a method of finding the rate of transmission of electric
waves along different wires*.
   In order to compare the velocity along a wire surrounded
bv air writh that along one surrounded by paraffin or sulphur,
one of the wires BM was placed inside and insulated from a
brass tube connected with the earth at each end. The tube
was filled either with paraffin which was poured in in a melted
condition and allowed to set, or with sulphur melted down so
as to form a solid mass. The length of the circuit BL could
be altered by successively adding pieces of wire each J of a
 metro in length. The length of the wires when the spark-
length was least are given in the following Table, where the
different numbers refer to experiments made on different
davs :—        Wire surrounded                  Wire surrounded

   * I have found since this paper was in type that exactly the same me
thod was used by von Bezold twenty years ago to prove that the velocity
of transmission of electricity along wires is not affected by the material
or diameter of the wire (PoggendorfFs Annalen, cxl. p. 541).

   The velocity along a wire in air is thus 5-4/4, or 1-35 times
the velocity along a wire surrounded by paraffin.

                 by sulphur.                by air.

      Mean . . 4 metres.                     6-81 metres.
    Thus the velocity along the wire surrounded by air is 1-7
times the velocity along the wire surrounded by sulphur.
    These experiments show that the velocities along wire sur
rounded by air, paraffin, and sulphur are approximately
proportional to the reciprocals of the square roots of their
specific inductive capacities.
    When the tube surrounding the branch BM of the circuit
was filled with powdered glass, the sparks were least when the
lengths of the wires BL, BM were equal. This was also the
case when the tube was filled with flowers of sulphur. I
believe the explanation of this to be that the small pieces of
glass and sulphur are coated with a conducting film of mois
ture which prevents the waves entering the glass or sulphur, so
that the waves in this case are really transmitted through air.
            Velocity of Transmission alone/ Electrolytes.
    To determine the velocity along an electrolyte, an electro
lytic cell filled with a solution of zinc sulphate and having
 zinc electrodes was placed in one of the arms of the fork.
 The cross section of the cell was about 1 square inch, and the
distance between the electrodes about 2 inches. In this case
 the sparks were least when the arms were of the same length,
 though the effect produced by increasing the length of one of
 the circuits was not so great as when both arms were entirely
 metallic. The velocity of propagation of a rapidly alternating
 current along an electrolyte surrounded by air can thus not
 differ much from the rate along a wire.
    When a vacuum-tube was substituted for the electrolytic
 cell, the sparking-length did not seem to be affected, however
the relative lengths of the arms BL and BM were altered. I
 believe that this, however, is not because the velocity of the
discharge through a vacuum-tube is very much less than the
 velocity along a wire, but on account of the retardation of the
 discharge at the electrodes. The velocity across an air-space
 cannot be very different from that along a wire, otherwise the
 periods of electrical vibrators would vary with the length of

132          Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Velocity of
the spark very much more rapidly than seems to be the case.
I am endeavouring by the aid of a rotating mirror to measure
the velocity of the discharge along a vacuum-tube 50 feet
long, and though the experiments are not yet completed, they
have gone far enough to show that the velocity through the
gas is comparable with that of light. The results of ex
periments on the rate of propagation of electricity along
wires leads us to regard the conductor as merely guiding the
discharge, the correlation between the aether and the conductor
compelling the discharge to travel along the latter with the
velocity of light.
   The very rapid rate with which the electric discharge is
propagated through a rare gas compels us to admit that the
electricity is not carried by charged atoms moving with this
velocity. For if it were, then if the discharge were to take
place in air at atmospheric pressure between two parallel
plates one centimetre apart, charged to a potential difference
of approximately 30,000 volts, the kinetic energy which would
have to be communicated to the atoms to make them move
with this velocity would be greater than the original poten
tial energy of the charged plates : assuming that the charge
on each atom is that deduced from electrolytic considerations.
   The evidence in favour of the view that the conduction of
electricity takes place by means of the atoms of the substance
through which the discharge passes appears to me to be so
strong, that I think it important to see whether this view of
the electric discharge cannot be reconciled with the very rapid
rate at which the electric discharge passes through a gas.
The following view of the behaviour of the gas seems to
explain both the rapid propagation of the discharge and some
of its most striking features, such as stratification.
   Before the electric field is intense enough to cause discharge,
the induction in the field polarizes the gas. We may regard
this polarization as being equivalent to the formation of chains
of molecules analogous to the " Qrotthus chain " in electro
lysis. As the intensity of the field increases, suppose the
molecules in one of these chains near an electrode, say the
negative, interchange their atoms ; and that it is not merely
those molecules which are next the electrode which split up, but
that the decomposition of the molecules extends along an appre
ciable length of the chain. The positively electrified atoms
will cling to the negative electrode, and after a time, depend
ing upon the number of free atoms, the distance between them,
and their mutual attractions, the chain will resume its original
molecular condition. This time may vary slightly from atom
to atom. Let us, however, for the sake of clearness, suppose

               Transmission of Electric Disturbances.         133
that the atoms recombine simultaneously after a time T.
Then, when the atoms have recombined as far as possible,
since there are a certain number, say N, of positively electrified
atoms sticking to the negative electrode, there must be N
negative atoms left free : in order that the discharge should
travel with the velocity V, these N negative atoms must be
situated along the line of discharge at a distance VT from the
negative electrode. Hence if we suppose that the molecules
along a length VT of the Grotthus chain were split up before
discharge commenced, the free negative atoms would appear
at the end of this chain, and the discharge would travel with
the velocity V; and thus, by properly choosing the length of
the chain, we can make the velocity what we please.
   The N free atoms at the end of the chain would act as a
new negative electrode, and other Grotthus chains of length
VT would decompose at the end of this, and so on. The dis
charge would thus be broken up into a series of separate
currents, each of length VT ; and in this way the discharge
through each element would be able to satisfy the condition
imposed on it by the surrounding dielectric and travel with
the velocity of light.
   According to our view, this breaking-up of the current into
a series of separate pieces shows itself in the stratifications
observed when the discharge passes through a gas at low pres
sure. The behaviour of a striated discharge in a magnetic
field seems almost to prove that it is made up of a series of
separate discharges. For " if a magnet be applied to a striated
column, it will be found that the column is not simply thrown
up or down as a whole, as would be the case if the discharge
passed in direct lines from terminal to terminal, threading the
striae in its passage. On the contrary, each stria is subjected
to a rotation or deformation of exactly the same character as
would be caused if the stria marked the termination of flexible
currents radiating from the bright head of the stria behind it,
and terminating in the hazy inner surface of the stria in ques
tion. An examination of several cases has led the authors of
this paper to conclude that the currents do thus radiate from
the bright head of a stria to the inner surface of the next, and
that there is no direct passage from one terminal of the tube
to the other." (Spottiswoode and Moulton, Phil. Trans. 1879,
part i. p. 205.)
   Goldstein, and Spottiswoode and Moulton, from the study of
the behaviour of the striated discharge, have independently
arrived at the conclusion that each stria represents a separate
discharge. Thus Goldstein (Phil. Mag. [5] x. p.183) says:—
" By numerous comparisons, and taking account of all appa

 134          Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Velocity of
rently essential phenomena, I have been led to the following
view :—
  " The kathode-light, each bundle of secondary negative light,
as well as each layer of positive light, represent each a sepa
rate current by itself, which begins at the part of each structure
turned towards the kathode, and ends at the end of the nega
tive rays or of the stratified structure, without the current
flowing in one structure propagating itself into the next,
without the electricity which flows through one also traversing
the rest in order.
   " I suspect, then, that as many new points of departure of
the discharge are present in a length of gas between two elec
trodes as this shows of secondary negative bundles or layers—
that as, according to experiments repeatedly mentioned, all
the properties and actions of the discharge at the kathode are
found again at the secondary negative light and with each
layer of positive light, the intimate action is the same with
these as it is with those."
   Spottiswoode and Moulton (Phil. Trans, parti. 1879, p. 201)
express much the same opinion :—" If, then, we are right in
supposing that the series of artificially produced hollow shells
are analogous in their structures to striae, it is not difficult to
deduce from the explanation above given the modus operandi
of an ordinary striated discharge. The passage of each of the
intermittent pulses from the bright surface of a stria towards
the hollow surface of the next may well be supposed, from its
inductive action, to drive from the next stria a similar pulse,
which in its turn drives one from the next stria, and so on.
Thus the procession in the naturally and artificially striated
columns are precisely similar ; save that in the case of the
latter the pulses from the several striae are excited by induc
tion from without the tube, while in the case of the former
the induction is that of the discharge itself in its passage from
stria to stria. The passage of the discharge is due in both
cases to an action consisting of an independent discharge
from one stria to the next ; and the idea of this action can
perhaps bo best illustrated by that of a line of boys crossing a
brook on stepping stones, each boy stepping on the stone
which the boy in front of him has left."
   The laws governing striation seem to be in accordance with
those which follow from the view expressed above, that the
distance between two striae is the distance passed over by light
during the time taken by the atoms split up in the chain to
recombine.
   Thus the distances between consecutive striae increase when
the pressure of the gas diminishes ; but when the pressure

               Transmission of Electric Disturbances.         135
 diminishes the mean distances between the atoms increase,
 and therefore T, the time required for recombination, will
 increase ; but as on the above view the distance between two
 striae is VT, where V is the velocity of light, the diminution of
 the pressure will cause a separation of the striae. Again, the
 distance between two striae increases as the diameter of the
 tube in which the discharge takes place increases; since in the
 wider parts of the tube we have the same number of mole
 cules split up as in the narrower, the average distance between
 the atoms will be greater in the wide part of the tube than
 in the narrow, so that the time required for recombination,
 and therefore the distance between two striae, will be greater
in the wide part of the tube than in the narrow.
    We have not the requisite data for calculating the time
required for the recombination of the atoms, but we may
perhaps suppose it is of the same order as the time required
for a particle moving with the average molecular velocity to
travel over half the average distance between the molecules :
this time for air at the pressure of 1 millim. of mercury is
about 2 x 10_u seconds, which would correspond to a distance
between the striae of 6 millimetres, which is a length quite of
the same order as the actual one.
    An interesting point arises when the electrodes are separated
by a distance less than VT. In this case the discharge cannot
be propagated from one electrode to the other with the velocity
V unless the velocity of the atoms is very much increased.
This increase in the energy which has to be communicated to
the gas to allow the spark to pass will increase the resistance
which the gas opposes to the passage of electricity along the
line joining the electrodes ; that is, it will require a greater
electromotive intensity to produce the discharge. If, how
ever, instead of taking the straight line of force between the
electrodes, we consider one of the longer curved lines, and
choose one whose length is VT, or a multiple of it, then along
this line a Grotthus chain could be formed, which would convey
the discharge with the velocity V; and since in this case it is
not necessary to increase the velocity of the atoms in order
to attain the requisite velocity of propagation, the resistance
opposed by the curvilinear path per unit length will be less
than that offered by the straight path. Thus, when the elec
trodes are separated by a shorter distance than VT, the shortest
distance between them need not be the path of least resistance,
and we might expect to find the discharge taking place along
curvilinear paths of such length as would enable the discharge
to travel at a rate V without increasing the kinetic energy
of the molecules.

 136          Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Velocity of
    Very striking examples of this effect have heen given hy
Hittorf and others. Hittorf (Wied. Ann. xxi. p. 90) describes
an experiment in which when the electrodes were very near
together the discharge passed along a curved path of very
much greater length, leaving the short space between the
electrodes free from glow. In Lehmann's Molekularphymk,
vol. ii., many illustrations of the discharge between electrodes
very near together are given. Some of these are very re
markable, the space immediately between the electrodes being
free from glow, while the discharge when the electrodes
are plane passes between the faces of the electrodes which are
most remote from each other.
   The view we have taken of the electric discharge requires
the molecules to be split up for a finite distance along the
line of force: the electromotive intensity has to maintain over
this length the value required to split up the molecules ;
thus, if the field of force is not uniform, it will require a
greater electromotive intensity at the surface of the electrode
to produce a spark than if the field were uniform. However,
at ordinary pressures VT is so small that it would be very
difficult to produce a sufficiently rapid variation of the field
to make this effect felt.
   The striations on this view of the electric discharge may be
regarded as forming little electrolytic cells, the beginning
and end of a stria corresponding to the electrodes of the cell.
Let us consider one of these cells. Suppose the unit of
electricity passes through it, then the work done by the elec
tric field is FX, if F is the electromotive intensity, and X the
length of the stria. The passage of this unit of electricity
will be accompanied by definite chemical changes in the
space between two striations. Let v> be the increase in the
potential energy due to these changes, then, if there is no
increase in the kinetic energy of the gas, we must have
                             FX =.10.
   Thus, when the chemical change is the same, the electro
motive intensity varies inversely as the distance between two
striae. Thus, if we can diminish in any way the distance be
tween the striae without altering the chemical action, the
electromotive intensity required to force electricity through
the gas will be increased. If we have gas at the same
Eressure in tubes of different diameter, after the exhaustion
  as passed a certain point, the distance between the striae will
he greater in the wide tubes than in the narrow ones, so that
the resistance offered to the discharge ought to be greater
in the narrow tubes than in the wide ones. Hittorf (Wied.

             Transmission of Electric Disturbances.          137
Ann, xxi. p. 90) has observed this effect to a very striking
extent: at a pressure of -03 centim. of mercnry it took 1100
elements of his battery to force the discharge through a tube
1 centim. in diameter, while 300 elements were sufficient to
force it between similar electrodes in a tube 11 centim. in
diameter.
   In the structure round the negative electrode, consisting
of the glow over the electrode, Crookes' dark space, and the
negative glow, which, according to our view, is only a stria
differing from other striae merely by the special arrangement
of the lines of force near the electrode, the chemical and other
changes produced by the discharge seem to be more compli
cated than those which take place in the rest of the field : one
obvious reason for this is the presence of the metal, which
makes many chemical changes possible which could not take
place in striae where nothing but gas is present. This stria is
thus under special conditions, and may differ in size, fall of
potential, Ac. from the remaining striae.
   Hittorf 's experiments show that there is an exceptionally
large change in potential close to the kathode. If we take the
preceding view of the spark-discharge this will explain the very
striking increase in the electromotive intensity necessary to
produce a spark across a layer of air when the thickness of
the layer is diminished beyond a certain amount. For let
us consider the case when the spark passes between two
infinite parallel planes ; the discharge, according to the view
enunciated above, goes first across the stria next the nega
tive electrode, where the rise in potential is K, and then
across a number of other striae, the rise of potential across
each stria being w ; thus if n be the number of such striae,
V the difference of potential between the plates when the
spark passes,
                           V = K + nw.
If I is the distance between the plates, A<> the length of the
stria next the kathode, X the length of the other striae, then
                           v-(x-£«)+i»              .  -  -  (1)
This may be written
                           Y=K' + «l.
On this view the curve representing the relation between
difference of potential and spark-length is a straight line not

  138        Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Velocity of
 passing through the origin. The curve given by Paschen
  (Wied. Ann. xxxvii. p. 69) for the relation between spark-
 length and potential when the electrodes were spheres
 1 centim. in radius is very nearly straight, and would corre
 spond to the above formula if K' were between 600 and
 700 volts.
    If R is the electromotive intensity required to produce a
 spark of length I, we see from the above since R= V// that
                           R=T+«.
 Thus the electromotive intensity required to produce a spark
 increases as the spark-length diminishes ; in other words, the
 electric strength of a thin layer is greater than that of a
 thick one.
    The curve on this hypothesis representing the relation
 between the electromotive intensity and the spark-length is a
 rectangular hyperbola ; the curves given by Dr. Liebig (Phil.
 Mag. [5] xxiv. p. 106) for air, hydrogen, carbonic acid, and
 coal-gas seem to approximate to hyperbolas.
    The distance between the striae is proportional to the time
 taken by the atoms in the Grotthus chain to recombine ; this
 time will be greater the greater the distance between the
 atoms ; if we assume that it is proportional to the distance
 travelled by an atom between two collisions, the distance
 between the strise will be proportional to the mean free path,
 and therefore inversely proportional to the density: thus we
 may write in equation (1) \=/3/p, where p is the density of
the gas. With this substitution equation (1) becomes
                         V=K'+^                             (2)
   Paschen's observations on the electric strength of air,
hydrogen, and carbonic acid at various pressures seem fairly
accordant with this formula ; they show, however, that K' is
not quite independent of the density but increases slowly
with it. ]f we are dealing with sparks so long that the
second term on the right-hand side of equation (2) is large
compared with the first, then the spark-potential for the same
gas depends only upon the product Ip. Paschen's experi
ments seem to show that this law holds with great accuracy ;
it would, however, be interesting to have experiments with
smaller values for Ip than those used by him.
   In the preceding equations we have supposed the field to
be uniform and the striae of the same length ; if the field is

            Transmission of Electric Disturbances.              139
variable the striae may be of slightly different lengths, and
(2) will only be approximately true ; the accurate equation
will be
   According to this view the discharge takes place when
the value of the potential difference has the value given
by either (1) or (2) and not when the maximum electro
motive intensity has a certain value. Dr. Schuster's reduction
of Bail1e's and Paschen's experiments shows that the maxi
mum electromotive intensity when the spark passes is by no
means constant.
   If by the combination of the atoms at the end of a stria
sufficient heat is produced to dissociate the adjacent gas without
the aid of the electric field, the gas dissociated will, as the ex
periments I described in the Philosophical Magazine for April
and May 1890 prove, be able to conduct the electricity, even
though the potential difference is very small. We should
then have a region in the gas where the potential charges are
small compared with those in other parts of the gas : the
dark space between the negative glow and the positive column
seems to be such a region, and it is situated near to the
negative glow, the hottest part of the field.
   When the dimensions of the electrodes are not large com
pared with the sparking-distance, the connexion between the
sparking-distance and the difference of potential is not linear.
The experiments of De La Rue, Hugo Miiller, and Freiberg
have shown that with pointed electrodes, or small spheres,
the sparking-distance for the same difference of potential is
greater than with larger electrodes. This is what we should
expect from the preceding considerations, for according to
them when the spark passes from the negative electrode the
             9\
 distribution of potential must be represented by the straight
 line AB, where the abscissae represent the distance from the

140                Messrs. Robson and Smith on the
electrode, and the ordinates the excess of potential over that
of the negative electrode.
   A spark will pass when the curve representing the potential
before discharge cuts the curve AB. When the field is
uniform the potential curve before discharge is a straight line
passing through the origin, and if OF represent the distance
between the electrodes OB will be the position of the potential
curve before discharge when it first intersects AB; in this case
FB is the potential necessary for discharge, and the relation
between it and the sparking-distance is represented by
equation (2). When, however, the electrodes are small the
electric field is very far from uniform ; there are great changes
in the value of the potential near the electrodes, but at some
distance from them the potential changes very slowly. The
 potential curve before discharge in this ca.se will be somewhat
of the form OCDE, and we see from the figure that this may
intersect the line A B (when a spark will pass) when the
 difference of potential between the electrodes FE is less than
 FB, the difference when the field is uniform. We see in
 this way that the sparking-distance will be greater for small
 electrodes than for large ones, and will increase more rapidly
 with the difference of potential. We notice, too, that in
 this case the maximum electromotive intensity is greater than
in a uniform field.
XIII. On the Diurnal Variation of the Magnet at Kero. By
   W. G. Robson and S. W. J. Smith, of the Normal School
   of Science and Royal School of Mines*.
rpHE multiplication of magnetic observatories makes it
 A extremely desirable that the methods of reducing the
observations should be as similar as possible. It is, however,
practically impossible that all observatories should determine
the diurnal variations of the elements by the elaborate
method in use at Greenwich, which, in the case of any one
element, necessitates the measurement of the hourly ordinates
of the curves at 24 points on all but a very few days of the
year under discussion.
   Dr. Wild (Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1885, p. 78) advocates the
determination of the mean diurnal range from measurements
on the comparatively small number of days of very small
disturbance, and points out that the inclusion of disturbed
     * Communicated by the Physical Society: read June 6, 1890.

            Diurnal Variation of the Magnet at Kew.        141
days will affect the form of the curve of diurnal range unless
the disturbances themselves occur indifferently at all hours
of the day and night.
   Mr. Whipple, the Superintendent of the Kew Observatory,
made a comparison of the methods of Wild and Sabine, and
that in use at Greenwich for the years 1870-71-72 (Rep.
Brit. Assoc. 1886, p. 71).
   His general conclusion was that the difference between the
Kew results, as treated by the two methods of Sabine and
Wild, was less than the difference between the Greenwich
and Kew results in either case.
   The range of the differences is given below : —
                  Mean of three years 1870-72.
                                     Range of Differences.
                                       -0'-3 to +0'-4
       Greenwich and Kuw (Sabine)...   -0'-6 to +0 -6
       Greenwich and Kew (Wild) ...    -0'-9 to +0'-7
   It would have been interesting if similar comparisons could
have been carried out for more recent years ; but the fact
that the Kew magnetic year has not been identical with that
used at Greenwich has made such a comparison impossible.
The Kew magnetic year has hitherto been from October to
 October, to admit of the observations being included in the
Annual Report made by the Committee to the Royal Society.
We understand that in future the civil year will be adopted.
   Besides this, some of the Kew results have been obtained
 not by measuring the hourly ordinates, but by drawing free
hand a mean curve among the superposed traces of " quiet
day" curves.
    It was therefore determined to make some further com
 parison of the different methods of reduction, and at the
 request of Professor Riicker we have determined the diurnal
 variation of the declination at Kew for three recent civil
 years.
   The years selected were 1883, a year of maximum sun-
 spots, 1886, and 1887. The mean diurnal range for each
 year was found by Wild's method—the hourly ordinates for
 about five quiet days in each month being measured.
    The results we obtained have been compared with the

Observatory (see Table I.). Thus for the total range for each
year at Kew and Greenwich we have the following :—

            1887                  7- '4              6'-9
    It is noteworthy that the total range at Kew determined
 from quiet days is greater than that at Greenwich determined
 from all days except those of great disturbance. If we may
 argue from so small a comparison this indicates that storms
 on the whole diminish instead of increasing the diurnal ex
 cursions of the needle. The total range is also apparently
 decreasing yearly.
    The range of differences of the corresponding mean hourly
 values is :—

     There is thus in 1883 a difference of l'-5 in a range of 9'—
  the percentage being 16-7. For 1886 the difference is l'-8
  in a range of 7'-6—or 23-7 per cent. ; while for 1887 the
  ditference is l'-9 in a range of 7'-4, or 25-7 per cent.
     Table II. shows the differences of the hourly readings for
  the three years just determined, together with the dif
  ferences for the years 1870, 1871, and 1872, as determined by
  Mr. Whipple (Rep. Brit. Assoc. loc. cit.\ The mean of these
  hourly differences for the six years has been taken (see
  Table II.). It is noticeable that there is considerable uni
  formity in the nature of the differences between the mean
  hourly readings for Greenwich and Kew respectively. Thus,
  for each year, the Greenwich mean curve falls below that
  obtained from the Kew magnetograph at about 7 p.m., and

144 Diurnal Variation of the Magnet at Kew.
                 On the Villari Critical Point of Iron.         145
remains below it until about 4 a.m., from which hour it is above
the Kew curve until it crosses it at about 7 P.m. The
minimum ordinate for each curve for each year occurs at
about 8 a.m., and the maximum at 1 P.m. The declination
has its mean value between 10 a.m. and 11 A.m., and again
at between 6 P.m. and 7 P.m. Precisely the same features
are to be noticed in the tables given by Mr. Whipple for the
years 1870, 1871, and 1872 (Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1886, p. 74); so
that it may fairly be assumed that the general nature of the
difference between the Greenwich and Kew mean curves
from 1870 to 1887 is the same.
   The general similarity of the differences is shown clearly
by the accompanying curves—the abscissae of which repre
sent hours, while the ordi nates give the mean differences
between the Greenwich and Kew readings at these hours.
The first set are plotted from the data given in Mr. Whipple's
paper. The second set are from the data which we have
obtained for the years 1883, 1880, and 1887. The lowest
represents the mean of the six curves.
   The individual readings do not differ from the correspond
ing mean to an extent greater than 0,-4. It would therefore
seem possible, knowing one set of values for any particular
year—Greenwich or Kew—to determine the other set, correct
to within four tenths of a minute. As the Kew results are
published earlier than the Greenwich ones, it would be
possibly to calculate approximately the latter from the former.
XIV. The Effect of Change of Temperature on the Villari
    Critical Point ofIron *. By Herbert Tomlinson, F.R.S.\
                           [Plates m. & IV.]
THIS paper must be regarded as a continuation of one
        previously communicated to the Physical Society J on
the Villari Critical Points of Nickel and Iron. As before,
only the temporary magnetization was studied, and the mode
of conducting the observations was also the same with the
addition that the effect of loading was tested not only at the
temperature of the room but also at various temperatures ex
tending to 285° C. The temperature was ascertained from
the resistance of a coil of platinum wire wound double and
embracing the same part of the iron wire as the secondary

146          Mr. H. Tomlinson on the Effect of Change of
coil ; the temperature-coefficients of the platinum coil had
previously been very carefully determined*. The iron wire
used was 1 millim. in diameter; it had been thoroughly
annealed, and the loads employed were not sufficient, even at
the highest temperature, to produce any very sensible per
manent extension. As a preliminary the wire was heated
to 300° C, tested with all the loads and magnetizing
forces to be presently mentioned, and again tested when
cooled to the temperature of the room. This treatment was
repeated several times until constant results were obtained at
both temperatures ; the observations recorded in figs. I.-VI.
were then made. In these figures the abscissae represent the
number of kilogrammes in the load and the ordinates the per
centage alteration of permeability at the temperature indicated
on each curve, + signifying increase and - decrease of per
meability. The Villari critical point is the value of the
magnetizing force for which loading does not affect the per
meability and may be ascertained by noting the point at which
each curve cuts the line of loads ; it varies with the value
of the load and with the temperature. In some instances the
curves cut the line of loads twice, and there are consequently
two loads which for the magnetizing forces pertaining to the
curves have no effect on the temporary magnetization. In
the following table is given the load (or loads if there are
two) which for each particular magnetizing force and tem
perature is without effect on the permeability.

           Temperature on the Villari Critical Point of Iron.            147
      It will be seen from Table I. and from tigs. I.-IV. that the
  magnetizing forces 2-84, 3-70, 4'83, and of course all inter
  mediate forces, are Villari critical values. If we regard only
  the first point where each curve cuts the line of loads, we see
  that at all temperatures the Villari value increases as the load
 decreases and, for a given load, increases with the temperature.
  If, on the contrary, we consider the second point of cutting
 the line of load, we find the critical value increases both with the
 load and with the temperature*.
     It will be seen from fig. I. that as the temperature rises the
 two points of cutting the load-line creep nearer and nearer
 together until for a temperature a little below 285° C. they
 coincide, and the curve osculates the load-line ; whilst for
 285° C. and for higher temperatures the magnetizing force
 2-84 ceases to be a Villari point for any load. When the
 magnetizing force reaches the value 7-69 (fig. IV.) both points
 of cutting the load-line vanish, at any rate when the loading
 is not carried beyond 12 kilos t, and for magnetizing forces
 beyond 7-69 (figs. V.-VI.) Villari critical values become
impossible.
     In all cases rise of temperature increases the alteration of
 the permeability in the positive direction and diminishes it in
 the negative direction ; but the diminution in the latter case
 is greater than the increment in the former, so that the
summits of the two bends in the curves become more and
 more nearly on the same level.
     The percentage alteration of permeability was calculated as
follows :—
     If P0 and P„ represent the permeability with no load and a
load of n kilogrammes respectively, the percentage alteration
                     100 (Pn-Pn)         100 (P0-P„)
                          For                  -p         >
                            o                  ro
according as the loading produces increase or decrease of
permeability. Table II. gives the values of P0 for the various
magnetizing forces.
    • The effect of change of temperature on the critical value is there
fore in the same direction for both points of cutting the line of loads, t. e.
in both cases the Villari value is increased by rise of temperature.
    t The second point could, however, be probably reached by taking the
load to higher value*.

 XV. Electrifcation of Air by Water-Jet. By Magnus
    Maclean, M.A., F.R.S.E., and Makita Goto (Japan)*.
SIR WILLIAM THOMSON, experimenting in the rooms
        of the Old College, Glasgow, found that electrified air
could pass through narrow passages, and he suggested to us
to try whether electrified air can pass through a metal tube
from one room to another. For this purpose a small room
adjoining the Natural Philosophy Class-room of Glasgow
University was used. In this room a Thomson quadrant
 electrometer, whose sensibility was 95 divisions of the scale,
per 1 volt difference of potential, and a spirit-lamp supported
 on an insulating stand and connected to the electrometer,
 were fitted up. Through the handle-hole of the door sepa
 rating the small room from the class-room, a metal tube
 60 centim. long and 1 centim. in diameter and connected
 to a gas-pipe by a wire was passed. In the fireplace of the
 small room a small fire was kept burning to produce draught
 from the class-room to this room. The class-room was elec
 trified by a spirit-lamp connected to one of the conductors
 of a large 24-plates electrical machine of Wimshurst type.
 By this arrangement we could observe any variation of elec
 trification in the small room due to the passage of electricity
 from the class-room to it. We believe electrified air passed
 through the tube, but the effect was masked by the draughts

through the chinks, though we took care to close all chinks
in the door by cotton-wool. Also, if the electrifying lamp
connected to thie electrical machine were placed nearer than
3 feet from the door between the two rooms, inductive effect
was felt in the small room.
   We therefore adopted an arrangement shown in fig. 1. AA
is a large sheet-iron vat 123 centim. in diameter and 70
                                Fig. 1.
            To etactromeber
centim. in height inverted on a large tray BB. By filling
 the tray with water the air is confined in the vat. The jet-
 tube of a water-dropper C passes through the centre of the
 top of the vat. The water-dropper was fixed in its position
 by a piece of ebonite and melted paraffin poured round it, so
 that it is insulated from the vat, which is always kept con
 nected to water-pipe for earth. By connecting the tube D to
 an aspirator the air inside the vat could be replaced by the air
 of the room through the tube E, which is a metallic tube or a
 glass tube coated with paraffin both inside and outside of the
 tube, and filled with cotton-wool. By this arrangement we
 could easily make electrified air pass through the metal tube,
 but with the cotton-wool tube the results were discordant,
 therefore we are not yet in a position to say anything definite.
    While these experiments were proceeding we came unex
 pectedly on an interesting result. It was found that the
 potential inside the vat, as shown by the water-dropper on the
 top of the vat, and connected to the electrometer, was always
 about \ volt positive at the beginning, and gradually changed
 towards negative till 5 volts negative was reached in about half

150         Messrs. Maclean and Makita Goto on the
an hour. To make it sure we made more than 15 observa
tions under different conditions, but always with the same
result, and we came to the conclusion that the water rushing
 through the air electrifies it negatively, at least it does
so electrify common air full of dust. This result is in
accordance with the well-known change of atmospheric
electricity to negative during rainy weather.
   The following are the results which prove our conclusion :—
   (1) After negatively electrifying the air inside the vat by
making water drop through it for some time, if it is replaced
by the air outside of the vat, the electrometer-reading comes
down towards zero.
   (2) Simultaneous observations of the electrification of the
air inside the vat by the same means and of the air in the
room were made. After about 13 minutes the former ex
ceeded the latter, though at that time the air of the room was
being electrified negatively by the paraffin lamp used in
reading the scale.
   (<J) After starting the water-dropper and taking the elec
trometer-readings for some time, say 10 minutes, if it is stopped
say for 10 minutes and again started, the initial reading is
the same as that just before the interval of stopping, and
it again continues to go up.
   (4) Whether the water-dropper was insulated or connected
to water-pipe by a wire, by connecting it to the electrometer
for taking the reading it shows that the negative electrifica
tion of the air inside the vat goes on increasing for about half
an hour.
   (5) No difference in the result was found after painting
the inside of the vat. Before painting it presented the sur
face of rusted iron.
   (6) Whether the vat is filled with air electrified positively
or negatively before the observation, the electrometer-reading
equally goes towards the negative side.
   (7) The maximum potential obtained was 5^ volts negative,
but the more the air became free of dust the less became the
maximum reached. This is shown by the curves in fig. 2.
The curve No. 1 was obtained by observation after filling the
vat with the air of the room, the curve No. 5 was obtained
after continuous running of the aspirator for about 25 hours.
Intermediate curves correspond to the intermediate state of
the air as to its purity. In the curve No. 2 the water-
dropper was running for some time before beginning the
observation.
   (8) After putting water into the water-dropper and wait

               Electrification of Air by Water-Jet.         151
ing as usual till the water-dropper comes to equilibrium, the
initial reading is always about £ volt positive. This we are
inclined to regard as due to the electrification of water itself
and not to the potential due to the internal arrangement.
This initial reading also increases little by little as the air
becomes more purified.
                                Fig. 2.
   In the course of these experiments we have observed the
following phenomena, which may be of some interest : —
   (1) If the air of the room is very highly electrified, con
tinuous sparks can be drawn from any insulated conductors
by presenting finger.
   (2) Electrified flame is attracted or repulsed as any other
electrified body. Flame electrified by the large electrical
machine before mentioned takes different shapes according to
the position with respect to other conducting bodies cither

          XVI. An Electromagnetic Theory of Quartz.
                By A. B. Basset, M.A., F.R.S.*
1. f I ^HE rotation of the plane of polarization of light by a
     X.    magnetic field, although presenting several features
in common with the rotation of the plane of polarization by
syrup or quartz, is a phenomenon of a totally distinct cha
racter, which depends upon the existence of an external
magnetic force, and disappears as soon as the magnetic force
is removed. A theory of magnetic rotation is given by Max
well t, and some extensions have been made by Fitzgerald % ;
but it is, I think, pretty obvious that Maxwell's theory will
 not apply to syrup or quartz ; for the additional terms consist
 of the products of the magnetic force and the differential
 coefficients of the displacements, and are therefore terms of
 the second order when the magnetic force is produced by
 optical and not by external causes.
    On the other hand, rotations produced by syrup and quartz
 appear to be phenomena of an essentially similar character,
 and therefore a theory which explains one ought to explain
 the other ; and the object of the present paper is to endeavour
 to show how the electromagnetic theory may be extended so
 as to account for these phenomena.
    2. Let us conceive a medium which possesses three rectan
 gular planes of symmetry, and which produces rotatory pola
 rization when a plane wave of polarized light travels through
 the medium parallel to any one of the axes of symmetry, and
 elliptic polarization when the wave travels through in any
 other direction, the values of the rotation per unit of length
 being different for each of the three axes. The physical pro
 perties of the medium, so far as rotatory polarization is con
 cerned, will be specified by three constants, pv p2, p3, which
 depend upon the amount of rotation produced when the direc
 tion of propagation is parallel to any of the three axes. In
 an isotropic medium the three »'s will be equal, since the
 rotation is independent of the direction of the wave ; whilst
 in quartz two of the p's, must be zero, since no rotation will

be produced when the direction of propagation is perpendi
cular to the axis. Now in the ordinary theory of double
refraction, as developed by Maxwell, the electromotive force
is connected with the electric displacement by the three equa
tions
           P = 47r//K1, Q = 47r<7/K2, R=47r/i/K3,
where Kj, K3, K3 are the three principal specific inductive
capacities. We shall now show that in a crystalline medium,
such as has been described above, rotatory polarization may
be accounted for by assuming that
                   F=i7r//Kl+p3a-p2hA
                   Q=47T0/K2+p1A-jpJ/,>                      (1)
                   R = iirh/K3 + pj~ptf, )
where pi. p2, p3 are constants.
    This assumption supposes that when electromotive force
acts upon the medium, it produces electric displacement in a
 direction perpendicular to itself ; and that the force depends
 not only upon the actual displacement, but also upon the rate
 at which it is taking place.
    The equations of electromotive force in terms of the electro
 magnetic momentum are
                   Y=-¥-d^jdx,\
                   Q=-G-dir/dA                                (2)

   Equations (10) are the equations of electric displacement
in a doubly refracting medium which exhibits rotatory polari
zation. The first two terms on the right-hand side produce
double refraction, and the last terms produce rotatory polari
zation. These last terms are quantities in the nature of
angular velocities, and are analogous to the components of
molecular rotation in Hydrodynamics ; one of the results of
our hypothesis therefore is, that something in the nature of
vortex motion takes place in a medium which exhibits rota
tory polarization.

   4. We shall now briefly consider the propagation of light
in an isotropic medium. In this case Pi=Pi-p2, A = B = C.
If therefore the axis of z is the direction of propagation, h=Q,

 where L and M are complex constants, t is the period of the
 particular light considered, and V is the velocity of propaga
 tion in the medium.
    Substituting in (12), we obtain
                    (V2-A2)L +2t7rpM/r=0,
                    (V-A2)M-2t7rpL/T=0;

 shall obtain in real quantities,

whence, if ^ be the angle through which the plane of polari
zation is rotated after the wave has passed through a length
z of the medium,
Substituting the values of Vu V2 from (14), we obtain

 to a first approximation, where X is the wave-length in the
 medium.
    This result is in accordance with the law which was experi
 mentally deduced by Biot, viz. that the rotation is directly
proportional to the thickness of the length of the medium tra
 versed by the wave, and inversely proportional to the wave-length
 of the particular light employed.
    5. We must now consider the theory of quartz. Taking
 the axis of the quartz as the axis of z, we must put A = B,
p1=p2 = 0, whence writing/* for p3, (10) become

    We have already pointed out that if a plane wave be
 travelling perpendicularly to the axis, no rotation is pro
 duced. Now if the wave is travelling parallel to the axis of
 x, we must have /=0, whilst g and h are functions of xand t
 alone ; when this is the case we see from (16) that the
 rotatory terms vanish, as ought to be the case. Similarly
 we see that the rotatory terms vanish when the wave is

                Electromagnetic Theory of Quartz.               157
travelling parallel to the axis of y. Our equations thus far
represent observed facts.
   Since everything is symmetrical about the axis, we may
without loss of generality assume that the axis of y is parallel
to the wave-front, and we may therefore put
                     /=SX, p = Sfi,      h=Sv,
                           it*
where I, n are the direction-cosines of the wave-front, X, fi, v
are those of the direction of displacement, and r is the period.
   Substituting in (16) we obtain
           (Vs- A2n2)X + C2lnv + (2nrp/T)n,(i.=0,
           (V2-A>- (2nrp/r)\=Q,
           (V,-C2P)v + A!/n\-(2t7r/)/T) lnfi=0 ;
whence eliminating X, /*, v and putting 6 for the angle which
the normal to the wave-front makes with the axis, we obtain
(V2-A2)(V2-A2cos2^-C2sin2^) = (4-7r2p7ri)cos2(9, . (17)
which determines the velocity of propagation of waves of
period t. Putting 0=0, we get
                       V2 = A2±2?T/?/t                         (18)
 which gives the values of V when the wave is travelling in
the direction of the axis. In this case equations (16) reduce
to (12), so that the rotation of the plane of polarization is
given by (15).
    6. The elastic solid theory of double refraction which was
 proposed by Green is, I believe, universally admitted at the
present time to be unsatisfactory ; and accordingly during
recent years numerous theories have been proposed, which
attempt to explain optical phenomena by a quasi-elastic solid
theory, based upon assumptions respecting the mutual re
 action of aether and matter ; and it will therefore be instructive
 to ascertain whether the terms by which we have endeavoured
 to explain rotatory polarization on the electromagnetic theory,
 will also explain this phenomenon on the quasi-elastic solid
 theory.
    The fundamental idea of all such theories is, that the statical
 properties of the fflther in transparent media are the same as
in vacuo, but that the motion of the aether is modified by the
presence of ponderable matter, the effect of which may be
represented by forces X, Y, Z ; and phenomena such as
double refraction, rotatory polarization and the like, are

 158                    Mr. A. B. Basset on an
 explained by making certain assumptions regarding the form
 of these forces.
    The particular theorj' of this kind which I shall now con
 sider, and which on the whole is perhaps the most satisfactory,
 is the theory of Lord Rayleigh* as modified by Sir W.
 Thomson f, and which consists in supposing that double re
fraction may be explained by assuming that A, Y, Z are equal
to —p1u, —piV, -p3io, and that the velocity of propagation of
the pressural wave is so small that it may be treated as zero
without sensible error. This theory, so far as double re
 fraction is concerned, has been fully worked out by Glaze-
 brook J, and has been applied by him §, and also by myself //
to investigate the intensities of the reflected and refracted
 waves, when the reflecting medium is a doubly-refracting
 crystal. In order to deduce a theory of doubly-refracting media
 which exhibit rotatory polarization, we shall assume that the
effect of the peculiar molecular structure of such media is to
introduce into the expressions for the forces the additional
terms which are given by the last three terms of (10) ; so
that our equations of motion are:—
 , , .<?m            ,dB . _, , d /dv             div\
 (P+Pi) W> = ~n'^ +n^u+ ^ (jz -

where u, v, w are the displacements, and p and n are the
density and rigidity of the aether in vacuo.
    When the medium is isotropic, pi=p2=pi - pi=pi=p3 - if
therefore the axis of z is taken as the direction of propagation,
it and v will be functions of z and < alone, and w will be zero,

   Electromagnetic Styli, in Clironographic Measurements. By

WHILE working with the chronograph, a description of
         which appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for
 May, I have introduced a method of taking time-traces, by
 which instrumental error is greatly reduced, when styli are
 used which differ in their " latencies." It is as follows :—Two

traces are made, but the order in which the styli are used is
reversed by a pole-changer in the second trace ; by means of
this interchange of styli the latencies are cut out.

XVIII. Note* on Secondary Batteries. By J. H. Gladstone,
           Ph.D., F.R.S., and W. Hibbert, F.I.C
EIGHT years ago, one of us, in conjunction with the late
        Mr. Tribe, published a series of papers on the Chemistry
of Secondary Batteries f. Since that time accumulators have
undergone many improvements in detail, but they still present
some unsolved problems of a more or less subtle character.
In this paper we give an account of some experiments under
taken to test points which have arisen in the last few years.
                    Action of Sodium Sulphate.
   In May 1889 Mr. Preece delivered a lecture at the Society
of Arts dealing generally with his experience of Secondary
Batteries Among the topics treated was the influence of
the composition of the electrolyte on the working of the cell,
and it was stated that the addition of sodium sulphate to the
acid solution was of very considerable advantage. Mr. Preece
determined the proportions of acid and sulphate which gave
the best result in a year's working, and found that a compa
ratively small quantity of the salt was sufficient to produce
the effect.
   We have determined the percentage composition of the
liquid from a sample kindly furnished by Mr. Preece, and find
it to be as follows : —
              Sodium sulphate (Na2SO4)             .    0-81
              Sulphuric acid (H2SO>) -             -  29-39
              Water                                   69-80
                                                     100-00
    The specific gravity at ordinary temperatures is about 1'23 J.
    When used in secondary batteries instead of the usual acid,
it is stated that there is less buckling of the plates and little or
no scaling. The chief benefit, however, is stated to be that
the sodium salt diminishes the chance of objectionable sulpha-
ting in the cell, and where such sulphating occurs, enables it

Macmillan.
   J In making this liquid, it would be best to add together <i8 parts
(by weight) of water, 30 of strong sulphuric acid, and 2 parts of crystal
lized sodium sulphate (Na,S04 . 10HaO).

                  Notes on Secondary Batteries.              163
to be removed by a charging current much more readily than
when sulphuric acid alone is employed.
    Mr. Preece did not explain the beneficial action of the
sodium sulphate, but in the discussion following the lecture
Sir F. Abel threw out the idea that it was " probable that a
double salt of sulphate of lead and sodium was formed which
was soluble, whereas the sulphate of lead was comparatively
insoluble."
    We have made some experiments to test the value of this
suggestion. It may be well, however, to note that lead sul
phate is so nearly insoluble in dilute sulphuric acid that com
paratively large errors are easily possible.
    We took advantage of the greater solubility of lead sulphate
 in strong acid. Measured volumes of this were added to water,
 the precipitate formed allowed to settle, and the lead salt
 remaining in solution determined by precipitation as sulphide.
    The mean results are :— 1 part of lead sulphate dissolves
 in 105,000 parts of the acid mixed with water, in 90,000
 parts of a similarly diluted acid containing 5 per cent, sodium
 sulphate, and in 107,000 parts of Mr. Preece's solution.
     As these numbers deal with such minute quantities we lay no
 stress on their absolute value. Their relative values are more
 useful, and evidently the addition of the sodium salt has not
 materially increased the solubility of lead sulphate.
     This conclusion was confirmed by experiments of another
 type. To equal quantities of a dilute acid and a similar acid
 containing sodium sulphate we added a few drops of strong
 acid saturated with lead sulphate. Precipitates were formed
 in both cases, but it was possible so to adjust the number of
  drops that the precipitate did not appear for an appreciable
  time. We could therefore see in which it appeared first. In
  many experiments and many variations of procedure, we nearly
  always obtained earlier precipitation in liquids containing
  sodium or magnesium sulphates than in those consisting
  simply of dilute acid. We judge therefore that lead sulphate
  is not more soluble in these liquids, and that the explanation
  of the action of sodium sulphate must be sought in some other
  direction.
      Mr. Swinburne has suggested that, as lead sulphate is dis
  solved by sodium hydrate, the action may be due to that
  hydrate being produced by electrolysis of the sodium sulphate.
   Experiment showed that in a simple solution of neutral sul
   phate of soda, a paste made of equal parts of red lead and
   sulphate of lead was more readily reduced than in dilute sul
   phuric acid. It was also easy to detect sodium hydrate on the
   cathode by red litmus-paper. But this last result was no

 164             Messrs. Gladstone and Hibbert
longer obtained when the sodium-sulphate solution contained
 sulphuric acid in the proportion of 1 volume to 10. The acid
 present interferes with such a simple test, and we sought for
 information on the point by determining the ratio of acid to
 sulphate of soda in the pores of the spongy lead, and com
 paring it with the ratio of the same substances in the body of
the liquid. Preliminary experiments indicated the following
as the best course to pursue.
   A strip of spongy lead was used as cathode in a liquid
somewhat similar to that analysed above. The ratio was
 h so
N 2 4 = 30. A current was passed for three hours, falling
slowly from about 2 amperes to 1-5. The strip was then taken
out and placed in 120 cubic centim. of distilled water and
allowed to diffuse for 40 minutes. It was then placed in
fresh distilled water for 18 hours. The forty minutes' diffu-
sate gave a ratio of j^'^q =25, only a little lower than that
shown by the original liquid.     The 18 hours diffusate gave
a ratio-52-*^^- =11-8.     Evidently, then, the portions of the
liquid which diffused last were much richer in sodium salt
than the earlier ones.
   This would show that a large proportion of sulphate of
sodium is formed in close contact with the lead sulphate, and
we have already seen that this is favourable to the reduction
of that body.
   But there is another consideration. It is well known that
the spongy lead formed on one of the plates in a secondary
battery is to some extent acted on by the liquid.
   It occurred to us that this direct chemical action between
lead and sulphuric acid might be influenced by sodium sul
phate. We therefore placed a quantity of red lead on a sheet
of lead and reduced it electrolytically. The sheet was then
cut into small pieces and divided into two equal quantities
of about 20 grammes each. One half was put into a flask
containing 1 volume of acid to 6 of water ; the other half
was put into a similar acid with the addition of 5 per cent,
of sodium sulphate. Hydrogen gas was evolved from both
flasks at the ordinary temperature. The following Table
shows the results :—

   It is evident that the sodium sulphate exercised a protecting
influence on the lead.
   In another experiment with a solution containing as small
a proportion of sodium sulphate as that used by Mr. Preece,
the protective influence was still observable, though much less
marked.
   These results support the idea that part of the effect pro
duced by sodium sulphate lies in its power to diminish the
local actions arising between the acid and the different parts
of the plates.
   It is not unlikely that this chemical action has something
to do with the difficulty experienced in electrolytically redu
cing pure lead sulphate when that substance unmixed with
other compounds is simply immersed in dilute acid ; for at
the moment of incipient decomposition the lead must ba very
finely divided, with its affinities in their most active state.
                        Sub-sulphate of Lead.
   In a paper read before the Eoyal Society*, Dr. Frankland
doubts whether the lead sulphate formed and decomposed in
the cell is the ordinary white sulphate known to chemists, and
has studied the action of dilute acid on litharge and on minium.
From litharge he obtained a buff-coloured compound, for the
composition of which he gives the formula (SO3)3 (PbO)6.
From red lead he obtained a brownish-red compound, S2Pb3Ol0.
Dr. Frankland thinks it highly probable that one or other of
these salts takes part in the electrolytic processes of the storage
battery. He remarks, however, very truly that the working
conditions in a battery are very different from those of his
experiments.

   With reference to these results we have made some obser
vations.
   Buff-coloured body from Litharge. —The formula (S03)3
(PbO)5 can be written' 2 PbO + 3PbSO4. In other words, the
substance may either be a true sub-sulphate, or a mixture of
the ordinary sulphate and oxide of lead. When attempting
to prepare some of this compound, preliminary results sug
gested the following experiment.
   Known quantities of litharge and sulphuric acid were
digested together in a flask.
were shaken vigorously and a small quantity of the clear
liquid subtracted. The strength of the acid was carefully
determined ; and from this, together with the known volume of
acid, it was easy to find how much acid had combined with
the lead oxide. The curves given below, which are drawn
through the actual points of observation, show the course of
the action for 28 days, theordinates giving the acid absorbed,
and the abscissae the time.
   In Exp. I., 33-41 grams of litharge and 150 cubic centim.
of 1 to 5 acid were used. This liquid contained 43'38 grains
of sulphuric acid.
   In Exp. II., 39-73 grams of litharge and 150 cubic centim.
of 1 to 6 acid =36-37 grams H2SO4 were used.
   In Exp. III., 39-92 grams of litharge and 150 cubic centim.
of 1 to 10 acid =25 grains H2SO4 were used.
   The acid required for total conversion of the litharge into
sulphate would be,
                  In Exp. I. = 14-7 grams.
                  In Exp. II. = 17-45 „
                  In Exp. III. = 17-54 „
Of course only three fifths of these quantities would have been
required to form the compound (S(33)3(PbO)(j.
   The salt gradually became white in colour. It is evident
that in each case the action was slow and progressive, without
any sudden change of rate to mark the formation of a sub-salt.
   At a later date we stopped the experiments and analysed
the substances produced in Exps. I. and II.
   In I. we found 31-26 per cent, of SO,,, which indicates the
presence of 98-6 per cent. PbSO4 and 1'4 per cent, of PbO.
   In II. we found 31 -67 per cent, of SO4, which indicates 99-5
per cent. PbSO4 and 0-5 per cent, of PbO.
   The general outcome is clearly in favour of the idea that the

                      o?i Secondary Batteries.
  action Is a continuous one, which will only finish when the
  whole of the litharge is converted into sulphate. As the
  experiment proceeds there is an increasing proportion of in
  soluble sulphate present, which no doubts acts as a protective
  coat for the unchanged litharge, and thus renders the trans
  formation less rapid. We found in fact that the action was
  greatly hastened if we continually broke up the substance in
  a mortar.

                             Time in days.
    We see therefore no reason to doubt the view put forth as far
  back as January 1882, that the substance produced in the voltaic
  reaction is ordinary sulphate of lead, a substance which is

 168             Messrs. Gladstone and I^bbert
easily oxidated by means of the current, and is reduced
without serious difficulty, especially when broken up by better
conducting bodies.
                High Initial Electromotive Force.
   During the prosecution of the experiments described in the
preceding pages our attention was again drawn to the high
electromotive force which, as is well known, is found in a
secondary battery for a short time after the charging current
has been stopped. So far as we know, the explanations of
this curious phenomenon which have been hitherto given are
not looked upon as satisfactory. These explanations depend
on the presence and action of electrolytic gases, which are
either supposed to be occluded by the electrodes, or else to
form secondary products differing from the ordinary elements
in much the same way as ozone differs from oxygen.
   We thought it probable that the chief cause of the high
E.M.F. might be found in the great inequalities in the strength
of acid produced by the charging current. There is no doubt
that the acid becomes much stronger in the immediate vicinity
of the peroxide plate. The strong and weak acid thus pro
duced at the positive and negative plates respectively, being
contained in spongy masses of material, require some time to
diffuse, and the normal E.M.F. of 2 volts cannot be attained
until diffusion has produced uniformity in the strength of
the acid. We put this idea to experimental test.
   Most of the observations were made on a small experimental
cell in which were :—
   (1) a negative plate consisting of a strip of lead (1 inch x 3)
        covered with spongy lead ;
   (2) a positive plate made of similar lead covered with
       peroxide ;
   (3) an electrolyte of dilute acid containing 18'5 per cent.
        H2SO4 (=1 volume of acid to about 9 of water).
   We also provided a small porous earthenware jar filled with
stronger acid, into which we could introduce the peroxide
plate when desired.
   In the first series of experiments the plates were charged
in the uniform electrolyte by a current of nearly half an
ampere, and after breaking the battery-circuit, observations
were taken of the E.M.F. by the condenser method.

   From this Table it is evident that the rate of fall in the
various experiments is fairly uniform, and also that an
increase in the strength of the acid round the positive plate
(peroxide) is able to give a large increase in the E.M.F. of
the cell. We further see that the greater portion of the fall
in E.M.F. takes place in the first few seconds after stopping
the charging current. This we should expect if the action
depends on differences of density in acid, for these differences
will be greatest and diffusion most marked in the early stages.

cell thus arranged was charged as before, and after stopping
the charging current observations were taken of the E.M.F.
   From this Table it appears that the rate of fall is very much
slower than before. This is especially marked in Exp. III.,
where the strength of the acid in the jar is nearer the possible
maximum producible in the interstices of the spongy materials.
   It may be worth notice, that the value of the E.M.F. to
which the cells finally rise in Exps. I., II., and III. of the
first series is very nearly the same as that to which they fall
in the first two experiments of the second series. If the rise
is due, as we think, to the diffusion inwards of the stronger
acid, some such agreement might be expected.
   We therefore regard the abnormal E.M.F. as due to the
inequality of acid strength, and its gradual disappearance as
due to equalization of strength produced by diffusion.
 XIX. On Dropping-Mercury Electrodes. By J. Brown*.
IN Prof. Ostwald's Reply f he is scarcely correct in descri
      bing my paper { as a " supposed disproof of v. Helmholtz's
theory." It was perhaps unnecessary to disprove what had
not been proved. V. Helmholtz put forward an explanation
based on several unproved hypotheses. I offered what ap
peared to me a simpler and more probable theory. Prof.
Ostwald, however, goes further ; and there arises the question
whether many of the supporters of v. Helmholtz's theory
would accept Prof. Ostwald's exposition of it, or the predic
tions which he founds so easily upon it. He is, however, so
sure of his ground as to go the length of prophesying in his
fourth paragraph (p. 480) what will happen if I try a certain
experiment. Well, that experiment I had of course already
repeatedly tried before I made any assertion as to the result ;
and now, to make sure, I have repeatedly tried it again, and
 so far from the current being " much weaker " than in the
previous case, as Prof. Ostwald implies that it obviously must
 be, I am unable to detect a mean difference of one half per
 cent, between them. Any subsequent decrease of the current
 by polarization of the resting mercury is explained equally by
 either his hypothesis or that which 1 advocate, as is also the
 current referred to in the last paragraph of his reply.
    It is after all possible that the initial equality of these cur
rents (however this may affect Prof. Ostwald's view) might,
by the adoption of some further not impossible hypotheses, be
 made to agree provisionally with the view of v. Helmholtz.

It may suffice, therefore, that attention has been called to a
theory alternative to that of v. Helmholtz, and which seems,
to me at least, much simpler and more probably true.
   An undoubted knowledge of even the sign of the potential
of mercury in contact with an electrolyte would go a great
way towards settling the question at issue. According to my
view, it is probably negative. V. Helmholtz's theory is founded
on the assumption that it is positive ; but, notwithstanding
the rather decided way in which this assumption is at first
stated *, no real proof is given ; and the subsequent remark
(" wiire z. B. das Queksilber positiv" t) indicates the recognized
provisional character of the assumption. It lies with those
who would give to the provisional theory of v. Helmholtz
the character of an ascertained law of Nature to provide a
knowledge of the true value of the hypotheses on which it is
based before it can carry the weight they propose to attach to
it, or serve as a reliable support for the further researches
already dependent on it.
 XX. Problems in Probabilities : No. 2, Competitive Examina
       tions. By Professor F. Y. Edgeworth, D.C.L.%
THE following study is related to the first number of the
       series § as being another instance of the Probability-
calculus applied to a practical interest. In a paper on " The
Statistics of Examinations," which was published in the
September number of the Journal of the Royal Statistical
Society for 1888, and in a sequel to that paper which will
shortly be published in the same Journal, I have made an
estimate of the extent to which the results of competitive
examinations depend upon the accident of one examiner
rather than another equally competent being appointed to
mark the work of the candidates. Referring to those papers
for a fuller exposition of the statistical data and the practical
conclusions, 1 propose hero to abstract the mathematical
reasoning.
    The fundamental axiom is the proposition, evidenced by
analogy and specific experience, that the marks given by
different examiners to the same piece of work are apt to be
arranged according to some law of error or facility-curve
which is constant for the same class of examiners and work
examined. The analogy between errors of observation and
discrepancies in marking is evident. But, as the transition is

 rather abrupt from objective quantities observed by the senses
to dogrees of intellectual quality estimated by the judgment,
I have confirmed the analogy by trying an experiment in an
 intermediate case, where the quantity to be determined is
 objective, but the operation by which it is determined is an
 estimate rather than a simple observation. Of this sort are
 the answers which I have obtained by asking a number of
 persons separately: "What is my weight?" Having col
 lected 96 estimates made in reply to this question, I find that
 they are constant to a definite law of frequency. That law
 is exhibited in the annexed table or scheme ; in which the
 ordinary numerals denote pounds above nine stone (thus 25
 means JO st. 11 lb.), and the Roman numerals above denote
 the number of estimates which are entered in each of the
 spaces bounded by the ordinary numerals (thus there were
 four estimates below 9 st. 101b., and nineteen between that
 figure and 10 st. 61b.)*. The verification of our axiom is

shown by the lower rows of Roman numerals which respec
tively designate the distribution of the first 48 answers which
I received, and of the second batch. I add the following
verifications. Regarding as an error the deviation of any
estimate from the average of all J, namely 25, I find that the
average of the errors in defect is 7-2 ; the average of the
errors in excess is 6-8. Now split up the forty-seven errors in
defect into two batches as nearly as may be ; the average of
the first twenty-four—first in the order of arrival—is 7-5; of
the remaining twenty-three, is 6-8. So the average of the
first twenty-five errors in excess is 5'6, of the remaining
twenty-four 8.
    Even the batches of sixteen show considerable steadiness.
The following table exhibits this constancy. The first column
designates the position of each batch of sixteen in the
accidental order in which it was received and entered. Thus

   It will be observed that these estimates obey not only a law,
but the law of error ; according to which the Mean Error
ought to be equal to the Average Error x ^/~.            For further
 verification of this incident I may refer to the scheme on
 page 172, where it appears that the probable error, as deduced
 from the distribution of the observations, is 5. Now, according
 to the Tables compiled for the Error-function, the number of
 observations outside a distance on either side from the centre
 of three times the probable error ought to be 4-3 per cent.
 That is exactly what occurs. It is true that the average and
 mean error do not perfectly fit the probable error. But the
 imperfection is hardly greater than might be expected in
 dealing with a number of observations so limited as %. Nor
 would I contend for a perfect fulfilment of the law of error—
 more perfect than in the case of human statures and other

natural groups *. Indeed I am not concerned to show that the
law of error is fulfilled ; except so far as this incident may
afford some guarantee of greater stability. It is on this
account only, if at all, that I am concerned with another
striking incident, namely that the Mean of all the estimates t,
the apparent weight, 9 st. + 25 lb., coincides with the real
weight, which is exactly, or oscillates about, 10 st. 11 lb.
   A less perfect, but still I think sufficient, verification of our
axiom is afforded by another series of 9G estimates which I
obtained by asking the additional question : " What is my

height"? The grouping of the series is as before exhibited
by the first two rows of figures in the annexed scheme.
The correspondence of the parts with the whole and with
each other is shown by the third and fourth rows, referring
respectively to the first and second batches of forty- eight
estimates. The average of the thirty-five errors in defect—
measured from the average of the ninety-six observations,
 namely 8-6—is 1-73. The average of the first eighteen
errors in defect is 1-55. The average of the remaining
seventeen errors in defect is 1-9. Again, the average of
the sixty-one errors in excess is -98. The average of the
first thirty-one of those errors is 1 ; the average of the
remaining thirty is '90.
    Asin the case of the weights, the apparent {and true measures
coincide. But there does not exist that guarantee of stability
which may be afforded by conformity to a Probability-curve.
That hypothesis is negatived by the protuberance of the lower
limb which has just now been evidenced. It may be added
that, whereas the lower quartile is distant from the Median
by less than 1'o, there occur (in so small a set) three observa
tions distant respectively from the Median 5, 7, 8. This
occasional darting out of the lower limb is unfavourable to
that steadiness in the average of small batches which we
noticed in the case of the weights. The Medians of compo
nent batches are sufficiently steady §.

vitiating causes in both cases.

eighty answers which I have obtained to the question : " How
many five-pound notes are equal in weight to a sovereign?"
The grouping of these estimates is represented in the first of
the annexed schemes * ; the grouping of two component
batches by the second and third scheme. It will be seen that
there is a general resemblance between the two parts and the
whole. The displacement of the Median seems not incon
sistent with the hypothesis of a constant facility-curve. I thus
conclude, partly from a rough application of the formula which
I have cited from Laplace in the predecessor to this paper for
the error of the Median of any facility-curve t, partly by a
still rougher reasoning as to the divergency that might be
expected, if we were dealing with a genuine Probability-
curve.
    But it must be admitted that the upper extremity of the
curve defies law. The maximum of the first batch of 40 is
1500 ; the maximum of the second batch of 40 is 20,000 f.
These fluctuations are so violent that we could not expect to
determine their law of frequency without statistics more
copious than I have attained for examination marks. It
should be considered, however, that at examinations the
maximum and minimum are usually fixed, so that enormous
vibrations of the extremities are impossible. In so far as the
abnormal or incalculable element in the fluctuation of the
maximum or minimum may make itself felt, it should be held
that my estimates of the extent to which chance affects
examinations are underrated.
    These experiments in an intermediate case seem to warrant
 our applying with caution the Theory of Errors to the more
 specific experience which I shall now adduce. It consists of

two kinds : marks given by two examiners to several papers,
and marks given to the same paper by several examiners.
The former kind of statistics are more copious ; and in some
respects more valuable. For they admit of being freed from
a constant difference, of the nature of a " personal equation,"
between the marking of two examiners ; which equally
affecting all the competitors does not disturb their order;
and therefore perhaps ought not to be reckoned*.
    My method of dealing with these data may be described
by taking as an example the most perfect specimen which I
obtained, namely the marks given by two examiners to 400
pieces of English composition. First I took the difference
between the two marks given to each paper ; then squared
those differences, found the Arithmetical Mean of those
squares, and took the square root of that Mean Square as the
Mean Deviation in a sense analogous to Gauss's use of Mean
Error. The peculiar propriety of this coefficient as a measure
of discrepancy is that it not only represents, as well as other
sorts of average error, the deviation between marks in any
particular subject ; but also leads to the coefficient of the
Probability-curve which measures the deviation between sums
of marks. Thus the Mean Deviation for the 400 pairs of
marks in English composition proved to be 67, which co
efficient not only gives a general idea of the discrepancy to
be expected between any two marks, but also yields a
precise system of measures for the discrepancy between the
sum of several marks assigned by two examiners to the same
pieces of work in pari materia. That discrepancy would
fluctuate according to a Probability-curve whose modulus is
  V2 x 10 x 67, or whose probable error is '674 . . . x VlO x 67.
    For our purpose it is generally convenient to express the
 Mean Deviation as ka percentage of the mean mark for a
whole set of papers. Thus in the case before us the average
of the 800 marks was 227 ; and accordingly the Mean Devia
tion per cent, -in round numbers 30.
    This result requires to be corrected for a certain " personal
equation." The constant difference between the two sets of
marks is about 20, nearly ten per cent, of the average mark.
The square of this constant difference is to be subtracted from
 the uncorrected Mean Square ; of which 67 was the square
 root. The corrected Mean Deviation is 64 ; expressed as a
 percentage of the average mark, 28 nearly.
    The worth of this result may be appreciated from the state-

 Statistical Society for 1890.

ment that, whereas the (uncorrected) Mean Deviation for the
whole set of 400 pairs is G7, the corresponding determinations
for the first, second, and third batches of 133 papers were
respectively 63, 67, 72. I have similarly verified other
results obtained by the same or a similar method. Thus the
Mean Deviation for marks given by two examiners to fifteen
papers in Greek Prose is 25 per cent. ; for marks given by
the same pair of examiners to thirty pieces of Latin Prose, 26
per cent. For sixty pieces of Greek and Latin Prose and
Verse composition (including some of the Latin Prose but
not any of the Greek Verse before mentioned) I obtained,—
by a more summary, but in the particular instance at least
sufficiently safe, method*—again 25 per cent.
    When the statistics are in the form of marks given by
several examiners to the same piece of work, I have extracted
the Mean Error according to the usual rules ; and then mul
tiplied the coefficient by ViI in order to obtain the Mean
Deviation as above defined. In the only case in which I
have been able to compare the two methods of determination
the results yielded are fairly consilient. I refer to Latin
Prose Composition, for which, according to the first method,
I extracted from thirty pairs of marks given to as many
pieces of prose the Mean Deviation 26 per cent. By the
second method I obtained from twenty-eight marks given to
the same piece of prose by as many highly competent ex
 aminers the Mean Deviation 20 per cent.—of the average
 of the twenty-eight marks ; which, being four fifths of the
 maximum, is not exactly comparable with the general average
 referred to in the first method.

 one or other of those methods t:—
    ' Using the formula : Mean Deviation (in the sense above defined)
           Average Deviation ; which relation had held good for a great
 number of marts given by the same examiners in a variety of Classical
 subjects including Composition.
    t These computations derive some confirmation from an experiment
 which Mrs. Bryant, D.Sc, of the North London Collegiate School, has
 communicated to me. Having examined forty Geometry papers, she re
 examined them after some weeks. The discrepancy between the two
 sets of marks (corrected for a certain difference of scale) proves to be
  only 12 per cent. For further remarks on the Table see the companion
 paper.

   These data are adapted to certain problems which are of
practical interest.
   I. The first problem is, What is the probability that
any particular candidate who has come out successful at an
examination would have been successful (or vice versa)
if the candidate's work and that of his competitors had
been appraised by a different though equally competent
examiner (or examiners) ? This general problem may be
variously subdivided. First (A) success may be defined by
the attainment of a predetermined number of marks, a fixed
Honour Line. Or (B) the number of prizes, say n, may be
predetermined ; and the first n candidates, without respect to
the absolute number of their marks, may obtain prizes. Other
distinctions turn on the presence or absence of an attribute
which is particularly favourable to the calculation of proba
bility: namely, a certain plurality which renders applicable
the laws of large numbers ; the attribute in virtue of which
the movement of multitudinous atoms is more tractable than
the problem of three bodies. We may inquire whether a
candidate would be displaced, if (.?.) the mark assigned to
each paper in each subject had been what may be called the
true mark—namely the mean of the marks given by an inde
finite number of equally competent examiners ; or (x), if the
marks in each subject had been given by a single examiner
(or a few) different from the one (or two) who acted on the
given occasion. Again (y) the number of competing candi
dates may be large, or (y) not so. Lastly (z) there may be

          Prof. Edgeworth's Problem* in Probabilities.        179
several subjects, the candidate's place being determined by
the sum of his marks in each ; or (c) there may be only one
or two subjects.
   Of the immense number of cases formed by the combina
tions of those attributes I shall discuss only the most interest
ing. First in the order of simplicity is A.rc. In this case there
is a fixed Honour-line, say H ; the comparison is between
the place actually obtained by the candidate and the place
which be would have obtained if in each subject the marks had
been determined by a numerous jury of competent examiners ;
the number of competitors may be either many or few ; the
number of subjects is large, say S. Since the number of
subjects is large and the marking in each subject fluctuates
with the change of examiners according to a definite law of
frequency, it follows that sums of S marks fluctuate according
to the law of error, the Probability Curve. Let (J be the
 Mean Deviation for the marking in each subject ; in the
sense above defined, that is V2 x the Gaussian Mean Error.
Then the Probability-curve, according to which the compound
 mark determined by any set of S examiners will fluctuate,
 has for its Modulus the coefficient C ; which is ascertainable
 by observation. Now suppose the candidate has obtained the
 mark H + 1. The problem may be likened to the familiar one:
 If the average of S observations of given precision be H + /,
 what is the probability that the true value is less than H. By
 received reasoning the probability in question is
                           1   C     *
which may be calculated from the usual tables.
   Awz. This case differs from the preceding in that the
comparison of the actual compound mark is not with the true
mark, but with the mark which any other set of S competent
examiners might have assigned. It is as if, in the parallel
problem, we sought the probability, not that the true value
is less than H, but that any second measurement made
under similar conditions should fall below H. According to
a well-known theory the solution is obtained by substituting
 ^2x1' for C in the solution of the preceding problem.
    Bzyz. This is the ease in which a fixed large number, say n,
 prizes are assigned to the n candidates who come out first
 (irrespectively of the absohite number of their marks); and
 the inquiry is whether any particular candidate would have
 his status changed from successful to unsuccessful, or vice
                                N 2

versd, if each of the marks in each subject had been deter
mined by a jury ; the number of candidates, say m, and the
number of subjects, S, being large. The number of candi
dates and prizes being large, we may assume that the mark
of the nth candidate in a descending order of merit, that is
the Honour line, will be constant for any particular set of
examiners ; for much the same reason that, if two large
batches of similar ob jects, e. g. statures of the same nation,
be taken at random, the quartiles, octiles, deciles, &c. remain
constant. Thus the problem is reduced to Axyz which—as
one case of Axz—has been solved.
   Hxyz. This problem is related to the preceding Bxyz, as
Kxz to Axz.
   Bxyz. This case differs from Bxyz in that the number of
the competitors (and prizes) is small. First, let there be only
two competitors, and one prize. The problem is : What is
the probability that the verdict of any particular set of S ex
aminers would be reversed, if the two papers in each of the S
subjects had been marked by a jury. Let the (compound)
marks of the two candidates differ by I. The probability of
reversal is identical with the probability that the difference
between the candidates in a particular direction, or with its
sign, according to the actual set of examiners, should differ by
as much as / from the difference in the same direction under
the jury-system. If, as before, C is the Mean Deviation in
each subject, then, upon principles to which allusion has been
made, the required probability is

   Next, let there be three candidates ; and, to fix the ideas,
let there be two prizes, and let the question be, What is the
probability that the second prize-man would fail to obtain a
prize, if the work were marked by other examiners ? In order
that the original second should become third, it is evident
that he must come out below the original third. Thus, I being
the distance between the original second and third, the solu
tion would be the same as for the simple case, if the original
first were not liable to move relative to the original second.
But, in virtue of this liability, a certain proportion of cases in
which the original second comes out below the original third
are not failures for the original second. Thus /, the distance
from the first of the unsuccessful, or Honour-line as it may
be called, being the same, the probability of failure decreases
with the increased number of candidates. The limiting case

          Prof. Edgeworth's Problems in Probabilities.     181
   where, the candidates and prizes being indefinitely nume
rous, the Honour-line may be regarded as fixed, our Bxyz.
It will be observed that the measure of discrepancy for Bxyz
is less than the corresponding measure for the extreme case
of Bxyz in the ratio 1:^2. We have thus a rough measure
of the inaccuracy which we commit in treating intermediate
cases according to the rule proper to either extreme.
   Bxyz. This relation of this case to the preceding is like
the relation of Bxyz to Bxyz ; which has already been con
sidered. The coefficient of discrepancy which is proper to
Bxyz should be multiplied by si 'I for Bxyz.
   Bxyz. This case differs from the preceding in that the
number of the papers is small. At this stage therefore the
Probability-curve which has hitherto illumined our course
disappears. A certain twilight may, however, be derived
from that source of illumination. Take the extreme case of
two candidates examined in one subject for a prize. What is
the probability that the award of one examiner would be
reversed by an equally competent examiner? As we saw
under a preceding head, the answer turns upon the variation
with the change of examiners in the difference between the
marks of the two candidates. Such a difference between
differences of marks will in general fluctuate according to the
same law as a sum offour marks taken at random from under
the facility-curve, according to which by our postulate the
marks of different examiners fluctuate. But a sum of four
observations taken from under any facility-curve will in
general fluctuate according to a law which is getting on for
a Probability-curve, unless indeed the given facility-curve be
exceedingly abnormal. But so far is the facility-curve with
which we have to deal from being exceedingly abnormal,
that it is presumably getting on for a Probability-curve.
Accordingly the rule for Bxyz may pretty safely be extended
to Bxyz ; especially where we have specific experience that
the facility-curve in question does not violently rebel against
the normal law of error—experience which I have obtained
with respect to several subjects. For example, let a prize be
 given to the one of two candidates who obtains the higher
 mark for a piece of Latin Prose, of about the same calibre as
 the Composition at the India Civil Service or Cambridge
 Classical Tripos Examinations. Even if the successful candi
date exceeds his rival by fifty per cent, (of the meau between
the two marks), there is some probability, say one in a hun
dred, that the verdict would be reversed by another equally
competent examiner.

  182       Prof. Edgeworth's Problems in Probabilities.
     II. The answers which have been given to the first problem
  are required for the solution of the second problem : At any
 examination of which the circumstances are given, how many
  of the candidates are uncertain in this sense, that there is an
  appreciable chance of any assigned one of them who is now
  successful coming out unsuccessful, and vice versa ; if the
  work were marked by different but equally competent ex
  aminers ? If we confine ourselves to the general case of
  several candidates and several subjects (yz), we have only to
  measure from the Honour-line in both directions a distance
  such that the probability of any candidate at this distance
  being displaced is very small, say less than one in a hundred.
  This improbable error, or discrepancy as it may be called, is
  found by multiplying the probable error, or discrepancy,
  proper to the case by 3-5. The candidates above that limit
  may be described as " safe."
     The reader who applies this formula to statistics of exami
  nations, such as those which are given in the Reports of the
  Civil Service Commissioners, may be surprised to find that
 the number of the uncertain unsuccessful is greater than that
 of the uncertain successful ; although, in the case of a deter
 minate number of prizes (B), every instance of a successful
 candidate being in the wrong box involves an instance of an
 unsuccessful candidate being misplaced. The explanation of
 this anomaly is that, in applying the received formula, we
 have made the common assumption that the a priori proba
 bility of the candidate's real mark, so to speak, being one
 figure rather than another is constant. The nature of that
 assumption and the caution with which it must be made* are
  ve1l illustrated by these problems. In the present case the
 a priori probabilities are not constant. In general the marks
 of candidates at an examination are not distributed equably
 between the positions of the senior and the man at the bottom ;
 but are heaped up in the form of a Probability-curve f. Now
 the scene of our operations is the upper extremity of this
 Probability-curve ; whence it follows that the a priori pro
 bability (for each point or degree) diminishes as we ascend
    * See my paper " On A priori Probabilities " in the Philosophical
 Mayazine for September 1884 ; also ' Metretike ' (London, Temple Co..
 1887). _
   t With respect to this statement and others which may seem to
require proof the reader is again referred to companion papers in the
Journal of the Statistical Society, Sept. 1888 and Sept. 18SX). 1 have
sometimes in those papers used the term " true mark ' for the mean of
the marks given by an indefinite number of examiners-a conception which
is not absolutely essential to the x variety of our problems.

          Prof. Edgeworth's Problems in Probabilities.                183
from below towards the Honour-line and above it. The effect
of this consideration is that we have somewhat underrated the
probability of displacement for positions above the Honour-
line, and somewhat overrated it for positions below. It may
be assumed, I think, that these errors will compensate each
other when we determine the total number of the uncertain
in the manner which I have indicated.
   III. I have made a similar assumption in solving the follow
ing third problem. At any examination of which the circum
stances are given, what number of candidates is most probably
displaced ? I proceed as follows. Having ascertained the
coefficient of the probability-curve which governs the case, I
determine numbers corresponding to equal increments of that
coefficient above and below the Honour-point. In each of
the degrees so constituted I find how many candidates are
comprehended ; and I assign to the candidates in each degree
the probability of displacement which is found by Problem I.
 (with the aid of the proper tables) to appertain to the centre
of the degree. The product of the number of candidates and
the probability of their displacement gives for each degree
the number most probably displaced ; which numbers being
added give the total number most probably displaced. It is
assumed that the underrating of the probability above the line
will fairly well be compensated by the overrating below.
   An example will make my meaning clear. With reference
to an examination for 50 clerkships of the second class, of
which the statistics are given in the Twentieth Report of the
Civil Service Commissioners*, how many would most pro
bably be displaced if the work has been marked by another
set of equally competent examiners. The problem is of the
species Hxyz, the candidates being numerous and the papers
about ten in number. The Honour-line is at 1720, and the
probable error for the regulating Probability-curve (what I
have elsewhere called the probable discrepancy) is taken as
50 ; upon the assumption that the Mean Error for each of
the ten papers is 15 per cent., that is the lowest coefficient
which I have actually observed. Accordingly the intervals
 1720-1730 &c. correspond each to a fifth of the Probable
error f. The computation is shown in the annexed Table.

x= Probable Error* x -I, -2,&c.— 1'8, 2-2 respectively- (values
obtained from the fourth table appended to DeMorgan's
'Calculus of Probabilities'). Column 8 gives the difference
between -5 and each of these values, the corresponding inte
gral between limits x> and x ; which represents the proba
bility of displacement for candidates in the corresponding
compartment. Column it, the product of column 6 and
column 8, gives the most probable of number of those who
would be displaced, for each degree or interval. The sum of
these numbers is the most probable number displaced, out of
all the candidates. I take the half of this number as the most
probable number of successful candidates who would be dis
placed on re-examination.
   In conclusion I submit a Table containing answers to
Problems 2 and 3 for certain cases which seem to me fairly
typical of the various statistics which I have inspected.
   In this Table the first column designates a service to which
appointment is made by competitive examination. The second
column contains references to the Reports of the Civil Service
Commissioners, in which are published the marks given at public
examinations. The Reports referred to are in the 22nd vulume
of the Parliamentary papers for 1875 and for 1876. The third
column gives the number of candidates at each of the examinations
referred to in this table. The fourth column gives the correspond
ing numbers of successful candidates. The fifth column contains
the mark of the lowest successful candidate at each of the
examinations, or of the highest unsuccessful, or some intermediate
number (figures differing from each other by quantities which may be
neglected). The sixth column contains the aggregate marks which
occupy the halfway position in the order of merit at each ex
amination. Thus at the second examination (referred to in the
second row of the table) there being 171 candidates, the aggregate
mark which is 86th in the order of merit is 1601 ; in round
numbers 1600. At the first examination, the number of candidates
being even, viz. 150, the Median is intermediate between the 75th
mark, which is (in the descending order of merit) 1601, and the

76th which is 1597 ; in round numbers 1600. In the seventh
column, each entry is the discrepancy which is as likely as not to
occur between the sum of ten marks given to any candidate's
papers at the examination referred to and the sum of the marks
which might have been given to the same work by any other
set of equally competent examiners. This figure is calculated
from the formula: Mean Discrepancy = Mean Error x >/i!x-477
(or Mean Error x -67 ...)-+- */lU. Here 10 is the number (or
greater than the number) of the papers answered by a candidate.
The other figures are explained in the books on Probabilities.
The Mean Error is a coetticient determined by observation in the
manner described in this paper (above 176). Por most of the
examinations the lowest figure actually observed, viz. 15, has been
taken for the Mean Error. Por the India Civil Service the
 higher coefficient 18 has been used ; partly because that figure
 actually has been observed for that examination ; and partly because
 the examination includes more advanced and speculative subjects
 than the Examinations for which the coefficient 15 was observed.
 The eighth column gives the discrepancy which in each case is
 very unlikely to occur, against the occurrence of which the odds are
 about 100 : 1. The improbable discrepancy is by the Theory of
 Errors equal to the probable discrepancy multiplied by 3-5 nearly.
 In the ninth column each upper limit is formed by adding the
 improbable discrepancy to the Honour-Line, the lower limit by
 subtracting the same figure from the same. In the tenth column
 the number of the successful who are uncertain is ascertained by
 counting the number of candidates whose marks are between the
 honour-line and the upper limit of uncertainty ; the number of
 the unsuccessful who are uncertain is found by counting the
  number of candidates between the honour-liue and the lower limit
  of uncertainty. To form the eleventh column subtract the number
  of the uncertain successful from the total successful ; the remainder
 is the number of those who are ''safe" in this sense that for any
  assigned one of them the odds against his being displaced upon a
  reexamination of his work are about 100 to 1. The number of the
  safe divided by the number of the successful at each examination
 is entered in the eleventh column. The laborious formation of
  the twelfth column is described above at page 185. To form
  the thirteenth column divide each entry in the twelfth column
  by the corresponding entry in the fourth. The average of the
  figures in the thirteenth column relating to the same class of
  examination gives the proportion of the successful candidates
  which M ould most probably be displaced upon a reexamination of
  their work—most probably in the same sense as we may say that
  the average death-rate represents the proportion of the popula
  tion who will most probably die in any proximate year. Thus in
  the case of the India Civil Service we may say— or rather might
  have said at the period to which the statistics relate, twelve years
  ago—that the most probable proportion of displacement— the

188           Messrs. Maclean and Makita Goto on
degree of failure of justice which may be expected — amounts to
8 per cent, of the successful ; or rather 8-s- V'S, say 6, per cent.,
if we define the just verdict as that wliich would be found by taking
the average of the results obtained by a variety of competent
examiners.
XXI. Some Electrical Propertie2 of Flames. By Magnets
   Maclean, M.A., F.R.S.E., and Makita Goto {Japan)*.
                               [Plate V.]
IN connexion with our experiments on the " Electrification
       of Air by Combustion," we were led to make some ex
periments on the electricity of different parts of the flame
itself. A Bunsen burner was used, and the potentials at
different points, both inside and outside of the flame, were
examined. In fig. 1, Plate V., is shown the arrangement
for examining the inside of the flame. AA and BB are pla
tinum wires insulated from the burner and projecting into
the flame 5 millim. above the upper end of the burner. These
wires can be adjusted by bending so as to lie in various
positions from the middle line of the flame to its boundary.
In our experiments one of them was left insulated (with its
end free in air), while the other was connected to a terminal
of a Thomson Quadrant Electrometer. Or, again, one wire
was connected to one terminal of the electrometer, and the
other to the other terminal. The Bunsen burner itself was
always connected to earth. The sensitiveness of the electro
meter was generally such that a difference of potential of
 gJu volt between the terminals could be observed.
   In fig. 2 is shown the arrangement for examining the
 outside of the flame. C is a platinum wire fused into a glass
tube which covers the wire except a very small portion of its
 end. D is the scale for measuring the distance of the point
 of the platinum wire from the boundary of the flame. E is
the index.
    By these arrangements it was found that the flame is
 negatively electrified, while the film of air surrounding the
 flame is positively electrified. These results were already
 obtained by Elster and Geitel. Our results agree with what
 they found, though our method of examining the different
 parts of the flame is different from their method. (See an
abstract of their experiments by S. P. Thompson in ' Nature,'
                    * Communicated by the Authors.

              some Electrical Properties of Flames.           189
vol. xxvi. No. 666.) In fig. 3 is shown the curve of potential
obtained after several observations. It will be observed that
the potential at the middle line of the flame is nearly zero,
and the surface of maximum negative potential lies just inside
of the flame, while the surface of maximum positive potential
lies at a distance of 2 millim. from the boundary of the flame.
The maximum difference of potential between these two sur
faces was found to be between 2£ and 3 volts.
   Similar results were obtained with other flames ; but in
the case of glowing charcoal the point of the platinum wire
had to be brought very close to it in order to obtain the indica
tion of positive potential of the film of air surrounding it.
   Having thus made quantitative measurements of the
potentials of different parts of a flame, it was expected that
the magnitude of the electrification of the air would depend
on the part of the flame that was earthed ; that is, that maxi
mum positive electrification would be obtained when the most
negative part of the flame was earthed and vice versa. This
expectation was verified by placing the Bunscn burner 3 feet
below the nozzle of a water-dropper connected in the usual
manner to a quadrant-electrometer.
   The flame of the Bunsen burner was next surrounded by a
wire-gauze cage, which was made to lie on the surface of the
flame. The burner and wire gauze were connected to a gas-
pipe for earth. Under this arrangement the effect of the
flame was just like that of glowing charcoal, the electro
meter connected to the water-dropper showing 6 volts positive.
   Another cage open at the top, and connected to earth, was
made to lie on the surface of maximum positive potential
surrounding the flame. This was difficult to do, and only a
part of the cage fulfilled the condition. In this case the air
was electrified to 2^ volts negative, while the burner without
the cage electrified the air to less than one volt.
   These experiments help to explain why glowing charcoal
electrifies air positively, for it acts like a solidified flame
connected to earth. For a similar reason spongy platinum,
when it glows in hydrogen or coal-gas, is negatively electrified
like glowing charcoal.
    In these experiments it was desirable to kuow the maxi
mum electrifying effect of the flame, and this was done by
the following method :—The flame to be tested is placed
on a stand insulated or uninsulated about 3 feet below the
 nozzle of the water-dropper, which is connected to the electro
 meter. The room is electrified, say negatively, to a certain
 potential which is indicated by the electrometer, by turning

190            Some Electrical Properties of Flames.
an electrical machine in the further end of the room. The
flame to be tested is then lighted, and the change of deflexion
of the electrometer, if any, is noted. If the change of the
deflexion is towards negative, the flame is put out and the
room is further electrified negatively by turning the machine;
but if the change of the deflexion is towards positive we wait
for some time till the electrification of the room decreases by
some scale-divisions, and the flame is again tried to see the
effect. This process is continued till no change is observed
on lighting the flame. The reading at that time is taken as
the maximum effect of the flame. The following observation
on a spirit-lamp connected to a gas-pipe may be taken as a
specimen :—
         Deflexion before   Deflexion after   Direction una-
             lighting.         lighting.    amount of change.
                30                20              + 10

                  81                81               0
The maximum effect is therefore 8£ divisions, equal to 0'6
volt negative, 14 divisions of the scale corresponding to one
volt.
   When this same lamp was put on an insulating stand and
connected to the negative pole of one Daniell's cell, the other
pole being connected to gas-pipe, the maximum deflexion was
40 scale-divisions ( = 3 volts), and when two Daniell's cells
were used in the same way the maximum deflexion was 60
scale-divisions ( = 4^ volts).
   Experiments the arrangements for which are shown dia-
grammatically in fig. 4, were also tried. A, B are metal plates
 supported about 2 millim. apart by the insulating material 0,
 and joined by wires to the terminals of the electrometer. A
 spirit-lamp is placed about a foot below, so that the hot air
from the flame passes between the two metals. Differences
of potential produced by this arrangement are given in the
following table :—

    Hot air from the flame seems to have a different property
from ordinary hot air, because the hot air from a large red-
hot soldering bolt, put in the place of the spirit-lamp, had no
effect; nor had breathing upon the plates, nor the. vapour from
hot water any effect.

The Theory of Determinants in the Historical Order of its Devdojmunt.
   —Part 1. Determinants in general, Leibnitz (1698) to Oayley
   (1841). By Thomas Muib, LL.D. (Macmillan, 1890. Pp'. xii
    + 278.)
DR. MUIR is most favourably known to English mathematicians
         by his previous work in the region of Determinants, both in
original directions and in the way of gathering together and putting
into compendious shape the results obtained by his predecessors.
By the way, we are glad to see that a " greatly enlarged " edition of
his "treatise" is in course of preparation. It was fitting and
natural that he should be inspired to write some such work as the
present, if only he could secure the leisure for doing so. He him
self remarks that whilst writing his " treatise," " it was repeatedly
forced on my attention that the history of the subject had been
very imperfectly looked into. Not only, as it appeared, had injus
tice been done by the attribution of isolated theorems and demon
 strations to authors other than the first discoverers, but the labours
 of the great founders of the theory had been disproportionately
 represented, and a considerable amount of valuable work had
 actually been lost sight of altogether." He accounts for this natu
 rally enough. The outcome of his discovery was the forming of a
 resolution " to set about collecting the whole literature of the sub
 ject, in order that, as a first step on the way to a history, a biblio

192                Notices respecting New Books.
graphy might be compiled." A first instalment of his labours took
the form of a " List of Writings," which occupied 41 pages of the
'Quarterly Journal of Mathematics' (vol. xviii. pp. 110-149):
this, as an offprint, was very liberally dispersed and resulted in a
supplemental list, of 22 pages, which was printed in the same
journal (vol. xxi. pp. 299-320). It is of interest to our readers to
note that a by-result was the note on Schweins, entitled " An
overlooked discoverer in the Theory of Determinants," which was
printed in our Journal [Phil. Mag. vol. xviii. pp. 416-427 (1884)].
   Dr. Muir's object is twofold. To provide a work of reference
to all that has been written on the subject, and " which should be
so indexed that any one engaged in research might easily ascertain
exactly what had been done on any particular topic, how it
had been done, and what possible developments it foreshadowed."
To show clearly to whom every step in advance had been due,
furnishing the student with the actual data on which the author's
conclusions were based. These two matters have been kept well
in view, and the result is a work well worthy of taking rank with
the recent historical writings of Todhunter and others on mathe
matical subjects.
   The first 100 pages consider what had been done by mathe
maticians in the period 1693-1812. The prime contributors are
Bezout, Van dermonde, Laplace, Lagrange, Monge, Binet, and
Cauchy. Were the contributions of these worthies left out,
" there would be exceedingly little left to anyone else, and even
that little would be of minor interest." A glance at these names
shows that the writings of French mathematicians were the most
important in this period. Accompanying the retrospect (pp. 131 -2)
here given is an admirable Table, which enables the reader to run
down any particular result, which marks this epoch, to its dis
coverer.
   The second period analysed in this volume ranges from 1813-
1841. The period of " pioneering " extended to 120 years,
this to only 30 years or thereabouts. In the longer period we
have 20 papers by 13 writers, in the period before us we have 35
papers by 18 writers; and these have representatives from the
following nationalities :—English, Italian, and Polish, in addition
to the previous French and German. Some of the English con
tributions saw the light first in our pages : viz. Driukwater (on
Simple Elimination, vol. x. 1831); Sylvester (on Derivation of
Coexistence, vol. xvi. 1839) ; the same (A method of determining
by mere inspection the derivatives from two equations of any
degree, vol. xvi. 1820).
   Dr. Muir has done his work very thoroughly, and has supplied
all necessary aid to the student for the easy reading of a vast mass
of results ; and we heartily wish him equal success in the com
pletion of what will possibly be the more difficult, because more
crowded with authors and results, period which yet lies before
him. It would have added to the utility of the work if the date
and author's name of the memoir analysed could have been fur
nished at the top of each page.

<U+FFFC> 1. " On the disturbed Bodes of North-western Germany." By
Prof. A. von Konen, For.Corr.G.8.
   After referring to the disturbances of Palaeozoic times, the author
commented upon the Miocene dislocations of the Harz, Ehineland,
Westphalia, and Nassau, which have a N.W.-S.E. strike, varying
to N.-S. or E.-W., and which are similar to postglacial dis
locations.
   He briefly discussed the origin of these dislocations, and noticed
their peculiarities, and proceeded to consider the relationship of the
intruded basalts to the disturbances, supposing that during the pro
cess of faulting the earth's crust was pressed downward along
synclinal lines and that the basaltic magma escaped upwards through
the inverted funnel-shaped synclinal fissure.
   Comparison was made between these Tertiary basalts and the pro
ducts of modern volcanic eruptions, and it does not appear to the
author to be unlikely that the cause of the outflow of many of the
lavas in the latter was similar to that which produced the extension
of the Tertiary basaltic rocks.
   2. " On the Origin of the Basins of the Great Lakes of America."
By Prof. J. W. Spencer, M.A., Ph.D., F.G.S., State Geologist of
Georgia.
   From the study of the hydrography of the American lakes, from
the discovery of buried channels revealed by borings, from the
inspection of the glaciation of the lake-region, the consideration
of the late high continental elevation, and the investigation of
the deformation of old water-levels, as recorded in the high-level
beaches, the explanation of the Origin of the Basins of the Great
Lakes becomes possible.
   The original Erie valley drained into the extreme western end of
 Lake Ontario—the Niagara river being modern—by a channel now
partly buried beneath drift. Lake Huron, by way of Georgian Bay,
was a valley continuous with that of Lake Ontario ; but between
these two bodies of water, for a distance of about 95 miles, it is now
 buried beneath hundreds of feet of drift. The old channel of this
 buried valley entered the Ontario basin about twenty miles east of
 Toronto. The northern part of Lake-Michigan basin was drained
 into the Huron basin, as at present ; whilst the southern basin of
 that lake emptied by a now deeply drift-filled channel into the south
 western part of Huron. The buried fragments of a great ancient
valley and river, and its tributaries, are connected with submerged
channels in Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, thus forming the course of

the ancient St. Lawrence (Laurentian) river, with a great tributary
from the Erie basin and another across the southern part of the State
of Michigan. This valley is of high antiquity, and was formed during
times of high continental elevation, culminating not long before the
Pleistocene period. The glaciation of the region is nowhere parallel
with the escarpments, forming the sides of, or crossing the lakes or
less prominent features. During the Pleistocene period, and especially
at the close of the episode of the upper Till, the continent was greatly
depressed, and extensive beaches and shore-lines were made, which
are now preserved at high elevations. With the re-elevation of the
 continent these old water-levels have been deformed, owing to their
 unequal elevations. This deformation is sufficient to account for the
roc'. y barriers at the outlets of the lakes. Some of the lakes have
been formed, in part, by drift obstructing the old valley. The
origin of the basins of the Great Lakes may be stated as the
valley (of erosion) of the ancient St. Lawrence River and its
tributaries, obstructed during, and particularly at the close of, the
Pleistocene period, by terrestrial movements, warping the earth's
crust into barriers, thus producing lake-basins, some of which had
just been formed in part by drift deposited in the ancient valley.

   4. " Notes on a ' Wash-out' found in the Pleasley and Teversall
CollierioB, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire." By J. C. B. Hendy.Esq.
   Sections were given of the " Wash " showing the thickening of the
coal as it approaches the same, and the splitting of the " Wash "
itself into two branches. Various measurements were noted, and
certain disturbances recorded. In every section examined, the sides
of the " Wash " are more or less slickensided, and in some few cases
the coal is distorted next to the " Wash;" but the author is of opinion
that these are due to lateral pressure and movement subsequent to
the denudation of the coal and deposition of the sandstone, and ho
remarks on the difficulty of reconciling the regularity of the under-
clay with the theory of the formation of " Washes " by disturbance.
   He considers that they are due, in Durham and elsewhere, to
currents flowing at a high rate of speed in one direction, carrying
away the denuded material, and, as in the case of the Derbyshire
" Wash," to a series of inundations, each inrush denuding a certain
amount, and on subsiding redepositing part of the material at a
higher level, while the remainder was carried away in suspension.
   In conclusion, notice was taken of " washes " occurring in other
localities.

    1. "On certain Physical Peculiarities exhibited by the so-called
- Raised Beaches ' of Hope's Nose and the Thatcher Rock, Devon."
By D. Pidgeon, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author described the peculiarities of these so-called beaches,

                The Devonian Rocks of South Devon.                    195
 including the absence of stratification, the presence of splinters of
rock like that of the overlying limestone cliffs, the scarcity of rounded
pebbles, and the great abundance of sharply fractured shells asso
 ciated with unbroken rock-dwelling shells.
    He enumerated the fossils collected from these deposits by Mr. A.
It. Hunt, which include Trophon truncatus and Fleurotoma turricula,
 and calling attention to the observations of Messrs. Feilden and
De Ranee, and of Dr. Moss upon the ice-foot of Arctic regions,
and the accumulation of material in the trenches found therein
concluded that the deposits under consideration were formed at
a time when a small bay existed between Hope's Nose and the
Thatcher Eock, which has since been destroyed by denudation of the
intervening sandstone, in which bay an ice-foot once existed ; and
further, that the two deposits form the surviving relics of the mingled
mass of chips, shells, shell-fragments, Crustacea, &c, which must
have filled the trench in the ice-foot demanded in such a position.
This would place the time of formation of the deposits at the close
of the Glaoial period.
   2. " The Devonian Rocks of South Devon." By W. A. E. Ussher,
Esq., F.G.S., of H.M. Geological Survey.
   This paper is the result of work done in continuation of the labours
of the late Mr. Champernowne, and refers particularly to the area
north of the Dart and east of Dartmoor.
   Owing to the complicated stratigraphy of the region, we have to
fall back upon such information as can be procured of the general
types of Upper, Middle, and Lower Devonian faunas ; for though the
lithological constituents of these three divisions are broadly distin
guishable, there are no definite lithological boundaries between them.
   The Lower Devonian is mainly distinguished by the occurrence
of sandstone and grit, but the upper beds are shales passing into
the Middle Devonian slates.
   The Middle Devonian consists of limestones, and shaly limestones
upon slates, the latter representing the Calceolen-Schiefer, and con
taining Spirdfer specioms. Stringocephalus is found here and there
in the middle Devonian Limestones. The upper part of the middle
Devonian Limestones (with Lummaton fauna) passes into the
cuboides-be&B of the Upper Devonian. The Upper Devonian con
tains thin-bedded limestones, often concretionary, with chocolate-
red and pale greenish slates and mudstones. These beds corre-
pond to the Goniatiten-Schichten, Kramenzelstein and Knollenkalk
of Germany, and to the Cypridinen-Schiefer.
   In the Upper and Middle Devonian rocks we find a local preva
lence of schalstein and tuffs, breaking up the limestones. The slate
and sandstone type of Upper Devonian in North Devon appears to
give place southward to a purely slate type, possibly accompanied by
overlap of the Culm measures. The author groups the South Devon
rocks under the following heads ;—

Lower. 7.  ' 6. Slates and sandstones, generally red.
                Slates with hard grits.
   After discussing the relationship of the Lincomhe and Warberry
beds and the New Cut Homalonotus-beds, the author notes the
discovery of Pleiirodictyum by Mr. Whidborne in the Railway Cutting
at Saltern Cove. He proves the Lower Devonian age of the Cocking-
ton beds and their correlation with the Torquay Lower Devonian
by the discovery of fossils. He considers it probable, though not
certain, that the main mass of Meadfoot beds is below the Lin-
combe, Warberry, and Cockington sandstones.
   The distribution of the Middle Devonian Limestones is described.
Stringocepludus is found in limestones containing Rhynchonella
cuboidet. The upper parts of the limestone-masses (East Ogwell,
Kingskerswell, Barton, Ilsham, &c.) may be Upper Devonian. The
massive limestones may terminate abruptly or pass laterally into
shales, and the whole mass of the limestones seems to be replaced
by slates between the Yealmpton and Totnes areas.
   The commencement of the phase of volcanic activity which
caused the accumulation of the Ashprington series is shown to coin
cide with the latest stage of Eifelian deposition, and the Ashpring
ton series may represent continuous or intermittent vulcanicity up
to a late stage in the Upper Devonian. North of Stoke Gabriel a
mass of limestone seems to have been formed contemporaneously
with the volcanic material on the immediate borders of which it
occurs. Elsewhere tho limestones are interrupted by local influxes
of volcanic material. The occurrence of other local developments
of Middle and Upper Devonian volcanic rocks is described.
   The relationship of the Middle and Upper Devonian deposits
varies. In some cases Upper Devonian shales may have been
deposited against Middle Devonian limestones ; in others there is
         being development
a continuous
stones                            limestone, the&'oH?aftfi<e-limestones,
                 succeeded byofCuboides-beds,     Middle Dovonian lime   and
Enollenkalk. The local variations of these are described, and
fossil-lists given. The Enollenkalk is shown to pass under Entomis-
bearing beds (" Cypridinen-Schiefer "), which are described, though
a detailed account of their relationship to the Culm-measures is
reserved for a future occasion.

   1. " The so-called Upper-Lias Clay of Down Cliffs.'- By S. S.
Buckman, Esq., F.G.S.
   The blue clay of Down Cliff, Dorset, which has been referred to

                Contact-alteration at New Galloway.                197
the Upper Lias, has yielded Ammonites of the genus Dumortieria
to the author, notably D. radiant. This blue clay is below the
Yeovil Sands ; but the position of D. radians in the Cotteswolds is
in the limestone above the Cotteswold Sands, which has been placed
in the Inferior-Oolite series.
    The author, by combining the Down-Cliffs and Chideock-Hill
sections, obtains a sequence of beds from the Middle Lias to the top
beds of the Inferior Oolite, including the zones of spinatum, commune
and faldferum, jurense, opalinum, Murehisorue, coneavum, and Par-
kinsoni.
    The genus Dumortieria binds the opalinum- and _/Mr«n«e-zones
together ; while at Symondsbury Hill the author has found Ludwigia
Murchisona and Lioceras opalinum in the same bed, which renders
it difficult to draw a line of demarcation between Lias and Oolite
 at the top of the qpalinum-zone.
    The facts adduced in the paper furnish additional evidence of the
unreliability of a grouping which depends upon lithological appear
ances, and it was because no satisfactory line could be drawn between
Lias and Oolite that the author, in a previous paper, supported the
continental plan of grouping Upper Lias and part of the Inferior
Oolite under the term Toarcian upon palseontological grounds. In
the present paper he furnishes further statements in support of this
view.

 Gardiner.
    A description is given of an alternating series of grits and shales
 occurring at the eastern end of the northern edge of the Cairnsmore
 of Fleet granite-mass. The rocks here are generally more altered
 than around other parts of the granite margin. The author describes
 a transverse section about half a mile from the granite, and traces
 the changes which occur in the rocks when passing towards the
 granite. She notices (1) the extreme variation in the amount of
 alteration in different places, but at the same distance from the
 granite ; (2) the entire recrystallization, in one locality, of the
 shales for about 2 feet and of the grits for about 100 yards from the
 granite margin ; (3) that material seems to have travelled through
 the rock, so that the most altered grit largely consists of crystals,
 here of one mineral, there of another, as though material had been
 conveyed from one part of the rock to another to form small
 nests ; (4) the apparent order of succession of the minerals, garnets

    The author considers, however, that the main metamorphism is
 due to the intrusion of the granite, and that the variation in the

 of the grits, and the transference of material might be accounted
 for by the passage of highly heated water. Other evidence points
 to the changes having been brought about slowly.

 of various degrees of alteration up to those in an abnormally high
 state of alteration near the granite, which resemble rocks of doubtful
 origin in other localities.

B.A., D.Sc, F.G.S.
    The author refers to the view propounded by him somewhat ten
 tatively seven years ago, and since confirmed by the researches of
 Prof. Prestwicn, as to the Preglacial age (probably Pliocene) of
 these deposits, pointing out the inconclusive nature of the evidence
 of Glacial age furnished by the presence in them of angular " sarsens."
 He regards the absence of Miocene marine deposits in this part of
 North-western Europe as supporting the published view of Zittel
 and other continental writers that the Miocene period was, in South
 eastern England, one of elevation and subacrial waste and degrada
 tion of the Weald to the south, and of East-Mercian England to the
north-west, this period of waste of the Cretaceous rocks having fur
nished much of the materials which, in Pliocene times, were carried
across a sloping plateau by fluviatile agencies.
   The composition and structure of the plateau-gravels are next
described, reference being made to previous writings of Prof. Eupert
Jones and to the recent papers of Prof. Prestwich. Eeference is
also made to the explanation suggested by the author seven years
ago of the anomalous contrast presented by the lithological con
ditions of the flint-pebbles and the subangular flint-fragments
which are intermingled in these gravels. The great masses of
unstratified and unrolled flint-debris on the Aldershot Hills are
compared with the Preglacial " Schotte " of the lower Alpine
valleys. The plateau-gravels are described as occupying altitudes
ranging from nearly 600' (O.D.) at Aldershot and on the north side
of Netley Heath, down to 280' (O.D.) at Bearwood and Farley Hill.
A list of 22 localities (with altitudes) is given where actual sections
of the plateau-gravels can be studied.

of some of these sections are given, and the levels of the plateau-
gravels and the glaciated sections correlated by a sectional diagram.
   The author concludes, from the evidence given in the paper, that:—
    1. The Plateau-gravels are of fluviatile origin, their materials
having been transported from the Weald-region to the south.
    2. They mark roughly the ancient lines of Pliocene drainage of
an old elevated Tertiary region, the present valley-system having
been mainly determined by their absence.
    3. That the modern Lower Thames Valley was initiated in Plio
cene times, the main line of drainage having been somewhat further
north than at present.
    4. That attention to altitudes reveals the fact that the present
valley-system was outlined and the major part of it actually exca
vated in an interval that intervened between the age of the Plateau-
gravels and the Glacial Epoch.
    5. That the deposition of the Plateau-gravels probably covers
most of the geologic time represented by the Pliocene.

   After noticing the prevailing opinion that such changes as he
treats of were caused by earth-movements of elevation and depres
sion, the author suggests that the altered levels were due to altered
conditions of the Mediterranean. He brings forward objections to
the prevailing theory, and remarks on the possibility of periodical
oscillating alterations in the tidal depth of the ocean.
   After noticing the special characteristics of the Mediterranean, he
infers that submergence and emergence on the Bay of Baiae would
follow equivalent alteration in the level of the Atlantic waters, such
as would be probably developed by changed conditions of astrono
mical forces ; and after discussing the possible dates and periods of the
changes at Pozzuoli, makes the suggestion that within a period of two
thousand years alterations may have taken place in the astronomical
combinations, out of which a change in the surface-level of the oceans
generally may have become developed, and wherefrom consequently
a synchronous change in the Mediterranean would also occur, and

    In an introduction the author describes the original discovery,

and clears up a misunderstanding by which he himself had been
credited with the discovery ; ho furthermore gives a historical
sketch of the further investigations and publications referring to
the mineral.
    The geology of the Awaruite-bearing district is described. The
 rocks consist of peridotites and serpentines, breaking through meta-
 morphic schists with occasional massive intrusions of acid rock.
 The petrographical characters of the peridotites of the hill-complex,
including the Olivine and Red-Hill Ranges, and serpentines are con
 sidered in detail, and the modo of occurrence of the Awaruite in
 them and in the sands derived from their denudation is discussed.
 The author Bubmits a sketch-map of the localities where the mineral
 has been discovered in sand, including not only Gorge River, but
 also Silver Creek, Red Hill, and other localities, and quotes Mr.
 Paulin's belief that it occurs diffused through the whole extent
 of peridotite and serpentine rocks, and inferentially in the drifts
 derived therefrom.

       NOTE ON DIAMAGNETISM AND CARNOT'S PRINCIPLE.
                          BY OLIVER J. LODGE.
TN the May 1889 number of the Philosophical Magazine Mr.
      J. Parker states a series of propositions which are equivalent
to the invention of an ingenious perpetual-motion machine, con
sisting of a wheel with a diamagnetie rim spinning near a perma
nent magnet, so that one side of the wheel approaches and the
other side recedes from a strong magnetic field. So long as the
wheel spins slowly, nothing happens ; but as soon as it spins so
fast that the diamagnetism excited lags behind the magnetic force
producing it, the side receding from the intense region will be
repelled more powerfully than the side approaching from the weak
region, and hence there will be perpetual motion.
   There are several ways of getting over this, and one of these
Mr. Parker suggests, viz. that diamagnetism may be a thing ex
cited instantaneously j though naturally he is not much impressed
with the likelihood of his suggestion. He rather takes refuge in an
appeal against the second law of thermodynamics, as possibly in
applicable to magnetic substances, cycle! -sp being perhaps negative
 for paramagnetic, and positive for diamagnetie, bodies.
    Returning to the subject in the last number of the Philosophical
Magazine (July 1890), he emerges from this position to make the
still wilder suggestion that diamagnetism does not really exist ;
that Faraday was deceived throughout his long and acute investi
gation by the obviously disturbing and constantly guarded-against
 paramagnetism of the air !
    Would it not, however, be possible that the spinning of a
 bismuth wheel should exert a demagnetizing effect on a magnet,
 while the spinning of an iron wheel should exert a strengthening
 effect ? When one comes to think of it, the ordinary act of mag
 netization consists in bringing on a magnet in a weak position and
 drawing it off in a strong; moreover the hypothetical induced
 molecular currents of Weber, which would certainly lag behind
 their cause by reason of self-induction, would get themselves
 strengthened and weakened as the hypothesis requires. In such
 case the energy of spin would be obtained at the expense of the
 magnetic field.
    The diamagnetism of known non-conductors is so disappointingly
 feeble, and the rapidity of its excitation so exceedingly great(judging
 from the magneto-optic effect), that it is perhaps not worth while
 actually to try if a disk of heavy glass delicately suspended and
 rapidly spun between the poles of a strong magnet in vacuo could
 maintain its motion.

     A METHOD OF DETECTING CHEMICAL UNION OF METALS.
                         BY DR. G. GORE, F.R.S.
   It is well known that evolution of heat during the mixing of two
substances is a sign of chemical union ; that considerable heat is
evolved during the melting together of certain metals, for instance
zinc and platinum ; and M. J. Eegnauld has shown that whilst
zinc, during its amalgamation by mercury, absorbs heat and becomes
more electropositive, cadmium by amalgamation evolves heat and
becomes less electropositive (Compies Hendus Acad. Sci. June 10,
1878 ; Chemical News, vol. xxxviii. p. 33).
   Having already found in a large number of instances that the
chemical union of two soluble substances, such as halogens, acids,
salts, &c., might be detected by the depression of voltaic energy which
occurs when the two dissolved substances are in the proportions of
their ordinary chemical equivalents (see Proc. Eoy. Soc. vol. xlv.
p. 265 ; " Examples of Solution-compounds," Proc. Birm. Phil.
Soc. vol. vii. p. 33 ; Chemical News, 1890, vol. lxi. p. 172), I
have adopted a similar method in this case, and have made a series
of experiments to ascertain the relative amounts of voltaic energy
in a oue-per-cent. aqueous solution of common salt, of a series of
amalgams composed of different proportions of cadmium and mer
cury, and observed whether there was a distinct depression of that
energy indicating chemical union, when the particular amalgam
composed of equivalent weights of the two metals was employed.
   As I had previously found that the amalgam changed in electro
motive force spontaneously, in order to balance this influence, I
employed, instead of a voltaic couple composed of platinum and one
bar of a series of bars of different composition, a couple composed of
a bar of fixed composition formed of the two metals in the propor
tions of their equivalent weights, and one bar of a series of bars of
different composition. The two bars in each experiment were con
nected with an ordinary torsion-galvanometer of 50 ohms resist
ance, and the amount of permanent deflexion of the needles after
about half a minute was recorded. This method was found suffi
ciently sensitive for the purpose. The composition of the bars of
varied composition is shown below by the chemical formul».
   After some preliminary experiments, the results of which agreed
with those given, the following series was made:—
                    Voltaic couple.                Deflexion.
              CdHg with Cd

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           203
   As the amounts of deflexion varied with different parts of the
 surface of the same bar, the surfaces of the bars were scraped quite
clean and the experiments with the amalgams CdlaHg10, Cdl0Hg10,
and Cd10Hgia repeated ; the same numbers as given above were
obtained.
   The numbers obtained in each case show a distinct depression of
strength of current with the amalgam composed of equivalent
 weights of the two metals, similar to that obtained with halogens,
acids, and salts, and indicate that the two metals chemically unite
together in the proportions of their ordinary chemical equivalents.
The method may therefore probably be employed for the pupose of
detecting the chemical union of metals.
                 ON THE SPECTRA OF THE ALKALIES.
            BY PROF. H. KATSER AND PROF. C. RUNGE.
   The investigation of the spectra of the alkalies has led us to
results which we present in the following short abstract.
   The spectra of the alkalies are formed in an entirely analogous
manner, which is especially manifest if, instead of the wave-lengths,
we consider the reciprocals—that is, the numbers of vibrations.
Each spectra is seen to be made up of several series of lines, each
of which may be represented with great accuracy by the formula
                          r1 -A-B-C-
                             —a-- -5 — -j,
where X is the wave-length, A, B, and C are three constants, and
n stands for the series of whole numbers from n = 3 upwards. For
n=2 the formulae give in all cases negative- that is, impossible
numbers of vibrations; n=3 represents the fundamental vibra
tions.
   The lines of the various series of each element behave very
differently as regards visibility, widening out with increase of
vapour-density. In each element we find one chief series which
contains the strongest lines, those which appear most easily, and
those which are most easily reversible ; it extends in all cases from
the red end of the spectrum to the extreme ultra-violet. The
members of the principal series, with the exception of lithium, are
with all alkalies pairs, whose distance is less as the wave-length
increases ; we have found that the difference of the numbers of
vibrations for the two lines of each pair is inversely proportional to
the number of this pair, that is of the value n, which, when inserted
in the formula, gives the pair.
   Besides the chief series, all alkalies have accessory series which
essentially appear in the visible part of the spectrum. In lithium
there are two secondary series, and in sodium four, each two of

204            Intelligence and Miscellaneoits Articles.
which, however, are congruent. Potassium is similar, while rubi
dium and caesium again have only two secondary series, which are
congruent. The congruence, which in the formula of the series
expresses itself by identity of the second and third constants for
the two series, has the effect that two such congruent series appear
as a series of pairs, but in which the difference of vibration of both
lines of the pairs is constant for each series, in opposition to the
deportment of the chief series.
    The result comes out that this difference of vibration of the
pairs of the secondary series is identical for each element with the
difference of vibration of the first pair of the principal series n=3.
It has further come out that the magnitude of this difference of
vibration is connected with the atomic weight ; the difference of
vibration is very nearly proportional to the square of the atomic
weight. With lithium no pairs are visible ; this law extended to
lithium enables us to calculate from its atomic weight that the
difference of possible pairs would be so small that we should pro
bably see the lines double.
    If we compare the spectra of the alkalies with each other, it is
 most distinctly evident that both the chief series as well as the
secondary series extend towards the red side of the spectrum. This
 is of course just as apparent in the constants A, B, C, which
 change, in a manner obviously expressed by a law, from one ele
 ment to another. It is worthy of mention that the constant B
 changes very little, and is the same, not only for the alkalies, but,
 as seems to be the case, for other elements also.
    We consider it premature to try to discover the law according to
 which the constants vary from one element to another before we
 have investigated other elements. We hope before long to lay
 before the Academy our results in reference to the alkaline earths.
    As a further result of our investigations we must mention that,
 in contradiction to the statements of Lockyer, who considered that
 he had found the hues of all pair alkalies among those of Fraun-
 hofer, only sodium is represented in the Sun, and probably also
  only its chief series.—Sitzungsberichte der Berliner AJcademie,Jone 5,

XXV. Contributions to the Molecular Theory of Induced
   Magnetism. By J. A. Ewing, F.R.S., Professor of
   Engineering in University College, Dundee*.
AS the facts of induced magnetism become better known,
        increasing interest attaches to molecular theories and
increasing difficulty attends the theories that are current.
Weber's fundamental conception that the molecules of iron
or nickel or cobalt are always magnets, and that the process
of magnetizing consists in turning them from many directions
towards one direction, has been strongly confirmed by the
now well-established fact that there is a true saturation
value, a finite limit to the intensity of magnetism, which may
be reached or very closely approached by using a strong
magnetic force t- Without going further back, to enquire
(with Ampere) how the molecules come to be magnets, we
may take this conception as the natural starting-point of a
theory. But when we go on to examine the conditions of
constraint on the part of the rotatable molecules which have
been suggested to make the theory square with what is known
about permeability, about residual magnetism and other
effects of magnetic hysteresis, about the effects of stress, of
temperature, of mechanical vibration, and so forth, we find a
 mass of arbitrary assumptions which still leave the subject

206             Prof. J. A. Ewing on the Molecular
bristling with difficulties. Many of the phenomena suggest,
for instance, the idea that there is a quasi -frictional resistance
which opposes the turning of the molecular magnets ; this
notion lends itself well to account for the most obvious effects
of magnetic hysteresis and the reduction of hysteresis by
vibration. On the other hand, it conflicts with the fact that
even the feeblest magnetic force induces some magnetism.
My object in this paper is to refer to another (and not at all
 arbitrary) condition of constraint which not only suffices
 to explain all the phenomena of hysteresis without any notion
 of friction, but seems to have in it abundant capability to
 account for every complexity of magnetic quality.
    In describing Weber's theory, Maxwell points out that, if
 each molecular magnet were perfectly free to turn, the
 slightest magnetic force would suffice to bring the molecules
 into complete parallelism, and thus to produce magnetic satu
 ration. He continues:—" This, however, is not the case. The
 molecules do not turn with their axes parallel to the force,
 and this is either because each molecule is acted on by a force
 tending to preserve it in its original direction, or because an
 equivalent effect is produced by the mutual action of the
 entire system of molecules. Weber adopts the former of
 these suppositions as the simplest."*
     Weber supposes a directing force to act in the original
  direction of the molecule's axis which continues to act as a
  restoring force in that direction after the molecule is dis
  turbed. This assumed constraint is quite arbitrary ; more
  over, if it were the only constraint, there would be no residual
 magnetism when the deflecting force was withdrawn. Accord
 ingly, Maxwell modifies Weber's theory by introducing the
  further assumption that when the angle of deflexion exceeds
  a certain limit the molecule begins to take permanent set.
  The development of this, however, does not agree well with
 the facts.
     The alternative which is offered in the sentence I have
  quoted from Maxwell was not followed up by him, and seems
  to have been very generally overlooked, notwithstanding its
  obvious freedom from arbitrary assumption. Several writers,
  notably Wiedemann t and Hughes j, have recognized the
  inter-molecular magnetic forces by suggesting that the mole
  cules, when unacted on by any magnetizing force from out
  side, may form closed rings, or chains, " so as to satisfy their

mutual attraction by the shortest path."* But Wiedemann
expressly postulates a frictional resistance to rotation, which
will prevent this arrangement from being more than approxi
mately attained, and which may be more or less overcome by
vibration f.
    I lately commented on the fact that soft iron and other
magnetic metals (notably nickel under particular conditions
of strain %) show a remarkably close approach to instability at
certain stages in the magnetizing or demagnetizing process §.
When the magnetic force reaches a particular value, the rate
of change of magnetism with respect to change of force may
become enormous. Referring to this in a paper which has
just been published //, Mr. A. E. Kennelly has reverted to the
idea of chains of magnetic molecules bold together by the
inter-molecular magnetic forces, and contends that when such
a chain is ruptured by applying a sufficiently strong external
magnetic force it will fall to pieces throughout, and the mole
cular magnets which compose the chain will take their align
ment suddenly. He accordingly sketches what he calls a
" chain-theory " of magnetization and an adaptation of the
theory of Hughes, in which, however, he postulates an elastic
resistance to the rotation of the molecules in addition to the
constraint afforded by their mutual magnetic forces. Mr.
 Kennelly's remarks are highly interesting and suggestive ;
but I do not think (for reasons which will appear immediately)
 that the notion of closed magnetic chains can be maintained
 as a general account of the molecular structure of unmagne-
tized iron.
    I have experimented on the subject by making a model
molecular structure consisting of a large number of short
steel bar-magnets, strongly magnetized, each pivoted like a
compass-needle upon a sharp vertical centre and balanced to
swing horizontally. We cannot readily imitate in a model
the two degrees of rotational freedom possessed by the axes of
actual molecular magnets, but a group of magnets swinging
in one plane gives a sufficiently good general idea of the nature
of the equilibrium which is brought about by inter-molecular
forces, and the manner in which that equilibrium is disturbed

 a centre punch : the pivot itself is a sewing-needle fixed
 upright in a small base-plate which is punched out of a sheet

 pole-strength is sufficient to make the mutual forces quite
 mask the earth's directive force when they are set moderately
 near one another. The group is arranged on a board on
 which lines are drawn to facilitate regularity in grouping
 when that is wanted, and the board slips into a large frame

 sides, with a coil through which an adjustable current may be
passed to expose the group to a nearly homogeneous external
magnetic force. The coil is wound in a single very open

inside is obtained *. A liquid rheostat with a sliding terminal
is used to secure continuity in varying the magnetic force.
It is scarcely necessary to add that the magnetic force which
is applied to the group is too weak to have any material effect
on the magnetism of individual bars. It alters their align
 ment only, just as a magnetic force alters the alignment of
Weber's molecular magnets.
    When a number of these magnets are grouped either in a
regular pattern or at random, and are left after disturbance

to come to rest free from external magnetic force, they of
course assume a form which has no resultant magnetic moment,
 provided the number be sufficiently great ; but it is apparent
 that they do not arrange themselves in closed' chains. Any
 such configuration would in general be unstable. Many
 stable configurations admit of being formed, and if the
 magnets are again disturbed and left to settle, the chances are
 much against any one configuration immediately repeating
 itself. One general characteristic of these configurations is
 that they contain lines consisting of two, three, or more
 magnets, each member of a line being strongly controlled
 by its next neighbours in that line, but little influenced by
 neighbours which lie off the line on either side. Thus, if
 there are two magnets simply, they form (as might be antici
 pated) a highly stable pair, thus:—
    With three magnets, two form a line along one side of the
triangle joining the fixed centres, and the third lies parallel,
or nearly so, facing oppositely. Four magnets will usually
form two lines with directions which lie nearly along two
sides of the quadrilateral ; but diagonally opposite magnets
may pair, leaving the others unattached. Suppose them set
at the corners of a rectangle with unequal sides, they may lie
in any of these forms

if the inequality in distance be not too great. All these con
figurations are stable, and the condition of least energy, while
making the first of them the most probable, does not prevent
the occasional formation of the others. In a long line, the
same condition leads in general to this formation :—
but it is by no means uncommon to find a line broken into
two or more sections, thus :—

    Experimental study of the forms which may be assumed
 by groups, and of the vibrations which may be transmitted
 through groups, is interesting, but to pursue it would be beside
 my present purpose. In all cases, the configuration assumed
 by a group is such that there is stability for small displace
 ments, but different positions of the group may be stable indif
 ferent degrees, and if members of the group be turned through
 a sufficiently great angle, they become unstable, and fall into a
 new position of stability, bringing about a partial reconstruc
 tion of the lines that characterize the group. Special interest
 attaches to square patterns, from the fact that iron and nickel
 (probably cobalt also) crystallize in the cubic system. In a
 square pattern of many members, we find, in general, lines
 running parallel with all sides of the square when the group
 settles without directive force after a disturbance.
    Let the group, or collection of groups, be subjected to an
 external magnetic force,        gradually increasing from zero.
 The first effect is to produce a stable deflexion of all members
 except those which lie exactly along or opposite to the
direction of JQ. This results in giving a small resultant
 moment to the group (assuming that there was none to begin
 with), which increases at a uniform or very nearly uniform
rate as     increases. This corresponds to the first stage in
the magnetization of iron or other magnetic metal (a, fig. 3) .
The initial susceptibility is a small finite quantity, and it is
sensibly uniform for very small values of
    Suppose that, without going beyond this stage, we remove
.£> ; the molecular magnets, not having been deflected beyond
the limit of stability, simply return to their initial places, and
 there is no residual magnetism. This, again, agrees with the fact
 that no residual magnetism is produced by very feeble mag
 netizing forces. Up to this point there has been no magnetic
 hysteresis. But let the value of .f) be increased until any

part of the group becomes unstable, and hysteresis immediately
comes into play. At the same time , there begins to be a
marked augmentation of susceptibility—that is to say, a
marked increase in the rate at which resultant moment is
acquired. It is not difficult to arrange groups in which the
state of instability is reached with one and the same value of
JQ throughout the group. Eut, in general, we shall have
different elementary magnets, or different lines of them,
reaching instability with different values of Jq. The range of
.£), however, which suffices <o bring about instability through
out the whole, or nearly the whole, of the members in most
groups is not large ; we, therefore, find in the action of the
model a close analogy to the second stage (/>, fig. 3) of the
process of magnetization, in which the magnetism rises more
or less suddenly, as well as to the first stage (a).

remove <£), we find that a very large proportion of the mo

and apply a magnetic force, Jo, in the direction sketched, the

through a small angle towards the line of

 (c) (fig. 3), which consists in the closer approach to satura
 tion that is caused by the molecules being more nearly pulled
 into exact line with .£) (fig. 6). Whether there will be insta
 bility during the deflexion of them from the lines of fig. 5
 will depend on the closeness of the poles, and on the inclina
tion of the lines of fig. 5 to the direction of .£) (see below).
 In some groups saturation will be complete with a finite value
 of .£) ; in others, it will only be closely approximated to. In
 magnetizing any actual specimen of iron, we have, of course,
 to deal with a multitude of groups the lines to which lie at
 very various inclinations to .£). If we remove the force .6 at
 a point in stage c, we find very little, if any, more residual
 magnetism than was found at the end of stage b.               The

the end of stage b, and diminishes as stage c proceeds.
This, again, agrees completely with the observed facts.

   There is some hysteresis during the removal (whether com
 plete or partial) and reapjilication of magnetic force, because
 (provided we have enough groups to deal with) there will be
 some lines of elements which pass to and fro through a con
 dition of instability during the removal and reapplication of
 the force. For certain inclinations of the line, the movements
 are not reversible.
    Suppose, next, that having applied and removed a strong
 force >p, leaving strong residual polarity, we begin slowly
 to reverse        At first, the effects are slignt ; presently, how
 ever, instability begins, and, as the force is increased within
 a narrow range, we find the molecules all upset. This is
 followed by a stage of nearly elastic deflexion as saturation is
 approached. Thus, the well-known general characteristics of
 cyclic processes are all reproduced in the model (see fig. 8
 below).

small. This, as Lord Kayleigh has shown", is what happens
in a magnetic metal, and the susceptibility with respect to
small cyclic changes is small in the model, just as it is in the
actual solid.
   The chief facts of permeability and retentiveness, and
hysteresis generally, are therefore at once explicable by sup
posing that Weber's molecular magnets are constrained by no
other forces than those due to their own mutual magnetic
attractions and repulsions. No arbitrary constraining forces
are required. In the model the centres of rotation are fixed;
in regard to the actual solid we may make an equivalent
supposition, namely, that the distances between the molecular
centres do not change (except in so far as they may bo
changed by strain).
   Hysteresis, then, is not the result of any quasi-fiictional
                     * Phil. Map. March 1887.

resistance to molecular rotations; it occurs whenever a mole
cule turns from one stable position of rest to another through
an unstable condition. When it is forced to return, it again
passes through a condition of instability. This process, con
sidered mechanically, is not reversible ; the forces are different
for the same displacement, going and coming, and there is
dissipation of energy. In the model the energy thus ex
pended sets the little bars swinging, and their swings take
some time to subside. In the actual solid the energy which
the molecular magnet loses as it swings through unstable
positions generates eddy currents in surrounding matter.
 Let the magnets of the model be furnished with air-vanes to
damp their swings, and the correspondence is complete.
   A regular group of elementary magnets, especially when
furnished with air-vanes, gives a good illustration of what has
been called magnetic viscosity. When the imposed force .£)
reaches a critical value one of the outer members of the group
becomes unstable, and swings slowly round ; its next neigh
bours, finding their stability weakened, follow suit, and the
disturbance spreads through the group in a way eminently
suggestive of those phenomena of time-lag in magnetization
which I have described in a former paper*.
   The model shows equally well other magnetic phenomena
which presumably depend on the inertia of the molecules,
such as the fact that a given force causes more magnetic
induction when suddenly applied than when gradually applied,
and leaves less residual magnetism when suddenly removed
than when gradually removed.
   The well-known effects of mechanical vibration in augment
ing magnetic susceptibility and reducing retentiveness are
readily explicable when we consider that vibration will cause
periodic changes in the distances between molecular centres.
This has not only a direct influence in making the molecular
magnets respond more easily to changes of magnetic force by
reducing their stability during the intervals when they recede
from each other, but tends indirectly towards the same result
by setting them swinging.
   The effects of temperature which are common to the
three magnetic metals may be stated thus:—Let any moderate
magnetizing force be applied, not strong enough to produce
anything like an approach to magnetic saturation, and let
the temperature be raised. Then the permeability increases
until the temperature reaches a certain (high) critical value,
at which, almost suddenly, there is an almost complete dis
appearance of magnetic equality. As regards the first effect,
                     * Roy. Soc. Proa, June 1889.

216            Prof. J. A. Ewing on the Molecular
it is clear that an increase of permeability is to be expected
from the theory ; expansion with rise of temperature involves
a separation of the molecular centres, and therefore a reduc
tion of stability. As regards the almost sudden loss of
susceptibility which occurs at a high temperature, it may do
no harm to hazard a rather wild conjecture. We may suppose
the molecular magnets to be swinging more or less, the
violence of the swings increasing as the temperature rises,
until finally it develops into rotation. Should this happen,
all trace of polarity would of course disappear. The con
jecture that the molecular magnets oscillate more and more
as the temperature rises, is at least supported by the fact
 (carefully investigated by Hopkinson * in iron and nickel ;
data for cobalt also have lately been supplied by du Bois t)
that under strong magnetic forces rise of temperature reduces
magnetism ; for with strong forces the molecular magnets
are already ranged so that their mean direction is nearly
parallel to .£>: hence the earlier effect of heat (to diminish
stability and facilitate alignment) does not tell, and the in
creased swinging simply results in reducing the mean value
for each molecule of its moment resolved parallel to the
magnetizing force.
   Before referring to effects of stress we may consider shortly
the stability of a pair or line of magnets, treating each as a
pair of poles subject to the law of inverse squares. Take first
a single pair of equal magnets with centres at C and C (fig. 7) .
The poles P P' would lie in the line CC, but for the imposed
force .£), which produces a deflexion CC'P' or C'C>P = 0.
   Let a be the angle which .£) makes with the line of centres,
m the pole-strength, and r the half length of the magnetic
axis of each magnet. The deflecting moment is
                           2$mrsin (* — 6),

first increases with 6, but passes a maximum at a value of 0
which depends on the relation of r to the distance between the
centres. The condition of equilibrium is

and as J$ and 8 are increased the equilibrium becomes neutral,
that is to say, the condition of instability is reached, when
                -r {2&mr sin (a - 6) \ = -y-n ,
   These two equations serve to determine the value of <£) and
of 0 at which instability occurs. If we have to deal with a
long line of magnets instead of a single pair, we have to
write 2m2 instead of ni* in the restoring moment.
   A considerable amount of stable deflexion is possible when
the distance between the poles is not small compared with r.
When the direction of Jq is not much inclined to CC (that is,
when a has a value approaching 0) there is no instability. In
rows with various inclinations to             the first to become
unstable as >£) is increased will be that for which «- 6 is equal
to \ 7T.
   If a, the half distance between the poles in the undeflected
position, be small compared with r, there is but little deflexion
before instability occurs, and in that case, provided a be not
small, nor nearly equal to ir, the occurrence of instability is
defined by the condition

of PP' to the line of centres. Hence, with the same proviso
 (a not nearly equal to 0 or to 7r, and a small compared with
r), the value of .p which causes the instability is
                         V    12^3.0' sin a
for a single pair of magnets, and twice this quantity for the
middle members of a long row. This is of course least for
magnets which lie normal to
   In the special case when a =7r, instability occurs when
                                  in
with the single pair, or m/ia2 with the row.
   Applied to the case of a group of rows, uniform in distance
between the centres, but various as regards their direction
with respect to Jq, these considerations show that after $ has
reached a value sufficient to make the most susceptible mem
bers unstable, no very great increase is required to bring
about instability in by far the greater number of the other
rows. One general effect of increasing the distance between
all the centres is to reduce the range of variation of .& within
which most of the different rows become unstable as the force
is progressively increased.
   In annealed metal, where we may expect considerable
general homogeneity, as regards distance between the centres
of the molecular magnets, we find that practically the whole
of the abrupt stage in the process of magnetization is included
within narrow limits of magnetizing force. We accordingly
obtain curves like A A (fig. 8).
   When the metal is strained sufficiently to receive permanent
set the curves take more rounded outlines (such as B B),
showing less susceptibility throughout, less residual mag
netism, and more coercive force. The most natural explana
tion of this, on the basis of the molecular theory, appears to
be that set produces on the whole a shortening of the dis
tances between molecular centres, hence greater stability and
more coercive force ; but this is associated with heterogeneity,
that is variety in the distances, hence the rounded outlines of
the curves. We know that set tends to develop, or at least to
emphasize, heterogeneity ; for instance, a bar of iron or steel
pulled in the testing-machine stretches irregularly after the
elastic limit is passed.

   The effects of stress and consequent elastic strain on mag
netic quality are so complex and so various in iron, nickel,
                                 Fig. 8.
 and cobalt, that it would be premature to attempt any full
  discussion of them from the point of view of the theory now
  sketched. Only a few general features need be referred to at
  present. Some of these can be traced experimentally in the
  model by setting the supports of the magnets upon a sheet of
  thin india-rubber, which may be stretched or distorted to
  imitate the conditions of longitudinal or torsional strain.
      When pulling stress is applied, those rows of molecular
  magnets which lie more or less along the direction of the
  stress have their stability reduced by the lengthening of the
  lines of centres ; similarly, rows which lie more or less normal
  to the stress have their stability increased. The resulting
  effect on the general susceptibility of the material will depend
   on which of these conflicting influences preponderates. Let
   pull be applied before magnetization begins, while the metal
   is still in a neutral state. The stretching of longitudinal lines
   and the contraction of transverse lines will not only alter the
   stability of those molecules which continue to lie in their
   original rows, but will tend to make the members of those

220           Prof. J. A. Ewing on the Molecular
rows winch are much lengthened swing round and form trans
verse lines in which they will be more stable than before.
We may therefore reasonably expect that the permeability
with regard to strong fields will be reduced by pull, as it
actually is both in iron and in nickel, though with regard to
weak fields the permeability may be increased, as it is in iron.
   Again, the theory explains well why the effects of stress
are by no means the same (1) when the stress is applied first
and the magnetic force after, and (2) when the magnetic force
is applied first and the stress after.
   Let a moderate magnetizing force be applied and then begin
to apply stress. The first effects are in general large, for the
strain precipitates into instability those molecular magnets
which were already on the verge of instability. This is
beautifully apparent in iron (see Phil. Trans. 1885, part ii.,
plates 63 and 64) ; and the theory shows why the first effects
are not reversible, why they do not disappear when the stress
is removed, and why it is only in subsequent applications and
removals of the stress that the magnetic changes become
cyclic.
   The same remark evidently applies to the first effects of
stress on residual magnetism ; also to the first effects of tem
perature-change either on induced or residual magnetism.
Again, the theory shows that when a cyclic change of stress
is repeated, there will be hysteresis in the corresponding
changes of magnetism, whether induced or residual, unless
either the cyclic range is very small or the magnetism ap
proaches saturation. During each application of the stress
 some molecular magnets will swing through nnstable posi
tions ; during the removal of stress they will swing back, but
 not at the same values of stress. And it will be characteristic
of this hysteresis that the variation in magnetism will begin
slowly when the change from applying to removing stress, or
from removing to applying stress, begins. All this agrees
with the facts.
   Moreover, the theory shows that even in the absence of any
resultant magnetization a cycle of stress makes the molecular
configuration pass through a series of changes which will at
first not be cyclic, but will become cyclic when the stress-cycle
is repeated, and in which any intermediate value of the stress
will be associated with different configurations during the
going and coming parts of the process. In other words, we
see that there will be hysteresis in the relation of molecular
configuration to stress when a cycle of stress is repeated.
Hence certain rather obscure effects which have been observed
in magnetic experiments; for instance, where an iron wire is

                   Theory nf Induced Magnetism.                       221
loaded and partially unloaded down to a given load before
being magnetized, its permeability is not the same as when
the wire is completely unloaded and reloaded up to the same
load. Experimental results of this kind led me in 1884 to
write :—" If we apply and remove stress in a wire whose
magnetic state is entirely neutral, we cause some kind of mole
cular displacement in the relation of which to the applied stress
there is hysteresis." * The theory now offered shows how this
happens. Hence also the remarkable hysteresis which the
thermoelectric quality of iron exhibits with regard to cyclic
changes of stress, discovered by Cohn, and more fully described
in Phil. Trans. 1886, p. 361. The hysteresis of molecular
configuration with respect to stress has been proved to be
removable or reducible by vibration.
   From this theoretical explanation of hysteresis in the effects
of stress, it at once follows that a cyclic change of stress
(provided it be not very small) involves some dissipation of
energy in a magnetic metal, whether the piece be magnetized
or not. We may expect this dissipation to be most consider
able under conditions which make the magnetic hysteresis
 large. But it will occur even when there is no external trace
of magnetism.
    This of course implies that, in a cyclic process of loading
and unloading, work must be spent. There is no perfect
 elasticity in a magnetic metal, however slowly the process of
straining be performed. Under any load there is less strain
 during application than during removal. This is borne out
 by experiments on the extension of iron wires (Brit. Assoc.
 Report, 1889, p. 502).
    The same action occurs to a marked degree in torsional
 strains. In a twisted specimen there will be a tendency
 on the part of the molecular magnets to range themselves
 along lines agreeing more or less with the direction of maxi
mum contraction. Alternate twisting to opposite sides should
therefore cause much molecular swinging through unstable
positions, with consequent dissipation of energy, even in a piece
which is not magnetized.
    Without going at present into details, it may be added that
the phenomena of molecular " accommodation " studied by
 Wiedemann and by H. Tomlinson accord with the theory,

in experiments with nickel wire under twist or under a com
bination of pull and twist. It also agrees with what little is
known as to the influence that previous magnetization in one
direction has upon subsequent magnetization in another
direction.
    To sum up, I have endeavoured to show :—
    (1) That in considering the magnetization of iron and other
magnetic metals to be caused by the turning of permanent
molecular magnets, we may look simply to the magnetic
forces which the molecular magnets exert on one another as
the cause of their directional stability. There is no need to
 suppose the existence of any quasi-elastic directing force or of
any quasi-frictional resistance to rotation.
    (2) That the intennolecular magnetic forces are sufficient
 to account for all the general characteristics of the process of
magnetization, including the variations of susceptibility which
occur as the magnetizing force is increased.
    (3) That the intennolecular magnetic forces are equally
competent to account for the known facts of retentiveness and
coercive force and the characteristics of cyclic magnetic
processes.
    (4) That magnetic hysteresis and the dissipation of energy
which hysteresis involves are due to molecular instability
resulting from intermolecular magnetic actions, and are not
due to anything in the nature of frictional resistance to the
rotation of the molecular magnets.
    (5) That this theory is wide enough to admit explanation
of the differences in magnetic quality which are shown by
different substances or by the same substance in different
states.
   (6) That it accounts in a general way for the known effects
of vibration, of temperature, and of stress upon magnetic
quality.
   (7) That in particular it accounts for the known fact that
there is hysteresis in the relation of magnetism to stress.
   (8) That it further explains why there is, in magnetic
metals, hysteresis in physical quality generally with respect
to stress, apart from the existence of magnetization.
   (9) That, in consequence, any (not very small) cycle of
stress occurring in a magnetic metal involves dissipation of
energy.

XXVI. A Formula for Calculating approximately the Self-
   induction of a Coil. By Professor John Perry, D.Sc,
   F.R.S.*
AN easy empirical formula for enabling the coefficient of
        self-induction (the inductance) of any coil to be calcu
lated with approximate correctness is very much wanted. I
have been led to take up the matter through having to design
an instrument with various cylindric coils whose inductances
should bear certain relations to one another, and it was neces
sary for me to see at a glance with some exactness the effect
of altering their dimensions. It is to be observed that for
practical purposes extreme accuracy of calculation is of no
importance, because the mechanical inaccuracies in construct
ing coils are considerable. It will be seen that my method of
arriving at what may almost be called a rational formula has
been suggested by Prof. James Thomson's ingenious method
of considering the flow of water over a rectangular gauge-
notch.
   I consider only hollow cylindric coils. Thus fig. 1 shows
the section of a coil whose dimensions are c centimetres mea
sured radially, b parallel to the axis, mean radius of coil a,
o o' being the axis. The supposition I make is that all the
                                                   c
coils considered are so long (b so great) that, - being the same
in all, the field near the ends is the same in all. Without
much straining of the meaning of words, we may say that the
inductance of a coil is the total induction when unit current
passes in the coil ; and if there is only one convolution, it is
 proportional to the reciprocal of what may be called the mag
netic resistance. My supposition comes to this : that if the
dimension b is great enough, increase of the magnetic resist
 ance produced by increasing b is proportional to the increase
 of b. Let MNM' (fig. 2) show the limiting length beyond
which increase of resistance will be proportional to increase of
length. Evidently M M' must be a function of c and a, and
if written in the shape 2sc it may be expected that s will be
constant for small values of -.     The magnetic resistance due,
then, to the end parts, A B, of the coil (fig. 1) will be the
 same as that of the coil, fig. 2. Now the magnetic resistances
 of all similar coils are inversely proportional to their dimen
 sions, and for all coils similar to that shown in fig. 2 for any

c X c and of mean radius a ; and the additional magnetic
resistance introduced by each of these is inversely proportional

   As sc is comparable with the axial distance inside a coil
 from the end, at which the lines of force are no longer per
 ceptibly curved, * may be supposed to be a proper fraction.
 In finding the values of p, q, and s, p and q being functions

 experimentally or by calculation, find L for various values of

a, b, and c, it is enough if one of these remain constant. Mr.
C. E. Holland has worked out for me the following values of
       m C.G.S. units, keeping e=l centimetre, from the series
published as Appendix III., page 321, vol. ii. of the second
edition of Maxwell s ' Electricity and Magnetism.' Unfortu
nately, unless the ratios of -and - are small, this series does

XXVII. The Changes of Property of Amalgams by Repeated
                Fusion. By Dr. G. Gore, F.R.S *
IT is well known that various alloys undergo a change of
       properties by repeated melting and cooling. Having
found during some experiments made for examining the
changes of volta-electromotive force of alloys during fusion,
that an amalgam composed of 1 part by weight of cadmium
and 4 of mercury gave different resnlts after each successive
melting, notwithstanding that the chemical composition of the
substance remained unaltered, I took a freshly made bar of
the substance and a strip of sheet platinum and formed a vol
taic couple with them in a solution composed of 1 part by
weight of common salt and 100 of distilled water, and ascer
tained the fixed amounts of deflexion it produced of the
needles of an ordinary torsion-galvanometer of 50 ohms
resistance after different numbers of fusions of the amalgam ;
they were as follows :—

                      12                        12
   The differences of strength of current were manifestly due
to the fusions, and not to any loss of mercury or oxidation of
the cadmium. The amalgam melted at 98 C, and was not
on any occasion heated above 130° C. There was no visible
fume or sublimate caused by volatilization of the mercury, and
it was found in a separate experiment that a diminution of as
much as 20 per cent, in the proportion of mercury, produced
 only about one degree difference of deflexion of the needles.
    I took a second freshly made bar of the same substance, and
 measured the electromotive force of the couple in the same
 electrolyte at 170-5 C. after each fusion and cooling, by the
 method of balance, with a suitable thermoelectric pile (see
 Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc. vol. iv. p. 130 ; ' The Electrician,'
 vol. xii. March 15, 1884, p. 414), and obtained the following

   At the first moment of immersion of the couple each day
the amount of temporary deflexion was about 30 degrees, and

230      Dr. O. Lodge on the Electrostatic Force between
the above numbers are the amounts of permanent deflexion
produced at the end of three minutes. The bar was wiped
dry after each experiment, and no error was produced by
oxidation ; and as a large bulk of the liquid was employed,
the diminution of amount of fixed deflexion was not due to
exhaustion of the solution. The diminished electromotive
force indicated a spontaneous molecular change going on in
the amalgam during the first few days.
   In order to find whether the amalgam altered in volume by
repeated fusion, the specific gravity of a fresbly made piece
was taken after the 1st and 6th fusion. The substance was
melted under water, and no loss of weight, or oxidation
occurred during the process.
After the 1st fusion the spec. grav. was =12-5438 at 140-5 C.
     „      6th      „       „      „      =12-6190      „
   From the various results obtained in this research and from
other considerations, I conclude that this amalgam, by the act
of fusion and subsequent cooling, and by spontaneous change,
suffers a loss of molecular motion, potential heat, chemical
activity, voltaic energy, diminishes in volume, and becomes
less corrodible in a solution of chloride of sodium. The
changes appear to be permanent.
   It is evident that the method employed, viz. measurement
of volta-electromotive force, may be used for detecting and
measuring physical changes produced in alloys by repeated
melting, lapse of time, &c.
XXVIII. On the Electrostatic Force between Conductors con
   veying Steady or Transient Currents. By Dr. Oliver
   Lodge*.
AT the last meeting of the Physical Society this session
       Mr. Boys described some attempts he had made to detect
mechanical force between a pair of Hertz resonators delicately
suspended and immersed in a region of electromagnetic waves.
   The attempt so far had not been successful; but Mr. Boys, by
attending to the energy manifested by Mr. Gregory's method
and by another method of his own, showed good reason why
the force, if any, was just too small to be observed even with
his extremely delicate appliances, and conjectured that a mo
derate increase in sensitiveness would be necessary in order to
detect the effect. Everyone must have full confidence that if
any such mechanical effect exists Mr. Boys will show it us

before long ; but, in common with Prof. Fitzgerald, I feel
provisionally and tentatively doubtful whether any mechanical
effect really exists between electric pulses travelling along
wires with the velocity of light. In a wire subject to electric
stationary waves there are obvious electrostatic pulses at either
end and electrokinetic pulses in the middle : but Mr. Boys
had allowed for all that, and arranged that the opposing effects
of ends and middle should conspire to assist each other in
causing rotation. What I felt doubtful about was whether
even in infinite wires, wherein all complication by reflexion
and stationary waves was avoided, a pair of pulses travelling
side by side, like a pair of humps (or a hump and a hollow')
on a pair of parallel cords, would exert any force on each
other. It is known that two charged bodies flying side by
side with the velocity of light will exert no sucn effect (Mr.
Heaviside has shown that this is equivalent to saying that two
elements in the same wave-front exert no mechanical force on
each other); but whether the same thing is true of two wire-
conducted pulses has not, so far as I know, been examined by
mathematicians.
    If it should turn out that pulses at full speed have no effect,
then two straight oscillators in similar phases should repel
each other, by the electrostatic effect of the slackening and
stationary pulses which are being reflected at the ends.
    Such an action seems optically rather interesting. Max
well predicted that a reflector or absorber would be repelled
by light ; though, as we know, the complication of the more
vigorous molecular action of material surroundings prevented
 Mr. Crookes from detecting this precise effect. We know,
however, that it must exist ; and the repulsive effects between
 alternating magnets and copper disks, detected by Faraday
and recently made much of in an interesting manner by Prof.
Elihu Thomson, are examples of this very thing. We can
even say what the stress caused by full sunshine ought to be,
viz. about 50 microbarads * ; that is, the weight of half a
 milligramme per square metre : but it has not yet been expe
rimentally observed. If Mr. Boys finds his effect, at least if
 he finds it in the form I suggest, as an overbalancing static
 repulsion, it will represent an action between two sources of
 light or between two similarly illuminated bodies.

232      Dr. O. Lodge on the Electrostatic Force between
by Mr. Boys' kindness, I made in a back room a hasty expe
riment on the pulses of a Leyden-jar discharge, which was
passed either in the same or in opposite directions through a
pair of flexible parallel strips of aluminium-foil, looked at
through a microscope.
    A fairly distinct effect was observed, its sign being, so far
as one could tell, the sign of the electrokinetic effect ; i. e.
attraction between currents in the same direction, repulsion
(more easily observed, because, as it was arranged, nearly
four times as strong) between opposing currents. Hence it
would seem, so far as this crude observation goes, that pulses
in wires do exert their electrodynamic effect. I expected,
however, that, by suitably arranging matters, the electrostatic
effect of the pulses could be made able to overpower their elec
tromagnetic effect. It is perhaps rather a barbarous plan
 to consider the two things separately ; but until some one
attacks the problem in a powerful manner I have been
 interested in groping at it, and accordingly make this com
 munication.
    First, consider the action of currents in general on each
 other, and find the ratio between their electrostatic and
 electrokinetic forces. So far as I know, the electrostatic
 force between two steady currents is usually overlooked.
    No advantage in generality is gained by treating two sepa
 rate circuits, a movable portion arranged near a fixed portion
 of one and the same circuit is sufficient.
    Arrange a short length, I, at a distance, a,
 from a long parallel conductor; with a resist
 ance, R, intervening between O and P, the
 middle opposite points of each ; and through
 the whole send a current, C, up one and down
 the other.
    Then the difference of potential between
 the two points is RC, or, with alternating
 currents, P C, where P is the impedance of
 the wire R ; and if the capacity per unit
 length of the two conductors is called S„
 the linear density of charge on each is on
 the average X=S,RC; a little more above
  0 and a little less below it ; but unless the
  distribution of potential differs greatly from
  a linear distribution, as when I is comparable
  to a wave-length, the mean value will serve.
     The electrostatic attraction between the
  two conductors is

Unless one of the conductors is very long there is another
term, which, however, it is unnecessary to write.
    The electrokinetic repulsion between the same conductors
is similarly

                         Steady Currents.
    Hence with steady currents the ratio of the static attraction
to the magnetic repulsion is
which on every possible system of units is a pure number.
    To get a notion of its value, suppose the wires to be round
and of radius p ; then
 so, remembering that
             ^£ = (the velocity of light)9 = (~~~~y>

     Suppose, for instance, the wires were 50 diameters apart, or
 4 log ajp = 18-4, the two forces would be equal, and just balance
 each other, if R was 552 ohms.
    With any resistance greater than this the electrostatic force
 would have the advantage, and two opposite currents in the
 given wires would attract.
                       Alternating Currents.
     If the current used is an alternating one, impedance must
 be inserted in (1) and (3) instead of resistance : no other
 change is necessary. Hence an impedance-meter suggests
 itself. Send a current alternating with given frequency

   Next proceed to consider the transient current of a Leyden-
jar discharge round the same circuit.
   Let a jar of capacity S charged to potential V0 be dis
charged round a circuit whose total resistance and inductance
are Eq and L0 respectively. Then the current at any instant

viously considered, when the discharge occurs, is therefore,
applying (2), an impulse :—

    To investigate the electrostatic attraction completely we
 should have to take into account the sinuous distribution of
 potential in space over the circuit ; but, unless the waves are
 much shorter than usual, the ultimate effect on a short length
 will be very little different from the effect of a uniform poten
 tial alternating sinuously in time, the difference of potential

   The first of these three numerical factors depends merely
 on the shape of the acting conductors and their distance
apart. The second is a proper fraction which may be made
as near unity as we choose. The third involves a comparison
between the electromagnetic measure of inductance of the wire
included in the circuit, and the electrostatic measure of
capacity of the discharged Leyden jar.
   Taking as an example the same round wire conductor as
before, with

 and considering j— as (~|q^ for insfance, we perceive that
 the two impulses will be equal and just balance each other if
 the length representing L on the magnetic system of units
 be 400 times as great as the length representing S on the
 electrostatic system. Any wire longer than this gives
 attraction the advantage ; any wire shorter than this favours
 repulsion.
    Or, with different jars discharging round a given circuit,
 small jars will exhibit the electrostatic impulse, big ones the
 electrokinetic.

    If strips are used instead of round wires for the movable con

given it : for take a pair of similar strips, of length I, breadth

easily calculated to be

to be immaterial ; and its value decreases steadily towards
zero, viz. ^ ir cot a, as a approaches 90° ; the whole becoming
ultimately 27r/*C1 . CI.
    As for the electrostatic force between strips, I do not know
how far we are justified in assuming uniform distribution of
density, even if given uniform distribution of current ; but
at least when the plates are close together the force will not
be very different from
the value of St being —

considerable accuracy without difficulty. Some of Mr. Boys'
quartz-fibre and aluminium-tube devices ought to permit the
zero of force to be sharply got, and thus a good measure of

   If the acting conductors are set very near each other, a
being still the distance between their centres, the denominator
alters itself a little, becoming

              Action of Moving Charges and Pulses.
   So far I have not taken into account the sinuosity of dis
tribution of Leyden-jar discharges in space, nor the possibility
of pulses passing the two portions of the circuit between
which the force is being observed at different times or in
different phases. It would seem as if a small assemblage of
short-waved pulses sent round a long circuit might be pre
vented from exerting any mechanical action on each other if
the adjacent parts of the circuit in which their action was to
be observed were purposely separated by an intervening length
of wire of many wave-lengths unsymmetrically introduced
into the circuit. But before committing myself I should
like to make a few experiments. Nevertheless I am tempted
to go on a little further.

wires, we consider charged wires moving along endways witb

238      Dr. O. Lodge on the Electrostatic Force between
the speed of light, Mr. Heaviside has attacked the general
problem in the Philosophical Magazine for April 1889. He
there shows that between two planes perpendicular to a wire
thus moving and moving with it at a distance apart equal to
the length of the wire, the electrostatic intensity is
                             E=Kr'
and the magnetic intensity is
                            H = ^,
                                   r
where X, the linear density, may be distributed anyhow on the
wire. Outside these two planes the force is zero.
   If the two intensities were to act, one on a stationary charge
of any number of electrostatic units, the other on a stationary
magnetic pole of the same number of magnetic units, the two
forces would be equal. If they act on a wire conveying a
steady current, and charged up to a certain linear density,
the forces will be equal when the statical measure of density is
equal to the magnetic measure of current, i. e. when C = i?X;
for then
                            E\ = H/tC.
   Lastly, if the two forces due to one bit of charged wire,
moving in its own line with the speed of light, act on
another similarly moving piece, the current equivalent to the
second wire will be v\' ; and again there will be an equality
between electrostatic and electrokinetic forces ;

                      Kr         r
Not by any different X, or by any rearrangement of X, can the
balance be disturbed : only by a different v. If either wire
moves with velocity less than that of light, the electrostatic
force overpowers the other, but, so long as the full velocity
is maintained, the density on either wire may have any value
positive or negative without disturbing the balance ; and this
 is natural enough, when, as here, X and 0 vary together ;
 for if X be zero or negative anywhere, C is also zero and
 negative, and the balance persists.
    Now proceed to the case of alternating pulses travelling
 along parallel stationary wires. Their speed of travel is the
 speed of light, and though the distribution of both density
 and current is sinuous there is nothing in that disturbing to
 a balance; moreover, so long as the waves are freely progres
 sive, Xand C still accompany each other exactly, and nothing
 but a balance will be observed in a closed circuit, however the
 phases operating in the acting portions be altered, if the right

      Conductors conveying Steady or Transient Currents.       239
proportion holds between the current and the potential, as
already calculated.
   But if by reflexion at distant unjoined ends of an open
circuit the pulses be turned from progressive into stationary
waves, then localities can be found on the wires at which
attraction or repulsion permanently occurs ; for \ and C are
no longer companions, the sinuous distribution of current lags
a quarter period behind the sinuous distribution of charge.
Hence at a given instant there will be places where the cur
rent force is a maximum and the static force zero ; while at
a quarter wave-length on either side the current force is zero
and the static force a maximum. Halfway between these
places only will the two forces be equal, but with alternate
agreement and disagreement of sign. A readjustment of
phase between the conductors will now make all the difference;
a shift of a quarter wave-length changing from maximum to
zero, and a shift of half a wave-length bringing about reversal
of sign.
   According to all this therefore (if it be correct) it follows
that the simple ideas on which Mr. Boys set to work are right
after all, and that he will detect the forces in the way ha
expects.
                      Variation with Distance.
    A few words as to the magnitude of the effect to be ex
pected. Hertz has shown (see ' Nature/ vol. xxxix. p. 404)
that at a reasonable distance from a rectilinear oscillator, one
 or two wave-lengths being practically sufficient, the electric
 force (or electromotive intensity) is perpendicular to the
 radius vector from middle of oscillator, and is of magnitude

    Calling the length of the oscillator the axis, and the normal
 plane through its middle the equator, this means that the
 electric force is a maximum at the equator, diminishes towards
 the poles, and varies along any radius with the inverse distance
from the centre.
    At smaller distances the law is not so simple, but at any dis
 tance in the equatorial plane the electric oscillation is parallel
 to the oscillator, and of amplitude

 the inverse cube of the distance, at intermediate distances

Take as a numerical example any convenient oscillator,
say, to avoid unnecessary repetition of specification, the
small oscillator drawn to scale on page 54 of the Philoso-
sophical Magazine for July 1889, which emits waves 1 metre
long: let its constant c=4£, and its spark be, as there
quoted, 8 millimetres, so that V0 is about 26,000 volts. Then
the initial electric intensity at a distance of a couple of wave
lengths in the equator is

proportion of 3 : 2.
   The difference of potential V is not constant, but decreases
logarithmically according to the law
                          V = V0e~*Z;
where R is a dissipation-coefficient of the dimension of re
sistance, and of value easily found, thus:—
   Total energy radiated for every spark of the oscillator is
                             .dt =
               f     Ufivc*           12five* '
which must also equal iSV02, the initial energy ; hence
                    R=12/«>c8=360c2ohms.
   Taking as a numerical example the same oscillator as above,
with c=4£ and V = 88 electrostatic units, all these values are
easily estimated. For instance the mean energy of the
radiation per unit volume at any considerable distance r, say
2 metres, in the equator, is
       KV8 _ 88x88 _ 3-8 _ 3-8 ,
     32mrV       25 x 81r* ~ r> ~ 4 x 104           s
                   = 95 microbarads, at a distance of two metres.
   This will cause a momentary pressure on a metallic surface
normally exposed to it, of 95 microdynes per square centimetre,
or a milligram weight per square metre ; and is nearly twice
as strong as full sunshine while it lasts.
   At 1 metre distance, I need hardly say, the energy and the
pressure are 4 times as great.
   The area of energy absorbed by a fine wire linear receiver
may be estimated roughly by finding the closeness of a grid

  242       Dr. O. Lodge on the Electrostatic Force between
  of parallel wires which would just not let any radiation pass
  through it. Suppose, for instance, that a grid with wires
  10 centimetres apart satisfies this condition ; then each wire
  mops up energy for a breadth of 5 centimetres on either side
  of itself. The heat generated in such a wire at each spark is
                                  47rr2 . 21 SV

to encroach on each other's field, the current attraction be

   It is in accordance with theory to assert that the action
of two given magnets on each other varies inversely with
the permeability of the medium ; that the action of two
currents on each other varies directly as the permeability of
the medium ; and that the action of a current on a given
magnet is independent of the properties of the medium.
   To avoid misunderstanding, it must be perceived that the
statement refers to a given magnet, not to a magnet of
numerically specified strength, because about that there
would be some ambiguity according to the medium in which
it was measured.
   Similarly, the static action between two charges is inversely
as the dielectric constant of the medium ; the action between
a given charge moving at the approximate light-speed and a
given magnet is independent of the medium, except in so
far as its properties affect the velocity of light; while the
dynamic action between two given charges moving together
at the light-speed is proportional to the permeability.
   It may be as well to have direct experimental verification
for some of these things.

XXIX. The Interactions of Circular and Longitudinal Mag
    netizations. {Preliminary Note.) By Prof. C. G. Knott,
    D.Sc*
IN the course of an extended series of investigations into
        the relations of magnetism and stress, part of which is
already published in the Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. (vol. xxxv.),
I was led to consider the effect of a current passing along a
wire upon its longitudinal magnetic intensity. Wiedemann,
Buff, and Villarif have discussed this problem in some of its
aspects. It does not seem possible, however, to deduce from
their results completely satisfactory conclusions as to the
effect of the current upon the apparent longitudinal permea
bility. The question as it presented itself to my mind was
not so much as to the effect of a varying current along the
wire upon the apparent longitudinal moment, but rather as to
the behaviour of the wire in various longitudinal fields
according as it was carrying a current or not. It was to be
expected, in accordance with the results of previous investi
gators, that a diminution of longitudinal intensity would be
an evident accompaniment of a steadily sustained circular
magnetization. In other words, the susceptibility to a longi
tudinal magnetizing force would, in all probability, be smaller
when a current was passing along the wire. This has been
fully established in the experiments, of which this forms a
short preliminary note. Other effects, however, have been
observed, which are (so far as I know) novel, and which may
lead to clearer views regarding the internal structure of
magnets and magnetized matter.
   In the experimental work I have been assisted by Mr.Tsuruta,
a graduating student of physics in the Imperial University.
    The wire to be experimented with was carefully annealed
and then inserted as the core of a solenoid of copper wire of
138 coils per centimetre length. The wire and solenoid lay
magnetically east and west, and at a suitable distance from
the one end a delicately suspended mirror with small magnets
attached to its back served in the usual way as the magneto
meter. The deflexions were measured by the familiar reflected -
beam method, the spot of light moving over a scale at a dis
tance of 1-7 metre from the magnetometer-mirror. Before
the wire was inserted, the electromagnetic action of the coil
on the magnetometer was corrected by a small adjustable coil

Society of Edinburgh, July 21, 1800.

Interactions of Circular and Longitudinal Magnetizations.     245
in circuit with the solenoid and set close to the magnetometer.
The wire was then inserted, and subjected to cyclic variations
of magnetic force. The magnetizing current was changed
continuously from a given positive value to an equal negative
value, and back again to the original positive value. The
variation was effected in a gradual manner by means of a
liquid rheostat, consisting of a column of dilute sulphate of
zinc with zinc electrodes, through which a steady current
from a battery of Daniell cells was constantly flowing. By
means of a sliding zinc electrode, the necessary current was
shunted through the solenoid circuit. The tangent^galvano-
meter included in this circuit was of course far removed from
the solenoid, and was so placed that the operator, in adjusting
the rheostat, could easily read the galvanometer-deflexion.
    In the earlier experiments careful attention was paid to the
first effects, as well as to the permanent cyclic condition which
soon becomes established after a few cyclic changes of the
 magnetizing current have been gone through. At suitable
 stages in the variation of the current, the current was kept
 steady until the corresponding deflexion of the magnetometer-
needle was observed and noted. These remarks will suffice at
 present to indicate the general method adopted in studying
 the cyclic changes, which have been so fully investigated by
Warburg and Ewing.
    One of my objects was to study the modification produced
on this cycle and on whatever else may be associated with it,
when a current is passed along the magnetized wire. This
linear current (as we shall call it) was derived from one or
more Bunsen cells. It entered the iron wire at the end
 furthest removed from the magnetometer and returned along
two copper wires stretched parallel to the iron wire and very
 close to it.
    A complete set of experiments consisted in :—
    (1) Taking a permanent magnetic cycle when no linear
        current was flowing along the wire.
    (2) Observing the initial effect when the linear current was
        made to flow in one direction along the wire, and taking
        the permanent magnetic cycle with this current kept
        steady.
    (3) Observing the initial effect when the linear current was
        broken, and taking again the permanent magnetic cycle
        as in (1).
    (4) Observing the initial effect of the linear current put on
        in the other direction, and taking the permanent mag
        netic cycle with this current steady.
    (5) Operating as in (3).

246         Prof. C. G. Knott on the Interactions of
   It was soon found that in good experiments the permanent
magnetic cycles in (1), (3), and (5) were practically identical ;
so that in later experiments (3) was omitted. It was also
established by direct experiment that the permanent magnetic
cycle in (2) was quite independent of the magnetic condition
of the wire when the linear current was put on.
   Some of the features of the case are shown in the curves
given. This is chosen as an average type, the departures
from which, when the relative magnitudes of linear current
and field are altered, will be briefly indicated below. In these
curves magnetic force {iQ) is measured horizontally, magnetic
intensity (3^ measured vertically. The magnetic force is
given in electromagnetic C.G.S. units ; and the magnetic
intensity (very roughly) in the same.
   Curve a corresponds to the permanent magnetic cycles
(1), (3), (5) ; curves b and c give the cycles when the linear
current is flowing first in the one and then in the other direc
tion. The current used in this experiment was about two
amperes.
   A glance at these curves is sufficient to teach us that the
linear current modifies the properties of iron in relation to
the magnetic after-effect in three well marked ways.
   First, the total range of magnetic intensity produced by a
given cyclic variation of magnetic force is markedly dimi

            Circular and Longitudinal Magnetizations.         247
nished when the current is flowing along the wire. This
means a diminution in susceptibility. Here also may be
mentioned the fact that the first effect of putting on the cur
rent when the wire is strongly magnetized is a diminution of
longitudinal magnetic intensity.
    Secondly, when the linear current is flowing, the average
magnetic intensity over a whole cycle no longer corresponds
to the condition of zero polarity, as in the normal case when
no linear current is flowing. For the one current, the mag
netic intensity oscillates, so to speak, about a large positive
polarity; and for the current in the reverse direction it oscil
lates about a nearly equal negative polarity. If we reckon
polarity in the usual way as a directed quantity measured
from the south pole to the north, then the direction of the
linear current is in the same direction as the average polarity
which it sustains, when the wire is subjected to an absolutely
symmetrical cycle of magnetizing force on each side of zero.
    Thirdly, the curves b and c are no longer symmetrical on
the side of the zero-line of magnetic force. The closed curve
b is more pointed at its positive end than at its negative end ;
the curve c, on the other hand, is more pointed at its negative
end than at its positive. If we turn the figure upside down,
the general appearance remains the same as before. Thus the
effect of the linear current is such as very distinctly to modify
the form of the ascending and descending branches. The
descending branch of b is very similar to the ascending branch
of c ; and the ascending branch of b is very similar to the
descending branch of c. We may connect this peculiarity
with the peculiarities already described in these words :—
    A current passing along an iron wire, which is being mag
netized, diminishes the apparent susceptibility of the wire ;
but this effect is more pronounced when the wire is acquiring
a longitudinal polarity in the opposite direction to that in
which the linear current is flowing. Hence, during any cyclic
operation, the wire tends to acquire an average polarity in the
same direction as that in which the current flows.
    These effects are more pronounced the stronger the linear
 current is as compared with the magnetizing field. In a
 moderate cyclic field the effect of the linear current may be
 so strong as to prevent the wire ever acquiring other than one
kind of polarity. For example, this effect was produced in a
 field +4 with a current of nearly 2 amperes. For the linear
 current in one direction the b curve never dipped below the
 zero-intensity line, and for the current in the other direction
 the curve c never rose above it.
    On the other hand, in stronger magnetizing fields, from 10

248    Prof. C. V. Boys on Photographs of Rapidly Moving
and upwards, the b and c curves for the same linear current
of 2 amperes tend to terminal coincidence, but diverge at the
intermediate stages. It is proposed to study more fully these
relations, and to extend the investigations to nickel and cobalt.
   In the course of these experiments an effect was noticed
which demonstrates the extraordinary complexity of magnetic
distribution in a magnetized wire. If, before the wire has
been magnetized at all, a current is passed along it no appre
ciable longitudinal polarity is produced, as measured by a
magnetometer-needle placed as in the above experiments.
Suppose, however, that the wire has been pretty strongly
magnetized ; and that, in the manner discovered by Auerbach,
and used almost universally now, the wire is demagnetized
by reversals of gradually diminishing magnetizing currents
until the magnetometer-needle stands almost exactly at zero.
It is of course generally recognized that the wire so demag
netized cannot be regarded as being in anything like the same
condition as it was in its originally unmagnetized state,
although it appears to have lost polarity. That this view is
correct may be at once demonstrated by simply passing a
pretty strong current along the wire, when a very pronounced
polarity will be evidenced by a comparatively large de
flexion of the magnetometer-needle. Reversing the current
will reverse this polarity. Heating to a red heat can alone
truly demagnetize an iron wire.

1. T HAD occasion last Christmas to show to a juvenile
    A audience a modification by the late Dr. Guthrie of one
of Plateau's experiments, which beautifully illustrates the effect
of the surface-tension of a liquid during the growth and for
mation of a drop. Under ordinary circumstances a drop of
water is so small that the formation of the neck and separa
tion of the drop are too rapid for it to be possible to follow
the process by the eye. If the drops were larger the process
would be slower, but a larger drop, owing to the weight of
water, cannot be formed in air. Dr. Guthrie caused the drop

         Objects, and on the Oscillating Electric Spark.   249
to grow at the end of a pipe half an inch or so in diameter
dipped below the surface of paraffin. By this means the
effective .weight of the drop is very much reduced, and the
surface tension is reduced, so that a large drop can be formed,
and the process is made comparatively slow. 1 have found
 that the development of the drop can be made still more
gradual, and that still larger drops may be formed by adding
bisulphide of carbon to the paraffin so as further to reduce
the effective weight of the drop.
   While trying to devise some way of representing this expe
riment on paper, I saw at the Royal Institution an apparatus
exhibited by Mr. Friese Greene, with which photographs at
the rate of ten a second could be taken upon a travelling film
moved on between and stopped during each exposure.
   Examination of the growing drop through a small window
in a card disk made to rotate ten times a second, showed that
even this rate applied to large and slowly forming drops was
not sufficient to give anything like a continuous representa
tion of the forms assumed. However, I found no difficulty in
obtaining twenty photographs a second ; and, had I required
them, I could certainly have obtained fifty sharp and fully
exposed photographs in this time, by the following method :—
An electric arc was focused by a pair of seven-inch lenses
upon the lens of an ordinary half-plate camera. A box with
a glass front and back, containing the liquids and the growing
drop, was placed immediately in front of the large lenses, and
the drops were focused by the lens of the camera upon the
ground-glass screen at the end of a slide forty-two inches
long. This could be charged with four 10 x 4 plates (two
10x8 plates cut longitudinally), and then be drawn by hand
from one end to the other of a seven-foot slide which protected
the plates from light everywhere except at one place where a
window 4x1 inches had been cut. Through this window the
image of the falling drops was cast upon the moving plate.
Just in front of the camera-lens a disk of card with an
aperture near the edge was made to rotate at any desired
speed by one of Cuttriss's P. 1 motors. Everthing was then
started, and the speed of the motor and rate of dropping ad
justed until the really intermittent but apparently continuous
view of the phenomenon upon the ground plate was as desired.
The slide was then rapidly drawn from end to end by hand,
the speed being such as to obtain rather more than one com
plete cycle during the motion of the slide. In the photograph,
of a portion of which Plate VI. fig. 1 is an exact copy, the
exposures were at the rate of fourteen a second, and lasted
 about one five hundred and sixtieth of a second each. The

250     Prof. C. V. Boys on Photographs of Rapidly Moving
exposure was more than enough to make a perfectly black
and white negative, and the outlines were clear and sharp.
Another series taken at the rate of twenty a second with an
exposure of one eight hundredth of a second each, in which
forty-three separate views were taken in the complete cycle,
was cut up into strips and mounted on a large disk of card
board with forty-three equidistant and narrow slits near the
edge. When the cardboard is made to rotate in front of a
looking-glass, after the fashion of the thaumatrope, the
original experiment is again perfectly presented, and all the
features are evident without the necessity for using these
objectionable liquids. The drop is seen to slowly enlarge until
it is too heavy to be supported by the surface-tension, the
form becomes unstable, a neck begins to develop, which
gradually gets narrower until the drop separates. The free
drop being suddenly released from the one-sided pull, vibrates
as it falls, not in the manner figured in the text-books, be
tween a prolate and oblate spheroid, but rather in a triangular
 fashion, with the base and vertex alternately uppermost, as
 recently described by Ph. Lenard*. The falling drop reaches
the water at the bottom of the box, where it vanisnes for a
 time only, for it has not mixed with this water, and so it
presently bounces out, as shown in fig. 1, after which it again
 falls into the water. Meanwhile the end of the neck from
 which the drop broke away has gathered itself together into
 the little drop or spherule so ably described by Plateau,
 which has an upward velocity imparted to it, since it separated
 from the upper or pendant drop after the falling drop had
 broken away. Moreover, just as the falling drop vibrates
 after it is released, so the pendant drop vibrates also and grows
 as it vibrates, coming into collision with the upward moving
 spherule, which it drives away by a blow. Fig. 2 is a reduced
 copy of the thaumatrope. The method described could be
.made more perfect by using films on roPers driven by the
 same motor that makes the card rotate, so that the separate
 photographs should neither overlap nor leave space un
 occupied ; but I did not make use of this refinement, as
 my object was simply to get the true outline in a particular
 experiment, and not to construct a piece of mechanism. The
 apparatus described was simply extemporized out of the
 materials at hand, and it answered my purpose perfectly.
    2. As I wished in the lectures referred to above to show
that exactly the same process goes on even when the finest
jet of water breaks up into beads, though of course the pro
cess is hundreds or thousands of times more rapid, I was

          Objects, and on the Oscillating Electric Spark.    251
 anxious to obtain photographs of these forms which should
 be as sharp and as clear as the photographs already described.
  Mr. Chichester Bell described to me in a letter a method
  which he had used successfully for this purpose, which is
  more especially interesting now, as Lord Rayleigh has recently
  exhibited photographs taken by a very similar method. Mr.
  Chichester Bell simply makes a small spark with one or two
  Leyden jars several feet away from the plate. The jet of
  water is allowed to fall between the spark and the plate, but
. as close to the plate as possible. The shadow cast under
  these conditions is perfectly sharp and will stand considerable
  magnification, and the light is quite sufficient to blacken the
  plate except when the water-drop protects it. Fig. 3 is an

252    Prof. C. V. Boys on Photographs of Rapidly Moving
enlargement of one of these photo
graphs. The water was broken up re
gularly by simply blowing into a key
which whistled a note of 2730 complete
vibrations a second, so that each drop
moved to the position occupied by the
next in the 07^0 of a second. Lord
Rayleigh photographed jets of water
by the spark with a camera and lens,
using in addition a large condensing
and field lens, so as to obtain sufficient
light ; but it appears that the glass of
the lenses is not of much advantage, if
any, because, as he himself has since
suggested, it absorbs so large a pro
portion of the ultra-violet rays that
the gain by concentration is about
balanced by the absorption of the
most actinic rays.
   3. Having found by the shadow
method that there was an abundance
of light from a comparatively feeble
spark, I thought it possible that each
half period of an oscillating spark
might produce sufficient light to leave
a clear record on a rapidly moving
photographic plate of the shadow of
small and rapidly moving objects. To
put this to the test of experiment, the
following arrangement was made. In
the first place an oscillating spark was formed between a pair of
polished brass knobs about one tenth of an inch apart, by dis
charging a condenser of large capacity through one or two coils
of gutta-percha-covered copper wire to give self-induction.
Details of the electrical arrangements will be given at the
end of these notes ; but I may state here that the separate
flashes of light in the spark followed one another at the rate
of about 4500 a second. A " half plate " was held in a recess
in a disk of wood screwed to a whirling-table, so that it could
be made to rotate in its own plane at a high speed. A card-
screen with a narrow slit was placed just in front of the plate,
so that the light from the spark could fall on the plate through
the slit. The jet of wateF was then formed just in front of.
the slit, and when the plate was rapidly revolving the spark
was formed. The plate, on being developed, was found to have
impressed upon it a picture like an open fan with the water-

         Objects, and on tJie Oscillating Electric Spark.     253
drops arranged in spiral lines. This method was not so con
venient as a modification in which, instead of a glass plate
spinning in its own plane, a flexible film was employed,
wrapped round and held by two india-rubber bands upon a
brass cylinder 1£ inches in diameter. This could be made to
rotate at a very high speed by means of a light band from a
whirling-table. PI. VI. fig. 4 is a copy of a photograph obtained
in this way. Here it will be seen that the intermittent light
is automatically produced, and the period of the intermittence
is constant for any particular apparatus. However, as carried
out, the value of this method of observing the movements
of rapidly moving bodies loses its practical value because the
spark is alight during a large proportion of the time of each
oscillation, so that it is by no means an instantaneous
phenomenon.
   4. In order to show the oscillating spark and to examine it
by photography, I wished to have some more convenient
means than the rotating mirror employed by Dr. Lodge.
With this the observer is taken by surprise whenever a spark
passes, for he does not know exactly in what direction to look,
and therefore he finds it more difficult to recognize the
peculiarities of the drawn-out spark than he would if he were
certain that he would see the spark in the exact direction in
which he was looking. Besides this it is not easy, when
photographing the spark, to ensure that the whole phenome
non from the birth to the dying flickers of every spark shall
be impressed upon the plate.
    The method which I am about to describe appears to me to
attain these ends more perfectly than any other with which I
am acquainted, and it does not introduce any difficulties
of its own.
    A brass disk (PI. VI. fig. 5) has six achromatic opera-glass
 lenses of about seven inches focus screwed into it, but not at
 the same distance from the axis. One pair, 1, 1, on opposite
sides of a diameter are placed equidistant from the axis ; the
next pair 2, 2 are placed one tenth of an inch nearer the axis ;
the third pair 3, 3 one tenth of an inch nearer still. The
wheel is mounted on an axle, carrying a grooved pulley-wheel,
and is accurately balanced. It may then be made to rotate, if
necessary, at the very high speed of over a hundred turns a
second. The spark is formed on one side of the plate, and a
screen or photographic plate is held on the opposite side ; and
the two are so adjusted that the spark is focused upon the
screen or plate. Now, when the disk is made to rotate, the
image of the spark is drawn out into a beaded band ; but as it
is possible to turn the disk so fast that it has moved through

254     Prof. C. V. Boys on PkotograpJts ofRapidly Moving
an angle of nearly one hundred and eighty degrees during
the existence of a spark, while to turn it through a right
angle is perfectly easy, each lens will project a beaded arc of
a circle perhaps nearly half a turn in extent. If the separate
lenses were all at the same distance from the axis, these six
semicircular arcs would be projected on the top of one
another and confusion would result; but as they are displaced
by an amount which is about the same as the length of a
convenient spark, the separate arcs are just made to clear one
another. Therefore, if the plate is large enough to take an
arc of t1le length of sixty degrees, the whole record of the
spark will afterwards be found upon it. By this means it is
possible to make use of the high speed which is necessary to
widely separate the several constituents of the oscillating
spark without at the same time causing the record to be
spoiled by the overlapping of the image formed by one lens
by that produced by the next. A single pair of lenses, in
stead of six, would prevent the overlapping, but then to
certainly obtain the whole record it would be necessary to
make the plate receive an arc of one hundred and eighty
degrees, which, on optical grounds, would be objectionable.
If the sparks are to be shown on a screen it is best to make
the spark in the axis of rotation, and show the complete circle
or a large part of it; but if the image is to be photographed, it
is best to place the spark exactly opposite one lens and use
such a size of plate that when the disk is turned one image
just begins to leave the plate on one side when the next is
coming in on the other.
    In order to make the most of a plate, it is convenient to
expose it in a common camera-slide held in the hand or in a
groove behind a card screen, with a curved aperture of such
a size that the image from all three lenses can fall upon the
plate. The plate can then be moved on by hand one stage after
every spark, and live or six groups taken on one half plate.
Specimens of portions of a few of the photographs obtained are
arranged together in PI. VI. fig. 6.
     Dr. Lodge has lately photographed oscillatory sparks,
and has observed their peculiarities; 1 shall therefore do no
more than merely mention the most striking features. The
spark is obviously alight nearly all the time that it lasts, the
intervals of darkness are short. The oscillatory spark proper
is, I believe, always determined by what may be called a pilot-
spark, due to the discharge of the knobs and wires outside the
self-induction.
    The pilot-spark is well seen at p in A, fig. 6, which is a
photograph taken with a very high speed and considerable

           Objects, and on the Oscillating Electric Spark.                  255
magnification. That this pilot-spark is due to the discharge
of the knobs is certain, because in the first placo it is a
quarter period behind the centre of the first spark of the
oscillation proper, and in the second place because in a photo
graph taken under similar conditions, but after a small
Leyden-jar had been directly connected to the terminals, the
pilot-spark was far brighter than before and was even brighter
than any of the succeeding alternating elements, while it occu
pied the same place, namely one quarter period before the
centre of the first spark of the oscillation proper. The very
exact analogy between' the motion of the electricity in an
oscillating spark and of the bob of a common pendulum may
be worth tracing :—
   The electric displacement gradu           The displacement of the bob

     In order to increase the total number of oscillations, I have
 introduced what I call a trap, which consists of a second air-
 gap in the circuit kept open by a prop while a strong spring
 tends to close it. The spark-gap is then made very short, but
 the potential can be raised up to any degree that the con

256    Prof. C. V. Boys on Photographs of Rapidly Moving
denser will safely stand. A string tied to the prop is then
pulled, and the spring completes the second gap so quickly
that not more than one or two oscillations can take place after
the spark hegins and before the filling of the air-gap at the
trap. Thus a higher potential can be obtained than would be
possible if the short working spark-gap alone determined the
potential, while the resistance in circuit is less than before
owing to the shortness of the spark.
   Two sparks taken with the trap are shown in B, fig. 6.
Two longer sparks taken without a trap are reproduced in
C, fig. 6. The gain in number of oscillations is not very great,
as the measures by Messrs. Robson and Smith at the end of
this paper show ; but there is a gain, especially as compared
with a short spark taken without a trap. The trap, however,
is practically useful in another way, it enables one to fix
the instant at which the spark shall occur, which, besides
being convenient, is important if for any reason the highest
possible speed of rotation is required. While the lenses will
run continuously at so low a speed comparatively as fifty or
seventy revolutions a second, it would not be well to run them
at high speeds for more than a few seconds together. By the
use of the trap t1ns is possible, whereas, if the high speed had
to be kept up during the long time that it takes to charge a
condenser of so great a capacity to the sparking-point, there
would be great risk to the bearings of the wheel of ienses.
For instance, to obtain a spark about one tenth of an inch
long from the condenser used in these experiments, from
twenty to thirty turns of the handle of a large eight-plate
Wimshurst machine had to be made.
   Anomalous variations of brilliancy are not unusual, as may
be seen in A, but a curious example is indicated by the letter
p in D. This represents the latter or dying portion of a
spark taken on the same negative and under the same general
conditions as A. In this case it will be seen that the light
instead of going out at the end of an oscillation travelled
slowly across the gap to the other terminal, forming apparently
a kind of ball-discharge.
   One series of photographs I may here refer to, though
the effect sought for is not so evident as I had expected. In
this series a short vertical spark was formed, with its length
parallel to the direction of the motion of the lens which at
any time might be opposite to it. A magnetic field was pro
duced in the line joining the spark and the lens. Then it was
hoped that the current oscillating backwards and forwards
would be largely deflected laterally alternately on either side
so as to produce a zigzag impression. The arrangements

          Ohjects, and on the Oscillating Electric Spark.   257
were very imperfect, but there is a very slight lateral shift
which I believe to be real, but it will be necessary to try the
experiment again under more perfect conditions.
   I must express my obligation to our lecture-assistant, Mr.
R. Chapman, who has performed the whole of the purely
photographic part of the experiments, and whose experience
in this direction has been of very great service.
   The following are the particulars of the apparatus that has
been used. The electrical constants were determined by
Messrs. W. G. Robson and S. W. J. Smith.
                             Condenser.
   A wooden tray was made, as shown in fig. 7, 28£ inches
long and 16£ inches wide inside, but with the base projecting
on each side so as to form a 22-inch square. A sheet of
varnished glass of this size was laid upon the base, and then
twenty-six pieces of thin window-glass 28 x 16 inches were
piled on one another in the tray. The window-glass had
been well washed, dried, and varnished while hot on each
side all round the edge for a width of two inches. Pieces of
tinfoil 24 x 12 inches were laid on each of the oblong
pieces of glass, except the top one, and long tongues of tinfoil
3 inches wide were brought out alternately on the two sides.
On one side all these tongues were brought out in the middle
and bent down so as to rest on the square glass plate below ;
on the other side they were brought out in four sets of three
 each with a space of two inches between each set. These
 were separately bent down to lie on the square glass plate
below. By this means the capacity can be made variable in
 the proportions of 1, 2, 3, and 4 by simply connecting the wire
 to 1, 2, 3 or 4 of these electrpdes. A strip of tinfoil lying
 over all the ends and held in contact by weights keeps them
 all connected except when a smaller capacity is required.

    Two coils, containing 330 yards each of No. 16 copper
 wire covered with gutta-percha to No. 7, were made use of in
 the form in which they arrived from the makers. The two
 coils are marked C and U. The following are the dimensions
 in inches approximately :—

   In comparing the number of oscillations measured with
those calculated from the electric constants given, experience
showed that the photographs, such as those in fig. 6, were not
so suitable as one taken with the spark in the line of the axis
of the wheel of lenses, because, though the definition along a
radius was not so good in the latter arrangement, it was for
the purpose of determining the intervals of darkness just as
good, moreover it gave a much larger arc on one plate which
made it possible to obtain the centre on the plate, and therefore
the angle between two points on the arc, with greater accuracy.
If the lenses were screwed into the face of a flat cone so that
the axes of each should meet in the axis of rotation at the
place of the spark, then definition would be equally perfect in
all parts of the circle. I did at first intend to place the lenses
in such a cone, but for various reasons the plate seemed pre
ferable.
   The comparison of the calculated number of oscillations
with the number found is complicated by the relations between
true ohms and B.A. units, as follows:—
   If the condenser is standardized with reference to the B.A .
unit of resistance, then, since the B.A. unit is 133 per cent,
too small, the number expressing the resistance is too large
and therefore the number expressing the capacity is too small,
since one varies inversely as the other, and so the number
expressing the capacity of such a condenser must be multi
plied by 10133 to obtain the true capacity.
   The self-induction determined by comparison with capacity
and resistance is found from the expression
                    L = a number x rj x r2 x 0.
If the resistances rt r2 are given in true ohms, then, as the

         Ohjects, and on the Oscillating Electric Spark.     259
number expressing C is too small by 1-33 per cent., therefore
the number expressing L is also too small by 1-33 per cent.,
and the nominal value of L must be multiplied by 1-0133.
But if ri and r2 are given in B.A. units, then, since these
numbers are each too large by 1'33 per cent., therefore the
number expressing L is also too large by this amount, since
one of the resistances and the capacity will balance, and
therefore the number expressing L must be divided by 1'0133.
   Now, the decrement being small, the numbers of oscillations
in a second n= ~—-r==- ; therefore, if L and C have each to
be multiplied by 1'0133, n should be divided by 1-0133; but,
on the other hand, if one has to to be multiplied and the other
divided by 1-0133, then these corrections balance and n
requires no correction.
   Messrs. Kobson and Smith determined from the photo-
  raphs the actual number of oscillations per second, and they
  etermined also, assuming the microfarad to be correct, the
number that ought to have been produced. The following
are their results :—
Observed number . , .          2293   3170    3264   2115  1806
Calculated number . .           2210  3126    3126   2210  1826

   spark                   )
   These were all taken on half plates and were subject to the
difficulty of centering. One spark was taken on a large
plate, so that all six lenses produced images of the same spark.
In this case the observed number was 1852, and the calculated
number 1826. Now, if this number is corrected by dividing
it by 1-0133, the calculated number becomes 1802, showing
the actual number to be about 2-7 per cent, too great. As
window-glass was used for the condenser, which, owing to
soakage, gives smaller capacities as the time of discharge is
made smaller, it is probable that part of the discrepancy may
be due to this ; but in the measurement of the capacity of the
condenser the effect of soakage was made as small as possible
by making, as far as such a thing could be done by hand, the
contact of discharge instantaneous. The self-induction, too,
as measured, may have been slightly different to the self-
induction for oscillations at the rate of 1852 a second.
   Mr. Smith has calculated the self-induction, using Prof.
Perry's formula, given at the last meeting of the Physical
Society, but the irregular form of the coils would not permit

260               Messrs. Langley and Very on the
of an accurate number being obtained in this way. The
figure obtained is about 51 x 10", a value which agrees with
the observations better than that found by experiment.
    I should add that I do not attach any importance to the
discrepancies referred to. The experiments were made
mainly with the view of showing the oscillating spark to an
audience more clearly than is possible by the method of Dr.
Lodge. For the purpose of measurement a window-glass
condenser is not suitable at all, and I do not think the rotating
lenses are so suitable as the method employed by Dr. Lodge,
in which the plate itself is made to rotate in its own plane,
for then the centre can bo determined with the greatest
 accuracy.
    The actual gain in number of sparks produced by the trap
was found by making three experiments, in which all the
 conditions were the same except those specified.

    I should in conclusion state that    the measurements given
 at the end of these notes were made     after the meeting of the
 Physical Society at which the paper    was read, and that some
 other additions have been made to       the fourth part of these
 notes.
 XXXI. On the Cheapest Form of Light, from studies at the
     Allegheny Observatory. By S. P. Langley and F. W.
     Very*.
  THE object of this memoir is to show, by the study of the
         radiation of the fire-fly, that it is possible to produce
  light without heat other than that in the light itself ; that
 this is actually effected now by nature's processes ; and that
  these are cheaper than our industrial ones in a degree hitherto
  unrealized. By " cheapest " is here meant the most econo
  mical in energy, which for our purpose is nearly synonymous
  with heat ; but as a given amount of heat is producible by a
  a known expenditure of fuel at a known cost, the word
    * Communicated by the Authors, to whom we nre likewise indebted
 for the cliches.

                        Cheapest Form of Light.                          261
" cheapest " may also here be token with little error in its
ordinary economic application.
   We recall that in all industrial methods of producing light
there is involved an enormous waste, greatest in sources of
low temperature, like the candle, lamp, or even gas-illumina
tion, where, as I have already shown, it ordinarily exceeds 99
parts in the 100 ; and least in sources of high temperature,
like the incandescent light and electric arc, where yet it is
still immense, and amounts, even under the most favourable
conditions, to very much the larger part.
   It has elsewhere * been stilted that for a given expense at
least one hundred times the light should in theory be obtain
able that we actually get by the present most widely used
methods of illumination. This, it will be observed, is given as
a minimum value, and it is the object of the present research
to demonstrate that not only this possible increase, but one
still greater, is actually obtained now in certain natural pro
cesses, which we know of nothing to prevent our successfully
imitating.
   It is now universally admitted that wherever there is light,
there has been expenditure of heat in the production of radia
tion existing in and as the luminosity itself, since both are but
forms of the same energy ; but this visible radiant heat which
is inevitably necessary, is not to be considered as waste. The
waste comes from the present necessity of expending a great
deal of heat in invisible forms before reaching even the
slightest visible result, while each increase of the light repre
sents not only the small amount of heat directly concerned in
the making of the light itself, but a new indirect expenditure
in the production of invisible calorific rays. Our eyes recog
nize heat mainly as it is conveyed in certain rapid aethereal
vibrations associated with high temperatures, while we havo no
 usual way of reaching these high temperatures without passing
 through the intermediate low ones ; so that if the vocal produc
 tion of a short atmospheric vibration were subject to analogous
 conditions, a high note could never be produced until we had
 passed through the whole gamut, from discontinuous sounds
 below the lowest bass, up successively through every lower
 note of the scale till the desired alto was attained.
    There are certain phenomena, long investigated, yet little
   * See results of an investigation by S. P. Langley, read before the
National Academy in 1883, and given in 'Science' for June 1, 1883,
where it is shown that in the ordinary Argand-burner gas-flame indefi
nitely over 99 per cent, of the radiant energy is (for illumination purposes)
waste.

262              Messrs. Langley and Very on the
understood, and grouped under the general name of " phos
phorescent " which form an apparent exception to this rule,
 especially where nature employs them in the living organism,
 for it seems very difficult to believe that the light of a fire-fly,
 for instance, is accompanied by a temperature of 2000° Fahr.,
 or more, which is what we should have to produce to gain it
 by our usual processes. That it is, however, not necessarily im
possible, we may infer from the fact that we can by a known
 physical process produce a still more brilliant light without
sensible heat where we are yet sure that the temperature
exceeds this. No sensible heat accompanies the fire-fly's light
any more than need accompany that of the Geissler tube ; but
this might be the case in either instance, even though heat
 were there, owing to its minute quantity, which seems to defy
direct investigation. It is usually assumed, with apparent
reason, that the insect's light is produced without the invisible
heat that accompanies our ordinary processes ; and this view
is strengthened by study of the fire-fly's spectrum, which has
been frequently observed to diminish more rapidly toward the
red than that of ordinary flames.
   Nevertheless, this, though a highly probable and reasonable
assumption, remains assumption rather than proof, until we
can measure with a sufficiently delicate apparatus the heat
which accompanies the light, and learn not only its quantity,
but, what is more important, its quality. Apart from the
scientific interest of such a demonstration is its economic value,
which may be inferred from what has already been said. I
have therefore thought it desirable to make the light of the
fire-fly the subject of a new research, in which it is endeavoured
to make the bolometer supplement the very incomplete evi
dence obtainable from the visible spectrum.
   As we may learn from elementary treatises, phenomena of
phosphorescence are common to insects, fishes, mollusks,
vegetables, and organic and mineral matter. Among luminous
insects, the fire-fly of our fields is a familiar example, though
others of the species attain greater size, and perhaps greater
intrinsic brilliancy, especially the Pyrophorus noctilucus, Linn.,
found in Cuba and elsewhere. Its length is about 37 millim.,
width 11 millim., and it has, like other Pyrophori, three light-
reservoirs—two in the thorax and one in the abdomen. To
procure this Cuban fire-fly, I invoked the aid of the Smith
sonian Institution, and through the kindness of Professor
Felipe Foey, of Havana, and Senor Albert Bonzon, of Santiago
do Cuba, in the Island of Cuba, living specimens of the
P. noctilucus were received here during the summer of 1889.
I have also to acknowledge my obligations to Professor C. V.

   After a preliminary spectral examination in Washington, I
found it more convenient to continue the research at tho
Allegheny Observatory by means of the very special appa
ratus supplied by the liberality of the late William Thaw, of
Pittsburgh, for researches in the lunar heat-spectrum*. Pho
tometric measurements throughout the spectrum of the insect's
light were also made.
    I have indicated the steps of the investigation ; but the
experiments have been so largely and so intelligently made by
Mr. F. W. Very, that it is just to consider him as an associate
rather than an assistant in the researches. I shall accordingly
in what follows not discriminate between what each has
contributed.

    Nathaniel lluhne].—Exp. 6. A dead shining glow-worm
was put upon water contained in a wide-mouthed phial, at the
temperature of 58°. The phial was then sunk in boiling-hot
 water ; and as the heat communicated itself to the contents
 of the phial, the light of the glow-worm became much more
 vivid.
    Exp. 7. Another lucid dead glow-worm was put into warm
 water at 114°, to see if that degree of heat would extinguish
 the light ; but, on the contrary, its glowing property was
 augmented. All the water was then poured off, yet the insect
 continued to shine for some length of time.
    Exp. 8. Two living glow-worms were put into a one-ounce
 phial, with a glass stopple ; and though they were perfectly
 dark at the time, yet if the phial were briskly rubbed with a
 silken or linen handkerchief till it became pretty warm, it
 seldom failed to make them display their light very finely.
 This experiment was very frequently repeated. It had
 the same illuminating effect upon the light of a dead glow
 worm.
     Exp. 9. The complete influence of 212 degrees of heat was
 now applied to the light of a glow-worm by pouring upon
 one when dead, but in a luminous state, some boiling water.

result.
   Macaire * (quoted by Becquerel) found that the luminous
matter taken from the body of a glow-worm and heated, in
creased in brilliancy up to a temperature of about 413 C, after
which the light diminished, became reddish, and ceased at
52° C. An electric current increased the luminosity in both
the living insect and in the luminous part separated from the
remainder of the body, but ceased to have any effect in a
vacuum. Oxygen and carbon monoxide increased the light
of the living insect and of the luminous matter taken from its
body ; but the light ceased in a vacuum, in hydrogen, in
carbon dioxide, in sulphurous anhydride, and in sulphuretted
hydrogen.
    Carus t observed that the luminous matter taken from the
body of the glow-worm ceases to shine when dried, but glows
again when moistened.
   Matteucei \ found that the phosphorescent substance of the
Italian glow-worm (Larnpyris italicd) soon ceased to glow in
hydrogen or in carbon dioxide, but shone decidedly brighter
in oxygen than in air, the oxygen being consumed and carbon
dioxide appearing. He drew the conclusion that the produc
tion of light in this insect is entirely due to the combination
of oxygen with carbon, which is one of the elements of the
phosphorescent matter. The greatest brilliancy occurred at a
temperature of 37° or 38° Cent., but all phosphorescence
ceased above 50° or below - 6° Cent.
   Robert § found that a glow-worm cut in halves continued
to glow for half an hour, when the light ceased, but com
menced again on the near approach of a candle, and continued
as bright as ever for thirty-six hours, after which it was
impossible to renew it.
    Pasteur // has examined the spectra of our PyropJioms

and thus differ from ignited solids and liquids, which have
continuous spectra, M. Becquerel concludes, from the apparent
continuity of the spectrum of the light from phosphorescent
animals, that their light approaches nearer to that of ordinary
incandescence—a deduction which the following result renders
unnecessary.
    C. A. Young* states that the "common" fire-fly gives a
continuous spectrum, extending from a little above Fraun-
bofer's lino G in the scarlet to about F in the blue, gradually
fading out at the extremities. He observes that it is notice
able that precisely this portion of the spectrum is composed
of rays which, while they more powerfully than any others
affect the organs of vision, produce hardly any thermal or
actinic effect. In other words, very little of the energy ex
pended in the flash of the fire-fly is wasted.
    (This is a most important and interesting inference ; but it
will be observed that this is necessarily rather assumed as
highly probable than actually demonstrated, since the method
did not permit the dealing with the invisible rays except by
inference.)
    It is quite different with our artificial methods of illumi
nation. In the case of an ordinary gas-light, experiments
 show that at most one per cent, of the radiant energy consists
 of visible rays, the rest being invisible heat ; that is to say,
over ninety-nine per cent, of the gas is wasted in producing
rays that do not help in making objects visible f.
     SecchiX at first thought that the spectrum of the glow
worm was monochromatic, but, with an improved spectroscope,
recognized that other colours were present, though feebly, and
decided that the spectrum was sensibly continuous.
    Quatrefages^, in connexion with the paper of Secchi,
remarks that the previous observations of Spallanzani and
Macaire, repeated with much care by Matteucci and Becquerel,
show beyond doubt that the light of glow-worms and elaters
is due to slow combustion. Thus the light is extinguished in
a vacuum and in irrespirable gases, it reappears in contact
with the air, it is perceptibly increased by the presence of pure
oxygen, it persists after the death of the creature, and finally
it is accompanied by the generation of carbon dioxide.
Nevertheless he points out that there is a distinct kind of
phosphorescence in the marine Noctilucidai, due to the con-

       Robin and Laboulbene* find the luminous organs of
P. noctilucus composed of irregularly polyhedral cells,
0-04 to 0-06 millim. thick, between which pass very nume
rous fine tracheae and nerves. The inner face of the organ is
composed of adipose tissue, and the outer of a transparent
modification of the ordinary chitinous covering of the insect.
The authors conclude that the light is due to chemical decom
position of a nitrogenous body with formation of crystalline
urates.
      Jousset de Bellesme f finds that although the phosphorescent
cells, when separated from the body of the insect, continue to
glow for several hours, yet if crushed they instantly lose their
illuminating power, which indicates that for the production of
the light the living cells must retain their integrity, and that
they are not mere reservoirs of a phosphorescent substance,
but continuous generators of it. He surmises that the light-
giving substance may be phosphuretted hydrogen.

represent the only attempt even, in this direction, I know of,
and seem to be judiciously made, but to be insufficient (on
account of the limitations of such apparatus) to establish the
author's conclusion that the light is accompanied by no sen
sible heat. This conclusion, we repeat, though very probably
correct, does not seem to rest on the evidence of an apparatus
of at all the necessary sensitiveness. This memoir, however,
appears to be in general an excellent one, and well worthy
the student's attention.

   From all these statements it is abundantly clear that not
only physicists and chemists, but naturalists, have been led to
conclude that this light is not associated indissolubly with any
so-called vital principle or vital process, but that it is a result of
certain chemical combinations, and that nothing forbids us to
suppose it may be one day produced by some process of the
laboratory or manufactory. With this conclusion in mind,
we now proceed to observations meant to demonstrate the
fact that this process (presumably discoverable but still un
known) gives light without invisible heat.
   These observations are :—1. Photometric. 2. Thermal.
             Part I.—Photometric Observations.
    The first impression on viewing the light of the Pyrophonis
noctilucus through a spectroscope is that it consists essentially
of a broad band in the green and yellow, while with pre
caution we see this extending into and beyond the borders of
the blue and orange, but not very greatly farther, and these
have been taken by previous observers as its absolute limits.
No one appears to have experimentally and distinctly answered
the question, " Would the light not extend farther were it
bright enough to be seen?"; nor has it been proven as clearly
as might be desired that the result depends on the quality
rather than the quantity of the light, or given conclusive evi
dence, that if the light of the insect were as bright as that of
the sun it would not extend equally far on either side of the
spectrum.
    It is impossible to increase the intrinsic brilliancy by any
optical device, but if it be impossible to make the light of the
insect as bright as that of the sun, it is on the other hand
 quite possible to make the light of the sun no brighter than that
 of the insect ; and this would appear to be the first step in
 obtaining a definite proof that the apparently narrow limits
 of the insect's spectrum are due to the intrinsic quality of the
 light and not to its feeble intensity. The only conclusive
 method of determining this would appear to be to balance the
 light from the insect with that of a definite portion of sunlight
 by any ordinary photometric device ; and having taken this
 sunlight as nearly equal as possible to that of the insect,
 though certainly not greater, to let this determined quantity
 fall on the slit of a spectroscope at the same time with the
 light from the insect, two spectra being formed one over the
 other in the same field and at the same time.
    The actual doing this is not so easy as it might appear,
 owing to experimental difficulties connected with the insect,

268             Messrs. Langley and Very on the
a part of which arises from the fact that its light is not only
fitful but unequal, being of very varying intensities when not
wholly intermittent.
   The simplest way in which the experiment can be per
formed is perhaps the following :—
   The insect is placed immediately in front of the slit of a
spectroscope so that the light of its thoracic or abdominal
portion falls upon the slit. This forms a narrow spectrum
which shoidd be brought into the lower or upper half of the
field, the insect being attached to the spectroscopic apparatus
in a position as nearly fixed as possible. The spectroscope is
now placed with the axis of its collimator in the line of a ray
of sunlight cast from a heliostat without. In the path of this
ray is a screen with a circular diaphragm covered writh ground
glass ; a lens in front of the slit casts on one portion of it an
image of the white circle formed by the ground glass, which
image is the same size as the illuminating organ of the insect,
and forms a spectrum of the same height in the reserved por
tion of the field. A suitable disposition of lenses placed
between the glass screen and the siderostat enables any degree
of illumination to be given to the former, from full sunlight
to nearly absolute darkness. If the normal spectrum be
studied, a grating is selected of such open ruling that the
entire visible spectrum of the first order can be seen in the
field, but the grating is first so placed that what is seen is not
the spectra but the reflected image of the slit, the grating thus
acting (at first) the part of a mirror ; so that the observer first
sees the two circles of light of approximately equal size and
brilliancy, one formed by the insect, the other by the sunlight,
and the light of this latter, by the arrangement of lenses
between the screen and the siderostat, is then adjusted so that
while remaining of the size of the insect, it is judged to have
the same intrinsic brilliancy, or at any rate not a superior
one.
   The essential thing is that a photometric comparison shall
be made of the two lights before the spectra are formed, and
that under these conditions the sunlight is equal but not
superior to that of the insect.
   The necessary condition of equality of the two lights from
which the spectra are to be formed having thus been secured,
the grating is moved until the two spectra are brought into
the held. The result of this direct test is that the solar spec
trum when intrinsically of the same brightness, or even when
clearly of less brightness than that of the insect, extends some
what further toward the red and distinctly further toward the
violet, the insect light being more intense than that of the

sun for equal lights in the green, but ending more abruptly
on the violet side.
   It may be added that when the insect's light grew brighter,
the increment appeared to be more in the blue eud, or as if the
average wave-length diminished with the intensity, but there
was not opportunity to put this beyond doubt.
   Photometric observations in the prismatic spectrum were
made previously to the adoption of the arrangement above
detailed, the first being on July 1, 1889, using thoracic light.
The insect was mounted on an adjustable stand to which it
was attached loosely, so as to give it such freedom of motion
as is needed to ensure its emitting the light. It was conse
quently necessary to re-adjust its position incessantly, and
this necessity constitutes a very obvious difficulty. The
thoracic light-spots are two ovals, each about 2 millim. by
1-5 millim. (see fig. 1). Their light is not so bright as the
abdominal light, but much steadier, and, like that, of a de
cidedly greenisb hue. One of these oval spots was placed
over the centre of a slit, open just enough to receive the light,
or about 1-5 millim. This slit was in the focus of a glass lens
of 8 centim. aperture and 82 centim. focus, which acted as a
collimator. The prism was a very large one of flint (faces
11'5 centim. high, 10'5 centim. wide), whoso mounting
included an automatic minimum-deviation attachment. The
observing lens was similar to the collimator, with a low-
power eye-piece in whose field was a pair of heavy vertical

 20 millim. long, the parallel wires being distinctly visible in
the indigo at a setting of 45° 25', corresponding to a wave
length of (y-468, and in the red at 43° 53', corresponding to
0'1-640. The spectrum then was visible from a little beyond
F to near C, or through a range of OM72. As might have
been anticipated from the greenish colour of the light, the
maximum brilliancy was in the green near E, or near wave
length 0M-53*. From this point the light fell away on both
sides more rapidly than in the solar spectrum. (See fig. 3, A, B.)
   July 2.—A comparison of the spectra of the thoracic and
of the abdominal light gave the latter upon the average about
double the intrinsic brightness of the former. This was only
a crude estimate, but more exact methods under the limited
time for experiment would have been useless, owing to the
very fluctuating character of the light. In continuation of
the photometric measurements of the preceding day on the
thoracic light, this was compared with that from the flame of
an ordinary Bunsen burner at its greatest luminosity, whose
area was limited by a diaphragm to that of the size of the
thoracic light. The light from the base of this luminous
flame (height of flame about 3-5 centim., air shut off at base
of burner) gave a continuous spectrum, which in these first
comparisons was alternated with that of the insect. The
spectra were judged to be equal in the blue and the red, but
that of the insect was much brighter in the green. Again, a
spectrum being formed from light taken midway between the
base and point of the flame was found to be everywhere too
bright, but especially so in the red.

fair match for that of the burner, elsewhere the latter was
brighter but not very greatly so. Since the insect's spectrum
was followed through O^'IS with the thoracic light, while

f>robable that the insect's light actually ceases near the given
 imits, and does not merely disappear from the inability of
the eye to follow a diminishing light. While we observe
from these first photometric measures that the insect's spec
trum has undoubtedly a decided maximum in the green, we
are led to infer that this spectrum is very probably of the
nature of a broad band stretching from beyond F to near C
where it terminates, and this very important inference we
shall see confirmed later by other and more exact measures.
    August 5.—Comparison of relative brightness in different
parts of spectrum of abdominal light with that from a student's
lamp.
    A spectrometer supplied with means * for bringing into the
same field the spectra of two different lights, formed by a
Rutherfurd grating of 17296 lines to the inch (instead of the
prism) was employed for this purpose. The upper half of the
slit received the insect's light, the lower half a beam from the
brightest part of the Argand flame, which had passed through
two Nicol's prisms, one of which was attached to a divided
circle. The two spectra were then seen in the same field with
their edges in exact juxtaposition. In the field of the ob
serving telescope was a slit 1 millim. wide, subtending not
quite 9'5 (minutes of arc), which allowed light having a
range of wave-length of about O^Ol to pass. The spectrum
of the lamp-light was brighter in every part of the field
though in unequal degrees till it was diminished by turning
the Nicol's prism. The angle through which the prism was
turned to produce equality having been noted, the values
deduced from the ordinary formula (transmitted light
 = Zcos9a, the angle a being 90° when the light is diminished
 as much as possible by crossing the planes of the Nicols at
 right angles) are as follows, where the fractions are those by
 which the brightness of the lamp spectrum at the various
 points is to bo multiplied to produce equality with the
 insect spectrum.

Owing to the motion of the insect and the varying brilliancy
of the light emitted, these figures (each of which is the result
of the mean of several trials including at least two measures)
still leave much to be desired. The supply of the insects,
which had been procured and maintained alive with difficulty,
however, did not allow of the experiments being further pro
longed, nor of the securing a direct comparison with the solar
spectrum. The value of each part of the lamp spectrum
having, however, been independently determined with all
possible exactness in terms of the solar spectrum, we are
enabled to exhibit a comparison of the latter with the insect
spectrum so as to show them together (fig. 3, A and B). It
is assumed that the same amount of luminous intensity (i. e.
energy in terms of vision as determined by purely photometric
methods) is taken whether from the sun or the insect. The
subjoined curves (fig. 3, A) show the solar and the insect
luminosity throughout the visible spectrum on the preceding
assumption of the intrinsic equality, a result which, however,
might be liable to a slight correction of the relative places of
the maxima if a direct comparison with sunlight were ob
tained. The important fact, however, seems to be brought
out almost bevond question, that when spectra are formed from
two equal lights, one from the sun the other from the insect,
the latter's spectrum terminates both at an upper and a lower
limit at which the solar light is still conspicuous. The con
 clusion follows that the insect spectrum is lacking in the rays
 of red luminosity and presumably in the infra-red rays,
 usually of relatively great heat ; or that it seems probable that
 we have here light without heat, other than that heat which
 the luminosity itself comprises and which is but another name
 for the same enegy.
    Any other supposition would apparently involve the hypo
thesis that the spectrum, which we have seen end at the red,
has a renewal' in the invisible infra-red where the main portion
of the solar heat and that of all ordinary illuminants is known
to exist. Although this last hypothesis cannot be considered
to have much weight, and though we are led to agree with
previous observers that it may be assumed with much pro
bability that the ordinary invisible heat would, if wo had
means to observe it, be found unassociated with the fire-fly's

in view of the great importance of the conclusions in question,
we shall now try whether it be possible to settle the point by
thermal measures with the bolometer.

274             Messrs. Langley and Very on the
              Part II.—Thermal Observations.
    To give an idea of the amount of heat at our disposition for
experiment, and of the actual minuteness of the radiation
which proceeds from even the most luminous tropical insect,
we may say that if that rate of radiation from a lampblack
 surface 1 square centim. in area, which represents the amount
 of heat necessary to raise 1 grm. of water 1° C. in 1 minute
 (i. e. one small calorie), be taken as unity, then the luminous
 radiation of the fire-fly's heat per square centim. of exposed
 luminous surface, as we have found, is about O'OOtM calorie in
 10 seconds, and the total luminous radiation from the most
 powerfully illuminating light-spot of the insect (the abdominal
one) will not exceed 0-00007 calorie in the same time. But a
 small portion of this could fall upon the bolometer, and that
 which actually reached it during the time (10 seconds) required
 for each observation was sufficient only to affect an ordinary
mercurial thermometer having a bulb 1 centim. in diameter
by rather less than 0°-0000023, or by less than $ooltfo© of one
degree Centigrade.
    We have just mentioned that the total amount of heat-
 radiation upon which we have to make our investigation re
 presents less than rooVoo- calorie, while that portion of this
 which falls upon the apparatus would, in the time of one opera
tion, only raise the temperature of an ordinary mercurial
 thermometer by less than ^rfoTVO degree ; and we have first to
notice the difficulty that in case invisible heat exists in company
with the light (and it certainly does exist in ordinary emana
 tions from the surface of any living creature independent of
phosphorescence), we have in this minute radiation heat of
two different kinds, both invisible, and which it is yet indis
pensable for us to discriminate.
    We are helped to do this by the consideration that while
 the insect, like any non-luminous one, must emit " animal
heat " from all its surface, its general surface-temperature is
certainly low, since it feels cold to the hand, whose greater
warmth excites it to shine. This heat, then, corresponds to a
temperature much below 50° C. ; and such temperatures must,
as we have shown in other memoirs, be accompanied by the
emission of waves whose length relegates them to quite another
spectral region to that in which the invisible heat associated
with light mainly appears. We can then discriminate the
rays of this invisible " animal " heat without the formation of
a heat-spectrum, by their inability to pass through a glass
which transmits with comparative freedom radiant heat whose
wave-length is less than 3**, the latter including the region

                        Cheapest Form of Light.                  275
where, if there he invisible heat radiated with the light, it must
mainly lie.
    The heat in the spectral region of the infra-red we are con
sidering we know in advance must be, if it bear any sort of
relation to the light, almost immeasurably small ; and, in fact,
it defied at first all attempts to obtain not merely a quantitative
measurement, but even any certain experimental evidence of
its existence. At last, upon July 24, with the arrival of anew
stock of over two dozen insects, and with the aid of experience
derived from previous failures, these heat-measures were
resumed. For the first described, the thoracic light is taken.
    The insect was placed 125 centim. from the mirror of
25'4 centim. aperture and 73-4 centim. focus, so that its
image was formed at 178 centim. and enlarged about 1'42
diameter, when a small portion of it filled an ajwrture equal
to the bolometer employed, which was selected from the most
sensitive of those used in previous researches in lunar heat,
and had an aperture of 19 square millim. By the preceding
arrangement of the mirror an image of one of the thoracic
bright spots, with enough of the surrounding body to repre
sent an area of about 13 square millim., was enlarged to nearly
the surface of the bolometer.
    Employing all the precautions taught by a multiplied expe
rience, we obtained by a series of exposures of the bolometer
to the insecWadiation a series of small but real galvanometer-
deflexions which represent the excess of total heat-radiations
from the insect over those from a metal plate of a temperature
of about 25° C. forming the background. These heat-radia
tions come jointly from the luminous spot (area 3 to 4 square
millim.), and about 9 square millim. of the surrounding body.
To determine their characters, we interposed a sheet of glass*
which cut off all the observed heat. Tne heat from the lumi
nous spectrum and from a spectral region below it extending
to about 311 (30,000 tenth-meters) was known to be capable of
passing through this glass. The evidence, then, is that there
is no heat in the spectrum below this feeble radiation from
the luminous thoracic region sufficient to be capable of
affecting the apparatus, though this was so sensitive as to
promptly respond to the feeble body-radiation from the
somewhat larger section of the luminous and non-luminous
surface.
                 Continuation on Abdominal Heat.
    The insect's light, then, is unaccompanied (in the specimen
   * Described in the memoir "On the Temperature of the Surface of the
Moon," Mem. Nat. Acad, of Sciences, vol. iii., as "B."

276              Messrs. Langley and Very on the
subject to this experiment) by any measurable heat ; but to
make it still more evident that this is due to the absence of
heat below the red (body-heat not being in question), we now
proceed to take an artificial flame, occupying the same area as
the radiating luminous part of the insect, and to see whether
heat is observed in it. If the flame be no brighter than the
insect, and the heat be nevertheless observed in it when in the
insect heat is lacking, it is obvious that in the latter case none
is observed, because (sensibly) none is emitted ; and this con
clusion is reached, a fortiori, when the flame-light is less than
that of the insect.
   July 27.—Through a circular aperture'2-5 millim. in diameter
there were passed alternately the total radiant heat and that
transmitted by glass from a nearly non-luminous Bunsen-flame
whose luminosity was very much fainter than that from the
insects. On this day there seemed to be an exceedingly
minute deflexion averging £ of one division of the galvano
meter-scale from the total radiation of an equal portion of the
abdominal light-spot of the insect, while from the flame there
was a mean deflexion of 177-5 divisions, showing that the total
heat-radiation from an equal area of a iess luminous flame was
many hundred times that from the luminous area of the insect.
    Glass being interposed, the heat due to this flame-radiation
fell to 14'5 divisions, or about 8 per cent, of the original radia
tion, showing that of the quality of Bunsen-flame heat imme
diately in question (that above 31* transmissible by glass) there
was still something like 60 times that of tho combined body
and luminous radiation of the insect in the far less luminous
flame. Subsequently, by the use of a lens giving greater con
centration, measurable indications of insect-radiation above
31*, and therefore distinct from any possible body-heat, were
obtained through glass, showing the flame-radiation of this
quality from an equal area of the same intrinsic brilliancy,
i. e. invisible heat and of long wave-length, but shorter than
3**, to be about 400 times that of the insect.
    These experiments were repeated with different luminous
flames and with different insects on succeeding days. In some
of them especially luminous insect specimens were secured,
which, with favourable conditions of the galvanometer, gave
very measurable deflexions on the latter. By a similar use of
the glass to that described, it appeared that flames whose
intrinsic brilliancy is nearly comparable to that of a point
below the middle of the candle-flame, and whose total bril
liancy is as exactly as possible comparable to that of the insect,
give several hundred times the heat of the latter, even if we
consider only that quality of heat which is found above 3*1,

                     Cheapest Form of Light.                   211
while if we compare the total radiations (i. e. those directly
observed without the use of the glass) the contrast is still
stronger.
   It follows that the insect-light is accompanied by approxi
mately one four-hundredth part of the heat which is ordinarily
associated with the radiation of flames of the luminous quality
of those which were the subject of experiment. This value is
confirmed by other methods which we do not give here. It
will conduce to a clearer comprehension of this if we exhibit
in a series of curves derived from our observations the spectral
distribution of one unit of energy in the gas-flame spectrum
(diagram 4, fig. 1) ; of the electric-arc spectrum (fig. 2) ; of
the sun (fig. 3) ; and of the insect (fig. 4). In all these the
abscissae are the same, the portion between (f"4 and 0^7
 (violet to red) showing the part of the energy utilized in light,
while that from O*1'? to 3h shows the part wasted as invisible
heat. The energy in each case being the same, the areas are
the same, except that owing to the relative importance of the
light heat-curve (fig. 4), only about 2'0 of the latter can be
shown in the limits of the plate.
    The curves in fig. 3 deal with luminous intensity only, and
give no means of drawing those economic conclusions which
appear to follow from our experiments, and which the curves
in diagram 4 supply. These curves all exhibit the spectrum
on the normal scale, from that easily visible, lying between
      in the violet and (f'l in the red, then to 3** near the limit
of the glass-transmission. In the case of the first three,
representing spectra of the gas-flame, the elect ric arc, and the
sun, nearly all the energy lies above 3^ ; in that of the gas-
flame a considerable portion lies below 3** (and still more in
that of the candle-flame, if that were shown, where most of the
energy would lie below 3*1 or outside the limits of the drawing) .
The curves then, we repeat, represent equal amounts of energy
 (which without sensible error we may assume to be all
exhibited as heat) and enclose equal areas.
    The total area represents in each case the expenditure of a
unit of cost in thermal energy, the area between O^'i and 0"-7,
 the proportion of this utilized as light ; though, as we have
just stated, in the case of fig. 4, the representative of the fire
 fly spectrum, only a fraction of this can be shown (owing to
the limits of the drawing).
    Resuming, then, what we have said, we repeat that nature
produces this cheapest light at about one four-hundredth part
 of the cost of the energy which is expended in the candle-
flame, and at but an insignificant fraction of the cost of the
electric light or the most economic light which has yet been

Determination, in Calories, of the Heat in the Luminous (Abdo
         minal) Radiation of Pyrophorus noctilucus.
   The determination is reached by two steps :—(1) The cali
bration of the galvanometer, so as to give the value of its
division in calories ; and (2) the inference from the observed
deflexion in divisions of the total of calories radiated.
   (1) The bolometer, whose face occupied 0-19 square centim.
(a), gave a deflexion of 342 divisions (/;), at a distance of
25 centim. (r) from a 5 centim. circular aperture filled by a
blackened Leslie cube. Seen from the centre of this aperture,
the bolometer occupied then 2~J =0-0000484: of the hemi
sphere, and would have received this fraction of the total
radiation, except that, being placed exactly opposite the radia
ting surface, more than the mean radiation fell on it in a
proportion which calculation shows to be about               The
fraction of the total radiation which it actually received, then,
was 0-0000645 (c).
   Accordingly the total radiation would have caused a
deflexion - =5,300,000 divisions.
           c
   The surface of the cube was at a temperature of 99° C,
and was limited by the diaphragm to an area of 19'6 square
centim. (d). The total radiation from one centimetre, then,
would have caused a deflexion of—.=270,400 div. The
                                        ca
temperature of the bolometer, which was that of the apart
ment, was 20° C. According to Dulong and Petit's law, the
radiation from such a surface at 99° C. to one at 20° C. would
be 1-11 cal. per minute (e), which does not greatly differ
from our own independent determinations; and for 10 sec.
 =0-167 min. (/) (the time of the galvanometer-swing) it
equals 0-185 cal. (ef).   Hence ~ = 5^5 = 1462000 div.

is the potentiality of work in 1 calorie, to be expressed in the
swing of the galvanometer-needle, and 1 div. =0-000000684
cal.

    (2) The galvanometer received the fire-fly radiation through
 a lens which occupied 0-00655 of a hemisphere, and would
 have transmited this fraction of the total heat except for its
 position, which caused it to transmit £ more than the average,
 which is 0-00873 (g). The measured radiation from this
 fractional part gave 0-84 div. (It), and - =96-2 div. is the
 deflexion which would be given by the total abdominal
 emission, or
              96-2 x 0-000000684 = 0-0000058 cal.
    Since the luminous surface has an area of about ^- square
 centim., this corresponds to a radiation of 0-00039 per square
 centim. of radiating surface in the time of the galvanometer-
 needle's swing, or to -            - 0-0024 cal. per square centim.

       1. " The Borrowdale Plumbago, its Mode of Occurrence and
probable Origin." By J. Postlethwaite, Esq., F.G.S.
   After giving details of the mode of occurrence of the plumbago of
Borrowdale in veins traversing diabase and diorite, which break
through the Volcanic Series of Borrowdale, the author refers to the
modes of occurrence of plumbago in other regions, and contrasts these
with the surroundings of the Lake-District masses. He points out
that many thousand feet of volcanic rock supervened between the
Borrowdale plumbago-bearing rocks and the overlying carbonaceous
shales of Silurian age. On the other hand, he finds similarities
between the containing rocks in Borrowdale and the diamond

bearing rocks of South Africa, and considers that the conditions
under which the plumbago was formed in the Lake District
approached much more closely to those which gave rise to the
Kimberley diamonds than to those which originated the plumbago
deposits in North America, though there is great dissimilarity
in the chemical composition of the intrusive rocks in the two cases,
especially with regard to the quantity of magnesia present. He
suggests that the molten magma in its upward course passed through
a deep-seated stratum of highly carbonaceous material, and tore off
numerous fragments, the bituminous matter in which became acted
upon by heat, a further alteration being subsequently caused by the
intrusion of the diorite.
   2. " Notes on the Valley -Gravels about Reading, with especial
reference to the Palaeolithic Implements found therein." By 0. A.
Shrubsolc, Esq., F.G.S.
   The following deposits containing implements are described :—
   A. North of the Thames.
        (i) Gravel at Toot's Farm, Caversham ; 235 feet above sea-
              level.          »
       (ii) Clayey gravel by side of Henley Road, Caversham ; 168 feet
              above sea-level.
      (iii) Subangular gravel at Shiplake ; 200 feet above sea-level.
   B. South of the Thames.
        (i) Gravel at Elm Lodge Estate, Reading; 197 foet above
               sea-level.
       (ii) Giavel on disturbed beds at Redlands ; 157 feet above
               sea-level.
      (iii) Comminuted flinty gravel at Southern Hill ; 223 feet
               above sea-level.
      (iv) Gravel at Sonning Hill ; 185 feet above sea-level.
       (v) Gravel at Ruscombe, Twyford ; 1C5-170 feet above sea-
               level.
    The author concludes that the highest gravels (235-280 feet
 above sea-level) do not, so far as is known, contain any traces
 of man, and that a considerable amount of valley-erosion occurred
 before the deposition of the earliest gravels which have furnished
 human relics. Further, he considers that the deposits indicate the
 occurrence of a severe climato at an early stage, and its recurrence
 at a later one, viz. during the deposition of the gravels found at a
 height of 197 feet and 144 feet respectively above the sca-level. He
 believes that many of the implements found in the lower levels
 at Reading have been derived from gravels of various dates and
 different levels, which have been swept away by denudation, and
 that this will account for the mixed character of the types of
 implements.

         XXXIII. Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
         ON THE THEORY OF THE OSCILLATOBT DISCHARGE.
                         BY PROF. J. STEFAN.
flTHE theory of the oscillatory discharge of a Leyden jar has been
 .*. developed by Sir William Thomson and Kirchhoff. It gives for
 the intensity of the current of the discharge an equation which
agrees with that for the motion of a pendulum in a resisting
 medium. In developing the theory it was assumed that the
discharge-current fills the entire section of the discharging wire
 with uniform density. With very rapidly succeeding currents this
 supposition is far from the reality. In such cases the motion of
the electricity in metallic conductors is almost entirely restricted
 to a thin layer on the surface of the conductor.
    The theory may be developed by taking into account this unequal
 division of the current. The result is essentially that an oscilla
tory discharge is always made up of two motions, one of which is
extinguished much earlier than the other. It is the latter which,
as the time increases, acquires the character of a pendulum motion.
 The amplitudes diminish, however, much more rapidly according
to the new theory than according to the old one.
    In so far as the influence of the resistance on the time of oscil
lation of this motion is small, the new theory gives a formula for
it analogous with the earlier one, excepting that, instead of the
coefficient of self-induction of the wire, we have that of the induc
tion on a filament in the surface. In consequence of this the time
of vibration is independent of the magnetic condition of the dis
charging wire, and is therefore almost as large for an iron wire as
for a copper one, while according to the older theory it is found to
be many times greater for the former.
    The interposition of a break in the circuit might cause a still
greater deviation from the pendulum motion than that indicated
by theory. Such a deviation has the effect that the discharge-
circuit on a conductor connected with it also induces electrical
movements in another, even when the time of vibration of the
latter is quite different from the time of oscillation of the exciting
discharge, and when therefore a true resonance is excluded.
    This motion experiences also an increase if the induction-impulse
is repeated in a favourable time, that is in one corresponding to
the special vibrations of the conductor, for instance in consequence
of a reflexion at the end of the inducing wire. The observations
made by Sarasin and De la Rive may be referred to this.
    Electricity in motion shows much more markedly than in other
phenomena the property of inertia. This discharge is often com
pared with the oscillations of a liquid in two communicating tubes.
Such a comparison affords only an image of the phenomenon which
is difficult of observation. A wider significance may, however, be
ascribed to it. The energy which corresponds to the difference in

height of the liquid in the tubes is changed during the equalization
into vis viva of the liquid. This may again be transformed into
energy of the original kind, so that the fresh difference in height
has the opposite position to the former. In the convertibility of
the two energies into each other is found the reason of the vibra-,
tory motion which would otherwise be conceived to be due to
inertia. If, owing to friction, part of the energy is transformed
into heat, which is not convertible, the amplitudes of the vibrations
are continually slower. The motion is as if the liquid had not
complete inertia.
   To the difference of potentials between the plates of a charged
condenser an electrical energy corresponds. If the plates are
connected by a wire, part of this energy is converted into heat,
owing to resistance ; the rest is again changed into another energy,
which, as the fact of the oscillating discharge shows, may again be
transformed into an electrostatic one, in such a manner that a dif
ference of potential is established in the condenser opposite to the
original one. The question is, of what value is this energy? In
the special case in which the discharging wire is passed spirally
round an iron core, the nature of the greatest part of this energy is
known. It is the magnetic energy which is accumulated in the
magnetized iron during the equalization of the discharge, and
which after the equalization is complete still maintains a current
in the same direction, and charges the condenser afresh, but in the
opposite direction. It is simplest, even in case there is no mag
netic core, to conceive this energy as a magnetic one which has its
seat in the magnetization of the medium in which the discharge
takes place. This assumption is sufficient also for establishing the
lawsof'electrodynamic induction.— Wiener Sitzumjsberichte, June 12,

CALORIMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DISENGAGEMENT OF
    HEAT AND LIGHT IN ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES. BY G. STAUB.
    The author determines the ratio N of the total energy E emitted
 by a gas to that which is perceived as light L. With this view he
introduces a Geissler's tube into an ice-calorimeter from the bottom
of which the mercury is removed. The ice and water transmit all
the rays of light and only absorb those of heat ; he then blackens
the Geissler tube, and thus retains the visible rays also in the ice-
calorimeter. If the quantity of heat in the first case is Q and in
the second E, L=E- Q.
    The width of the Geissler tube was altered as well as the pres
 sure in it, and condensers and also breaks were interposed in the
 circuit. The results of the experiment were as follows.
    With the help of electrical discharges in Geissler tubes, light of
 considerably greater useful effect may be obtained than in the glow-
 lamp. The maximum for one of Blattner's was 10 per cent., and
 for a Geissler tube with condensers 32-8 per ceut. The useful

284           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
effect increases with tbe density and quantity of electricity which
passes through the tube. It decreases as the pressure and diameter
of the capillary tube increases. If the Geissler tube is filled with
hydrogen, the optical effect is less than in air, other things being
equal.
   These results agree with the experiments on' glow-lamps and
flames, in so far that the higher the temperature the higher in
general is the useful effect.— Beibldtter der Physik, vol. xiv. p. 538.
OBSERVATIONS ON ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY IN THE TROPICS.
                        BY PROF. F. EXNER.
   The present paper forms the conclusion of a former one which
appeared under the same title (Phil. Mag. vol. xxix. p. 520), and
gives a complete discussion of the measurements contained in the
latter. The connexion between fall of potential and vapour-
pressure, which the author found to exist in our regions, is also
fully confirmed for the tropics, so that we may now regard the
electrical constants of the earth as determined with great certainty.
The quantity of electricity which is found in a column of a square
centimetre base above the earth's surface is, including the charge
of the latter, —0-0038 absolute electrostatic units. The total
charge Q of the earth is, Q= — 2x 10" in the same units, and its
potential V referred to a point in space is — 9 x 109 volt. A further
fact now fully established is that the sign of the normal fall of
potential in the tropics is the same as with us, that is positive.
Only few observations could be made as to the change of fall of
potential with height, yet this showed distinctly an increase as
required by theory.
   The daily period of atmospheric electricity is decidedly less pro
nounced in the tropics than with us, which is probably connected
with the extraordinary constancy of the weather. On most days
maxima could not be observed. — Wiener Bericlite, July 10, 1890.
   INVESTIGATION OF ELECTRICAL VIBRATIONS WITH THERMO
            ELEMENTS. BY DR. IGNATIUS KLEMENCIC.
   The author investigated Hertz's vibrations by the help of a
thermoelement soldered between the ends of the secondary in
ductor. By using two such inductors, one of which served as
standard while the other was moved about in the space affected, it
was possible to measure the distribution of energy in a ray pro
ceeding from the primary mirror, and at right angles to it. The
factor of condensation of a secondary mirror was further measured
for two different pairs of primary conductors, and was found to be
7 for a pair made exactly according to Hertz's directions, and equal
to 2-7 for a pair twice as long. The mirrors were exactly of the
dimensions mentioned by Hertz.— Wiener Berichte, July 17, 1890.

           XXXIV. On the Theory of Surface Forces.
                  By Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S.*
SINCE the time of Young the tendency of a liquid surface
       to contract has always been attributed to the mutual
attraction of the parts of the liquid, acting through a very
small range,—to the same forces in fact as those by which the
cohesion of liquids and solids is to be explained. It is some
times asserted that Laplace was the first to look at the matter
from this point of view, and that Young contented himself
with calculations of the consequences of superficial tension.
Such an opinion is entirely mistaken, although the authority
of Laplace himself may be quoted in its favour t. In the
introduction to his first paper J, which preceded the work of
Laplace, Young writes :—" It will perhaps be more agreeable
to the experimental philosopher, although less consistent with
the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first
place to the comparison of this theory [of superficial tension]
with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its founda
tion in the ultimate properties of matter." This he attempts
to do in Section VI., which is headed Physical Foundation of

28G                      Lord Rayleigh on the
the Law of Superficial Cohesion. The argument is certainly
somewhat obscure ; but as to the character of the " physical
foundation " there can be no doubt. " We may suppose the
particles of liquids, and probably those of solids also, to possess
that power of repulsion, which has been demonstrably shown
by Newton to exist in aeriform fluids, and which varies in the
inverse ratio of the distance of the particles from each other.
In air and vapours this force appears to act uncontrolled ; but
in liquids it is overcome by a cohesive force, while the par
ticles still retain a power of moving freely in all directions
It is simplest to suppose the force of cohesion nearly or per
fectly constant in its magnitude, throughout the minute dis
tance to which it extends, and owing its apparent diversity to
the contrary action of the repulsive force which varies with
the distance."
    Although nearly a century has elapsed, we are still far from
a satisfactory theory of these reactions. We know now that
the pressure of gases cannot be explained by a repulsive force
varying inversely as the distance, but that we must appeal to
the impacts of colliding molecules*. There is every reason
to suppose that the molecular movements play an important
part in liquids also ; and if we leave them out of account, we
can only excuse ourselves on the ground of the difficulty of
the subject, and with full recognition that a theory so founded
is probably only a first approximation to the truth. On the
 other hand, the progress of science has tended to confirm the
views of Young and Laplace as to the existence of a powerful
 attraction operative at short distances. Even in the theory of
 gases it is necessary, as Van der Waals has shown, to appeal
 to such a force in order to explain their condensation under
 increasing pressure in excess of that indicated by Boyle's law,
 and explicable by impacts. Again, it would appear that it is
 in order to overcome this attraction that so much heat is
 required in the evaporation of liquids.
     If we take a statical view of the matter, and ignore the
 molecular movements f, we must introduce a repulsive force
 to compensate the attraction. Upon this point there has been
 a good deal of confusion, of which even Poisson cannot be
 acquitted. And yet the case seems simple enough. For con
 sider the equilibrium of a spherical mass of mutually attracting
 matter, free from external force, and conceive it divided by

 Dynamical Evidence of the Molecular Constitution of Bodies " (Nature,

an ideal plane into hemispheres. Since the hemispheres are
at rest, their total action upon one another must be zero, that
is, no force is transmitted across the interface. If there bo
attraction operative across the interface, it must be precisely
compensated by repulsion. This view of the matter was from
the first familiar to Young, and he afterwards gave calcula
tions, which we shall presently notice, dependent upon the
hypothesis that there is a constant attractive force operative
over a limited range and balanced by a repulsive force of
suitable intensity operative over a different range. In La
place's theory, upon the other hand, no mention is made of
repulsive forces, and it would appear at first as if the attractive
forces were left to perform the impossible feat of balancing
themselves. But in this theory there is introduced a pressure
which is really the representative of the repulsive forces.
   It may be objected that if the attraction and repulsion must
be supposed to balance one another across any ideal plane of
separation, there can be no sense, or advantage, in admitting
the existence of either. This would certainly be true if the
origin and law of action of the forces were similar, but such is
not supposed to be the case. The inconclusiveness of the
objection is readily illustrated. Consider the case of the
earth, conceived to be at rest. The two halves into which it
may be divided by an ideal plane do not upon the whole act
upon one another ; otherwise there could not be equilibrium.
Nevertheless no one hesitates to say that the two halves
attract one another under the law of gravitation. The force
 of the objection is sometimes directed against the pressure,
 denoted by K, which Laplace conceives to prevail in the
interior of liquids and solids. How, it is asked, can there be
 a pressure, if the whole force vanishes ? The best answer to
 this question may be found in asking another—Is there a
 pressure in the interior of the earth?
    It must no doubt be admitted that in availing ourselves of
 the conception of pressure we are stopping short of a com
 plete explanation. The mechanism of' the pressure is one of
 the things that we should like to understand. But Laplace's
 theory, while ignoring the movements and even the existence
 of molecules, cannot profess to be complete ; and there seems
 to be no inconsistency in the conception of a continuous,
 incompressible liquid, whose parts attract one another, but are
 prevented from undergoing condensation by forces of infi
 nitely small range, into the nature of which we do not further
 inquire. All that we need to take into account is then covered
 by the ordinary idea of pressure. However imperfect a theory
 developed on these lines may be, and indeed must be, it pre

288                     Lord Rayleigh on the
senta to the mind a good picture of capillary phenomena, and,
as it probably contains nothing not needed for the further
development of the subject, labour spent upon it can hardly
be thrown away.
    Upon this view the pressure due to the attraction measures
the cohesive force of the substance, that is the tension which
must be applied in order to cause rupture. It is the quantity
which Laplace denoted by K, and which is often called the
molecular pressure. Inasmuch as Laplace's theory is not a
molecular theory at all, this name does not seem very appro
priate. Intrinsic pressure is perhaps a better term, and will
be employed here. The simplest method of estimating the
intrinsic pressure is by the force required to break solids. As
to liquids, it is often supposed that the smallest force is
 adequate to tear them asunder. If this were true, the theory
 of capillarity now under consideration would be upset from
its foundations, but the fact is quite otherwise. Berthelot*
 found that water could sustain a tension of about 50 atmo
 spheres applied directly, and the well-known phenomenon of
 retarded ebullition points in the same direction. For if the
 cohesive forces which tend to close up a small cavity in the
 interior of a superheated liquid were less powerful than the
 steam-pressure, the cavity must expand, that is the liquid
 must boil. By supposing the cavity infinitely small, we see
 that ebullition must necessarily set in as soon as the steam t
 pressure exceeds that intrinsic to the liquid. The same method
 may be applied to form a conception of the intrinsic pressure
 of a liquid which is not superheated. The walls of a mode
 rately small cavity certainly tend to collapse with a force
measured by the constant surface-tension of the liquid. The
 pressure in the cavity is at first proportional to the surface-
 tension and to the curvature of the walls. If this law held
without limit, the consideration of an infinitely small cavity
shows that the intrinsic pressure would be infinite in all
liquids. Of course the law really changes when the dimen
sions of the cavity are of the same order as the range of the
attractive forces, and the pressure in the cavity approaches a
limit, which is the intrinsic pressure of the liquid. In this
way we are forced to admit the reality of the pressure by the
consideration of experimental facts which cannot be disputed.
    The first estimate of the intrinsic pressure of water is doubt
less that of Young. It is 23,000 atmospheres, and agrees

extraordinarily well with modern numbers. I propose to
return to this estimate, and to the remarkable argument which
Young founded upon it.
    The first great advance upon the theory of Young and
Laplace was the establishment by Gauss of the principle of
surface-energy. He observed that the existence of attractive
forces of the kind supposed by his predecessors leads of neces
sity to a term in the expression of the potential energy pro
portional to the surface of the liquid, so that a liquid surface
tends always to contract, or, what means precisely the same
thing, exercises a tension. The argument has been put into
a more general form by Boltzmann*. It is clear that all
molecules in the interior of the liquid are in the same con
dition. Within the superficial layer, considered to be of finite
but very small thickness, the condition of all molecules is the
same which lie at the same very small distance from the surface.
 If the liquid be deformed without change in the total area of
 the surface, the potential energy necessarily remains unaltered ;
 but if there be a change of area the variation of potential
 energy must be proportional to such change.
    A mass of liquid, left to the sole action of cohesive forces,
 assumes a spherical figure. We may usefully interpret this
 as a tendency of the surface to contract ; but it is important
 not to lose sight of the idea that the spherical form is the
 result of the endeavour of the parts to get as near to one
 another as is possiblef- A drop is spherical under capillary
 forces for the same reason that a large gravitating mass of
 (non-rotating) liquid is spherical.
     In the following sketch of Laplace's theory we will com
 mence in the manner adopted by MnxwellJ. If / be the
 distance between two particles m, m', the cohesive attraction
 between them is denoted in Laplace's notation by m m' <f>(J-),
 where <f>(f) is a function of / which is insensible for all
 sensible values of /, but which becomes sensible and even
 enormously great, when / is exceedingly small.

distance to a distance z from an infinitely thin stratum of the
substance whose mass per unit of area is a ; (2) the attraction
of a particle m placed at a distance z from the plane surface
of an infinite solid whose density is <r."
    The intrinsic pressure can now be found immediately by
calculating the mutual attraction of the parts of a large mass
which lie on opposite sides of an imaginary plane interface.
If the density be <r, the attraction between the whole of one
side and a layer upon the other distant z from the plane and

    The expression for the superficial tension is most readily
found with the aid of the idea of superficial energy, intro
duced into the subject by Gauss. Since the tension is con
stant, the work that must be done to extend the surface by
one unit of area measures the tension, and the work required
for the generation of any surface is the product of the tension
and the area. From this consideration we may derive La
place's expression, as has been done by Dupr<5* and Thomsonf.

 The intrinsic pressure will thus be infinite whatever n may
 be. If n + 4 be positive, the attraction of infinitely distant
 parts contributes to the result ; while if n + 4 be negative, the
 parts in immediate contiguity act with infinite power. For
the transition case, discussed by Sutherland*, of n + 4 = 0,

K0 is also infinite. It seems therefore that nothing satisfac
tory can be arrived at under this head.
   As a third example we will take the law proposed by Young,

 The numerical results differ from those of Young*, who finds
 that " the contractile force is one-third of the whole cohesive
force of a stratum ofparticles, equal in thickness to the interval
 to which the primitive equable cohesion extends," viz. T=£aK ;
 whereas according to the above calculation T= ^joK. The
 discrepancy seems to depend upon Young having treated the
 attractive force as operative in one direction only.
    In his Elementary Illustrations of the Celestial Mechanics
 of Laplacet, Young expresses views not in all respects con
 sistent with those of his earlier papers. In order to balance
 the attractive force he introduces a repulsive force, following
 the same law as the attractive except as to the magnitude of
 the range. The attraction is supposed to be of constant inten
 sity (J over a range c, while the repulsion is of intensity R,
 and is operative over a range r. The calculation above given
 is still applicable, and we find that

 In these equations, however, we are to treat K as vanishing,
 the specification of the forces operative across a plane being
 supposed to be complete. Hence, as Young finds, we must
 take

                          Tm™MXp-r)                            (24)
 At this point I am not able to follow Young's argument, for
 he asserts (p. 490) that "the existence of such a cohesive
 tension proves that the mean sphere of action of the repulsive
 force is more extended than that of the cohesive : a conclusion
 which, though contrary to the tendency of some other modes
 of viewing the subject, shows the absolute insufficiency of all
 theories built upon the examination of one kind of corpuscular
 force alone." According to (24) we should infer, on the con
trary, that if superficial tension is to be explained in this way,
we must suppose that c > r.
    My own impression is that we do not gain anything by this
attempt to advance beyond the position of Laplace. So long
as we are content to treat fluids as incompressible there is no
 objection to the conception of intrinsic pressure. The repul
 sive forces which constitute the machinery of this pressure
are probably intimately associated with actual compression,
and cannot advantageously be treated without enlarging the
foundations of the theory. Indeed it seems that the view of
the subject represented by (23), (24), with c greater than r,
cannot consistently be maintained. For consider the equili
brium of a layer of liquid at a free surface A of thickness AB
equal to r. If the void space beyond A were filled up with
liquid, the attractions and repulsions across B would balance
one another ; and since the action of the additional liquid
upon the parts below B is wholly attractive, it is clear that in
the actual state of things there is a finite repulsive action
across B, and a consequent failure of equilibrium.
   I now propose to exhibit another method of calculation,
which not only leads more directly to the results of Laplace,
but allows us to make a not unimportant extension of the
formula; to meet the case where the radius of a spherical
cavity is neither very large nor very small in comparison with
the range of the forces;.
   The density of the fluid being taken as unity, let V be the
potential of the attraction, so that
                      V =iXfnCf)dxdydz,          ....         (25)

from the point at which the potential is to be reckoned. The
hydrostatic equation of pressure is then simply
                             dp=dV ;
or, if A and B bo any two points,
                        />b-/>a=Vb-Va                         (26)
Suppose, for example, that A is in the interior, and B upon a
plane surface of the liquid. The potential at B is then exactly
one half of that at A, or Vs = i Va; so that

 Now p\-pB is the intrinsic pressure K0 ; and thus
           K0=2^^U(f)fdf= ~^<l>(f)fdf,
 as before.
    Again, let ns suppose that the fluid is bounded by concen
 tric spherical surfaces, the interior one of radius r being either
 large or small, but the exterior one so large that its curvature
 may be neglected. We may suppose that there is no external
 pressure, and that the tendency of the cavity to collapse is
 balanced by contained gas. Our object is to estimate the
 necessary internal pressure.

    In the figure B D C E represents the cavity, and the pres
 sure required is the same as that of the fluid at such a point
 as B. Since j>a=0, pB = VB- VA. Now VA is equal to that
 part of Vb which is due to the infinite mass lying below the
 plane B F. Accordingly the pressure required (pb) is the

29b'                  Lord Rayleigh on the
potential at B due to the fluid which lies above the plane B F.
Thus
                      p*=fflll(f)dxdydz,
where the integrations are to be extended through the region
above the plane B F which is external to the sphere BDCE.
On the introduction of polar coordinates the integral divides
itself into two parts. In the first from /=0 to/=2r the
spherical shells (e. g. D H) are incomplete hemispheres, while
in the second part from/=2r to f-<x> the whole hemisphere
(e. g. IGF) is operative. The spherical area D H, divided
                 = 2ir\  sin 9 d6=2ir cos 6 =irfjr.
The area GF =2-nf.
    Thus, dropping the suffix B, we get the unexpectedly simple
expression
           P=}^y(f)fdf+^y(f)fdf.                        .   .   (27)
 If 2r exceed the range of the force, the second integral
vanishes and the first may be supposed to extend to infinity.
 Accordingly

 in accordance with the value (12) already given for T0. We
 see then that, if the curvature be not too great, the pressure
 in the cavity can be calculated as if it were due to a constant
 tension tending to contract the surface. In the other extreme
  case where r tends to vanish, we have ultimately
                      p=2^^U(/)fd/=K0.
     In these extreme cases the results are of course well known ;
  but -we may apply (27) to calculate the pressure in the cavity
  when its diameter is of the order of the range. To illustrate
  this we may take a case already suggested, in which ty(f) = e~M,
  II(/) = /3_1e_fi/'. Using these, we obtain on reduction,

  considered. Thus, if r be very great,

   In a recent memoir* Fuchs investigates a second approxi
mation to the tension of curved surfaces, according to which
the pressure in a cavity would consist of two terms ; the first
(as usual) directly as the curvature, the second subtractive,
and proportional to the cube of the curvature. This conclu
sion does not appear to harmonize with (27), (29), which
moreover claim to be exact expressions. It may be remarked
that when the tension depends upon the curvature, it can no
longer be identified with the work required to generate a unit
surface. Indeed the conception of surface-tension appears to
be appropriate only when the range is negligible in comparison
with the radius of curvature.
   The work required to generate a spherical cavity of radius r
is of course readily found in any particular case. It is ex

ceases. In this case by (18), II(/) absolutely vanishes, if

  XXXV. On some Problems in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.
                  By S. H. Burbuey, F.R.S.*
                  Maxwell's Law of Distribution.
 1. \1THEN a gas or mixture of gases is at rest in the
      T*      normal state, the distribution of velocities among
the molecules may be defined thus:—Take an origin O, and
let the vector velocity of each molecule be represented by a
 line drawn from O. Then the number per unit of volume of
molecules of mass M, whose velocities are represented by fines
from the origin to points within the element of volume dQ
at P, is
where N is the number of molecules of mass M in unit of
                3
volume, and        is the mean kinetic energy of a molecule.
    2. I shall employ two other variables :—
    Let V denote the vector velocity of the common centre of
 gravity of two molecules whose masses are M and m. Call
 this their common velocity.
    Let R denote the velocity of M, r that of m, relative to this
 common centre of gravity. Then the velocity of M is the
 resultant of V and R, that of m is the resultant of V and r.
    The relative velocity of M and m is R + r, and shall be
 denoted by p, so that
                 R_w         _ M + m T} _ M + to
                 7 ~ M' P~ ~m~               ~M~ r-
    3. The molecules whose velocities are represented by lines

from the origin to points within the element of volume dQ at
P shall be said to have velocities OP (dQ) . Or if we give to
rfQ any particular form, as (cPdwdS, <o being OP and rfS
being a small solid angle, we may speak of the velocities OP
(w2 da> dS) . If X, fi, v be direction-cosines of the axis of a
cone containing the elementary solid angle dS, we may speak
of the direction \fivdS as comprising all lines drawn from
the vertex of that cone and falling within it ; and \/*va>2 dw dS
as comprising all velocities between at and dco in directions
within that cone.
     4. In Maxwell's distribution, if ice consider all pairs of
molecules, M and m, having common velocity V, and relative
velocity R + r, for given V all directions of R or r are equally
probable.
     Let OC = V, POjo = K + r,
              PO_m _ R
              pO ~M~ r-
 If OC be given, the number of the
 pairs in question for which the angle
 POC lies between 6 and 6 + dd is pro
 portional to
          e-K*              smB d0.
     Now
           M . PC8 + m . p& = MR2 + mr* + W+nl V2
                              -2(M.R-m.r)Vcos0,
 which is independent of 6 because MR- mr = 0. The number
  is therefore proportional to sin 6 dd, and this proves the pro
  position. -
      5. If the molecules behave in their mutual encounters as elastic
  spheres, then for given direction of the relative velocity before
  encounter, all directions after encounter are equally probable.
      I think it unnecessary to give a proof of this proposition.
      6. (a) Every distribution of velocities among the molecules
  which satisfies the condition that for given V all directions of R
  are equally probable, is undisturbed by encounters, or by the
  mutual"action of the molecides, and is therefore, in the absence
  of external forces, stationary.
      (b) No distribution whatever of velocities among the molecides
   is undisturbed by encounters, or by the mutual action of the
   molecules, unless it satisfies the condition that for given V all
   directions of R are equally probable.
       Of these theorems (a) corresponds to the well-known pro

300           Mr. S. H. Burbury on some Problems
position that Maxwell's distribution is stationary. The con
verse (b) is founded on Boltzmann's proof (Sitzungsberichte,
Vienna, 1872), but is much simplified by using V and R for
variables.
    We will prove these theorems, (a) and (b), first on the
hypothesis that the molecules are to be treated as elastic
spheres. We will suppose two classes of molecules having
mass M and m respectively. It will be sufficient if we prove
our propositions for the encounters of M with m.
    Let ¥{xy Z) dxdydz, or F .dxdy dz, be the number per
unit of volume of molecules of mass M whose velocities are
represented by lines from the origin to points within the ele
ment of volume dx dy dz atxyz. Similarly/(..r'y'.z') dx1 dy1 dz1,
or /. dx1 dy' dzf, is the corresponding number for the wi's. If
xy z be denoted by P, and xf y' z1 by p, we will write Fp and
fp for F and /.
    Let C be the point £ t] f, Consider all the pairs, M and m,
 which have OC for common velocity. About C as centre
 describe two spherical shells, one with radii R . . .R + dR, the
                               M
 other with radii r . . . r -\   dR. Let P be a point in the first
                               m
 shell. The common velocity being OC, and the velocity of M
 being OP, the velocity of m is Op, where p is a determinate
 point in the second shell, namely in PC produced so that
 Op     M
      - — And so fp can be expressed as a function of £ 17 f,
and of xy z, the coordinates of P.
    The effect of an encounter between M and m under these
 circumstances is, without altering V, to substitute for TCp
 some other common diameter of the spherical shells as the
 relative velocity. Let it be P'C//. Then all directions of
 P'C//, given PCy>, are equally probable.
    The number of pairs M and m per unit of volume and time,
 having OC for common velocitv, for which the relative velocity
 is PVp(dS) before, and P'Cp'(dS') after, encounter, dS and

                  in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.                301
<iS' being small solid angles, is
where s is the sum of the radii of M and m.
    The number of pairs for which it is P'Cp'^S') before, and
PCp(<iS) after, encounter is
           j5 Fp/ydS' irfp, that is TP,/p.^~ irs'p.
    If, then, Fp/p=Fp<^, the number per unit of volume and
 time of pairs for which the relative velocity turns, as the result
 of encounter, from PCp to P'Cp' is equal to the number for
 which it turns from P'Cp' to PCp. And if this is true,
 given C, for every two directions of PCp, and for all positions
 of C, it follows that the distribution of velocities is not affected
 by encounters between M and m.
     Now Fpfp represents the chance that, given V = OC, the
 relative velocity shall have direction PCp. And we see that
 if, given OC, this chance be the same for all directions through
 C, the distribution of velocities is not affected by encounters.
 So (a) is proved.
     If for some two directions of the diameter Fp^^fcFp/,, we
 proceed as follows, adapting Boltzmann's proof.
     Let
             H = ffidx dy dz F(xyz)(\og ¥{xyz)-l)
               + jjj dx dy dzf(xy z)(log/(xyz) - 1),
  the limits being in each case +00 , or, as we will write it,
           H = ffidx dy dz{ F (log F - 1) +/(log/- 1) } ;
  then
            §=tff^{§l.gF+fl.g/}.
  Now F is supposed to vary only by encounters between the
  M's and the wi's. Therefore

   where TP is the number per unit of time of encounters with
   the m molecules which the M molecules with velocity OP
   undergo, and T'P is the number per unit of volume and time
   of encounters between M and m from which M issues with
   velocity OP. Now P being given, and the velocity of M
   being OP, C or f^f may have any position whatever, and

 given P,
 and by symmetry        has the same value.     In this equation
fp- and fp are supposed to be expressed as functions of f y ?
and the coordinates of P or P'.
    In order to find ~^-f we multiply       by log Fp and ~ by
 log/,, and then integrate over all positions of P in space. If
 VGp and Y'(Jp' be any two diameters of the spberical shells de
 scribed with radii R and r about C, -3- will contain the term
              «V Cog FP + log/,) (FP./,. - FP/,) ;
 that is
              Tr^log (Fp/,)(FP./,,-Fp/,).
 By symmetry, as P' is a position which P will assume in
                  dH
 the integration,     will also contain the term
                 wfplog (Fp./^)(FP/F-FF/y).

 And adding the two terms together,         contains the term
                   ^Vlog^-(Fp^-FP/,),
 and will consist wholly of a series of terms of that form.
     Now this expression is necessarily negative unless
 Fp<fp< = Fpfp, and is then zero.    Therefore ^- is necessarily

negative unless Fp> = FP>/J) for every two directions of the
diameter through C ; that is unless, for given V, all direc
tions of the relative velocity are equally probable. Now in
stationary motion H must be invariable with the time. There
fore the motion is not stationary, or the distribution of
velocities is not unaltered by encounters, unless the condition
be satisfied. So (6) is proved.
    7. We will next assume that the two molecules M and m
act on each other with finite forces. Then in the infinitely
short time dt the relative velocity is by their mutual action
during encounter turned through some small angle ; and
generally also altered in magnitude, in such manner as that
                      a        P2 + y= constant,
 X being the potential of the mutual action.
    It is not necessary to restrict the number of m molecules
 which may simultaneously be in encounter with, and affect
 the motion of, a given M. But by the superposition of small
 motions, we may regard the total time-variation of the velocity
 of M as the sum, or resultant, of the time-variation due to the
 action of all the m molecules separately, each acting for the
 time dt. We can then prove that for any given class of M's
 with any class of m's, as the result of their mutual action,
 -jt- is negative unless the condition is satisfied, in which
 case it is zero.
     The mutual action is assumed to depend on the relative
  positions, not on the velocities, of M and m.
     We assume also the distribution to be uniform in space, so
 that the number per imit of volume of any given class of
  molecules is independent of the position.
     Let, then, at any instant the distance between M and m be
  between q and q + dq.
     Let the common velocity be OC = V, and let the velocity
  of M be OP(R2rfRiS).
     The velocity of m or Op is then determined by these con
  ditions. In order completely to define the motion we require
  one other coordinate of position. Let it be 0. Consequently
  the number of pairs M and m satisfying these conditions at
  any instant is Fp/PR2 dRdS dq d0. Call this the first state.
     By mutual action V is not affected. The motion under
  the influence of the mutual action is determinate, and after
  time at the same variables shall be denoted by accented letters.
   Then q', Bf, S', 6' are functions of q, li, S, 6, known if the
                                   Y 2

   304          Mr. S. H. Burbury on some Problems
   law of mutual action is known. Call this the second state.
   The number of pairs, M and m, in the second state, at any
   instant is FP' / ' R'2 dR' dS' dq' dd'.
      Now by a known theorem (Boltzraann, Sitzungsbericlde,
   Vienna, 1871 ; Watson, ' Kinetic Theory of Gases,' Prop. HI.),
                 R2 <ffi dS dq d0= R'2 dW dS' dq1 dff,
   or, since
                 dq= —pdt, and d</= —p'dt,
                 R* dR dS d0 pdt = R'2 dW d® dff p'dt.
      The number of pairs which in unit of volume and time dt
   pass by their mutual action from the first to the second state
  is
                        Fp/pR9rfR<iS dOpdt ;
  and the number which so pass from the second state to the
  first is
                      FP'fP'R'*dn'dS' dff p'dt.
  If therefore
                                           Pi
 the number of pairs which pass from the first to the second
  state is equal to the number which pass from the second to the
 first in the same time, and this being true for all positions of
  C and of P, the distribution of velocities is unaffected by the
 mutual action of M and m.
     If Fp'/p gfcFp^, then we form -3- as before, and it will as
 before consist of a series of terms, each of the form
                     log54(Fp'/,'-FP/„),
 and is therefore necessarily negative until for given C, Fp.yj,-
 becomes equal to Fp/p for all directions through C.
    8. The complete expression for -^-in case of elastic spheres
is
    jjjrff dV rf? f"rfBwV - R2 jJ^S log (F/){F7'-F/>,
where JJ^S denotes integration over a spherical shell described
with radii R... R + (ZR about the point            as centre, and
F'/' denotes the mean value of F/ for all positions of the
diameter of that shell.

                    in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.           305
    This may be put in the form
J dVY*          d«27r sin aJ dUirs^pW JJdS log (F/XF^-F/) ,
where a is the angle made by OC with a given line—or,
changing the order of integration, -y- =
J rfW8j* dBnrs*pW^'d*2irrin* Jj tfSlog(F/)(Fy'-F/).
    9. In case of finite forces acting between the molecules, we
have no such simple expression as irs^p to denote the number
per unit of time of encounters between two molecules with
relative velocity p. We might define an encounter to be a
case in which the relative velocity of two molecules is turned
by their mutual action through an angle exceeding a certain
limit, reckoning from the time when mutual action begins, to
 a time when it has ceased, to be appreciable. If with that
 definition we denote by .nsip the number of encounters per
 unit of time, * is generally a function of p or of R. We
 might use irs*p in this sense for any medium in which the
 coincidence of two or more encounters for the same molecule
 simultaneously is so rare as to be negligible.
     10. The equation
                               FP/p=Fp./„
 is satisfied by
                             FP=C6-*M0P2,
 where C, C are constants, because if PCp, QC</ be two
  diameters of the spherical shells,
                   M . OP2 + mOf = M . OQ3 + mO<f.
      It is also satisfied by
                       fp _ Qe-AM(OP2+us-2uOPcoiP))
                        f _ Q/e-*m(Opa+na-2uOpcoi/S')
                       JP                             9
  where u is a constant line measured in any direction, and
  /3, /3' are the angles made by OP and Op with that direction,
   because M . OP cos /8 + m . Op cos ft' has the same value for all
   directions of PC/>. These are the values of Fp and fp when
   both sets of molecules, M and m, have the same velocity, u,
   combined with the velocities required by the kinetic theory
   for a gas at rest.
       A motion of this description is called by Professor Tait

 306          Mr. S. H. Burbury on some Problems
 " mass motion." I prefer to call it a motion of simple trans
 lation. Since the equation FP^, =FP/P'is satisfied by such
 a motion, the distribution of velocities is unaffected by en
 counters. As is otherwise also evident, because the motion
 of translation does not affect the relative velocities, it is not
 necessary that u should be small. It may, for instance, be the
 earth's motion in space. If, however, u be very small in a
 motion of this kind, the number per unit of volume of mole
 cules of mass M whose velocities are between a> and w -f- dco in
 direction \fivdS is
             M (^) e-*H"V d<o dS{l + 2X/iMo)m),
the direction of u being taken for axis of x.
                 On Disturbed States of a Gas.
    11. Thus far we have treated only of a gas at rest or in
simple translation, in both of which cases — =0.        Both may
be regarded as normal states. We come now to consider cer
tain disturbances in which, by the action of external causes,
the gas is maintained in a state differing from the normal state.
We might suppose generally the number per unit of volume
of molecules of mass M having velocities \fi vca2 da> dS
to be
                          F(»)»V» dS,
and
               F(»)=N (^)V*M"2{ 1 + 2C, Y,},
where the Y's are any spherical harmonic functions referred
to the origin, the Cs functions of <a, and SC.Yjis supposed
very small compared with unity. In the problems with which
we shall deal the harmonics will be of the first and second
orders only.
   12. In such a system H differs from the minimum value
which it would have were there no external disturbing causes.
Encounters between the molecules tend to diminish H, and
so to reduce the system to the normal condition, and the rate
of diminution of H increases with the increase of the distur
bance. If there be an external cause always producing the
disturbance at a constant rate, a state of steady motion will
be reached in which the disturbance is diminished by encoun
ters as fast as it is increased by the operation of external
                                    dH
conditions. We shall denote by -.- the time-variation of H

               in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.              307
due to encounters, and by BIT <— its time-variation due to ex-
ternal causes.   In steady motion
                           dt -r
   In like manner for any other function, as F, ^— shall be

nal causes, and the condition for steady motion is
   13. Let us consider the case of two sets of molecules, each
subject to a small disturbance.
   For the M set let
                P(») = N         V*M"'(1 + X) .
   For the m set let
                X*)=»(^)f«-*"*'(i+*)-
    Here N and n are   the numbers of molecules per unit volume
 of the M and m sets   respectively, and X and x represent the
 disturbances.
    Let us form the    spherical shells described about C, with
 radii R, r as in (6).   Let PC/) be any common diameter, and
                        w = OP, y = oP.
 Let XP, xp be the values of X and X at P and p respectively.
 In that case
              Mtu9 + mf = (M + m) V9 + MR9 + mr9

        14. Diffusion.—Two reservoirs, A and B, are connected by
     a uniform horizontal tube. In A is a mixture of two gases,
     gas M and gas m, in certain proportions. In B is a mixture
     of the same two gases in different proportions. The tempera
     ture and pressure of the mixture are the same in either reser
     voir and at all points in the tube between them. Gas M is
     of greater density in A than in B.
        Then a stream flows through the tube, of M from A to B,
     of m from B to A. If the proportions in which the gases are
     mixed in the reservoirs be maintained constant, as if for
     instance the reservoirs were of infinite extent, the stream
     becomes steady.

                  in the Kinetic Theory of Gases.           309
    Let N be the number per unit of volume of molecules of
  as M, 71 the number for gas m, at any point in the tube.

The stream velocity is assumed to be very small compared
with the molecular velocity of mean square. The problem of
diffusion is to find the stream velocity.
    Take as an element of volume in the tube a cylinder of
length Bx, and whose base is unit area parallel to yz.
    Let N be the number per unit of volume of molecules M
 at the left-hand face (towards A) of that cylinder. Then the
number at its right-hand face is
                  N + 8.rj^— , that is IS-Sx^.
                          (XX                  CUB
 The number of M molecules of the class \fivto2 dwdS which
 enter the cylinder through its left-hand face in unit of time is
     The number of the same class which pass out of the cylinder
 through its right-hand-face in unit of time is

   15. Conduction of heat in a single gas.—Let there be a
horizontal tube, AB, filled with a single gas. Let the
temperature be higher at A than at B, and be maintained
constant at each of those points, and let the pressure be uni-
                                      N
form throughout the tube, so that -j- =P, a constant, pro-
!>ortional to the pressure. With the same notation as in the
 ast example, let us consider the molecules of the class
X p v <a2 da> dS which enter the elementary cylinder from the
left in unit of time. Their number is, putting k for km,
                     \N(tye-h*WdmdS.
   The number of the same class which pass out of the ele
mentary cylinder by its right-hand face per unit of time is
                    + XStfJ^N^ye-^jft^ftjrfS,
N and k being variable.
   Therefore, but for encounters, the number of the class
within our elementary cylinder would be increased in unit of
time by
                  -\8z~(N(ty            a>'dmdS,
or the number of the class per unit of volume would be in

   This is positive or negative according as leap > or < -.
For high values of a> there is an increase, for low values a
diminution. This increase or diminution is in steady motion
compensated by encounters, because molecules with high
velocities are on average moving more to the right than to the

    16. Viscosity of a single gas.—A gas on either side of the
plane of xz is uniform throughout as regards temperature
and density. On the negative side of the plane y = - a the
gas has, and is constrained to maintain, a constant velocity,
v, of simple translation in direction x. And on the positive
side of the plane y=+a, a constant velocity —v of simple
translation in that direction. The problem is to find the
quantity of x momentum which under those circumstances is
 carried across unit area of the plane of xz per unit of time in
the positive direction by molecules crossing that plane.
 Take any two planes parallel to xz and distant &y from each
 other. Suppose for a moment that on the negative side of
 the negative plane the gas has a velocity, v, of simple transla
 tion in direction x. Then the number of the class
                             \ fi v <a2 da> d$>

 And, but for encounters, the class within the layer between
 the planes would gain in number per unit of volume and time

 In steady motion the number of the class in question is
 diminished by encounters by the same quantity.

312           Mr. S. H. Burbury on some Problems
   The motion of the gas is a motion of simple translation with
velocity v= - qy in direction x, where q is constant, combined
with a disturbance of the second order symmetrical about the
plane x=y. In this case we should assume
                    F=N          e-*»2(l +\fuf>(a>*)),
where <£(<o2) is an undetermined function, and
                   |S-N(i)V-x,.Sw|.
   17. The complete solution of any problem of the kind would
have to be found from the equation
                              dt + &      u'
expressing the steadiness of the motion for each class of mole
cules. It does not appear that in case of diffusion we can
obtain a solution by assuming the two gases to have a motion
of simple translation, one in one direction and the other in
the opposite.
             Relation of Diffusion tyc. to Temperature.
    Without obtaining a complete solution of any of these pro
 blems, we can by means of the equation
                             dt^ "dt
 determine the relation in which the solution, whatever it may
 be, stands to the absolute temperature of the system.
    18. When the disturbance is of the first order the solution
 proposed is, using X to denote the disturbance as in (13),
                           X=XX(A)<MAM<a2),
in which %(A) is a function of A to be determined, and
 £(AMa>2) is a function of AM<u2, containing only odd positive
powers of a> yVtM, as for instance
               <t> (AMa>9) = Cow */ AM + 0, (AM) W + &c,
 where the C's are numerical.
    Similarly in dealing with two gases, we shall assume
 and <f>' has similar form.      With these values of X and x,

and therefore varies as ^,or as the square root of the abso

that 7rs2 is independent of R, and therefore holds only for
elastic spheres.

assume for the solution \x(&)0(&a>9) , k being written for hm.

   We have now to compare two systems in each of which P is
constant throughout the tube, but nas not necessarily the same
constant value in both systems, and k has different values in
the two systems.
   We may make
                               N
   (1) P the same, that is       the same, in both systems.

   In case (2) it has dimensions k —
                                       yk
   Now the flow of heat per unit of time through a section of
the tube, that is the rate of conduction, is
                          |^ da>e-k°>Wx{k)a><t>{ka>1),
 and therefore varies

                                  vk
 We have then the following result. Assuming that the
 molecules may be treated, as regards their mutual encounters,
 as elastic spheres, the rate of conduction of heat between
 points of equal pressure but unequal temperature varies, as
 between two systems with the same pressure, inversely, and
 as between two systems with the same density directly, as the
 square root of the absolute temperature.
    23. When the disturbance is of the second order, as in the
 problem of viscosity, the mean value of \fm, given E, is (see

    As the result when all the integrations are effected, -j^

    But the excess of momentum carried in the positive

    24. The above results are obtained on the hypothesis that
 7Ts9 is independent of p or R, and therefore only on the
 hypothesis that the molecules may be treated as elastic
 spheres. On any other hypothesis 7r*2 is a function of R, and
 as such will affect the integration according to R, and the

  In this case, in dealing with diffusion^— will be proportional
 to (y(A))2, instead of          - as in the case of elastic spheres,

  absolute temperature, instead of as the square root of the abso
 lute temperature.
     If the experiments from which it appeared that the rate of
  diffusion varies as the square root of the temperature can be
  relied on as giving exact, and not merely approximate,
  results, they afford ground for the inference that molecules
  of gases may, as regards their mutual encounters, be treated
  as elastic spheres.

      XXXVT. A New Periodic Property of the Elements.
              By William Sutherland, M.A., B.Sc*
 TO help towards getting some insight into the physical
        basis of the periodicity in the properties of the elements
 unfolded by Newlands, Mendelejeff, Meyer, Oarnelley, and
 others, it occurred to me to investigate some property in
 which the period would be a real time-period. With the
 same object in view many workers have attacked the spectra
 of the elements ; but though interesting results have been
 obtained, the complications of the subject have proved too
 entangled to unravel to a simple issue as yet. But if we start
 from the usual idea that in solids the molecules vibrate about
 a mean position, then at some characteristic temperature each
 solid ought to have a period of vibration characteristic of its
 molecule. The question is, At what temperature? At the
 melting-point in each case the vibratory motion just breaks
 down, so that we ought to expect some simple relation
 amongst the periods of vibration of the elements at their
 melting-points. To find relative values of these periods we
 may proceed thus :—Suppose a molecule of mass, M, and
 specific heat (mean), C, heated up from rest at absolute zero
to its melting-point, T. It receives heat, MOT, which we
will take to be proportional to its kinetic energy £ Mr2, where
 v is the velocity of the molecule at the melting-point : this
would be strictly true only if we kept the body from expand
ing while being heated. Now, by Dulong and Petit's law,
M(J is approximately constant for the elements, so that v, the
mean velocity of the molecule in its vibrations at the melting-
point, is proportional to VT/M. Knowing thus the mean
velocity of the vibration, if we can find its length L then its
time or period L/t> is obtainable. Let d be the density of the
substance, then M/d represents the volume occupied by the
molecule ; and if a is the mean coefficient of linear expansion
of the substance between absolute zero and T, then aT(M/d)i
represents the increase in the linear dimensions of the space
occupied by a molecule when heated from zero to T, and
therefore represents the length or amplitude of the vibration
just as the molecule is going to leave the vibratory state cha
racteristic of the solid. Hence the periodic time p of the
molecule at the melting-point is proportional to
                      «T(M/<OVMCT/M.

           A New Periodic Property of the Elements.          319
All the quantities in this expression are known for a large
number of substances ; but it so happens that a has not been
determined for several of the bodies in Mendelejeffs most inter
esting families—those of Li and Be. To get over the want of
these data it might seem advisable to use R. Pictet's" empirical
formula aT(M/d)i= constant (Comptes Rendus, lxxxviii., and
Meyer's ' Modern Theories of Chemistry/ translated by Bedson
and Williams, p. 135). But this formula applies with accu
racy only to the harder and heavier metals, for wh1ch the
mean value of the constant is -045 ; instead of which for Mg
we get -066, and for Al '057, while for Na the discrepancy
is greater : this formula fails, then, just where we need it at
present. But I have found an empirical equation which will
suit our purpose, namely aTMT= constant, the constant lying
between '04 and -05 for all the metals for which data are
available except Sb, Bi, and Sn (Ir also falls to '037). This
formula includes Mg, Al, and Na, and may therefore be hope
fully applied to the other metals of the same families, as will
appear in the result. Taking '045 as the mean value of the
constant and substituting for oT, we get p proportional to
 (M/d)iMi/v/T, dropping the constants -045 and MG. Using
the values for d and T obtainable from Meyer's ' Modern
Theories of Chemistry,' and in our uncertainty as to the true
molecular weight of the solid elements, taking M as atomic
 weight, we get the following relative values of the periods of
 vibration of the members of the lithium family at the melting-
point :—
         Li.        Na.         K.        fib.      Os.
         .21        -43       -66         -96      123
At a glance these numbers are seen to run as 1, 2, 3, 4'5, 6.
   For the next family we get
        Be.        Mg         Ca.           Sr.      Ba.
        -35        -70       1-04         1-62      1'88
 These numbers run as 1, 2, 3, 4-5, and 5-3, not 6 exactly.
    Considering the nature of the assumptions we have been
 forced to make, we must allow that these numbers show
 beautifully simple harmonic relations to exist between the
 periodic times of the molecules of solid metals at their
 melting-points. Taking now Cu and Ag, which are sub
 sidiary relatives of the Li family, we get periods -21 and
 -30, which are nearly as 2 to 3, and involve the same funda
mental constant as the main family. Again, Zn and Cd,
which stand in the same relation to the second main family
                                Z2

320           Mr. W. Sutherland on a New Periodic
as Cu and Ag to the first, have periods -32 and -47, again as
2 to 3, and involving a fundamental constant very close to
that of the main family. In the next main family the only
members for which data are available are Al and La, for
which we get -20 and -56, which are nearly as 2 to 6, that is,
nearly as Na to Cs or Mg to Ha, as they ought to be. But
the subsidiary members Ga and In give -54 and -57, which
are not related in the same way as Cu and Ag or Zn and Cd;
so thaf here complete analogy between the families breaks
down when we reach the family that marks the transition to
the non-metallic families. The following three groups of
values are worth notice :—
   Mn. Fe. Co. Ni.           Ru. Rh. Pd.        Os. Ir. Pt.
   -16 -16 -16 -17           -21 -20 -23        -23 -25 -27
   The following values of (M/d)iM.i/\/T are added ; though
not of much use, because in many cases we know aTM^ not
to be near enough to -045.
      An. Hg.       TL   Sn.    Pb.      P.  As. Sb.     Bi.
      -35 -94 -65 -55 -63 -33 -36 -49 -71
       S.     Se.   Te.   CL     Br.      I.
      -41 -50 -50 -68 -80 '75.
   It is interesting now to pass on to the case of compounds,
extending to them the formula p=(M/d)'Mi/^/T, taking M
as the ordinary molecular weight, and remembering now that
MC is constant only for similarly constituted molecules, being
proportional to the number of atoms in the molecule. Car-
nelley has given the melting-points of many compounds (Phil.
Mag. [5] xviii.). Let us consider first the compounds of the Li
family with the halogens ; the study of the numbers tabulated
below shows that the period p of any such compound is the
sum of two periods characteristic of each of its atoms. These
characteristic periods are as follows : —
              Li.        Na.           E.        Kb.
             -075       -150         -225       -375
               F.        OL           Br.         I.
             -116       -232         -348       -464.
   For the lithium family these numbers run as 1, 2, 3, 5,
almost the same as the series for them in the free state. For
the halogens the numbers run as 1, 2, 3, 4. The soundness
of these conclusions is shown in the following Table, where
the values of p or (M/cQiMtyv/T, obtained from experiment

                    Property of the Elements.               321
and from the above values for the metals and halogens, are

   It is worthy of notice that the relation holds from the light
molecule LiP to the heavy one Rbl. To the same type of
compound belong the haloid compounds of Ag and the thal-
lious compounds as well as the mercurous and cuprous, if we
treat the latter sets as on the type CuCl, HgCl, and so on.
Thus we get for the periodic time of Cu in the cuprous state
-24, and of Ag '32, numbers which are nearly in the same ratio
to one another as the -21 and -30 before, but standing now
no longer in the same relation to those of the main family.
For Hg in the mercurous state we get a value -55, and for
Tl '52. Subjoined is a comparison as before:—
                      Cu.        Ag.        Hg.         Tl.

           cal.       -70        -78       1-01        -98
The agreement here is not so good ; in fact these numbers
by themselves would prove nothing, but in conjunction with
what has gone before they show that wo have got approxi
mately the periods which these four metals carry into their
compounds.
   Coming to compounds of the type CaCI2, we must re
member that MG is 1-5 times its value in the previous class
of compounds, so that to get comparable values of p we must
take j>=(M/d)*M*/ y/ttT.
  Again p is found to be for each molecule the sum of parts
due to each atom, and we find the following values for these :
           Mg.            Ca.         Sr.          Ba.
           -10          -15          -20          -25
numbers which run as 2, 3, 4, 5. Be, the first member of

322         A New Periodic Property of the Elements.
the family, is absent through want of experimental data.
For the halogen atoms as F2, Cl2, Br2, and I3, the following
are the values :—'156, -312, -468, and -624 ; again, the series
1, 2, 3, 4, although the value -156 of the constant of the family
is not double the previous value '116 for the single atoms.
But it must be remembered that we are using the empirical
relation aTM^= constant without knowing whether the value
of the constant may not change with change of type of com
pound. This does not affect the present purpose, which is to
show the existence of harmonic relations.
   To prove the substantial correctness for the values given
for the Be family, and the double halogen atoms, the following
comparison is furnished :—

As the comparison ranges from the light molecule MgF2 to
the heavy one Bal2, it proves the main principle under dis
cussion, in spite of some noticeable disagreements in the two
series of values. The following are some values for other

    It is established then that the periods of vibration of the
molecules of solids at their melting-points show very simple
harmonic relations.
   It is an interesting speculation in molecular physics as to
whether by the analysis of the whole radiation from melting
solids with bolometer and spectroscope similar harmonic
relations could be found and so demonstrate the communica
tion of impressed vibrations to the aether from the oscillating
molecules. A similar study to the above made on organic
compounds might yield useful information about the harmonic
connexions of the organic radicals.

            XXXVII. Electrical Oscillations in Air.
          By John Trowbridge and W. C. Sabine*.
THE experiments of Hertz on electrical waves have opened
         a wide field for investigations in electromagnetism.
The qualitative results of Henry and of Feddersen have been
expressed in a quantitative manner by Sir William Thomson.
Hertz, collecting together the results of previous observers,
and reasoning upon the factors in the formula of Sir W.
Thomson,—which expresses a relation between the capacity
of a Leyden jar and the self-induction of the circuit through
which this jar is discharged,—has detected wave-motion with
its nodal points and ventral segments, on a wire over which
electrical oscillations take place.
    Hertz has also pointed out that the experimental results
confirm Maxwell's theory, that light and heat are electro
magnetic phenomena, and that all energy comes to us from
the sun in electrical pidsations.
    There can be no question of the phenomena of so-called
resonance discovered by Hertz. Koughly speaking, the
results obtained by Hertz's resonators satisfy the formula
t= —\/L0 ; in which t is the period of the electrical oscilla-
     v
tions, L is the inductance of the circuit, and C is the capacity
of the jar, or that of the terminals between which the elec
trical discharge takes place.
    Professor J . J. Thomson has based a method of measuring
the capacities of dielectrics upon this formula and upon
Hertz's work f.

324              Messrs. Trowbridge and Sabine on
    The researches of Feddersen upon electrical oscillations*
were more quantitative than those of Joseph Henry : and
Lorenz f, by his repetition of Feddersen's results, and by his
mathematical analysis of them, apparently gave subsequent
observers a solid basis for calculation.
    The results of Feddersen and of Lorenz were obtained by
photography. An image of the electric spark drawn out by
means of a revolving mirror was photographed, and the dis
tances between the successive oscillations, shown by dark
bands on the photograph, were measured. Lorenz assumed
the ratio between the electrostatic units and the electromag
netic units, v = 300 x 106 metre, as that of the velocity of
                                                27T
light ; and by means of the formula t= — v LC obtained a
satisfactory agreement between the result of experiment and
the theory. He showed, apparently, that a certain lack of
agreement between theory and experiment, which Feddersen
had noticed, was due to taking the dielectric constant of glass
too small.
    It will be noticed that the method of Feddersen, by means
 of which the electrical oscillations are photographed, appa
rently affords an accurate method of determining v. For the
factors L and C occur under the square root, and the per
centage errors of determination of L and C, being under the
 square, are halved. Lorenz did not repeat the entire work of
 Feddersen, but only obtained a sufficient number of photo
 graphs—taken under definite conditions in regard to capacity
and inductance of the circuit —in order to measure t, the time
of oscillation. The accuracy of the results which can be
obtained for v depends upon the limits of accuracy of the
 measurements of the photographs, and of the determinations
 of the dielectric capacity for oscillatory charges.
    In reasoning upon the mode of electrical oscillations in
dielectrics, it occurred to us that the medium of the dielectric
must greatly influence the result. At the instant the elec
trical oscillations occur, the glass of the Leyden jar is subjected
to a strain which is more or less periodic. It is not probable
that the capacity of a condenser is the same for rapid charges
and discharges as for slow ones, and the measurements of
capacity by the ordinary slow methods form no criterion of
the capacity of glass under electrical influences which last but
three millionths of a second. We therefore concluded to

employ an air condenser instead of one of glass, in order to
detect, if possible, the effect of the medium of the dielectric
upon electrical oscillations. In order to obtain sufficient
capacity for a suitable spark, we were obliged to use the
cylindrical form of condenser. The first condenser we em
ployed was made of sheet zinc and consisted of nineteen coaxial
cylinders. The inner cylinder had a diameter of 15-1 centim.,
and the outer one of 60-4 ; the height of the cylinders was
92 centim. The capacity was computed from the formula
                                loZa
in which I is the height, and b and a are radii.
    A correction for the ends was made as follows. The radius
of curvature of the boundary of the cylindrical plates was
considered so large in comparison with the distance between
them that the boundary was treated approximately as a straight
line. We may consider that each zinc cylinder constituted a
plate between infinite imaginary planes which were at zero
potential, these planes being equipotential surfaces. The
zinc cylinder was supposed to have its area extended by a
strip of uniform breadth around its boundary, and the surface-
density was assumed to be the same on the extended plate as
on the parts not near the boundary. Following Maxwell
 (vol. i. § 196), we have
            — logf 2 cos -g- for the correction for length.
            B = a- b= distance between cylinders.
            /S = thickness of cylinder.
             I = height of cylinder.
    This air condenser was connected with a circuit of parallel
 wires, which was carefully strung by means of silk thread
 through the centre of a large unoccupied room. The length
 of this circuit was about fifty feet. It returned upon itself
 to the sparking terminal of the air condenser. The jar was
 charged by a Holtz machine, which worked fairly well under
 all conditions of the atmosphere. The revolving mirror was
 a plane one, 4x5 inches, silvered upon the front face. It
 revolved upon a horizontal axis with an average speed of
 three thousand revolutions per minute. The frame which
 carried the mirror bore also a brass arm provided with a
 minute brush, which rubbed upon a brass sector let into a
 large disk of ebonite. When the brush rested upon this brass
 disk the electrical charge could pass to two terminals of tin,

326             Messrs. Trowbridge and Sabine on
between which the discharge took place. A concave silvered
glass mirror, of 313 centim. radius and 16-5 centim. aperture,
placed at a distance of 230 centim. from the spark, received
the image of the spark and reflected it back to the revohdng
mirror. From the revolving mirror the image was reflected
to a photographic plate, which was at a distance of 259-7
centim. from the rotating mirror.
   The adoption of a plane revolving mirror, and a stationary
concave mirror of long focus, enabled us to place the photo
graphic plate at a distance from the revolving apparatus, and
therefore to employ less speed for the revolving mirror.
There was no sensible aberration of the image. Great care
was taken to balance the mirror. Its large size and weight
made it very important, on account of the danger of the appa
ratus flying apart, that it should revolve with uniformity.
The axis of the mirror was placed horizontally. This pre
caution proved to be a wise one, for twice during the course
of the many runs which were made the mirror flew into
pieces ; the excursions of the fragments, however, were con
fined to a vertical plane. This liability to accident is perhaps
inherent in a method which employs a large plane mirror.
The increased amount of light which results from the use of a
 large mirror, however, forms a valuable compensation. The
 revolving mirror was driven by a gas-engine.
    In order to determine the speed of the mirror at the instant
 the spark passed, the following apparatus was devised. The
 same shaft which carried the revolving mirror also carried a
 brass cylinder 5 centim. in diameter and 21 centim. long.
 This cylinder was covered at each trial with paper which was
 coated with lampblack. A stylus moving along a stationary
 rod beside the shaft could be made to draw a spiral upon the
 revolving cylinder. One terminal of a Ruhmkorff-coil was
 connected with the brass cylinder, and the other with the
 stylus. A second pendulum was made to break the circuit of
 the primary of the RuhmkorfF-coil at intervals of one second,
 and at the middle point of its swing. When the stylus was
 drawn along the stationary rod which served to guide it, it
 was made to release automatically at the beginning of the
 second another pendulum held up by an electromagnet. This
 latter pendulum, at the middle of its swing, discharged the
 air condenser through the inductance-circuit at the instant
 that the mirror was in a suitable position to reflect the image
 of the electric spark into the photographic camera. While
 the stylus was being drawn upon the revolving cylinder, the
 spark from the Ruhmkorff-coil left its trace upon the blackened
 paper. The record on the chronograph consisted of a strongly

                   Electrical Oscillations in Air.          327
marked spiral line of over fifty tarns. The two sparks from
the Ruhmkorff-coil left their trace upon the blackened paper
as spires, which therefore measured the number of revolutions
of the cylinder between the swings of the pendulum, and thus
gave the rate at which the mirror was revolving. The chrono
graph record enabled us to measure the time to              of a
second.
    In any operation which requires that an electrical spark
should make a record upon a disk or cylinder revolving at
great speed a large Ruhmkorff-coil and a strong battery are
necessary, especially if the primary circuit of the Ruhmkorff-
coil is broken by a pendulum. With the ordinary automatic
break, such as is commonly employed upon induction-coils,
the failure of a single break is unimportant. If, however, a
single break fails when a pendulum-break is employed, the
record of the experiment is an imperfect one. An excess of
battery-power and a large battery are therefore necessary. A
metallic breakpiece also was found to be more inconstant for
 our purposes than a mercury-break.
    It was found that a certain simplicity of contrivance was
necessary in the method of discharging the air condenser
 through the inductance-circuit. No arm connected with the
 revolving mirror could be trusted to break or make an elec
 trical circuit by throwing in or out any form of switch. The
 great speed at which it revolved broke all arrangements which
 were tried. By placing a short stiff brush of minute size upon
 the end of the flying terminal connected with the revolving
 mirror, and allowing this brush to rub against a brass plate
 set in an ebonite circle of 41 centim. in diameter, constancy
 of action was secured.
    In order to obtain the same difference of potential at each
 run, experiments were first made with various forms of unit-
jars and pith-ball electrometers. These devices were speedily
 given up in favour of a simple balance-electrometer. One of
 the pans of a delicate balance was replaced by a metallic disk.
 A similar disk, which was stationary, was placed imme
 diately below the movable one. By properly weighting the
 remaining balance-pan great delicacy and range of indication
 were obtained. This apparatus constitutes, in fact, an abso
 lute electrometer. A suitable gnard-ring can be placed around
 the movable disk.
    When the air condenser had been charged to a definite
 potential, the movable disk of the electrometer closed an
 electrical circuit in which was included an electrical bell.
 The observer stationed at the chronograph, at the instant he
 heard the bell, drew the carriage connected with the stylus

328             Messrs. Trowbridge and Sabine on
along the guides which kept the stylus on the blackened
cylinder.
   Calling L the coefficient of self-induction, we have
in which I is the length of conductors contained between two
parallel planes ; b the distance apart of the conductors ; a the
radius of wires.
   In our case the effect of the ends was found to be inappre
ciable. The induction due to the ends can be calculated by
the repeated employment of the formula? for geometric mean
distance t for two lines whose directions intersect at right
angles.
   Lord Rayleigh has given the following formula for induct
ance under rapid oscillations :—
in which A is a constant, depending on form of circuit ; fi is
                                        27T
permeability; R is resistance; p- —' where t is time of
oscillation ; I is length to and fro of inductance-circuit.
   The final value of U for our case is L' = 39697.
   The radius of the wire employed was «=-0501 centim.
   The length was measured in three sections :—
No. 1, length 1197-0 cm., distance between wires &! = 31'55 cm.
No. 2, „         281-0       „      „        „        &2=16-lcm.
No. 3, „         103-0              „        „              11 -3 cm.
   The ohmic resistance of the wires was -742 x 10® for direct
current, and 1'54 x 10* for alternating currents of period t =
-0000031.
   The difficulty in the process of photographing the spark
consisted in discharging the air condenser through the induc
tion-circuit at the instant the revolving mirror was in a
position to reflect the image of the spark to the photographic
plate. The terminal connected with the revolving mirror,
which allowed the electrical discharge to pass when the mirror
was in the desired position, had to be adjusted with extreme
care. The speed of the image at the photographic plate was
about 1 mile per second.
   The photographs were measured by means of a dividing-
engine. At first an objective of low power was used on the
microscope of the dividing-engine. It was found, however,

     The difference in the time of oscillations cannot be ex
  plained by the vibration of the discharging arm lengthening
  and shortening the sparking distance, since this would ne
  cessitate a vibration frequency of 100,000 per second, and an

 amplitude of at least one millimetre ; a velocity and momen
 tum impossible for the apparatus either to acquire or endure.
 This cause also would tend to make the variation range
 equally above and below the calculated value as the sparking
 distance increased or diminished.
    Another explanation may be sought in the varying ohmic
 resistance of the path of the spark, although this explanation
is inadequate to explain the whole effect. Jn order to test it,
 a long (13 centim.) and short (-4 centim.) spark were taken
 from a glass Leyden-jar (see fig. 7). Not only could no
appreciable difference between the two plates be detected, but
there was no variation in the time of successive oscillations.
    In regard to the measurement of the negatives on the
dividing-engine, the following points may be worthy of
mention. At the time the measurements were made, it was
expected that the sparks from the glass condenser would show
the variations, and that the air condenser would give the
constant and theoretical period of oscillation. The reverse
of this appeared when the results of the measurements were
reduced. Moreover, the measurements were made by a run
of the dividing-engine from one end of the negative to the

                   Electrical Oscillations in Air.           333
other ; so that if an error was made in the setting of the cross
hair on the image of one discharge—for example, making the
measurement of that oscillation large—a corresponding
amount would be deducted from the measurement of the next
oscillation. The result of this would be that if the apparent
variations were due to errors in measurement, the periods
of discharge would be alternately large and small, or at least
as often and as far below the theoretical value as above it.
But this is conspicuously not the case.
   A consideration of the curves which represent our results
shows that with quick oscillations which result from the em
ployment of a small air condenser, the air dielectric did not
have time to recover completely, in the time of one oscillation,
from the strain to which it was subjected. With the larger
air condenser, the oscillations being slower, more time was
given for this recovery, and hence the periodicity which we
nave discovered was not so marked. It seems, therefore, that
not only should an electrical resonator be turned for capacity
and self-induction, but also for a certain periodicity of strain
in the dielectric.
   In the case of glass, we should not expect to obtain evidence
of this periodical recovery from a quick strain, since it is
well known that the recovery from strain is so slow that the
discharge from a Leyden-jar is incomplete after a discharge
lasting a second. The curve we give for glass (fig. 7) shows
                               Kg. 7.
 that this periodical recovery is too slow to manifest itself
 during the time of quick oscillation.
    It is perhaps unnecessary to call attention to the fact that
 the capacity of a dielectric for rapid discharges is very diffe
 rent from its capacity for slow discharges. In the paper of
 Lorenz, already cited, the value of the dielectric capacity of
 glass was determined by slow methods, and used to test an
 equation in which the capacity of glass appears under very
 rapid charging and discharging.

334              On Electrical Oscillations in Air.
    Boltzman* and Klemencinf have experimented on the
specific inductive capacity of gases and vapours, and it is seen
 from their results that the agreement between the square root
 of the capacities of the simple gases and fi, the index of re
 fraction for light of these gases, is quite close, as is demanded
 by Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light. A marked
 difference, however, was found to exist in the case of more
 complicated molecules— sulphurous acid, or ethyl bromide, for
 instance. It is probable that the changes of specific capacity
 of heterogeneous media under rapidly alternating forces con
 stitute an important factor in considering the possible agree
 ment between Maxwell's theory of light and the results of
experiment.
    In order to see if an intense magnetic field could modify
 the transmission of electrical waves through a dielectric, the
 following experiment was tried. A glass Leyden-jar, 2-5
 centim. in diameter and 28 centim. in height, connected with
 our inductance-circuit, was placed inside a coil consisting of
 728 windings of large wire. The outer and inner radii of
this coil were 27-7 centim. and 34 centim. Its height was
405 centim. The magnetic field in this coil was supplied by
a Gramme machine, which gave a current through the coil of
approximately 30 amperes. It was expected that a certain
amount of the energy spent in producing the electrical waves
would be consumed in a reaction on the magnetic field. The
total duration of the electrical discharge did not appear to
be notably affected b}' the magnetic field. Certain experi
ments seemed to show a decrease in the total number of
electrical oscillations. A large number of experiments will
be necessary to decide upon the effect of a magnetic field upon
the passage of electrical waves through a dielectric. The
difficulty of obtaining an electrical discharge under the same
difference of potential made the experiment an extremely
difficult one. The method seems to us to promise a discovery
of Maxwell's displacement currents in dielectrics ; and we are
therefore continuing our researches in this direction with a
modified form of apparatus.
                               Conclusion.
    1. The electrical oscillations in the air between the plates of
an air condenser show a periodicity extending through the
entire range of oscillations. We believe that this periodicity

is the analogue of the phenomenon of hysteresis in magnetism.
A certain amount of the energy of the electrical discharge is
spent in overcoming the dielectric viscosity of the air, and in
straining the air dielectric. This strain is not immediately
released in unison with the electrical surgings.
    2. The discussion of our entire results shows unmistakably
that electrical oscillations in air are not represented fully by
the theoretical equations employed by Hertz. Since the latter
writer has taken the term resonance from the subject of
acoustics, and has given it a new significance in relation to
electrical waves, we are tempted to draw also an analogy from
 the subject of sound. Laplace showed that the discrepancy
 between the value for the velocity of sound in air calculated
 from the theoretical equation, and that obtained by experi
 ment, was due to a transformation of energy in heating and
 cooling the air during the passage of the sound wave. Our
 experiments on the transmission of electrical waves through
 the air show also that the values calculated from the theoretical
 equation do not agree with the experimental values. The dis
 crepancy, we believe, can be explained also by a consideration
 of the transformation of energy in the dielectric.
     3. The periodicity which we have studied is most manifest
 when the variable capacity of the air condenser bears a suit
 able relation to the time of the electrical surgings.
     4. The electrical waves are apparently unaffected by passing
  through glass which is placed in an intense magnetic field, the
  direction of the electrical strain being perpendicular to that of
  the magnetic strain. The displacement currents of Maxwell
  in this case do not appear to affect the time of electrical
  surgings. This conclusion, however, may be modified by
  experiments which we shall try on a more extended scale.

                       By H. E. J. G. du Bois*.
  A CONSIDERABLE extension of our knowledge of mag
          netic induction has lately taken place. This, like many
  other additions to the realm of science, was chiefly called for
  in order to meet the wants of designers of electric machinery ;
  and it has accordingly been arrived at in an essentially prac
  tical way. The aim of this preliminary communication is to
  show how physical science may draw advantage from some of
  these results, and may obtain them by unobjectionable purely

336                  H. E. J. G. du Bois on
physical methods. In doing so I shall not so much use the
conception of lines of force, but shall rather start from the con
sideration of magnetization. For it is the latter quantity,
which for experimental reasons (Phil. Mag. [5] xxix. p. 303,
1890) I believe must be taken as the fundamental one from
the physical standpoint, much more so than induction, to
which such importance has lately been attached.
   The idea of an analogy (even when only in mathematical
treatment) of magnetic systems with other systems of fluxes
(hydrokinetic, thermal, electric) dates back as far as Euler.
Faraday (and following him Maxwell) and Sir W. Thomson
then each developed it in his own way. It has been worked
out and practically applied, however, during the last de-
cennium.
   Bosanquet (1883), Rowland (1884), W. v. Siemens (1884),
Gisbert Kapp (1885), especially consider the analogy with
the flow of electricity, and accordingly apply Ohm's law to
magnetic circuits. As, however, this law essentially implies
the resistance being constant, independent of the current
flowing, the above extension of its most characteristic meaning
can hardly be conceded from the physical point of view ;
nothing is thereby meant to be said against certain practical
advantages gained by introducing an (essentially variable)
magnetic resistance. Quite lately, again, Pisati (1890) has
laid much stress upon the analogy with thermal circuits, and
accordingly has applied Fourier's law to certain magnetic
systems. This appears perhaps less objectionable in so far as
thermal conductivity is not necessarily a constant as its elec
tric analogue is, though Fourier originally introduced the
former as such. But even then it depends upon temperature,
not upon its space-variation or upon the flow of heat : the
analogy is therefore in no case a complete one, magnetic con
ductivity being of course independent of magnetic potential.
   No physical objection, however, appears to exist to the
totally different treatment the question received at the hands
of J. and E. Hopkinson (1886) : they started from two safely
established mathematical propositions, and only made some
auxiliary assumptions in order to simplify the (approximate)
calculations. They so arrived at their graphic construction,
now used to a certain extent in machine design, and which
will be reverted to below.
   Poisson's old theory of magnetic induction, extended by
Neumann and Sir W. Thomson, as laid down e. g. in Maxwell's
treatise, is known to rest on the fundamental assumption of
constant susceptibility ; it therefore applies to all substances
except " ferromagnetics " (iron, cobalt, nickel, magnetite, and
any substance which may yet be found to behave similarly).

                       Magnetic Circuits.                      337
Kirchhoff then introduced a new theory (in 1853) by making
the more general assumption that magnetization is a function
(capable of experimental determination) of the total magnetic
intensity. Besides the important solutions of certain par
ticular cases (ellipsoid, closed ring), he restricted himself to
giving a few integral equations in the place of Poisson's.
However, these were of but little practical use, and are hardly
more so now that Duhem has lately taken up the analytical
problem anew.
   A more geometrical treatment of the new theory showed
the distributions of the vectors concerned to be as follows :—
(«) magnetic intensity : lamellar ; (b) magnetization : complex-
lamellar ; (c) induction : solenoidal ; (rf) also the three vectors
are easily seen to have the same direction at every point. The
proof and further discussion of these propositions cannot be
given here. It may be remarked that homogeneous, isotropic
ferromagnetic substance is assumed, through which no electric
currents are supposed to flow ; neither is hysteresis taken into
account.
   The simple type of a circuit not completely closed is a thin
ring containing a radial air-gap and subjected to a uniform
tangential magnetizing force. This particular case, a solution
of which has to my knowledge never been attempted, is re
ducible to the known case of an ellipsoid of revolution. In
fact it is only necessary that the " self-demagnetizing factor "
be capable of calculation ; i. e. the number into which the
magnetization has to be multiplied in order to obtain the
intensity of the self-demagnetizing effect. Let this numerical
factor be, as usual, denoted by N ; for sufficiently long ovoids
 (prolate ellipsoids of revolution) of axial ratio tn it is found
by the well-known equation
                     N=g(h>g.2m-l).
   Now let the gap of our ring have the angular value a ; i. e.
an arbitrary concentric circle in it being considered, the
 a/360 part of this will lie in air, the (360— a)/360 part in the
 ferromagnetic substance. A consideration of the line-integral
 of the self-demagnetizing intensity, which must vanish along
 any such closed circular line of integration, leads as a first
 approximation to the result that
                 N= ...fr-8 Tapprox. =-035al.

    The proof cannot well be given without a diagram. Both
 particular cases are now comparable in every respect, as the

   Now Lord Bayleigh has given a graphic construction for
Ovoids, which Ewing expresses in the following words :—
From the ordinary curve of magnetization for infinitely long
ovoids, that corresponding to a given finite one may be
obtained by shearing the diagram parallel to the axis of
abscissae through an angle, which is simply determined by N,
therefore also by the giveU ratio of axes. By the above the
curve for closed rings may now, in the same way, be sheared
into a diagram for a ring with a given angular gap.
   The analogy of this process with the Hopkinsoiis's well-
known graphic method is obvious, though at first essential
differences appear to exist ; e. g. the quantities used for co
ordinates are not the same in both cases. However, a com
parison in detail finally leads to the identification of both
constructions, so that in any given particular case the curves
would exactly overlap, supposing the coordinates to be
measured to proper scales. Our problem, a solution of which
was first necessitated and afterwards approximately given by
machine practice, has therefore now been solved to the same
order of approximation by physical methods.
   The degree of this approximation, the allowable limits for
thickness of ring and width of air-gap, the amount of
" leaking " of lines of force, &c, can only be determined by
experiment on as large a scale as possible.

                         By Carl Barus*.
                         [Plates IX., X., XI.]
IT was my original intention to communicate the second
      part of this paper only ; but I found that the data there
given would not be intelligible without a clear account of the
method of the work. Accordingly I supplied the first part
from the ' Proceedings' of the American Academy (June 1890),
where a fuller account of my compressor may be found.

   The literature of the subject, which I submitted at some
length elsewhere*, need not be repeated here.
   The work was suggested by Mr. Clarence King, and it
represents a stage of physical progress of an inquiry in which
we are conjointly interested.
I. The Method of obtaining and of vieasuring High Pressures.
    1. Andrews's screw-compressor has an advantage, inasmuch
as the acting stress is brought to bear within the compass of
the barrel. In other arrangements, such, for instance, in
which a cylindrical plunger is forced home, stress must be
exerted on the bed-plate, or applied in a way tending to
flexure the plunger. The screw-compressor may therefore be
taken as the model of an apparatus of greater strength and
efficiency than was necessary in Andrews'st work. Hannay
and Hogarth J were the first to carry an improvement of the
 screw into execution. They obtained pressures but little short
 of 900 atmospheres, stating that their reasons for stopping
 work at this datum were quite apart from the efficiency of
 their apparatus. With the screw-compressor described below,
 I reach and hold 2000 atmospheres with facility (§§ 17, 23).
 It is so constructed that a large volume of liquid may be
 operated on, admitting of a compression of five cubic inches.
 Special provision has been made for the insulation of parts,
 thus enabling the observer to apply the essential electric
 methods § in studying his test samples.
     Particular notice should here be given of the remarkable
 modification of Desgoffes's differential manometer, by which
 Amagat // has measured over 3000 atmospheres ; but Prof.
 Taiti recently described the "manometre a pistons fibres"
 in connexion with his own researches. The Bourdon gauge
 has just been discussed by Prof. Greenhill** and Mr. Worth-
 ingtonft- The Bourdon gauge used below is of the kind
 described by the former.

    2. The apparatus (Plate IX. fig. 1) consists essentially
of a strong wrought-iron barrel, ABC, the head of which,
A A, is suitably threaded, so that a steel screw, S S T, can be
forced into it. The piezometer tube is attached at the end,
C C, of the barrel. Barrel and tubes are quite filled with oil.
   3. To obviate leakage I make use of two special devices,
the first of which is the tinned screw. This is an ordinary
well-cut machine screw of iron or steel, covered with a uni
form thin adhesive layer of ordinary solder, by dipping it
(after cleansing with soldering-salts) in a vessel of the fused
metal. When forced into their sockets, these screws secure
complete freedom from leakage, even at 2000 atmospheres
and more. Gauges and other appurtenances may thus be
attached to the barrel, and removed from it, with facility.
    The other device is the gasket of marine glue *, or other
highly viscous liquid. A stuffing-box is easily made, by
which this substance is kept pressed against the threads of
the screw, or against the smooth surface of a cylindrical
plunger. The cement admits of being shaped by pressure
 to fill up any cavity, but it is far too viscous to flow through
 capillary interstices. In a preceding paper f 1 found its
 viscosity to be 20 billion times the viscosity of water.
 Pressure, moreover, tends to close up all fissures between
 nut and screw, thus making the apparatus more efficient at
 high pressures than at low pressures, even if the cement
 should not itself increase in viscosity.
    4. To rotate the screw 8 S T (figs. 1 and 3) it is provided
 with a lever (three feet long) and ratchet, LDK. The steel
 ratchet-wheel, R R, forged to the shaft T of the screw, is
 square-cut to correspond with the right-and-left click D. A
pin, E, sliding in a socket of the lever, L, and actuated by a
 spring (fig. 1), enables the operator to adjust the ratchet
 either for forward or retrograde motion of the screw S T.
    The screw S S is one inch in diameter with twelve threads
to the inch.
    5. The barrel, B B, is secured between guides, on the
 planed front of the bed-plates, F F, by two bolts (figs. 1 and 4).
 The rear of the bed-plate is hollowed to catch drippings.
    The gland, K K, of the stuffing-box is of steel, and is pro
 vided with a large flange for screwing it forcibly in place.
   * Supplied, among others, by Ducretet of Paris, and bv the Socie'te'
Genevoise. Perhaps pitch, or even molasses candy, would be similarly
serviceable.

If a thread be cut both in the end of the barrel and in K K,
these parts tend to act as lock nuts on each other at high
pressures. To obviate this annoyance, I devised the method
shown in fig. 2. Here the thread a a is movable, being on
the inside of a ring, rr, of steel, which fits snugly in a
socket of the barrel. Rotation of rr is prevented by the
projection s, corresponding to a slot in the barrel. In this
way a tight stuffing-box is obtained. The same number of
threads are cut both on the outside (c c) and the inside (b b)
cylindrical surface of K K. Thus it can be rotated without
moving the screw, S S T. The gasket of marine glue is
shown at m m.
    7. The barrel is perforated by four or more holes, suitably
threaded to admit the tinned machine-screws (diameter §
inch with 16 threads to the inch), at the end of the gauges or
other appurtenances.
    8. The piezometer tubes, U U U, of cold-drawn, weldless
steel tubing* are inserted in such a way as to insulate them
 electrically from the barrel-end C C. A screw is cut on the
 end of U U U, fitting into an iron flange, W W, between two
 cylindrical jackets, X X and Y Y, of hard rubber or ivory.
 X and Y fit the hole in the barrel and the aperture of the gland
 Z Z very snugly. All other space within C C is filled with
 marine glue, by compressing the thick gasket d d. To obviate
 electric contact X X is flanged and W is of smaller diameter
 than the hole in the end C C of the barrel.
    9. The outer end of U U U is closed by a tinned screw V
 (fig. 5). The substance to be examined is here introduced,
 usually in glass tubes (see next section, § 24) . As a rule these
 tubes are adjusted within the compass of the copper vapour-bath
// (fig- )> whi°h surrounds U U excentrically. This bath is
 a long cylinder of brazed sheet copper, containing the liquid
 yy to be boiled. Vapours escaping are condensed in a lateral
 tube (not shown) and run back, thus making the ebullition
 continuous. A number of these baths are at hand. In order
 to pass from one temperature to another, it is merely necessary
 to slip off one vapour-bath and slide on another. The copper
 vessels are thickly jacketed with asbestos, and the tubulures
 h h are either closed by perforated corks, or at high tempera
 tures (200°-300°) by stuffing-boxes (not shown) appressing
 the corks. The tubulure g receives the insulated platinum/

flows must surround U U, between the barrel and the vapour-
bath, and between this and the end-screw V. It is essential
that vapour be directly in contact with the piezometer. For
fine temperature-work (§ 30, next section) and below 200°, I
use the drum ff merely for the reception of vapour, leading it
in at one end of the bottom, and suitably withdrawing it at
the other, Low temperatures are obtained by a jacket of
circulating water.
     1 0. In figure 4, O P Q indicates the method of filling the
barrel with oil. It is quite as convenient, however, to simply
pour it in, after removing one of the screws M, fig. 1 .
     11. A case of two-inch plank closely surrounding the
machine is easily devised. A barricade should be placed
beyond the end V of the piezometer tube.
    12. A vertical piezometer similar to C C U U, but smaller
in dimensions, and ending below in a finely perforated steel
screw, may be attached at M (§ 23).

    13. Pressures are measured in terms of the volume increase
of a long, cold-drawn steel tube, closed at one end, while the
other end communicates with the interior of the barrel B B,
fig. 4. It may be called a Tait gauge, since the elastics of
this case -were specifically investigated by Prof. Tait*. This
gauge is inserted at N, and is shown at qq, It, ss. To
measure the expansion of the steel tube q q, it is surrounded
by a close-fitting glass tube tttt, one end of which is joined
to q q by an internal laj'er of marine glue, v v, surmounted by
a tight cap of fusible metal. This joint is rigid as well as
reliably hermetic. The other end, of 1 1, communicates with
the capillary tube ss, by which the volume increase is
measured. In fig. 4 ss is shown vertically ; but it is ex
pedient to bend it horizontally, parallel and close to the water-
jacket ww, to which ss is rigidly fastened directly over a
glass millimetre-scale. Pressure on the outside of 1 1 appre
ciably displaces the meniscus in s s, an error to be guarded
against.
     The shell-like space between steel tube q q and glass tube
 1 1 is quite filled with a liquid of small coefficient of expansion.
 Neither mercury nor alcohol were found satisfactory. I
therefore used pure water, coloured with a little fuchsine.
 This is introduced through « s, by repeatedly evacuating 1 1
 and boiling out all traces of air.
     I obtained the requisite constancy of temperature by sur-

rounding 1 1 with a jacket uu of circulating cold water,
coming directly from the hydrant. The meniscus in ss may
be raised or lowered, and coloured when faded, by inserting
filamentary glass suction-tubes into the capillary (§ 14).
Water free from air scarcely attacks steel.
   14. To graduate this gauge, I compared it with a Large
Bourdon gauge* reading from 0 to 1000 atmospheres (§ 1).
This comparison is a check on both instruments, though it
affords no means of testing the standard atmosphere employed.
Since both gauges are based on Hooke's law and provided
with suitable scales of equal parts, relations are well indicated.

    344                       Mr. Carl Barus on the
        15. The table contains five series of observations made at
    the times (minutes) stated. Not more than two or three
    minutes were allowed per observation. Comparing data on
    the same or corresponding horizontal rows, the maximum
    difference is -40 centim., or 24 atmospheres. Comparing the
    two zero readings of the last column (work intentionally
    hastened), the difference of reading is -56 centim., or 33
    atmospheres. This is the maximum index of error in case of
    unreasonably hasty work (§ 18).
        16. A second point of view is obtained by comparing the
     data of the pressure " on " and the pressure " off" phases of
     the above experiments. This is done in the chart, fig. 6
     (PI. X.) No. 0. The accordance in the " on " phase is satisfac
     tory, since the errors are not above 10 atmospheres, and the
     loci very nearly straight. The " off" data do not return in
     the lines of the " on ' data. Indeed the two curves, " on "
     and " off," enclose a band the maximum width of which is
     1-5 centim. or 90 atmospheres.
        17. To interpret this curious phenomenon I compared the
     gauges after several months' use. At least five minutes
     were allowed per observation. Two complete series are given
     in Table II. This table also gives some data on the con
     stancy of the zero after very high presssure. Slight shifting
     equivalent to 5 or 10 atmospheres is observable after 2000
     atmospheres.

        The character of Tables I. and II. is identical. Hence to
     account for the apparent hysteresis it is necessary to construct
     other Tait gauges. This I did with much care.

Both capillaries were calibrated. Of the many series of ob
servations made, two for No. 1 are given in Table III., and

346                   Mr. Carl Barus on the
a long range comparison between No. 1 and No. 4 is given in
Table IV. Five minutes were allowed per observation. In
the second part of Table IV. both gauges are standardized
by a comparison with a small, very sensitive Bourdon Gauge,
found identical with the large Bourdon Gauge, used above.
Fi and F4 are the factors found. In other series similar to
Table III., the agreement of observations occupying like
positions in like series is always very close, the mean difference
being 1-2 atmospheres. Nevertheless the data of Table III. still
show decided hysteresis. See fig. 6, No. 1 (PI. X.). The maxi
mum distance apart of the "on" and "off" series is about
40 atmospheres. Indeed I was even able to grade the cycles.
   19. It is expedient to examine the chief sources of error
involved. The cycles cannot be attributed to an imperfect
Bourdon mechanism ; for in adjusting the pressure at any
given value just before observing, the actual pressures must as
frequently be incremented as decremented, both in the " on "
and the " off" series. Thus the aggregate error must be nil.
Liquid adhering to the walls of the capillary tube s s, would
show its largest discrepancy at zero atmospheres, following
high pressure. Similarly, slight changes of temperature of the
water in u u might displace the fiducial zero, but they would
produce no persistent cyclic effects.
   I think the clue for the interpretation of the apparent
hysteresis is given by the form of the cycles, which is that of
an archer's bow with the cord uppermost. Bearing in mind
that the liquid in tt is heated by compression during the
" on " series, and that even though gradually parting with
its heat increment, it is, nevertheless, continually hotter than
the surrounding medium ; bearing in mind, moreover, that in
the " off " series the water in 1 1 is cooled by expansion, but
that the water is hotter than the surrounding medium only
during the high-pressure stages, and colder than this medium
during the low-pressure stages (heat having been continually
dissipated)—an explanation of the bow-shaped cycles is sug
gested. Tait gauges considered as thermometers are relatively
very sensitive instruments ; even my best gauges show dis
placements of 1 or 2 centim. per degree. Regarding the small
cycle (17 atmospheres) of Table IV., it will be remembered
that the error here occurs differentially.
   A bow-shaped cycle may also be conceived to result as a
viscous phenomenon, if strain (set) were gradually impressed
on the gauges during the " on " series, which strain asserts
itself during the "off" series. (Cf.§ 34.) I must reserve
my opinion until further experiments have been made, in
which Amagat's " manometre " (Z. c.) is employed.

    It follows, in general, that to obtain trustworthy data
pressure observations must be recorded during the pressure-
increasing phase of work only. In most cases (see next
section) this condition is easily fulfilled, since the pressures
sought are reached from zero.
    20. From the dimensions a0, au L, p, (Table I.), the in
crease of the external volume of the steel gauge-tube is 47/106
per unit of external volume, per centimetre of displacement of
the thread in the capillary tube ss (fig. 4). This corresponds
to a volume increment
                            „/V = -0000008                       (1)
per unit of external volume, per atmosphere.
    Tait's formula (I. c.) modified to suit the present case is
t//V = na02(l//t+l/nV(a12-a2o), where II is the internal
pressure, and 1/k and n the compressibility and rigidity, re
spectively, of the steel employed. Taking k and ?i from
Everett's* tables, viz., £ = 1'84 x 10" and n=8'2x 1011, and
putting II = 106 dynes,
                          v'fV= -0000007                         (2)
This result is of the same order as (1), § 19.
    Similar results could be obtained for Tables II. and III.
I think this method can be made sharp enough for the ex
perimental measurement of ljk-{ 1/n.
    21. In addition to the work done with Tait gauges, I spent
some time in constructing a direct-reading, helical Bourdon.
 The results are not of interest here.
    22. Instead of having a screw enter the barrel, similar re
 sults must be obtainable by forcing a cylindrical shaft into
the barrel. The device shown within C C, fig. 1, proves that
 the gasket of marine glue is quite as serviceable for smooth
cylinders as for screws.
     The labour necessary in producing the above pressures
decreases nearly as the fourth power of the diameter of the
screw, owt. par. Similar advantages are gained by increasing
the number of threads to the inch. Hence, supposing the
initial pressures produced by a thick screw (diameter 1 inch
 say) at one end of the barrel, and the final pressures (above

 much less compressible) produced by a thinner screw (diame
 ter £ inch say) at the other end of the barrel, the efficiency
 of the screw-compressor would be increased. In such a case
 the piezometer tube must be vertical, § 12. My purpose,

however, in limiting these experiments to 2000 atmospheres
was to avoid straining the gauges, § 17. I add in con
cluding, that among the special facilities of the above screw-
compressor is the micrometric accuracy with which pressure
can be raised to and maintained at a given value, for any
reasonable length of time.

                     amine, and Para-toluidine.
    23. By aid of the machine, described in the foregoing
section, I made the following investigation of the isometrics
of liquids. The nature of the problem is clearly defined by
the results of an earlier paper t, where it appears conformably
with the inferences of Dupre\ Levy, Ramsay and Young,
and Fitzgerald, that liquid isometrics are lines of small
curvature.
                              Apparatus.
    24. The apparatus to be constructed is such that the
criterion for constant volume is given by a reliable electric
contact. Figs. 7 and 8 show the tube of constant volume.
 Itconsists of three parts:—the reservoir ef (diameter -3 centim.
to -4 centim.), and the two capillary stems ed and da (diame
ter about -08 centim.), separated by the enlarged portion d,
into which a platinum terminal c penetrates. Other dimen
sions are given in fig. 7. Fig. 8 (diagram) shows the tube
ready for use. The end g has been sealed, holding the
platinum wire (the other terminal) mhn, which passes
through / e into the capillary. The substance to be tested
quite fills ef and about one half the adjoining stem. The
remainder of the tube is filled with mercury / k.
    The tube thus adjusted is inserted into the piezometer U U,
 fig. 5, and the terminal c put in metallic connexion with the
 walls of the steel tube near V. The terminal m o is suitably
 insulated by surrounding it with a glass tube, and after
 passing quite through the piezometer into the barrel, fig. 1,
is there put in metallic connexion with one of the screws M.
 The constant-volume tube ag, fig. 8, is thus held in horizontal
 position within the steel piezometer, by aid of its two tense
 terminals.
    • The word "isometric " is used by J. Willard Gibbs in his beautiful
 researches on graphic methods in the thermodynamics of fluids (Trans.
Connecticut Acad. II. [2] p. 311, 1873 ; cf. ibid, p. 382). It has the
advantage of priority if not of expressiveness, and I do not feel the need
 of withdrawing " isometric " in favour of " isochore," as is done by
 Ramsay and Young (Phil. Mag. [5] xxiii. p. 435, 1887).

                   Isometrics of Liquid Matter.                 349
   25. The method of experiment is easily inferred. The
glass tube being in place and quite surrounded with oil,
piezometer and barrel are put in a simple circuit containing
a battery and a galvanoscope. The electric contact, made or
broken by forcing the screw S S T in or out, is sharp arid
thoroughly reliable, even at 2000 atmospheres and 200°.
   26. In passing from one constant temperature to another,
there is danger either of forcing the mercury thread, / k, out
of the tube ag, or into the reservoir ef. Hence when the
temperature of uu is increasing, the pressure is to be in
creased in such a way as to keop the electric contact just
made ; and when temperature decreases the pressure is to be
relieved in such a way as to keep the electric contact just broken.
In these adjustments the screw and ratchet is very serviceable.
   27. When a series of isometrics is to be mapped out, the
volume of liquid between meniscus k and the free end n is
suitably changed. This volume may be conceived to be
either positive or negative.
   28. The operation of filling the glass tube ag calls for
some skill ; but a description is beyond the scope of the
present paper. I make extensive use of filamentary glass
funnel-tubes, and of filamentary glass connexion-tubes com
municating with the mercury air-pump.
   Solid substances, like diphenylamine, must be kept fused
after filling in a hot-water-bath, and the tubes ag are to be
introduced into a hot piezometer.
    29. The greatest care must be teken to have all parts of
 the tube clean, and to avoid rubber connexions or other
 material impregnated with sulphur. When the mercury
 appears dead, the tube is worthless.
    30. Seeing that the piezometer tube is a good conductor,
constancy of temperature cannot be guaranteed nor its value
 measured, unless the vapours of the bath be directly in con
tact with the tube, § 7. Methyl alcohol, (>ti° water, 100°,
amyl alcohol, 130°, turpentine, l60°, naphthaline, 215°, ben
 zoic acid, 250°, diphenylamine, 310°, phenanthren, 340°, are
 available for boiling. They form a convenient series. A low
 (fiducial) temperature is given by ice, or by circulating
 water. It is essential that the vapour-baths slide on and off
 the piezometer easily. Jarring may break the thread of the
 constant-volume tube within.
    31. Tomeasurethe temperatures I used a platinum/platinum-
 iridium thermocouple, with its junction in contact with the
 piezometer tube, near the centre of the vapour-bath. Thermo
 electric force was expressed in terms of the twist of the
 platinum fibre which suspended the given astatic system of

  the torsion-galvanometer*. To calibrate this instrument the
  boiling-points of water and of mercury were first used.
  Finally, I made extensive comparisons with the glass re
  entrant air-thermometer (§§ 35, 36).
     32. Pressure was measured as shown in Section I., and
  the factor of the Tait Gauge frequently checked by aid of a
  small sensitive 300-atmosphere Bourdon Gauge. About 20
I or 30 minutes were allowed to secure isothermal conditions,
  both for the gauge and the piezometer tube. Leaks must be
  avoided ; otherwise the operator is apt to pump heat into the
  liquids. Particular care was taken to redetermine the initial
  pressure and temperature (17° and 68°, respectively) before
  and after each high-temperature observation. This is a
  certain and an essential check on the validity of the results.
  At any high temperature at least four readings were made,
  about five minutes apart. The last two of these, if coincident,
  were taken.

   the many series of results obtained, for ether and the other
   substances. Each series contains at least one observation at
   the boiling-point of water, the importance of which will

    The change of p during the course of a series is notice
able, and it is due to the fact that the gauge, which had on a
former occasion been compelled to do violent work, has not
yet quite viscously recovered from the strain. The series
XV*. is better than series XIV. in this respect, and the im
provement continues in all the other data, § 37. Of the two
values of fiducial p which comprehend any high pressure p,
 the second is very probably correct and will be used below.
    35. An inspection of all my data shows that the tempera
 ture datum needs correction. The cause of discrepancy is
 the temperature-coefficient and perhaps also the time-coefficient
 of the magnetic system of the torsion-galvanometer. This
 correction is easily applied, since whatever magnetic state ob
 tains affects the twists corresponding to all temperatures of a
 given series, uniformly. If N ' be the twist for 100° on any

352                     Mr. Carl Barus on the
day of observation, and if N» be the corresponding twist on
the day of final calibration, both observed at the same torsion-
galvanometer, then Ne/N9' is the reduction factor.
    To test this inference I adduce two independent calibra
tions, over a month apart. If N, = a(T-0 +b(T1-P), and
< = 20°, the data are expressed in Table VI.

The change of No/No' is less than -3 per cent, for the whole
interval i)0o to 400°, a satisfactory result. Small reciprocal
changes of a and would wipe out this discrepancy without
appreciably slighting the observations.
    36. A more serious question, relative to the degree of truth
of the interpolation equation N»=a(T- t) +b(T2-t2) remains
for solution. This can only be decided by direct air-ther
mometer comparisons. I used a re-entrant air-thermometer
bulb I, and determined constancy of volume by aid of an
electric contact. The bulb was heated in a closed cylindrical
Earaffin bath, 7 inches in diameter and about 7 inches long,
  eavily jacketed ( 1 inch thick) with asbestos. The disposition
met was such as placed the thermoelectric junction at the
centre of the bulb, which in its turn was at the centre of the
bath. Observations were made in time series during the
period of cooling down from 300°. I give an example of
one of the three series of comparisons made in Table VII.,
where Ta,( is the temperature measured by the air-therinome-
ter, Ne the corresponding twist at the torsion-galvanometer.
T(i<, is the temperature computed from N9, by aid of Table VI.
Again, V is the zero volume of the air-thermometer bulb, iJ
and r" the volumes of the hot and cold parts of the stem and
capillaries, and is the tension of the gas at zero Centigrade.

    Series of this kind show at once that throughout every stage
of cooling the temperature registered by the thermocouple is
persistently higher than the corresponding temperature of the
air-thermometer. Inasmuch as the system cools from the
outside of the thermometer-bulb, this may be regarded as a
mere indication of too rapid cooling. I must note, however,
that by retarding or accelerating cooling, I did not materially
change this discrepancy. Hence, without passing further
judgment, I deduced both T^t and Tt/f, for all the observations
below.
    37. After correcting the temperature in the manner stated,
I obtained the data for the five isometrics given in Table VIII.
Temperatures 6a,t and 6t,e are measured by the air-thermo
meter and the thermocouple respectively. Two data under A8
are to be similarly interpreted. Ap is defined above, § 33.
Slight irregularities of 8 still appear, showing that if tempera
ture is to be measured by the torsion-galvanometer, check
readings of the boiling-point of water must be made before
and after each series of temperature observations. Two
independent series are usuall}' given for each substance.

356                      Mr. Carl Barus on the
   38. Corrections are now to be applied for the thermal and
elastic volume-changes of glass. Direct measurements of the
elastic constants of my glass tubes, throughout an interval of
300° and 2000 atmospheres, are at present out of the question.
Hence I selected liquids of large compressibility. Fortu
nately the correction is differential, and it will vanish in
proportion as the isometrics of glass approach those of the
above liquids (§ 43).
    For the expansion of glass throughout long intervals (0° to
300°), results of Dulong and Petit* and of Recknagelt are
available. The coefficients of the former are the smaller. I
will therefore accept them, seeing that inasmuch as the
thermal variations of the compressibility of glass are not
known, the smaller coefficients of expansion (0) are prefer
able. Dulong and Petit found :—
                       0° to 100°,   £=26/106,
                       0° to 200°,   /S = 28/106,
                       0° to 300°,   /3 = 30/106.
From these the volume of the constant-volume tube in terms
of its capacity at 20° and 70°, respectively, are to be com
puted.
    39. The compressibility of glass taken from Everett's tables
(/. c.) agrees fairly well with the values due to Regnault, and
more recently to AmagatJ ; but apart from the fact that com
pressibility increases in marked degree with temperature, little
further can be conjectured. Hence, for want of data, the
volume of the glass tube under any hydrostatic pressure »
(atm.) must be taken as l-pxlQ6//c, where A=4xl0 ,
irrespective of temperature.
    The present and preceding paragraphs suffice for the com
putation of a table of double entry (the arguments being p
and 6), from which the volume-changes Bv of the glass con
stant-volume tubes, corresponding to any of the pairs of
values of Ap and Ad in Table VIII., may be at once desig
nated. A list of the values Bv is given in Table IX., corre
sponding in arrangement with Table VIII. The curious
feature of these data is that Bv, as here computed, is some
times positive and sometimes negative.
    40. Having given these data, it is finally necessary to
find what correction Bp is to be added to Ap in order to com-

     pensate for Sv, or, as it were, to annul it. The compressi
     bilities of the liquids must therefore be known under the given
     conditions of actual pressure p and temperature. The results
    of my earlier paper* are available for this purpose, except in
    the case of ether at high temperature, where the compressi
    bility is estimated. Table IX. enumerates the divers com
    pressibilities (d^/dp) as well as the values of Sp corresponding
    to each Sv.
         41. Utilizing these values I constructed the final Table X.,
    in which the values of Ap and A0 are such as would be
     observed if the constant-volume tube were quite rigid. For
     A0 I give the thermoelectric values only (§ 36), believing
     these to be more nearly correct. The Table also contains p0
     and 80, which are the initial or fiducial pressures used in con
     structing Ap and A8. For diphenylamine and toluidine p0
     and 80 are estimated.

    42. It conduces to clearness to express graphically both the
 data of Table VIII. and of Table X., as has been done in
 PI. XI. figs. 9 and 10 respectively. In the latter the points are
 connected by straight lines, to emphasize the changes of cur
 vature. Turning first to fig. 9, it is seen that below 1000
 atmospheres the curves are so nearly linear that they may be
 accepted as such with an error no larger than 2° or 3° at
 1000 atmospheres. An inspection of the individual points
 shows this to be within the limits of error. Regarding
 diphenylamine and toluidine, it is well to remember that the
 initial temperature is nearly 70°.
    Above 1000° all the isometrics show definite curvature, in
 a way which often appears somewhat abrupt. This is parti
 cularly the case with diphenylamine and with toluidine, and
 to a smaller degree with ether. As a rule the curves are
 concave downwards, showing that the pressure-increments do
 not keep pace with the temperature-increments. The reverse,
 however, is to some extent true for alcohol, while the isome
 trics of thymol are practically straight within 1500 atmo
 spheres. It is well to note that thymol has been undercooled

      It is seen from this Table as well as Table IX., that the
   correction for non-rigidity of the constant-volume tube does
  not exceed 2 per cent. In most cases, and for pressures 'not
  too high, it may be disregarded.
      The slopes thus obtained (Table XI.) have no absolute
   value, since the data must vary with the initial volume under
   consideration. Volume-measurements are beyond the scope
   of the present paper. I may state, however, that a study of
   the thermodynamic surfaces of liquids, by the aid of consecu
   tive isometrics, promises to be experimentally the most precise
   (§ 27).
      Ii the change of curvature (figs. 9 and 10) above 1000
   atmospheres were due to an unwarranted application of
   Hooke's law in case of the gauge, the curvatures of all the
   isometrics would change in somewhat similar ways at the
   same pressure. This is not observed in the figures, where
   each isometric is found to have an individual character. Tests
   made with thymol at the close of the above work reproduced
   the straight isometric very beautifully, showing that the
   curves for diphenylamine and toluidine are not influenced by
   marked gauge-errors (see Table VIII., end).
      43. A singularly curious inference is suggested on com
   paring the approximate isometrics of solid glass computed in
   §§ 38, 39, with the liquid isometrics of Tables X. and XI.
   For glass the initial slope of the isometric is about -1° per
   atmosphere, a datum which comes very near (in order) to the
   slopes of the liquid isometrics, varying as they do between
   -07° per atm. and '12° per atm. This proximity of the solid

360               The Isometrics of Liquid Matter.
and the liquid isometric of compound matter is exceedingly
striking. Solid metallic isometrics are quite different from
the above (Table XI.). If \/k be the compressibility and yS
the coefficient of thermal expansion, the quantity 106/£/8 is an
estimate of the initial slope of the isometric, in degrees per
atmosphere. Taking k and /S from Everett's tables (£. c),
the slopes for steel, iron, and copper respectively are only
-014°, -016°, and -Oil0 per atmosphere. They thus preserve
an order of magnitude smaller than that of glass, or the above
organic liquids.
   44. For the time being the above results admit of the fol
lowing interpretation :—Whenever a substance passes from
the liquid to the gaseous state, no matter whether this takes
place continuously above the critical temperature, or discon-
tinuously below it, the underlying cause is a change of mole
cule from a more complex to a less complex type. As long
as the molecule remains unchanged the isometrics are straight.
When the change of molecule takes place so as to begin with
the liquid molecule and pass continuously into the gaseous
molecule, the isometrics curve continuously for the linear
isometric of the true liquid to that of the true gas. Such an
explanation is of course tentative. It rests on evidence purely
experimental and therefore of uncertain interpretation ; and
it is suggested by a controversy which I have summed up
elsewhere * as follows :—" The linear relation was predicted
from theoretical considerations by Dupre (1869) and by LeVy
(1884) —considerations soon proved to be inadequate by
Massieu, H. F. Weber, Boltzmann, and Clausius. Ramsay
and Young (1887) established! the relation in question expe
 rimentally for vapours, but not, 1 think, very fully for liquids
decidedly below their critical points. Reasoning from these
data, Fitzgerald (1887) investigated the consequences of the
law; viz.:—(1) specific heat under constant volume is a
temperature-function only ; (2) internal energy and entropy
can be expressed as a sum of two terms, one of which is a
volume-function only and the other a temperature-function
only. Thus Ramsay, Young, and Fitzgerald arrive substan
tially at the same position from which Dupre' and Levy
originally started."
    However, too much care cannot be taken in keeping clearly
in mind that pressures which, in relation to the usual labora
tory facilities, are exceptionally large, may yet be mere

      THE MAGNETO-OPTICAL GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY.
                     BY SAMUEL SIIELDON, PH.D.
-YJSTHILE experimenting upon the effects of alternating currents
  ' * of electricity upon the plane of polarized light, results were
obtained which made it feasible to try a series of experiments, in
which the Faraday arrangements were reversed. Although the
series is incomplete, yet the little that has been accomplished
seems worthy of publication.
    It is well known * that if a beam of plane-polarized light be
passed through a tube containing bisulphide of carbon, and if the
tube and beam lie in the direction of the lines of force of an
electromagnet about to be excited, the plane of the emergent beam
will be rotated upon exciting the magnet. The direction of
rotation will be the same as that of the exciting current, and the
amount of rotation will depend upon the strength of the current.
If the current be reversed, the plane will be rotated in an opposite
direction and by exactly the same amount. Thus the rapidly
alternating current would produce a rapid swinging to and fro of
the plane of light.
    Now if a difference of potential, under these conditions, pro
duces such a rotation of the plane, why should not a rapid rotation
of the plane under exactly the same conditions produce an inverse
difference of potential between the terminals of the coil ? A con
tinuous rotation should produce a continuous current of electricity,
and an oscillating of the plane an alternating current. The ex
periments which have been per»ormed verify the latter supposition.
    The coil employed was wound upon a thin brass tube as a core.
This was closed at each end by plates of glass, and was provided
with holes for filling with carbon bisulphide. Its length was
175 millim. and its diameter 23 millim. Upon this was wound
the coil from double silk-covered copper wire of 0-85 millim. dia
meter. When wound, the length of the coil was 150 millim.
and its diameter 45 millim. The resistance was 7-21 ohms.
    A quantitative measurement of the Faraday effect was first
made and in the following manner :—A beam of light from an
incandescent lamp, after passing through a large nicol, was made
to traverse the bisulphide of carbon in the coil. Upon emerging,
                 • Faraday, Exp. Bes, 2146, vol. iii. p. 1.

362            Intelligence and. Miscellaneous Articles.
 the beam was brought to extinction by the proper adjustment of an
 analysing nicol. A measured current of electricity was now passed
 around the coil. This necessitated a readjustment and rotation of
 the analysing nicol to reproduce extinction of the beam. -Within
 the limits tried, this rotation was proportional to the current
 strength. As a mean of many measurements, it was found that
 a current of 1 ampere required a rotation of 78 minutes of the
 analyser. Accordingly 278 amperes would be required to rotate
 the plane through 360°, providing the proportionality between
 current strength and rotation remained unaltered.
    Now, if we consider a plane-polarized ray of light to be made
 up of two opposite circularly-polarized rays, then a particle of
 aether in the bisulphide of carbon describes a simple harmonic
 oscillation in a plane. This motion in a straight line is the re
 sultant of the two oppositely directed, equiperiodic, circular
 rotations of equal amplitude. If now a magnetic field be created, the
 particle undergoes an instantaneous circular electric displacement
 which results in the retardation of one and the acceleration of the
 other component rotation. The line of oscillation suffers rotation
 as a result, and assumes a new position. The displacement must
 be instantaneous, for, were it continuous, the line of oscillation
would continue to rotate and the analyser could not be made to
produce extinction. If, now, instead of allowing the magnetic
 field to produce this circular displacement, we superimpose, by-
mechanical means, a third rotation upon the two existing com
ponents, then a magnetic field should result and an electromotive
force be induced in a coil surrounding that field. Such a result
would be obtained by rotating the polarizing nicol. The rapidity
of rotation must be very great, and, if it requires 278 amperes (an
impressed electromotive force of 2000 volts) to rotate the plane
 through 360°, then to produce this electromotive force the polarizer
 must be revolved with a frequency of the same order as of the
oscillations of light. But a nicol cannot be revolved much above
200 times per second. The centrifugal force resulting from a
 higher rate will, owing to the strain produced, interfere with the
 performance of its functions as a polarizer. This rate of 200
revolutions per second would produce, in the apparatus employed,
 an electromotive force of perhaps 0-000000001 volt, giving a
 current too small tb be detected by any galvanometer in my
 laboratory. Hence use was made of the extreme delicacy of the
 telephone as a substitute, and a swinging of the plane instead of a
revolution.
     The arrangement of apparatus was as follows :—Light from an
  arc lamp, after passing through a large nicol, was reflected, at a
 very obtuse angle, from a small movable mirror and then passed
 through the bisulphide of carbon in the coil before-mentioned.
 The two terminals of the coil were carried to a room three storit s
  below and in another part of the building. Here they were con

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           363
nected through a telephone and a switch. The mirror (10 x 30
millim.) was fixed in a brass frame free to rotate about an axis
nearly parallel with the ray of light. This frame was connected by
an eccentric and gears to the main shaft in the workshop. By this
arrangement the mirror was made to oscillate through 45° about
300 times each second. The plane of polarization was thus twisted
through twice that amount, or 90°, in the same time. While this
oscillation was going on in the workshop, an ear placed at the
telephone at the other end of the circuit could easily distinguish
a tone, which, however, was the octave above that made by the
moving mirror. When the circuit was broken the sound ceased to
be heard, but upon again closing the tone became audible. With
a rate of 200 oscillations per second the note was not so easily
distinguished. But upon closing the circuit that peculiar sizzling
noise so common in telephone-circuits was heard.
   During the experiments the mirror was frequently broken by
the high rate of vibration. But another was quickly substituted
by my assistant, Mr. Baker, whom I have to thank for this and
the construction and management of the rotating apparatus.—

       ON THE OBSERVATION OF ELECTKODYNAMIC WAVES.
                         BY EMIL WIECHERT.
   If the occurrence of electrodynamic waves of short period is
observed in the manner originally indicated by Hertz, considerable
difficulties arise from the very feeble light of the scintilla;. This
difficulty is greatly diminished if the scintillas are observed through
a microscope, which sends to the eye a very large cone of light
proceeding from the scintilla.
   I made up such a microscope from a system of lenses which
belongs to a polarizing microscope, and is used in this for obser
vation with strongly convergent light, and the object-glass of a
telescope. The linear magnification is about fiftyfold. The mi
croscope gives diffused indistinct pictures, but fulfils its purpose
so well that, in observing with it, the place of observation need not
be darkened ; in bright daylight scintilla; stand out clearly which
the naked eye can only see with difficulty in darkness.
   Another method is not only more sensitive, but enables a large
number of persons simultaneously to observe the scintilla; ; and
can also be used with ordinary light.
   Imagine a secondary conductor formed just as if the object
were to observe the occurrence of scintilla;. Suppose that at first
the secondary waves do not act. Let both halves of the secondary
conductor be insulated from each other, and one put to earth while

364           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the other is connected with a source of electricity which supplies
electricity slowly. When the potential has reached a certain limit
a scintilla passes between the two halves of the conductor; the
potential then falls rapidly, then increases again until a fresh
scintilla again diminishes it, and so on. If electrodynamic waves
produce electrical vibrations in the secondary conductor, the sparks
will obviously occur with a smaller accumulation of electricity than
otherwise; this is the fundamental idea of the new method of
observation.
    In practically carrying out the observation I connect the half of
the secondary conductor which is to be electrified with an ordinary
electroscope, which contains two aluminium leaves which hang
near each other. Each spark is then manifested by a sudden col
lapse of the aluminium leaves : attention is to be directed to this
Shenomenon. If electrodynamic waves act, the greatest angular
  eflexion of the aluminium leaves diminishes.
    If the action of the electrodynamic waves is so violent that, even
without artificial electrification of the secondary conductor, scintillas
occur in its spark-gap, the aluminium leaves remain almost without
change.
    I used at first a water-electrification machine as source of elec
 tricity ; I now use a Wimshurst machine. A thread of proper
 length connects one electrode with the half of the secondary con
 ductor w hich is to be electrified ; in order to avoid too high tensions
 both electrodes are provided with points. If the machine is kept
 at work for a few seconds and is then left to itself, the store of
 electricity remaining in the Leyden jars is sufficient to keep up
the play of the phenomenon.
    The author points out the similarity of his method of observa
 tion to that of Boltzmann (Phil. Mag. [5] xxx. p. 126), which he
 had only seen after his paper was sent off. He dwells on the very
 distinct way in which his method illustrates the phenomena.—

            By H. E. J. G. i>u Bois and H. Rubens*.

 § I. JNTRODUCTORY.—K method has heen worked out
             by Prof. Kundt, by means of which the laws of
 propagation of light may be studied in exceedingly thin me
 tallic prisms. By this method he has succeeded in obtaining,
 for a number of metals, the refractive index for light normally
 transmitted, the approximate value of the dispersion, and the
effect of temperature on the former. As his papers t are
everywhere easy of access, we shall often refer to them below
in order to avoid needless repetition.
    § 2. Working on the same lines we have now made observa
tions with light obliquely transmitted, in order in the first
place to obtain an empirical rule of refraction. We then
attempted to determine the dispersion as accurately as pos
sible by using four colours defined by spectral lines. The
three metals experimentally examined were iron, cobalt, and
nickel ; these were chosen for the following reasons : —

   In the first place Dr. Lobach* and one of usf published
data for the dispersion of Kundt's and Kerr's magneto-optic
phenomenon respectively in these three substances ; those
numbers refer to the same colours we have now used again.
We so hope to contribute towards the experimental deter
mination of strictly comparable optical constants.
   Secondly, it is comparatively easy to obtain these metals
electrolytically in wedge-shaped films. We may therefore
safely assume that our metal prisms left little to be desired.
   Lastly, the considerable amount of their refraction con
tributes towards the accuracy of measurement. In addition
we shall occasionally have to discuss the behaviour of certain
metals with much smaller refractive indices ; however, we
have not made any experiments on these (see § 16).
   § 3. The experiments were carried out almost in the same
manner and with the same spectrometer as those made by
Prof. Kundt in Berlin (B. pp, 1389-91). We did not use the
heating arrangement there described ; certain other special
appliances were, however, devised, to be described in due time.
Readings had previously either been taken off the spectro
meter's divided circle or with a micrometer-eyepiece. Neither
of these plans was adhered to in the present case ; the adjust
ments being made instead by turning the micrometer-screw
of the spectrometer's telescope (magnifying 10-fold). This
having been done by one of the observers, the reading on the
divided head of the micrometer-screw was taken by the other,
observing through an auxiliary telescope placed at a distance.
 One division on the divided head corresponded to a rotation
of 4''-20 of the telescope round the spectrometer's vertical axis.
    Refracting angles and deviations are always given in
seconds, each being obtained from 20 readings. Generally
the collimation was checked before each such set by observa
tions through the lateral windows, according to the rules laid
down by Prof. Kundt (B. p. 1390).
    § 4. Checks have been applied to the method in considerable
number by Prof. Kundt (A. pp. 263-265). We have there
 fore only had to add a few measurements in order to test the
method of collimation. A perfectly plane and parallel glass
{>roof-plate of Steinheil's was blackened in such manner as to
  eave open four windows, of breadth -2 centim. and height 1-0

centim., occupying the same relative positions as the prisms
and windows of our metallic biprisms (see Plate XII. fig. 1).
The collimation of the two outer windows was adjusted as
usual, with the result that the inner pair of windows now gave
an apparent angle of -2", and an apparent deviation of -4". A
platinized glass plate treated in the same manner gave values
l"-3 and 1"-8 respectively; this had been previously labelled
" middling," and was less perfectly plane than any of those
carrying the biprisms finally experimented upon. The latter
plates were of course carefully selected and tested by means
of a Gauss's eyepiece.
   These observations prove the method of collimation to have
been sufficiently accurate for the object in view, as the re
fracting angles of the prisms * lay between 15" and 25", the
deviation generally exceeding 20" (up to 200", compare § 11).
As regards the measurement of the angles and deviations, it
may be remarked that these cannot appreciably have been
interfered with through multiple inner reflexions. In fact
the prisms were in every case so thick that films of double
the thickness would have proved almost quite opaque f.
   § 5. It is impossible to give a general estimate of the
accuracy reached ; each prism exhibiting its particular indi
viduality in this respect. In order therefore to enable the
reader to form a judgment on our measurements, we have
given a few detailed sets of observations (Tables I. and III.)
besides the final values (Tables II. and IV.).
   Our prisms were always kept in exsiccators, and proved to
remain quite unaltered when thus treated. Thus we found
the refracting angle as well as the deviation of a cobalt prism
(Co III.), which had been left to itself for six months, not to
have changed appreciably during this interval. The same
was the case with an iron prism (Fe III.), the black coating
of which had moreover been removed and replaced by a new
one : this also proves the surfaces of the metal to have been
sufliciently plane, as the reflecting patches left open on blacken
ing certainly had not exactly the same boundaries in both cases.
   We may remark that certain other experiments were occa
sionally made in this laboratoiy by Mr. Shea, using our prisms
with a spectrometer by Schmidt and Haensch ; these always
quite confirmed our results.
  • As it is necessary to keep the thinner part of the prisms >3x 10- «
centim. and the thicker part < 13x 10-* centim., it follows that prisms
with an angle much exceeding the highest value given in the text cannot
be used. The mean breadth of the prisms may be estimated at '15 centim.

   § 6. Measurements of the deviation on oblique transmission
of light through the prisms would have possessed but little
intrinsic interest. We had therefore first to find a legitimate
way of developing, from our measurements, the relation
which must needs exist between the inclinations of the wave-
fronts in metal and air respectively to the surface separating
both media. In doing so we wished to avoid all auxiliary
hypotheses, and to base our inferences on none of the optical
theories at present in vogue. The following treatment of the
problem before us will show how far we have reached the end
in view on the lines thus prescribed.
   § 7. Notation. —Accurately " parallel " light having been
always used, we have to consider plane wave-fronts, and in
particular the direction of their normals. Let the angles of
these directions with the normals to the prisms' surfaces be
denoted by im in the metal, i in the air. These are evidently
also the inclinations of the wave-fronts on either side of the
bounding surface metal / air. For the refractive index we
write the usual symbol n ; it has to be borne in mind that the
index has a strictly physical meaning only when Snellius's
sine law* holds absolutely or infinitely nearly (see § 12).
   The angle between the normals Nj and N2 to the two surfaces
of the biprism, as directly measured by Gauss's eyepiece, will
be called the " refracting angle" /3 ; it is the sum of the angles
of the two prisms. The angle between two pencils of light,
originally parallel, then each transmitted through a different
prism, is the deviation a. yS as well as a may be considered
infinitely small for our present purpose ; the mathematical
treatment of the subject is thereby reduced to great simplicity.
   § 8. Mode of Calculation.—Fig. 1 represents a horizontal
cross-section of our biprisms, of course not drawn to scale.
The two surfaces are numbered 1 and 2, these numbers being
also used as suffixes to distinguish quantities related to one or
the other surface. Now consider two infinitely thin pencils
of light, 1 and 2, parallel to one another ; evidently these
will continue parallel in the metal M up to points A, and A2
infinitely near the surfaces 1 and 2. This is still the case if
the glass plate or the film of platinum or both be wedge-
shaped (as indeed they always are more or less). The paral-
   * The ordinary law of refraction ftill often poes by the name of
Descartes; however, there can be no doubt but that the Dutch mathema
tician AVillebrord Snell was (he first to enunciate it.

                and Dispersion in certain Metals.             369
lelism of both pencils cannot in any way be interfered with by
anything happening at the bounding surfaces a, b, c. In fact
this parallelism is only destroyed by refraction at the fourth
boundary metal / air ; therefore our experiments can only
teach us something about what happens at this boundary, in
particular about how i depends upon im. For our purpose it
is, however, better to consider i the independent variable, as
this angle is the one directly measured.
    We therefore put im=/{i), evidently a single-valued odd
function, unknown as yet. From the diagram in fig. 1 it
follows at once that

    § 9. Now from our measurements we know the values of a,
and therefore also of /S/(a +     for a set of values of t. We
therefore in a certain sense obtain an experimental differential
equation of the simplest kind, which we have only to integrate
in order to obtain the relation sought for between im and i.
This we have actually carried out ; with abscissae t values of
/S/(« + /S) were plotted as ordinates, the points thus obtained
joined by a smooth curve, and the values of the integral /(i)
arrived at by graphical integration, starting from the initial
value f(0) = 0, evident for reasons of symmetry.

ordinary transparent matter of index n, Snellius's law would

Of course a changes but slightly near its minimum (compare
A. p. 259). When i approaches 90°, a tends towards infinite
values; at least so long as n>l, and accordingly no total
reflexion ensues (see § 15).

vertically on tne spectrometer platform. By means of the

at any angle to the left ( + ) or right ( - ) of the telescope's
axis. After a few preliminary trials we made regular measure
ments for values of » = 0°, 306, 40°, 50°, 55°, 60s, 65°, because
with these intervals the increments of the deviation were most
uniform. In certain cases we could still observe at 70° inclina
tion ; the deviations obtained in this case were considerable, e.g.
with a cobalt prism we found a = 200", i. e. over three minutes.
However, the projection of the prism on the objective lens
now becomes too narrow ; consequently the image of the slit
is so considerably drawn out by diffraction that measurement
becomes uncertain and inaccurate notwithstanding the strong
deviation.
    For these observations the source of light was a Linnemann's
zirconia burner seen through red glass. For the reasons
stated above (§ 5) a complete set of observations is given in
Table I. It will be seen that each observer determined one
deviation for + and one for - inclination (each by 20 read
ings) ; these are seen to agree on the whole. The angle /3 was
measured three times by each of us, the deviation with normal
transmission four times ; this was done on account of the pre
ponderating influence of these values on the final results.
The mean values for the two observers were used in the subse
quent calculation.
    We have carried out this part of our work with but one
prism of each metal, while using three for the measurements
of dispersion. In the latter the results prove quite inde
pendent of the refracting angle (§ 18), and it may therefore
be inferred that such is also the case with oblique transmission.
It was not so much our object here to find numerical constants
as it was in the second part of our work, where a great
number of observations had to be collected in order to obtain
sufficient accuracy *.
    § 12. The results for the three metals are given in Table II.
From the observed values of a (first horizontal line in each
section of the table) values of n were first calculated by
equation (3) (third line); this was done only in order to see
whether Snellius's law might apply. Now it is evident that
for nickel the values of n at last begin to increase with i ;
such is also the case for cobalt, though to a less degree. For
iron the deviations from Snellius's law appear to lie within
the errors of observation. However, we feel bound to assume
that the latter metal differs from the two others only quan
titatively, not qualitatively.

constant ; and we have given the variable values only to show
that they can be of no further use. A deviation of the metals

from the sine law is thus shown to exist, but to become
sensible only for inclinations above say 40°. We believe that
the nature of this deviation will be better understood if the
behaviour of each metal be compared with that of an ideal
transparent substance, which we assume to exist for this pur
pose, and to possess a refractive index equal to the mean of
those found for the metiil at inclinations cf 0°, 30°, and 40°,
which are equal within the limit of experimental errors.

    We have now calculated a and im for these imaginary sub
stances by equations (4) and {'!), i. e. according to Snellius's
law (second and fifth lines). Lastly, the values of tm, found
for the metal by graphic integration, are given in the fourth
line of each of the three sections of Table II.
    For the sake of clearness we have also graphically illustrated
the contents of Table II. In fig. 2, a is plotted as a function
of I ; the dotted curves refer to the ideal substances, the
broken straight lines to the metals*. For iron both lines
almost coincide ; for cobalt, and especially for nickel, it is
easy to see the difference.
    In the same way fig. 3 gives the relation between im (ordi
nate) and t (abscissa) ; the dotted curves again refer to the
ideal substance. The points ©, corresponding to the metals,
all lie somewhat towards the axis of abscissae.
    § 13. Synopsis.—The results may be condensed into three
statements :—
    I. Light, on passing from Fe, Co, and Ni (and probably
also from a number of other metals) into air, begins by follow
ing Snellius's sine law for small angles of emission f.
    A refractive index may therefore be inferred from observa
 tions with approximately normal transmission, but from such
 only j in fact this is what was done by Prof. Kundt, and what
 may be mathematically expressed as follows :—
    II. The refractive index of metals is denned as lim
 (sin I'/sin im).                                                          *=0
    The expression in parentheses differs but little from its
 limit even for considerable values of i; at least for the three
 metals we have examined.
    III. The actual metals deviate from ideal substances, sup
 posed to possess the index thusdefined, in the following sense :
 to a given im corresponds a greater value of t, or to a given i
 a lesser value of im.
     The differences become more marked the greater the in
 clination, and are given empirically by our Table II. (sixth
 line) ; for the three metals they decrease in the order Ni,Co, Fe.
     § 14. The method of observation we used has the advantage
 that considerable differences in the deviation observed finally
 lead to comparatively slight differences in the relation obtained
 by integration.
    • On account of the almost identical behaviour of Co and Fe, the
  ordinates of all the iron curves (in tigs. 2-4) had to be plotted from the
  auxiliary axis of abscissae, in order to prevent the curves from overlapping.
    t This law is then easily seen to hold as well for emission into any
  other transparent medium within the same range.

    In many cases, where the object is rather qualitative, it
 further appears advisable to work at considerable inclination;
the fittest angle is 60° ; the deviation is then increased about
three-fold. The apparent breadth of the prism, however, is
 only halved (cos 60°=0'500), so that the diffraction effect
 does not yet present too great an obstacle. As remarked
 above, however, refractive indices can only be calculated from
measurements with normal transmission ; we have therefore ad
 hered to the latter method for our measurements of dispersion.
    § 15. Other Metals. —These remarks can only apply to
metals having a high index, such as those now examined.
For these metals one condition is always fulfilled, which
appears important to us, viz. that the values of im hardly
exceed 30°, an angle the cosine of which is still near unity*.
For Fe and Co im even remains below 20° ; accordingly the
deviations from Snellius's law are most considerable for Ni,
which has the smallest index.
    We have also given theoretical curves for silver and gold in
fig. 3 ; we began by assuming the sine law to hold and took
the indices given by Kundt (A, p. 266) : Ag (white) 0 27 ;
Au (white) 0-58 ; Au (blue) 1-00. Of course in the latter
case a deviation should never occur, and im-i always.
    These theoretical curves show that for i > 150,66 (Ag) and
i > 35°'45 (Au^ , total reflexion ought to commence ; greater
angles of emission into air would then be impossible. The
deviation curves in fig. 2 have been calculated for prisms
with a refracting angle yS=25"; they should more properly
lie under the axis of abscissae, as the deviations all become
negative. The curves show that for these metals also the
numerical values of a ought to increase with i, finally to reach
the value /8 for the critical values of the abscissa given above
 (see equation (4) § 10) ; at this point the curves must come
to a dead stop.
    § 16. It is evident, however, from the most casual observa
tion that silver or gold films may be looked through at any
angle. This shows that the assumption of Snellius's law,
made above for the sake of further discussion, must be quite
beside the truth in this case, even as a rough approximation.
    For different reasons it appeared to us unadvisable at
present to attempt to pursue this question experimentally.
It may be indeed foreseen that the advantages offered by
   • As is seen from fie. 3, im hardly increases any more when t increases
from 65u to 00° : we should therefore probably have learned nothing more
even if we had been able to push the inclination beyond 65°.

                   and Dispersion in certain Metals.                375
our method in the case of Fe, Co, and Ni would not subsist
when applying it to Au or Ag. In fact we should have had
to determine the large deviation from Snellius's law, which
doubtless exists, by small differences in the quantities observed.
We could hardly have successfully attempted this without
refining the observations.
   However, it is possible to foretell the actual shape of the
silver and gold curves (fig. 3). They must start from the
origin along the same tangent as the dotted curves drawn ;
then bend more and more concavely towards the axis of
abscissae ; they cannot intersect PQ, as this would mean total
reflexion, and must abut normally on QR. Their character
therefore is essentially the same as that of our curves obtained
for Ni &c.

376          Messrs. du Bois and Rubens on Refraction
deviation, as remarked above. In the plane of the spectro
meter's slit a small spectrum from an arc lamp was projected.
By slightly turning the collimator the slit could be adjusted
to given positions in the spectrum. For this purpose the
divided circle had been calibrated by observations with the
spectral lines of Li, Na, and H, and the readings correspond
ing to the wave-lengths of Li a, D, F, and G noted once for
all. The refractive index was calculated by equation (5) (§10).
   We begin by giving two full sets of observations in Table
III., which explains itself. We worked with three prisms of
each metal, in order to get our results freed as much as
possible from the individuality of the prisms and from other
sources of error.
   § 18. The results are given in Table IV. ; the numbers in
prominent type are the arithmetic means of the indices ob
tained for the three prisms. Beneath these we moreover give
figures headed "means B ;" these were calculated by giving
different weight to the indices derived from different prisms
proportional to the refracting angle of the latter. As the num
bers B show no systematic differences against A, the results are
really independent of the refracting angle (compare A, p. 264).
The means B are of no further use, as the observations with
the steeper prisms are for various reasons not more trustworthy
than those with the flatter ones. The indices for " red
light are those obtained above (Table II.) ; they correspond
to a wave-length of about 64-4 x 10-6 centim. *
   §19. Discussion.— A comparison of some of our numbers
with those found by Prof. Kundt for Ni and Fe with light
only approximately homogeneous (A, p. 266) leads to the
following remarks :—
   1. For Ni the coincidence is sufficiently near, considering
the preliminary character of Prof. Kundt's measurements and
the uncertainty about the wave-length which has to be
attributed to his "blue" light ;
   2. For Fe deviations appear, rather insignificant at the blue
end but increasing towards the red.
   It is of course at present impossible to decide whether these
deviations may be explained by Kundt's prisms not having
been free from oxide (lesser index, normal dispersion A, p. 267)
or by his electrolytic iron baths not having been chemically
pure. Considering the improvements since introduced into
the method, mainly by Prof. Kundt himself, we believe our

    There appears to be no simple relation between this dis
 persion of refraction and that of either Kundt's or Kerr's
 phenomenon (compare § 2).
                            III. Conclusion.
    § 20. We have from the beginning guarded ourselves
 against basing in any way upon any of the various elastic or
 electric optical theories proposed (§ 6).               In the present
 paper we have attempted to restrict ourselves to the com
 munication of facts which may be simply inferred from our
experiments. We believe that the realm of fact in the optics
 of metals is as yet too little extended to serve as a successful
 criterion for the theories ; any slight extension of it, to which
 we may have contributed, hardly changes this state of affairs.
    A valuable contribution towards the experimental investiga
tion of this part of Optics has been lately published by Dr.
 Drude ; he determined the two ordinary constants of reflexion
 for a number of metals with the utmost care. By means
 of the particular elastic theory advocated by him, he then
calculated indices of refraction and of extinction and re
flecting powers which he compared with experimental data
by Kundt (A, p. 266), Wernicke*, and one of usf. Of the
refractive indices obtained in this way four J are directly
comparable with ours, and even show a certain amount of
coincidence.
    In answer to our inquiry Dr. Drude was good enough to
promise measurements on cobalt also, eventually with regard
to dispersion. We therefore think it advisable to wait
for those further determinations, as these are sure to afford
Dr. Drude a safer base for judging any coincidence or dis
crepancy than the data at present to hand can possibly do.

XLII. On a Method of Determinino the Absolute Density of a
                  Gcu>. By J. Joly, B. E., M.A.*
THE method still in general use for the accurate determina
       tion of the density of a gas is that of Regnault, improved
from the conception of Biot and Arago, by the addition
principally of the counterpoising vessel. This method is not
free from objections.
    The gas is weighed in the vessel in which its volume
is measured, and as this is necessarily a large vessel, of con
siderable weight, the weight of the gas bears but a very small
proportion to the total weight observed. Agaiu, from the
great bulk and surface of the containing vessel, it is in itself
a difficult object to weigh with a high degree of accuracy,
more especially when exposed, as it is, between the first and
second weighings, to the manipulation incident in filling it at
a known temperature.
    Further, in the determination of the volume of this vessel
there arises, as Lord Rayleigh has lately shown f, an error
due to the variation of pressure within the vessel when it is
weighed, vacuous in the first instance, full in the second.
This error, which escaped Regnault, is very considerable iu
this method.
    If, again, there is an object in economizing the gas, Reg
nault's method is wasteful, as the "washing out" of so large
a vessel with the gas necessitates a far greater expenditure of
 gas than is subsequently required for the actual determination.
 Without referring again to these objections to the method of
 Regnault, it will be seen that they are either much reduced
 in importance or eliminated in the method to be described.
    In this new method the measurements of the volume and
 of the weight of the gas are effected in separate vessels. That
 in which the gas is weighed is small, the gas being under
 high pressure within it. That in which the volume is subse
 quently measured may, on the other hand, be as large as may
 be desired. We are not concerned with its weight.
    The vessel which I have in use for holding the gas, when
 being weighed, is of copper, spherical in form, about B^centim.
 in diameter, made up of two hemispheres, the walls being
 about 1 millim. in thickness. The hemispheres are brazed
  (not soft-soldered) together within a belt of copper about

  3S0                Mr. J. Joly on a Method of
  4£ millim. wide, and 1 millim. in thickness. The vessel must
  be quite staunch. Its internal volume is just 160 cub. centim.
  It is closed by a small screw-valve, having a side tubulure for
 attachment to the various apparatus. The valve-spindle of
 stoel works through a small stuffing-box to prevent the escape
  of gas along the shaft of the spindle when the vessel is being
 filled or emptied.
     This vessel is tested hydraulically to 1000 lb. in the square
 inch. It may be safely filled to pressures of 20 or 25 atmo
 spheres. I am daily using such vessels in the steam calori
 meter in determining the specific heats of gnses ; here they
 are raised to the temperature of 100° (J., bringing the pressure
 to near 30 atmospheres in many cases. For the purpose of
 compressing the gas into this vessel I use a pump of special
 construction, a description of which I hope shortly to publish.
  But, obviously, any compression-pump which will deliver the
 gas without contamination of oil or moisture will answer.
    A counterpoising sphere of the same bulk and weight
 approximately is required. Against this, after the required
 quantity of gas has been inserted in the weighing-sphere,
 the latter is equilibrated. This operation is readily per
 formed in an ordinary chemical balance to an accuracy of
 one tenth or one twentieth of a milligram. The weight of a
 copper vessel of the strength described will be from 80 to 90
 grammes. It will be seen later that one sufficiently strong to
 hold 2 litres safely need not exceed some 40 grammes in
 weight.
    The vessel in which the volume is determined is next to
 be considered. It is lettered g in the diagram, where it is
 shown connected with the weighing-sphere, the latter screwed
 to the steel connexion b provided for it, and through the fine
bore (1 millim.) of which it delivers its contents into g. The
volumenometer is of glass, cylindrical, closed at each end by
ground stoppers with tubulures attached. The upper tubu
lure is of fine bore, hardly 1 millim., the lower tubulure of
some 3 or 4 millim. bore. The volumenometer is surrounded
by a copper jacket, having two large openings cut in its
cover for the admission of broken ice or water, and also a
tubulure for admitting a thermometer. A fine mark is etched
on the lower tubulure at /, and this tubulure is continued by
attachment to a smaller vessel c, as shown. This again is
connected by a rubber-tube connexion with the vessel d, which
can be raised or lowered, as will be understood from the
diagram. The volume of the volumenometer is best deter
mined with water. If water is subsequently to be used in it
the procedure is as follows:—

         Determining the Absolute Density of a Gas.          381
   The coupling b is removed and the vessel g inverted in the
copper jacket. The wide tubulure is now uppermost, the
narrow one below. This is attached to d, and the upper one
to an air-pump, and distilled air-free water drawn into g
through the lower tubulure till it is quite full. The vessel d is
now raised, the connexion with the air-pump removed, and
when d is so high that water is just welling out of the
tubulure this is closed with a short pinched rubber tube.
   Broken ice is now filled in round the volumenometer, and
after the lapse of some hours the connexion below with d is
broken and the fine tubulure closed with a little piece of wax.
The upper tubulure is now opened, and the level in the
tubulure lowered by applying bibulous paper till it sinks to
the mark etched upon the glass. It is then closed with rubber
tubing as before. The ice being next removed, g is lifted
out, dried carefully, and weighed. This done it is replaced

in the copper cylinder, this time in its normal position, and the
water allowed to run out. The ice is now returned to the jacket,
and after the lapse of some time the volumenometer is closed
as before, when the height H of the barometer is read.
Another weighing is now made, and by difference the weight
of water at 0° C. which has quitted the vessel is calculated,
allowing for the weight of saturated air at 0° 0. and H con
tained in the vessel at the second weighing. One or mora
such operations may be performed, and from the known
density of water at 0C C. the volume at the temperature 0° C.
calculated. To this must be added, for the complete volume,
the volume at ordinary temperatures of the small steel con
nexion with the sphere. It is obvious that the error arising
from the inconstant temperature of this fine tube or of the
short tubulure exposed at / need not be attended to.
    If mercury is subsequently to be employed in the volume
nometer the volume should be determined on a slightly
different procedure. Water should still be used, however—
not mercury, or a distending effect, due to the great weight
of the latter, might give rise to error—but the weight of the
vessel, when containing air, should be first ascertained when
the walls within are dry. In this way the capacity of the
dry volumenometer is obtained, which is that required with
the use of mercury. It is evident that the use of mercury is
on this account much preferable to water in subsequent work,
as the volume of residual water in the vessel from one experi
ment to another will not be accurately constant. Again, no
hygrometric correction on the pressure of the gas contained
in the volumenometer will be requisite.
   The volume of this vessel (which is but an enlarged
Sprengel tube) being ascertained once for all at the tempera
ture 0° C, it follows that it will afford a ready means of
dealing with a gas contained in the weighing-sphere. It is
filled with mercury or water, and surrounded by ice. The
vessel d is then raised till the liquid in the volumenometer has
risen to the top of the fine steel tubulure b, the weighing-
sphere removed from the balance, screwed on to b, and the
vessel d lowered. The valve at a is next screwed back a little
till the mercury is seen to rise in d. The right-hand stop
cock on d is now opened, and the mercury let flow into a tall
graduated or marked vessel, so that it may be known about
when the operation of filling g is approaching completion.
Presently, the surface level of the mercury sinks into the
vessel c. This possesses such capacity as to give time to

  the volumenometer. All must now be let to stand till f0° is
  attained (half-an-hour will suffice), and the final adjustment
  of the mercury level to the mark f then effected. By means
  of a cathetometer the height h, the difference of level between
  the surfaces at d and f, is read. This will only be some 5 or
  6 millim. in general. For this a temperature correction is
  hardly required ; but a capillary correction, ascertained ex
  perimentally once for all, must be applied owing to the
  different areas of the surfaces in the two tubes. This might
  be eliminated in the construction by conferring an equally
  small area on d, but it is probably more convenient to make
  the simple correction required. The barometer is now read,
 and the pressure of the gas in g computed. Its temperature
 is 0° C, and its volume that of the vessel, = V. The sphere
 is now returned to the balance, re-weighed, and the weight of
 gas, subject to a small correction, found by difference.
    The correction mentioned is due to the shrinkage of the
 copper sphere on the relief of pressure, and corresponds to
 that occurring in the case of Hegnault's glass vessel. Ex
 periments (two, closely agreeing, have been made on this
 sphere) reveal a shrinkage which may be taken as 0-1732 cub.
 centim. on the removal of 4-3525 grammes of air at the
 temperature 12° C, a fall of pressure of 22-01 atmospheres,
 closely. At 760 millim. this weight of air occupies about
 3-367 litres. This would be a needlessly large volume to
 confer on the volumenometer, except for very special work.
 Even in the case of hydrogen (1 litre at 7G0 and 0° C, weigh
 ing 0-0895 gram.) two litres will suffice for a very accurate
estimation of the weight of gas dealt with. At the pressure
corresponding to the compression of two litres into the sphere
of 160 cub. centim. capacity, a much lighter weighing-sphere
than that previously described will suffice. Thus 1 use one
weighing but 41 grammes, which has been tested up to 500 lb.
in the square inch. The thickness of its walls is somewhat
less than half a millimetre, its volume a little greater than
160 cub. centim. There is no difficulty in weighing such a
vessel to the one-twentieth of a milligram., or closer. Using
the heavier vessel the correction for shrinkage will be the
shrinkage due to two litres, i. e. 0-1029 cub. centim. multi
plied into the normal density of air. This gives a displace
ment effect of 0-000127. This correction is on a weight of
2-5878 gram, of air or the correction on w, which is sub-
tractive, is for air one part in 25,000 q.p. In the case of
hydrogen one part in 1790. Assuming the use of the lighter
sphere the experimentally determined shrinkage is 0 26359
cub. centim. for a lowering of pressure of 12-82 atmospheres,

384                   Mr. J. Joly on a Method of
a little more than the pressure due to two litres. The shrink
age is, in fact, closely 0-257 cub. centim., and the cor
rection on the weight of gas released is O'OOOSIS. This
is higher than with the heavier sphere, but the correction
is perfectly definite [and easily ascertained once for all by
successive weighings, before and after emptying, in distilled
water] * ; and on the other hand the use of the lighter vessel
will probably confer still greater accuracy on the weighings.
   Turning our attention to the volumenometer it appears
possible that a similar correction may arise in the assumption
made as to its capacity. For, in the experiments in which its
volume is determined, its wails are exposed to the pressure
due to the weight of the water contained in it ; subsequently,
when it is occupied by a gas, this pressure does not obtain.
Hence there might be reason to fear some small excess in the
value ascribed to its capacity. To make this a matter of
experiment, I filled the jacket with water, and provided a
wide tube dipping into it, syphon-wise, enabling the water to
be all run off within a short space of time. The volumeno
meter within was filled with air, the upper tubulure was closed,
the lower one being arranged to dip into a vessel of water,
the water standing some little height in the tube, nearly to
the etched mark. Thick baize was now folded round and
over the jacket, and after the lapse of some time the cross
wire of a cathetometer was brought to read the level of the
water in the lower tubulure. A few minutes' observation
sufficed to show when this level was stationary. The syphon
was now put into operation ; and while the water was running
out of the jacket the level of the liquid on the tubulure was
observed. No movement was perceivable. It is thus, I
think, legitimate to conclude that no appreciable error arises
from this source, the experiment being a delicate one.
   Comparing the previous figures with those obtained in the
exact experiments of Lord Rayleigh, using Regnault's method,
which experiments may be fairly taken as representative of
modern refinement on the method, the following numbers are
obtained, assuming the same weight of hydrogen to be dealt
with in the present method as was used by Lord Rayleigh,
and the lighter sphere to be used.
   • Two experiments on the heavier sphere afforded : (1) a shrinkage of
0'1013 cub. centim. for the release of 2-5728 grammes of air at 15°-4;
(2) a shrinkage of (H732 cub. centim. for 4'3525 grammes of air at 12° C.
   Two experiments on the lighter sphere gave : (1) 0-1720 cub. centim.
shrinkage for the release of l-6046 grammes of air at 16°; and (2) a
shrinkage of 0-2G36 cub. centim. for 2'5284 grammes of air at 140-8.

   Regarding the last numbers I may observe that the case
assumed is unfavourable to the new method. The compression
of 1800 cub. centim. (at 760 millim.) in the sphere raises the
pressure to 12-5 atmospheres, but it may safely be filled to 17,
or, it will carry some 36 per cent, more gas than is assumed
above.
   The volumenometer which I am about to take into use in
estimating the density of the samples of gas used in my
experiments on the specific heats of gases has only lately been
constructed. A first and hasty experiment on the density of
dry air may, however, indicate the magnitudes dealt with, and
the accuracy obtainable when restricted to the use of water in
the volumenometer. The interior volume of the volumeno
meter determined by weighingit filled with water at 15°-67, and
again filled with air, but wet on the walls, was found to be
1751-0 cub. centim. This is with great probability correct to
unity, the first place of decimals being perhaps open to small
error.
   The data in the experiment on air density are as follows :—
Weight of air inserted = 2-1092 less 0-0001 for error of
buoyancy=2-1091. Temp, of water jacket=15°-70. Bar.
760-32 reduced to 0°C. Head of water 0-388 inches (=A)
+ 0-120 inches correction for capillarity (by subsequent
experiment). Total press. 760-32 + 0-95 millim. = 761-27.
Max. vapour tension of water at 15-7 = 13-3 millim.; hence
the pressure, finally, is 747-97 millim. The volume for the
experiment may be taken as 1751 cub. centim., neglecting
the temperature effect of 0°-03.

386           Lord Rayleigh on the Tension of Water
   From these data the density of dry air at 747-97 millim.,
and at the temperature 15-70, is found to be 0-0012046. The
last figure is doubtful, as being beyond the limit of accuracy
with which the volume is known.
   If, for confirmation of this result, reference is made to
accepted results from the Tabellen of Landholt and Bornstein,
the density of dry air under the same conditions of pressure
and temperature is deduced as O0012033. From Bieder-
mann's Chemiker-Kalender (1888) is deduced the number
0,U012052. The mean of these two closely agrees with the
experimental result, absolutely indeed to the fourth significant
figure, the last reliable one in the determination.
   In conclusion, I may point out that this method leaves the
gas finally in a vessel, which, by the addition of a small side
way to the connexion b, may be made a most convenient one
for the subsequent transference of the gas into any apparatus
for its analysis.
   The present method may, as in the case of Regnault's, be
by obvious procedures applied to the determination of the
variation of the density with change of temperature, or
change of pressure. And its application to the determination
of vapour densities suggests itself. In this case the tempera
ture of the volumenometer would, ]>erhaps, best be adjusted
by the use of a vapour in the jacket, and an arrangement for
controlling its pressure.
 XLIII. On the Tension of Water Surfaces, Clean and Conta
   minated, investigated by the Method of Ripples. By Lord
    Rayleigh, Sec. R.S.*
 NUMEROUS and varied phenomena prove that the ten
         sion of a water surface is lowered by the presence of
 even a trace of grease. In the case of olive-oil, a film whose
 calculated thickness is as low as 2 micro-millimetres is sufficient
 to entirely alter the properties of the surface in relation to
 fragments of camphor floating thereupon. It seemed to me
 of importance for the theory of capillarity to ascertain with
 some approach to precision the tensions of greasy surfaces ;
 and in a recent paper f I gave some results applicable to the
 comparison of a clean surface with one just greasy enough to
 stop the camphor movements and also with one saturated with
 olive-oil. The method employed was that depending upon the

rise of liquid between parallel plates of glass ; and I was not
satisfied with it, not merely on account of the roughness of
the measurement, but also because the interpretation of the
result depends upon the assumption that the angle of contact
with the glass is zero. In the opinion of Prof. Quincke, whose
widely extended researches in this field give great weight to
his authority, this assumption is incorrect even in the case of
pure liquids, and, as it seemed to me, is still less to be trasted
in its application to contaminated surfaces, the behaviour of
which is still in many respects obscure. I was thus desirous
of checking my results by a method independent of the
presence of a solid body.
   The solution of the problem was evidently to be found in
the observation of ripples, as proposed by Prof. Tait, upon the
basis of Sir W. Thomson's theory. Thomson has shown that
when the wave-length is small, the vibration depends princi
pally upon capillary tension ; so that a knowledge of corre
sponding wave-lengths and periods will lead to a tolerably
accurate estimate of tension.
   Besides some early observations of my own *, made for the
most part for another purpose, I had before me the work of
Matthiessen t, who has compared Thomson's formulae with
observation over a wide range of wave-length. The results
are calculated on the basis of an assumed surface-tension, and
are exhibited as a comparison of calculated and observed wave
 lengths. On the whole the agreement is fair ; but the accuracy
 attained seemed to be insufficient for the purpose which I had
in view. As will presently appear, an error in the wave
 length is multiplied about three times in the tension deduced
 from it, so that, in a reversal of Matthiessen's calculations, the
 errors would appear much magnified.
    Quite recently Mr. Michie Smith has published an account
 of experiments made by Thomson's method for the determi
nation of the tension of mercury. Some anomalies were
met with ; and it seems not improbable that the vibrations
 observed were in some cases an octave below those of the
vibrating source J.
    When it is remembered that Thomson's theory is one of
infinitely small vibrations, it will be seen that for my purpose
it was necessary above all things that the amplitude of vibra
tion should be very moderate. The sub-octave vibrations of

 388           Lord Bayleigh on the Tension of Water
 Faraday are especially to be avoided as almost necessarily
 of large amplitude. At the same time the limitation is not
 without its inconvenience. One of the great difficulties of the
 experiment is to see the waves properly, and this is much
 increased when the vibrations are extremely small.
    In considering the problem thus presented, it occurred to
 me that it was essentially the same as that so successfully
 solved by Foucault in relation to the figuring of optical sur
 faces. The undisturbed surface of liquid is an accurate plane;
 the waves upon it may be regarded as deviations from optical
 truth, and may be made evident in the same way as any other
 deviations from truth in a reflecting surface. Guided by this
 idea, I was able to work with waves of which nothing what
 ever was to be seen by ordinary observation of the surface
 over which they were travelling.
    In the application of Foucault's method it is necessary that
 light from a radiant point, after reflexion from the surface
under test, should be brought to a focus, in the immediate
neighbourhood of which is placed the eye of the observer.
Any small irregularities in the surface then render themselves
conspicuous to the eye focused upon it. In the present case
the reflector is plane, and the formation of a real image of the
radiant requires the aid of a lens. In my experiments this
was usually a large single lens of 6 inches diameter and
84 inches focus. On one occasion an achromatic telescope-
lens was substituted, but the aperture was too small to include
the number of waves necessary for accuracy. Although the
want of achromatism was prejudicial to the appearance of the
image, it is not certain that the accuracy of the determina
tions was impaired, at least after experience in observation had
been acquired. The lens was fixed horizontally near the floor,
a few inches above the surface of the water under examination.
The radiant point, a very small gas-flame, was situated in the
principal focal plane, but a little on one side of the axis of
symmetry, so that the image formed after reflexion from the
water and a double passage through the lens might be a little
separated from the source. For greater convenience reflecting
strips of looking-glass were introduced at angles of 45°, or
thereabouts, so that the initial and final directions of the rays
were horizontal.
   The smallness of the disturbance is not the only obstacle to
its visibility. Even with Foucault's arrangement for viewing
minute departures from planeness, nothing could usually be
seen of the waves here employed without a further device
necessary on account of the rapidity with which all phases are
presented in succession. A clear view of the waves must be

an intermittent one, isoperiodic with the vibrations themselves,
and may be obtained in the manner first described by Plateau.
In the present case it was found simplest to render the light
itself intermittent. Close in front of the small gas-flame was
placed a vibrating blade of tin-plate rigidly attached to the
extremity of the prong of a large tuning-fork, and so situated
that once during each vibration the light was intercepted by
the interposition of the blade. The vibrations of the fork
were maintained electromagnetically in the usual manner, and
the intermittent current furnished by the interrupter fork
was utilized, as in Helmholtz's vowel-sound experiments, to
excite a second, in unison with itself. The second fork gene
rated waves in the dish of water by means of a dipper .attached
to its lower prong.
    When the action is regular, the vibrations of the two forks
are strictly isochronous, even though the natural periods may
differ somewhat*. The view presented to the observer is then
perfectly steady, and corresponds to one particular phase of
the vibration, or rather, since the illumination is not instan
taneous, to an average of phases in the neighbourhood of a
 particular one.
    Even in the case of a perfectly regular train of waves, the
appearance will depend upon the precise position occupied by
the eye. It is evident that the light most diverted from its
 course is that reflected from the shoulders of the waves— the
 points midway between the troughs and crests, for it is here
 that the slope of the surface is greatest. Thus if the eye be
 moved laterally outwards from the focal point, until all light
 has nearly disappeared, the residual illumination will mark
 out the instantaneous positions of one set of shoulders, all other
 parts of the complete wave remaining dark. This is one of
 the most favourable positions for observation. If the devia
 tion from the focal point be in the opposite direction, the
 other set of shoulders will be seen bright.
     The aspect of the waves was not always equally pleasing.
 Sometimes the formation of stationary waves, due to reflexions,
 interfered with regularity. A readjustment of the walls of
 the vessel relatively to the dipper would then often effect an
 improvement. The essential thing is that there should be no
     * A dirty condition of the mercury sometimes leads to the failure of
 several successive contacts. During the interval the vibrations of the
  second fork, being unconstrained, take place in their natural period. In
  this way a phase-discrepancy may set in, to be subsequently corrected
  when the regular contacts are reestablished. Such a state of things is to
  be avoided as distracting to the eye, and unfavourable to accurate obser
  vation.

390           Lord Rayleigh on the Tension of Water
ambiguity in the wave pattern over the measured part of the
field. It would occasionally happen that in certain positions
of the eye a change of phase would occur in the middle of the
field, so that the bright bands in one part were the continua
tion of the dark bands of another part. Near the transition
the bands would appear confused, a sufficient indication that
no measurement must be attempted. On the other hand, it is
not necessary that the contrast between the dark and bright
parts should be very great. Indeed the measuring marks
were better seen when no part of the field was very dark.
   Fig. 1 gives a general idea of the appearance of the field.

which was to facilitate the counting. The measuring arrange
ment was something like a beam compass. Stout brass wires,
attached to a bar of iron, were shaped at their ends like brad
awls, and the edges were placed parallel to the crests of the
waves. In order to avoid residual parallax, the rod was so sup
ported that the edges were in close proximity to the water
surface.
    In many of the experiments the distance between the edges
was set beforehand, e.g. to 10 centim., and was not altered
 when the wave-lengths varied with the deposition of grease.
 The number of wave-lengths included was determined by

                Surfaces, Clean and Contaminated.            391
counting, and estimation of tenths. Usually the discrepancy
between Mr. Gordon's estimation and my own did not ex
ceed a single tenth, and in a large proportion of cases there
was no difference. Probabty the mean of our readings would
rarely be wrong by more than fa of a wave-length, when the
pattern was well seen. In the experiments specially directed
to the determination of the tension of a clean surface, it was
found advisable to work with an unknown distance ; other
wise the recollection of previous results interfered with the
independence of the estimates.
   It is probable that somewhat greater accuracy in single
measurements might have been attained had the distance been
adjustable by a smooth motion within reach of the observer.
Each measuring edge might then have been set to the most
favourable position, that is, to the centre of a bright band.
The frequent removal of the apparatus for comparison with a
scale would, however, be rather objectionable ; and it was
thought doubtful whether any final gain would accrue in the
mean of several observations.
   Some trouble was experienced from the communication of
vibrations through unintended channels. In order to prevent
the direct influence of the interrupter fork upon the liquid
surface, it was found advantageous to isolate it from the floor
 by supporting it upon a shelf carried upon the walls across a
corner of the laboratory. On one occasion it was noticed that
the waves were visible without the aid of the arrangement for
making the light intermittent. This was traced to a tremor
of one of the mirrors, supported upon the same shelf as the
interrupter fork. Such a method of rendering the waves
visible is objectionable, since it destroys the definition of the
 measuring points. The tremor was eliminated by the intro
duction of rubber tubing under the stand of the interrupter.
    During the experiments on greasy surfaces one pair of
 forks only was employed. The frequency of the interrupter
 was about 42 per second, so that the intermittent current
 could be used to excite a fork of about 126. The beats be
 tween this and a standard Koenig fork of 128 were counted
 at intervals, and found to be sufficiently constant. The pitch
 of the standard has been verified by myself*, and at the
 temperature of the laboratory may be taken with sufficient
 accuracy to be 128. If we take the number of beats per
 minute at 98, we have for the frequency of the interrupter
                     /-*(l«8-|jj)=«-li.

392          Lord Rayleigh on the Tension of Water
In the case of clean water another pair of forks of about 128
was employed as a check. The number of beats was 184 per
minute, and

                     /= 128 -^ = 124-9.
The water was contained in a shallow 12" x 10" porcelain
dish ; and before commencing observations its surface was
purified with the aid of an expansible hoop of thin sheet brass.
The width of the hoop is greater than the depth of water, and
it is deposited in the dish so as to include the dipper, but
otherwise in as contracted a condition as possible. It is then
opened out to its maximum area with the effect of attenuating
many times the thickness of the greasy film, which no amount
of preliminary cleaning seems able to obviate. It not un-
frequently happened that the first attempt to get a clean
surface was a partial failure, but a repetition of the operation
was usually successful. It seems as if impurity attaches itself
to the brass so obstinately that only contact with a clean
water surface will remove it.
   In the earlier experiments the waves were generated by a
dipper of circular section, a closed tube of glass, somewhat
like a test-tube. The measurements were quite satisfactory,
but I felt doubts as to a possible influence of curvature upon
wave-length. In order to avoid any risk of this kind, and
to render the waves straight from the commencement, a
straight horizontal edge of glass plate, about 2£ inches long,
was afterwards substituted, and worked very satisfactorily.
It is not necessary or desirable that the dipper should pass
in and out of the water. In most cases the vibrations employed
were very small, and the edge of the dipper was immersed
throughout.
   The purity of the water surface could be judged by the
result of the observation of the number of wave-lengths ; the
smallest number corresponding to the purest surface. But it
soon became apparent that a more delicate test was to be
found in the general appearance of the wave pattern. Upon
a clean surface there is a strong tendency to irregularity,
dependent no doubt upon reflexions, which become more
important when the propagation is very free. In order to
meet this, it was often found necessary to weaken the vibra
tions of the secondary fork, either by putting it more out of
tune with the primary, or by shifting its magnet to a less
favourable position, or, finally, by shunting the current
across. A slight trace of grease would then render itself
evident by a damping down of the waves before any change

                Surfaces, Clean and Contaminated.         393
could be observed in the wave-length. After a little ex
perience with the forks in a given state of adjustment, a
momentary glance at the pattern was sufficient to enable one
to recognize the condition of the surface.
   The interpretation of the observations depends upon the
following formula, due to Thomson :—
   Let       U = velocity of propagation,
             \ = wave-length,
             t = periodic time,
             p = density,
             T = superficial tension,
             h = depth of water,
then (Bassett's ' Hydrodynamics,' vol. ii. p. 177)
so that to find T we have
                   T=^Coth2-^-^.
   In the present experiments the effect of the limitation of
depth is negligible. We have h =1-8 centim., and for the
greatest value of \ about '7 centim. Now
               com ^ - i_e-i„k/\ - *-r*e         ,
approximately, when h is relatively large ; so that
                   coth (2vh/\) = 1 + 2e-30= 1,
with abundant accuracy.       Again, in the case of water we
havep=l; and thus             \3     g\3
which is the formula by which the calculation of T is to be
made. The second term will be found to be small in com
parison with the first, so that approximately T varies as \s.
A one per cent, error in the estimation of \ will therefore
involve one of three per cent, in the deduced value of T. In
many of the experiments about 15 waves were included be
tween the marks. An error of f0 of a wave is thus 1 in 150,
leading to a two per cent, error in T. We may expect the
final mean value to be correct to less than one per cent., but
we must not be surprised if individual results show dis
crepancies of two per cent.
   An example (August 2) will now be given in which the
 surface of clean water was greased with oleic acid. The dish

394          Lord Rayleigh on the Tension of Water
after rinsing was filled with water drawn from a tap in con
nexion with a cistern supplied mainly by rain water, and
placed in position. On expansion of the brass hoop the
number of waves included between the measuring points was
estimated to be 13-7, 13-8 by the two observers. A piece
of paper was then greased with oleic acid, and with this a
platinum wire, previously cleaned by ignition, was wiped.
On introduction of part of the wire into the water contained
within the hoop, the number of waves rose to 15'4, 15-3.
Upon this surface camphor scrapings were found to be quite
dead, so that the mark had been overshot.
   The dish was then refilled. Upon expansion the number
of waves upon the clean surface was 13-7, 13-7. On con
tamination with a little oleic acid, 14-8, 14-8. Camphor was
now moderately active. More oleic was added. Headings
were now 15-4, 15-4, and camphor was quite dead.
   The point to be fixed evidently lay between 14-8 and 15-4.
A fresh surface was taken, and on addition of a little oleic the
readings were 14-8, 14-8. Camphor was then tried and found
moderately active. Reading still 14-8. A little more oleic
added ; readings 15-1, 15-1 ; camphor scrapings were now
" nearly dead.' More oleic ; 15% 15-2 ; camphor " very
nearly dead." More oleic ; 15-4, 15-4 ; " not absolutely
dead." More oleic; 15-5, 15-5 ; camphor " absolutely dead. '
The temperature of the water was 63° F.
   On a previous occasion (July 29) accordant results had
been obtained. Clean water 13-7, 13-7. Oleic added ; 15-0,
15-0; camphor nearly dead. More oleic; 15 2, 15-25 :
camphor very nearly dead. Oleic; 15-55, 15-6 ; camphor
dead. On both days the distance over which the waves were
measured was 9-20 centim.
   It may be well to exhibit in full the calculation for the
clean water :—

                Finally, T= 85-5 -11-2 = 74-3.

   If we take as the reading when the camphor is nearly dead
15-2, we find in like manner
                          T=62-7-9-l=53-6.
After this example a summary of results may suffice. The
interest attaching to the determination of the tension of a
clean surface led me to strive after a higher degree of accuracy
than perhaps would otherwise have been necessary. The

   The mean result with the graver fork is T=74-2 ; and
with the quicker one T = 73'6. The discrepancy of nearly
one per cent, marks the limit of accuracy. It should be re
marked that some of the consecutive results where no varia
tion occurred in the distance between the points cannot be
regarded as quite independent.
   On several occasions distilled water proved a less satis
factory subject than tap water. The surface seemed more
unwilling to become and remain clean. Sometimes after ex
pansion a notable increase of readings would occur in the
course of a few minutes without assignable cause.
   I was very anxious to satisfy myself that in the surfaces
experimented upon by the wave method a high degree of
purit3r was really attained. In the experiments of July 28 a
Plateau needle vibrating upon a portable stand was introduced.
After the examination by the method of waves the dish was
brought out into a good light, and the quality of the surface
tested by observation of the motion of motes when the needle

396              Lord Rayleigh on the Tension of Water
lying upon it was caused to vibrate by an external magnet*.
In making the necessary arrangements there was some risk
of introducing contamination, so that the discovery of an
unclean surface would prove nothing definite. If, however,
the behaviour of the surface under the needle test was good,
it could be inferred with confidence that the measured waves
were not affected by impurity. On two occasions the test
succeeded fairly well.
    The observations with the 128 fork were rather difficult,
the waves being about twice as close as in the other case. In
the calculation of results it appears, as was to be expected,
that the importance of the second term, due to gravity, is
diminished. Thus for July 22,
                          T=76-5-2-4=74-l.
The general result that at temperatures such as 65° (18° C.) the
tension of clean water surfaces is about 74-0 C.G.S. absolute
units of force per centimetre seems entitled to considerable
confidence. It agrees with some former observations t of my
own upon the transverse vibrations of jets, as has been re
marked by Mr. Worthington %. Some interesting experiments
upon the vibrations of falling drops by Lenard § point also in
the same direction. On the other hand it deviates largely
 from the higher value, about 81, which Prof. Quincke thinks
the most probable. The deviation from 81 is certainly not
 due to contamination. It has been explained that great care
 was taken in this respect during the present experiments ; and
 in the jet method the surfaces are probably the purest attain-
 able. The method favoured
 measurement of large flat bubbles confined under the horizontal
 surface of a solid body. In default of experience I must leave
 it to others to judge whether a systematic error due to optical
 or other causes could enter here. Mr. Worthington contends
 that some of Quincke's deductions from his measurements
 require correction for curvature perpendicular to the meri-
 dianal plane. To this and other criticisms Prof. Quincke has
 replied // .
     Experimenters upon capillary tubes have generally been led
 to adopt the lower value, but here the interpretation involves an
 assumption that the angle of contact 6 is zero. What these
 measurements give in the first instance is T cos 6 ; so that if
 0=30°, or thereabouts, the higher value of T is the one really

indicated. This is the view adopted by Quincke, who in an im
portant series of observations* tias shown that the edge angle
between water and glass has frequently a considerable value de
pendent upon theimpurityof glass surfaces, even when carefully
cleaned by ordinary methods. But I confess that the argument
does not appear to me conclusive. The angles recorded are maxi
mum angles. If after a drop has been deposited some of the
liquid is drawn off, the angle may be diminished almost to
zero. Observations upon capillary heights correspond surely
to the latter condition of things, for no experimenter measures
the gradual rise of liquid in a dry tube. I am disposed to think
that the assumption 0 = 0 is legitimate, and thus that the lower
value of T is really supported by experiments of this class.
   Leaving now the results for pure surfaces, let us pass on to
those found for water contaminated with grease up to the point
where the camphor scrapings were judged to be " very nearly
dead." It must be remembered that the additions of oil were
discontinuous, and that the point could not always be hit with
precision. On any one day it is possible to set up a fairly
  recise standard of what one means by " very nearly dead ; "
  ut the standard is liable to vary in one's own mind, and is of
course impossible to communicate to another. Too much
importance therefore must not be ascribed to exact agreement
or the failure of it. On one day experiments were made by
varying the areas enclosed within the hoop. Thus, if the
motions were a little too lively, they could be deadened to the
required point by contraction of the area and consequent
concentration of grease. This procedure was not so con
venient as had been hoped, in consequence of the mechanical
disturbance attending a motion of the hoop. In all cases an
 observation, for the most part recorded in the previous table,
was made first upon a clean surface, so as to ensure that the
contamination was all of the kind intended. The results arc
collected in the annexed table :—

398           Lord Rayleigh on the Tension of Water
   The tension of the surface when the camphor movements
are just stopping may thus be reckoned at 53'0 C.G.S., or
about 72 per cent, of that of a clean surface. There is some
reason to infer that the tension is the same whatever kind of
grease be used. In the last experiment the sample of oil was
one of which it was necessary to take decidedly more than
usual (in the ratio of about 3 : 2) in order to stop the motions.
Thi3 was proved by the balance in the manner described in a
former paper. 1 have other grounds for thinking it probable
that the tension does not depend upon the kind of oil, and
hope to investigate the matter further by a more appropriate
method.
   On several occasions the effect of large additions of oil was
tried. The limit did not appear to be very definite ; for a
second and even a third drop gave a sensible indication. The
results were June 30, 38'8 ; July 1, 40-3 ; July 7, 41-0 ;
July 8, 41-7 ; July 26, 38-9 ; mean 40-1. They relate to
olive-oil ; and it is possiblo that the largeness of the quantity
required to approach the limit depends upon the heterogeneous
character of the substance.
    Two observations were made of the effect of additions of
oleate of soda to distilled water. When the limit seemed
nearlv attained final readings were taken with the results :
July"8, 25-3 ; July 11, 24-6 ; mean 25'0. It will be seen
that the tension is lowered very much further by soap than
 by oil.
    The principal results of the present experiments may be
 thus summarized. The tension of a water surface, reckoned
 in C.G.S. measure, is in the various cases :—
  Clean                                             740      100
  Greasy to the point where the camphor motions     53-0      72
     nearly cease
  Saturated with olive-oil                          41-0      54
  Saturated with oleate of soda                     25-0      34
    In the last column the tensions are exhibited as fractions
 of that of a clean surface.
                           Postscript, Sept. 19.
    It appeared probable that the tension of otherwise pure
water saturated with camphor would be the same as that of
greasy water upon which camphor fragments were just dead ;

               Surfaces, Clean and Contaminated.           399
and before the above paper was written I had already at
tempted to examine this point. The experiment, however,
did not succeed. The camphorated water had decidedly too
much tension (wave-number 14- 7 instead of 15-5), but on the
other hand the liquid was clearly not saturated, inasmuch as
fresh camphor scrapings were lively upon an expanded surface.
I have recently returned to the subject with water which has
stood in contact with excess of camphor for more than a
month.
    Sept. 15. Fresh clean water. Expanded 13-7, 13-7. Motes
still. Olive-oil added, 15-2, 15-2 ; camphor fragments mode
rately active. More oil, 15'3, 15-3; camphor nearly dead.
More oil, 15-5, 15-5 ; camphor dead. Fragments of camphor
and motes quite still.
    The saturated solution of camphor was now substituted.
Surface expanded ; 15-5, 15-5. Expanded, 15'5. This number
could not be reduced by any number of expansions of the
surface.
    It was observed that the surface was usually in motion, as
evidenced by an irregular drift of motes and camphor frag
ments. The latter had no individual motion, all neighbouring
particles moving together. The effect is probably due to
local evaporation of camphor and accompanying increase of
tension. Associated with this was a fluctuation backwards
and forwards of the number of waves, such as was never
observed with pure or simply greasy water.
    We are thus justified in the conclusion that saturated
solution of camphor has the same tension as is found for
greasy water when camphor fragments are just dead. When
the saturated solution was diluted with about an equal
volume of water, the wave-number was reduced to 14-7. In
these experiments the distance between the points was 9'20
centim., and the frequency was 42-12, so that the observations
are directly comparable with those in the example calculated
at length.
    The comparison of tensions for clean and camphorated
water may also be effected by the method of capillary
heights. Some observations by Mr. Gordon gave the follow
ing :—
         Clean water              7-94,    7 91,   7-92
         Water changed             7-92,   7-90,   7-90
         Saturated camphor         5'63,   5-68,   5'65
         Clean water               7-97,   7-90,   7'92
         Water changed             7-94,   7-96,   7-93
         Saturated camphor         5-62,   5-63,   5-66

400           Mr. S. U. Pickering on tJie Expansion
Thus, as a mean, capillary height for clean water is 7-93
centim., and for water saturated with camphor 5-64. The
ratio of these is '71.
   Observations by myself upon the same tube, but read in a
somewhat different manner, gave
   Clean water              8-04, 8'03, 804, 8'05.
   Water changed ... 8'02, 8-02.
   Camphorated water 5-77, 5-80, 5-79, 5-80, 5'80, 5-83.
As means we may take 8-03 centim. and 5'80 centim., giving
for the ratio '71, as before.
   The ratio of tensions thus found agrees remarkably well
with that deduced from the observations upon ripples, viz.
-72. It will be remembered that the latter might be expected
to be somewhat higher, as corresponding with a condition of
things where camphor fragments were nearly, but not quite
dead.
    October 8.—I take this opportunity of recording that a film
 of grease, insufficient to check the motion of camphor frag
ments, exercises a marked influence upon the reflexion of light
 from the surface of water in the neighbourhood of the polari
 zing angle. In the case of a clean surface and at the Brew-
sterian angle the reflexion of light polarized perpendicularly
to the plane of incidence appears to vanish in accordance with
the formula of Fresnel.
       XLIV. The Expansion of Witer and other Liquids.
     By Spencer Umfreville Pickering, M.A., F.R.S.'
                          [Plates VII. & VIII.]
MY investigation of various properties of sulphuric acid
          (Journ. Chem. Soc. 1890, pp. 65, 331, and Phil. Mag.
 1890, xxix. p. 427) showed that the curved figures representing
these properties, or the figures representing the rate of change
of these properties with change in percentage composition—
 the first differential coefficient, obtained by dividing the differ
 ence between the values obtained for two different solutions
 by the difference in their percentage strength—indicated the
 existence of more or less sudden changes of curvature at
 certain points corresponding to the composition of definite
hydrates. The method adopted in examining any curved
figure, to ascertain whether it was a single continuous curve
                      * Communicated by the Author.

                   of Water and other Liquids.                  401
or not, consisted in applying to the experimental points of
which it was composed a ruler bent by the hands, and ascer
taining whether the whole figure could be drawn in one
section, or whether it could only be drawn in several inde
pendent sections. The mere fact of the latter being the case
did not prove that there was any real change of curvature at
the point where two sections met, it simply suggested the
possibility of this being the case : this possibility was, how
ever, converted, in my opinion, into certainty, by finding that
each of these sections was a simple parabola (although a ruler
may be bent to form curves of a non-parabolic nature) ; by
finding that some seven or eight different curved figures of
totally different characters, and representing, either different
properties, or the same property under different conditions,
all gave indications of changes of curvature at the same points;
and by finding that these points certainly corresponded to
definite hydrates, wherever the solutions were strong enough
to permit of such evidence being obtainable.
   The culminating proof, however, of these changes of cur
vature, and of the hydrates which they represent, has been
obtained from the law of the freezing-points which I have
formulated, and which has reduced the proof of their existence
to a mere question of mathematics (Chem. Soc. Proc. 1889,
p. 149). So far as I have gone at present, every one of the
hydrates which the changes of curvature indicated has been
established beyond all reasonable doubt.
   Such results afford conclusive proof of the validity of the
method which I used to recognize these changes of curvature,
and justify me in publishing the results of a similar treatment
of the curves representing the density of water at different
temperatures, although the changes shown by them are much
more doubtful than in the majority of the cases previously
examined, and although there is little or no evidence from
any other source available for confirming their existence.
   In an examination of the effect of temperature on the densi
ties of sulphuric-acid solutions (J ourn. Chem. Soc. 1890, p. 120),
I determined the value of the water-contents of a 25 cubic
centim. bottle at every 2° between 6° and 38° (for the method
see ibid. p. 69). The results, which are given in Table I., when
plotted out (fig. 11, Plate VII., which, however, does not show
the whole of them), suggested the existence of some change of
curvature at about 18° : on differentiating the experimental
values, a differential (dw/dt in Table 1.) was obtained which also
suggested a change at this temperature, though a change of a
very doubtful nature : this differential is shown in fig. 1,
Plate VII., and appears to consist of two nearly straight

an omission which gives us the differential points given in
Table I. under the heading of "alternate determinations,"
and marked in the plate by crosses.
   A differentiation of the smoothed curve representing the
experiments gave the values quoted in Table II., and the
figure reproduced in fig. 2, Plate VII. This figure, like the
other, suggests a change of curvature at 18°, as well as another
change at about 10°.

404           Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Expansion
    My determinations were not nearly numerous enough to
 establish either of the changes here suggested, and were taken
 only as hinting the possibility of the existence of such ; but
 they showed the advisability of examining the more numerous
 results of other physicists in the same manner.
    In all cases except one the differentiation of these was per
formed on the experimental values themselves. The exception
 was that of Kopp's determinations, which, though thev may
approximate to the truth more nearly than in several other
cases, show such experimental errors in consecutive determina
tions as to be useless for purposes of direct differentiation.
 The smoothed curve representing the experiments was there
 fore differentiated in this case. In other cases also the
smoothed experimental curves were differentiated, but only
with the view of supplementing the evidence derived from a
direct differentiation.
    The differentiation of the several results requires some
manipulation in order to combine the various series which
several of the experimenters have made, and in order to get
fairly equal differences between the consecutive determina
tions. One or two determinations which were evidently
erroneous have been omitted. I have not considered it neces
sary to reproduce here the voluminous tables containing these
results.
   It is scarcely necessary to point out that only the experi
mental values themselves were taken, and that values calcu
lated from equations purporting to represent them would be
of no use for such purposes as the present.
   Some of the results refer to volumes, others to weights :
in some water at 0° is taken as unity, in others water at 4°:
in some, again, the weights or volumes are uncorrected for
the expansion of the glass. None of these differences will
affect the question at issue—the existence or position of sudden
changes of curvature—they will only affect (and that to a
very small extent) the inclination, and, possibly, the curvature
(if the coefficient of expansion of glass is represented by a
curve instead of a straight line as is generally assumed) of the
differential. Where densities are taken, the sign of the dif
ferential will be the opposite of what it is where volumes are
taken : in the Plates I have represented them so that this dif
ference shall not interfere with a comparison of the various
figures.
   It must he remembered that the figures here given illustrate

                  of Water and other Liquids.               405
the results only imperfectly. In examining determinations in
the manner here described many different scales must be
employed ; and the scales must be altered to suit the accuracy
of the determinations of different experimenters, and of the
same experimenter when working at different temperatures.
   The illustrations which I give of the results are confined
almost exclusively to the differentials.
   The following details may be noted as to the various
results obtained.
   Pierre's values (Ann. Chim. Phys. xv. p. 325) exhibit great
regularity up to 20° ; they are very numerous, and extend
down to - 13°. The direct differential up to 20°, and that from
the smoothed experimental curve from 20° to 95° (Table 111.),
is shown in fig. 3, Plate VII. The direct differential for these
higher temperatures is given on a less open scale in fig. 12,
Plate VIII. The irregularity which suggests two changes at
0° and — 2°-5 respectively is so peculiar that it must be
regarded with considerable distrust : but some one change,
however, somewhere about this temperature seems certain,
since the results from -13° to 10° cannot be represented by
any one line or curve. The change at about 18° is also
doubtful, since the curve from 50° to 18° could be extended
down to 10°(but not lower) with but little increase in the
apparent experimental error.
   Despretz (Ann. Chim. Phys. lxx. p. 1) made four series of
determinations between —10° and 17°. That one which gives
the most regular results indicates a possible change at about
10° (see fig. 4) ; and the mean values which he deduced from
the four series gives a similar indication, though at a some
what higher temperature (fig. 5). There appears to be some
irregularity below 0°, but the nature of the figure here is
uncertain. One series of determinations extending to 100°
which he made by another method gave no certain indications
of any change at higher temperatures, and are not sufficiently
numerous to show any changes which might exist at lower
temperatures. They have not been reproduced here.
   The differential obtained from the smoothed curve repre
senting Kopp's results (Pogg. Ann. lxxii. p. 45) is shown in
fig. 6. Tables III. and IV. contain the numerical values.
They suggest a change at about 60° and 10°.

   Rosetti's results (Pogg. Ann. Erg.-Bd. v. p. 268) give a
differential which suggests a change at about 60° and another
at 18° (fig. 7) ; but the determinations at the higher tempe
ratures are not very numerous, and those from 3° to -6°

408           Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Expansion
show irregularities too great to permit of any satisfactory
conclusions being drawn from them.
   Matthiessen's determinations (Pogg. Ann. cxxviii. p. 527,
and fig. 8) indicate a change at about 20°, but none at
50°-60°: they would not be sufficiently numerous to show
any which existed at temperatures below 20°. I have repre
sented a portion of the experimental curve itself in fig. 12 :
the close similarity with my own as regards the change near
20° will be noticed, though the curves, referring as they do to
weights and volumes respectively, differ as to their position.
Rosetti's experimental curve is of a precisely similar nature.
   Jolly's values (Sitzungsber. d. Akad. zu Munchen, 1864, (i)
p. 141; give a differential represented by fig. 9. They indi
cate a change at about 50°, but they would not be sufficiently
numerous to show any changes at lower temperatures. Jolly
quotes some results obtained by Henrici, but they are not
sufficiently numerous for the present purposes.
   Hagen's determinations (Abhaiull. d. k. Akad. d. Wissen-
schaft. z. Berlin, 1855; Math. Abhandl. i.) are very numerous,
and for the purposes of direct differentiation must be arranged
in two series. They indicate changes at 50°, 20°, and 10°,
but the exact form of the figure between 20° and 10° is
doubtful : the changes at these two temperatures depend on
the fact of the curves above and below them ceasing to be
applicable below and above the two temperatures respectively.
The points given by the second series into which his results
were divided have not been inserted here owing to lack of
room : they do not extend above 34°. Hagen's values refer
to actual weights ; they have been multiplied by ^ so as to
reduce them to about the same relative magnitude as those
results which are expressed as volumes or densities.
   None of these results, if taken separately, would be sufficient
to prove the changes which they indicate, but when taken
together they certainly afford sufficient evidence for the asser
tion that these changes are highly probable. The evidence
may be summarized as follows :—

     -2°-5
                                  peratures.
   Such concordance in the results of different observers can

                   of Water and other Liquids.                409
scarcely be accidental. The cases in which the individual
results fail to show any one of the above changes are chiefly
those where the results are deficient in number or accuracy.
The most marked exceptions to this statement being the
absence of indications of any change at 50°-60°, by De9pretz's
or Matthiessen's results, and the absence of indications of
change at 10° by Rosetti's results.
   It is true that there is some discrepancy as to the nature of
the first differential lines in some cases according to the dif
ferent observers ; but a very small difference, or a constant
source of error, such as might occur in taking the temperature,
would account for this ; the important point is the position of
the changes.
   The existence of more or less sudden alterations in the rate
at which density varies with temperature must, I think, from
reasons other than experimental ones be regarded as not
improbable. It can scarcely be doubted that liquids are
composed of various partially dissociated aggregates of their
fundamental molecules, and the instability of such complicated
bodies would, no doubt, be so great that a rise of a few degrees
would be sufficient to exterminate some particular one of
them, and such extermination would result in the alteration in
the rate at which temperature would affect the density. The
existence of such changes, moreover, is in harmony with that
of similar changes in the curves representing the effect of
temperature on the heat of dissolution of weak salt-solutions
(Trans. Chem. Soc. 1887, p. 290).
    Further confirmation of the change at 50°-60° has been
found in some recent work of Tschernay          Russ. Chem. Soc.
1880, pp. 430 and 486). This physicist has examined the
expansion of solutions of six different nitrates and nine chlo
rides, and finds that in all cases a change occurs at about 50°,
necessitating the use of different equations to represent the
determinations above and below that temperature*. I had at
first attributed this change to some peculiarity in the expan
sion of glass, since it is well known that at about 50° glass
begins to experience some change which prevents it reverting
at once to its original volume on cooling ; but I now think
that this explanation cannot be held, for most of the other
liquids which I have examined do not exhibit any change at
this temperature, and those which do so exhibit a change of a
very different magnitude from that exhibited by water. It may
also be pointed out that definite changes in the rate of expan-
   * I have not examined Tschernay's data to see whether they give
evidence of any changes besides that at 50'.

410           Mr. S. U, Pickering on the Expansion
sion of a solid must imply sudden changes in its constitution,
just as they do in the case of a liquid ; and in the case of a
solid, where the molecules are practically fixed, such changes
present far greater difficulties than in the case of liquids,
where the mobility of the particles is great, and where we
have a state particularly favourable for dissociation.
    An examination of the densities of some other liquids has
added confirmation to my conclusions respecting water. The
changes which they exhibit are placed at various temperatures,
showing that they cannot be attributed to constant errors in
the instruments used, and some of them are moreover of a
 much more pronounced character than those in the case of
water.
    Pierre's memoir above cited gives the results obtained with
eleven other liquids ; these I have differentiated directly, and
the differentials are plotted out in Plate VIII. They are
arranged roughly according to the magnitude of the rate of
change : the scale adopted for dv/dt, it must be specially
noted, is only one-fifth of that used in Plate VII.
    With ethyl chloride the results are not very regular : they
appear to form a continuous straight line throughout.
    With methyl bromide they form a slight curve continuous
throughout, but there are not sufficient points to admit of any
 definite conclusions being drawn from them.
    In the case of ether we get two straight lines meeting at
 about 14°, and showing the existence of a change at that
 temperature, which is further emphasized by the very non-
 conformable point existing there (see Trans. Chem. Soc. 1890,
 p. 67). There seems to be another change at -10°, but the
 data are insufficient to prove it.
    With ethyl formate the results are represented by a straight
line from 60° to —21°, where there seems to be a change ;
 but it is uncertain in its character.
    Ethyl bromide gives two straight lines showing a change
at about 39°.
    With methyl acetate we get a continuous and very slight
 curve ; but it might well be a straight line from 65° to about
 - 10°, followed by a different line down to -34°.
    Methyl iodide gives two straight lines showing a change at
 10°. The points are not in very good agreement with the
 upper of these two lines, but if we take the means between
 consecutive points the agreement is perfect.
    Methyl alcohol gives three straight lines with changes at
44° and 16°.

                    of Water and other Liquids.                  411
    With ethyl iodide we get a perfectly continuous straight
line throughout.
    Carbon disulphide gives a fairly straight line from -20°
up to 45° ; at this last point some irregularity begins to show
itself, and we get two points at A and B which are noncon-
formable to an extraordinary extent. The difference at B
would correspond to an error of some 3°, and though it is
difficult to imagine how such an error could occur (as it would
have to exist in all the determinations above 51 ), it is still
more difficult to imagine that the results are true.
    Ethyl alcohol gives three straight lines with changes at 53°
and 19°, noticeable as being nearly coincident with two of
those shown by water.
    Fig. 12 gives Pierre's results with water, the portion below
 15° being copied from fig. 3, Plate VII. The character of
 this curve and the lowness of its position is remarkable by
 the side of the other curves.
    The boiling-points of the various liquids are inserted in the
 Plate (b.-p.), but they do not seem to correspond to any sudden
 changes when the substance still remains liquid.
    Although we cannot attribute very much weight to the
 results obtained with these volatile liquids, the general cha
 racter of all the curves is in favour of the view that the first
 differential is a series of straight or nearly straight lines, and
 that consequently the density, as a function of temperature,
 is represented by a series of parabolic curves of the second
 order. Methyl bromide and acetate are the only doubtful
 exceptions amongst the non-aqueous liquids examined ; and
 in the diagrams for water the portion between 18° and 55° is
 the only one which appears to be uniformly curved.
     MendeleefFs work on the expansion of alcoholic solutions,
 Tschernay's on that of salt-solutions, and my own determina
 tions with sulphuric-acid solutions given above (Trans. Chem.
  Soc. 1890, p. 119), may also be cited as further proof of the
  rectilineal character of the first differential in such cases.
     That the arguments brought forward in this communication
  in favour of the existence of more or less sudden changes in
  the rate of alteration of the density with temperature can be
  regarded as absolute proof cannot for a moment be maintained ;
  nor must it be supposed that the evidence here is in any
  respect on the same footing with that on which the conclu
  sions in my previous communications depend. In the present
  case the various changes depend on differences as small as
 any in the most doubtful cases in former investigations, and
 the conclusions drawn from them must always be doubtful.
  The evidence derived from the data given by the different

412      Prof. Masson on the Boiling-Points, Molecular
physicists are, moreover, not in absolute agreement, though it
would be unreasonable to look for greater concordance in such
a difficult case. But the weakness of the evidence here in
comparison with that in the previous work lies in the fact that
we are here dealing with only one property, instead of with
the accumulation of confirmatory evidence from wholly inde
pendent sources. For this reason only we must be satisfied
with regarding the results more as important suggestions than
as definite proof.
XLV. On the Relation between the Boiling-Points, Molecular
    Volumes, and Chemical Characters of Liquids. By Orme
   Masson, M.A., D.Sc, Professor of Chemistry in the Uni
   versity of Melbourne*.
IN one of his papers on the Periodic Law (Phil. Mag. 1885,
      p. 259) Professor Carnelley pointed out several relations
between the alkyl compounds of the elements with regard to
the variation of boiling-point 'and of specific gravity. If,
 instead of considering the specific gravities themselves, we
 calculate from them the molecular volumes of, say, the ethyl
compounds of the various elements and plot a curve with
these values as ordinates and the atomic weights of the
 elements in question as abscissae, the manner in which they
 vary from one compound to another and from one period to
 another may be compared with the variation of the boiling-
 points, similarly plotted ; and, in spite of the broken character
 of the curves, due to want of data and the nonformation of
 ethides by many of the elements, the general resemblance be
 tween the alteration of molecular volume and the alteration
 of boiling-point is rendered very striking. The molecular
 volumes are, however, not really comparable, being calculated
 from densities at ordinary temperatures ; and they cannot
 therefore serve for the study of whatever exact relation may
 exist between boiling-points and molecular volumes. For
 this purpose densities at the boiling-points are required, and
 these are known in the case of only five of the twenty or more
 known ethides (Clarke's Table of Specific Gravity).
    Intending ultimately to complete as far as possible the study
 of the molecular volumes of these'substances at their boiling-
 points under atmospheric pressure, I commenced recently
 with the haloid compounds of ethyl, using Ramsay's method,
 slightly modified ; and certain considerations have been sug
 gested by a comparison of these first results with the work of
                   * Communicated by the Author.

          Volumes, and Chemical Characters of Liquids.        413
other observers, which I believe are of sufficient interest to
warrant me in discussing them now. It is not claimed that
the law which will be put forward is at all complete or final
in form ; but the evidence certainly shows that it is at least
a first approximation to an exact law. Before proceeding
further, I should state that I find that the relation in question
has already been to a certain extent noticed by J. A.
Groshans, who cited one or two instances of it in a paper
published four years ago and discussed these instances in the
light of his " Law of Density Numbers " ( Berichte, xix. p. 974).
So far as I am aware, it has not otherwise been noticed.
   To save circumlocution, I shall use the phrase compounds
of the same group to signify compounds of the same Hydro
carbon radical with elements of the same natural group.
Thus ethyl fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide form one
group ; the oxide, sulphide, selenide, and telluride form
another ; ethylene halides a third ; and chloroform and bromo-
form belong to a fourth. The law may then be stated as
follows:- The ratio of the molecular volume at the boiling-
point to the temperature of ebullition reckoned from absolute
zero is a constant quantity for all compounds of the same
group. More fully stated it amounts to this :—
   If liquid compounds of the same group be compared at
temperatures at which their vapour-pressures are equal, the
voltimes occupied by unit weights are inversely proportional to
the molecular weights and directly proportional to the absolute
temperature; or
                 -DtX^T = T=aC°nstant ^ .            .  .   .  O)
for each group, vapour-pressure being equal. In this formula
M = molecular weight, DT = density of the liquid .at T°, T =
absolute temperature of ebullition, and Vt= molecular volume
at T°. It will be shown that, so far as the law can be at
present tested, the deviations are small but real.
    This may be compared with the following, which is but a
 special statement of two familiar laws of much wider applica
 tion :—If vapours of the same group [or any vapours] be
 compared at different temperatures but equal pressure, the
 volumes occupied by unit weights are inversely proportional
 to the molecular weights and directly proportional to the
 absolute temperatures : or
                    M       vt             , .
                  d xy = tjt = a constant (c'),       ...      (2)

vapour-pressure being equal. Here also the deviations are
small but real.
   If these two expressions be taken together, we get the
following rider to the first law :—
    Different compounds of the same group are expanded equally
in changing from liquid at the boiling-point to vapour at the
boiling-point ; for

   If we neglect deviations from normal vapour-density, and
if all measurements be expressed in grammes and cubic centi
metres, the actual value of v? for any vapour at atmospheric
pressure is —^k—-        Hence c'=81-7766, and
and this ratio is of constant value in each group of com
pounds. It may be called the coefficient of ebullition expan
sion. (Compare J. A. Groshans, Phil. Mag. 1885, xx. p. 197.)
   The chief evidence in support of the law is afforded by the
compounds of the hydrocarbon radicals with the halogens.
The data they afford are brought together in Table I., where
they are divided into eleven groups according to the con
stitution of the radical. It will be seen that the examples are
of various kinds, monohalides of different homologous series,
both saturated and unsaturated, being represented, and also
dihalides and trihalides. The molecular volumes are calcu
lated from the densities recorded by various observers, but as
far as possible the same observer has been quoted for the com
pounds of the same group, so as to ensure comparable results
within that group.
   The different columns of Table I. give (1) the name of the
compound, (2) its formula, (3) the molecular weight, M, (4)
the liquid density, D<r, at the boiling-point under atmospheric
pressure, (5) the observer's name, (6) the found molecular
volume, VT, (7) the boiling-point on the absolute scale, T, (8)

the value of the ratio       and (9) the number 81-7766 y,
which is, as already explained, the measure of what may be
called the ebullition expansion.

   The figures in the last two columns of the foregoing Table
afford, I think it may be claimed, sufficient proof of the truth
of the law under discussion, so far as the elements of the
seventh natural group are concerned. They show that
the different halides of the same radical give an almost
                     V
constant value for »- , the deviation from perfect constancy
in only two cases amounting to 2 per cent, of the total
value. But an inspection of the figures also proves, I think,
that the deviations, such as they are, are real ; for in every
case but one the bromide has the lowest value, and in every
case but two the iodide has a value intermediate between those
of the chloride and the bromide. If we assume, as seems fair,
that the fluoride possesses the highest value in each group,
as it does among the phenyl compounds, then the magnitude
of ^ appears to undergo a small periodic variation within the
group, falling from RF to RBr and rising again at RI to
almost the value of RC1.
   Other points are suggested ; but before entering into a dis
cussion of these, it will be best to bring forward the evidence
which, as it appears to me, justifies the extension of the law
beyond the elements of the seventh group. Unfortunately
direct experimental evidence is not as yet available ; for
though the densities of some of the alkyl oxides and nitrides
at their boiling-points have been recorded, there is a total
absence of data with regard to the sulphides, phosphides, &c.
The boiling-points of many of these compounds are known,
however ; and a fair approximation to their molecular volumes
at the boiling-point can be almost certainly arrived at by
making use of the average atomic-volume values of Kopp or
Thorpe. Those here employed are C = ll, H=5-5, S = 22-6,
P=25-3, As =26-3, Sb=2fc-6, Si = 30-3, Sn=40'8 (Thorpe,
Trans. Chem. Soc. xxxvii. p. 393).
   Table II. gives the results of such calculation. It will be
seen that, if the method may be trusted at all, proof is afforded
                                                      y
of the close approximation to a constant value for         in the
compounds of the sixth, fifth, and fourth groups of elements.
 It does not, of course, enable us to compare the extent of the
 deviations from absolute constancy with that exhibited by the
 compounds of the seventh group. The successive columns of
 Table II. give (1) the formula of the compound, (2) the mole

    The atomic volumes of selenium and tellurium are not even
 approximately known. Ethyl selenide boils at 108° C, and
 the telluride at 98° C. If these compounds follow the rule,
 therefore, tellurium must have a smaller atomic volume than
                                    V
 selenium. If a value for              be assumed slightly smaller than
 that obtained by direct experiment with the oxide, viz. -34
 instead of -3447, we get VT= 129-5 for (C2H2)2Se and
 VT= 126-1 for (C2H8)2Te ; whence, if CjH4=49-5, Se=30-5,
 and Te = 27-1, as approximate values.

   To revert to Table I., it may be pointed out that the varia-
                    V
tion in value of       is fairly constant as we pass from the
halide of one alkyl radical to that of its next homologue.
This is exemplified in Table III., where the experimental
figures for the chlorides and iodides of the first four normal
fatty radicals are compared with consecutive multiples of the
figure -041.

   In this table it is intended merely to call attention to the
comparative regularity of the increase with each successive
addition of CHS to the radical, so far as can be judged from
the examples quoted. The evidence is at present insufficient
to warrant speculation on this point.
   There is no doubt whatever that the law, at all events in its
most obvious form, cannot be extended beyond the range of

mental value for Vr, the third gives his value for T, and the

   It is evident from these figures that the apparently simple
relation which obtains among the compounds of hydrocarbon
radicals with elements of the same group does not extend to
compounds of elements of one group with elements of another
group. In some cases the ratio has nearly the same value in
similar compounds, e. g. SOC1S and S2Clj, or POC13, POBrCl,,
and VOC18 ; but in others there is a large variation, as in the
simple halogen compounds of the phosphorus group. But the
law, if fully understood, might be found to explain and em
brace these cases.
   It appears, then, from a comparison of Table IV. with
Tables I. and II., that similarity of chemical constitution is
                                                            y
not the only condition required for equality of the ratio ~.
Some clue may be obtained to the more precise nature of the
relation by an examination of the very interesting work on
benzene and its monohalogen derivatives published last year
by Professor Sydney Young (Trans. Chem. Soc. lv. p. 486).

420       Prof. Masson on the Boiling-points, Molecular
I may perhaps be allowed to briefly recapitulate his chief
results, in so far as they affect this question.
    (1) The critical pressures of C6H„F, C6H6C1, C6HsBr,
and C6H8I are equal, or very nearly so. Equal pressures are
therefore corresponding pressures. But CeH6 has a different
critical pressure.
    (2) Compared at equal pressures, from 5 millim. up to the
critical point, the absolute boiling-temperatures of the four
halogen derivatives (but not of benzene) bear constant ratios to
one another.
   (3) At all equal pressures the molecular volumes at boiling-
points of the four halogen derivatives also bear constant ratios
to one another.
    Young gives the values of VT and T for each compound at
various pressures, and also the constant ratio numbers appli
cable to any pressure for comparison of the fluoride with the
chloride &c. in respect to each of these variables.
    In Table V. the second column gives Young's boiling-
temperature ratios, the third gives his molecular volume-ratios,
and in the last are the values of the ratios      which I have cal
culated from them.      They are good for any equal pressure.

    The figures in the last column prove (1) that the approxi-
mate equality of the ratio -^r exhibited by these four compounds
at a pressure of 760 millim. holds good at other pressures ;
 (2) that the deviations from perfect equality, such as they
are, characterize all pressures alike, at all events up to the
limits actually reached in Young's experiments.

           Volumes, and Chemical Characters of Liquids.      421
   This being the case with one of the groups of compounds
quoted in Table I., it seems only fair to conclude from the
perfect analogy of the others at atmospheric pressure, that the
same conclusions might be drawn in their cases also, were
experimental data available. Hence, in all probability,
                          y
equality of the ratio 7^ in different compounds at equal
pressure depends on a combination of the following :—
   (1) Similarity of chemical constitution, of a kind akin to
that concerned in isomorphism ; (2) equality of critical
pressure ; and implies also (3) constancy of the ratios V : V
and T : T' at all equal pressures. It is possible that the slight
                                      V
deviations from perfect equality of ^ , to which attention has
been directed, are connected with slight differences of critical
pressure.
   Young's work further enables us to study the manner in
         V
which Tjrfor one and the same liquid varies with variation of
pressure. Very interesting curves are obtained by plotting
the ratios y -^Tas ordinatesand P, Px, or T as abscissae. In the
case of fluorbenzene the first curve shows a descent which is
very rapid at first, then gradually slows off till a minimum is
reached at about 7000 millim., then a slow but steadily in
creasing rise, which becomes rapid as the critical point is
approached. The actual extreme values are '3559 at 5 millim.,
-2631 at 7000 millim. (minimum), and -4164 at 33912 millim.
 (critical). The value at 760 millim., already given, is -2837.
The curves for the chloride, bromide, and iodide are perfectly
similar as far as they go. Those plotted with VT measured as
 abscissas are nearly parabolic in form.
    Obviously it would be of considerable interest if we were
 enabled to compare the curves of the halogen compounds of
different radicals with one another and these with the curves
for their compounds with oxygen, nitrogen, and elements of
other natural groups. We should, then, in all probability
attain to a fuller understanding of the relations between
boiling-point, molecular volume, and chemical character.

    Postscript.—It has been suggested to me by Mr. E. F. J.
 Love, Lecturer in Natural Philosophy in this University, that
 the relation discussed in the foregoing Paper, when taken

 422     Boiling-points and Molecular Volumes of Liquids.
 together with certain of Ramsay and Young's results (Phil.
 Mag. 1885 and 1886), leads to the following conclusion :—
    If different compounds of the same group be compared when
 boiling at equal pressure, the latent heats of vaporization are
 inversely proportional to the molecular weights and directly
 proportional to the absolute temperatures of ebullition : or
 —m— = a constant for each group, pressure being equal.
    This may be demonstrated in the following manner, starting
 with the thermodynamic formula
                            L       T dp
                        Sj-S, ~ J-«fii '
 where S! and S2 represent the specific volumes of the same
 substance at the boiling-point in the gaseous and liquid con
 ditions respectively.
    Ramsay and Young have shown that the value of T. ^
 is a constant for closely allied substances such as the halides
 of ethyl and phenyl, i. e. for different members of the same
 group; whence also (if we distinguish quantities belonging to
 two such compounds by dashes)

liquid and gaseous, therefore follow the same law as regards
their relation to temperature.

   There are very few actual determinations of latent heat by
which this conclusion can be tested. In the cases, however,
of methyl chloride and iodide and ethyl chloride and iodide,
the values found at atmospheric boiling-points agree fairly
well with the theory. But it should be remembered that such
determinations are not to be relied on as more than near
approximations to the truth (compare Ramsay and Young,

 XLV1. On the Relation between the Boiling-points, Molecular
    Volumes, and Chemical Characters of Liquids. By Sydney
    Young, D.Sc, Professor of Chemistry, University College,
   Bristol f.
 THE appearance of the preceding very interesting paper
        under the above title by Professor Masson has induced
 me to bring forward the following considerations at a some
 what earlier period and in a probably less complete state than
 I had originally intended.
    In bis dissertation ' On the Continuity of the Gaseous and
 Liquid States' Van der Waals has proposed the following
 generalizations as applicable to all substances :—" If two
 substances be compared at absolute temperatures which are
 proportional to their absolute critical temperatures, their
vapour-pressures will be proportional to the critical pressures,
 and their specific volumes (both of liquid and saturated
vapour) will be proportional to their critical volumes."
    Assuming the truth of these relations, we may calculate the
   * The figures in this column are taken from Ramsay and Young's
paper (loc. cit.), where the authorities are not given ; except that for
methyl chloride, which is quoted from J. Chappuis (Uhem. Soe. Abstr.,
1887, p. 627).
   t Communicated by the Author.

424        Prof. Young on the Boiling-points, Molecular
ratio of the specific or molecular volumes of two substances
at " corresponding " pressures if we know their critical tem
peratures and pressures and their boiling-points under low
pressures, provided, as is usually the case, the saturated
vapours at these low pressures behave as normal gases.
    For the molecular volume of the saturated vapour of any
substance under such conditions will be given by the equation
                       _0 „a     T       760
                   v= 22-32 x        x —>
                                2io       p
where T is the boiling-point on the absolute scale of tempera
ture, and p is the pressure. So also the molecular volume of
the saturated vapour of any other substance at the " corre
sponding " pressure pi =
                       f ooqo       r       760
The ratio of the molecular volumes of the saturated vapours
will therefore be
                           v__T
                           t/ ~T' * p
 The ratio of the molecular critical volumes will be the same ;
 and as the critical volumes apply equally to the gaseous and
 liquid states, the ratio of the molecular volumes of the liquids
 at corresponding pressures will also be given by the equation
                            V__ T _p'
                            V'~lv X p'
 In the special case of the haloid derivatives of benzene, the
 critical pressures of which are equal, the equation becomes
                                 _ T _
                              y' - rjv 5
 and this relation Prof. Masson has shown to apply not only
 to this group of compounds, but also to other groups of haloid
  compounds of hydrocarbon radicals.
     So far the experimental results extend only to the liquid
  state, but I hope to be able to determine the densities of the
  saturated vapours of the benzene derivatives within sufficiently
  wide limits to test the accuracy of the relation for the gaseons
  state also.
     When the critical pressures of two substances are not the
                                                   » V T t/
  same it would seem improbable that the relation = ^ = — x -
                                                  v V 1/ "
  would really hold good ; for it is quite certain that for su

          Volumes, and Chemical Characters of Liquids.              '425
bodies, when the absolute temperatures are proportional to
the absolute critical temperatures, the vapour-pressures are
(at any rate in the cases examined) not proportional to the
critical pressures. In the case of benzene and fluorbenzene,
for instance, between about 0° C. and the critical points the
ratios of the vapour-pressures at " corresponding " tempera
tures, instead of being constant, vary from 1-340 to 1/073.
   I have, however, shown (Trans. Chem. Soc. 1889, lv. p. 514)
that at " corresponding " pressures the ratio of the molecular
volumes of benzene and fluorbenzene remain approximately
constant within wide limits ; and this is also the case, though
the deviations are greater, with the liquids (methyl, ethyl,
and propyl alcohol and ethyl ether) examined by Professor
Ramsay and myself, when compared either with fluorbenzene
or among themselves. It is therefore possible to obtain an
approximate value for the ratio of the molecular volumes of
such substances at " corresponding " pressures and to compare
these values with those given by the equation

lated are given below :—

   The number of comparisons is hardly great enough to allow
of very certain generalizations ; but it may be pointed out
that in three out of the four cases where there is the closest
concordance between the values calculated by the two methods,
we have to do with bodies which, as far as constitution is
concerned, are closely related. Of the seven remaining com
parisons only two are between compounds which are so related,
and in both cases methyl alcohol is one of the compounds.
The want of concordance exhibited by methyl alcohol when
compared with the other alcohols of the same series, both in
this case and in many of its properties, may perhaps be due to
the preponderating influence of the hydroxyl as against the
alkyl group.
   The following conclusions may perhaps be tentatively drawn
from the foregoing data :—
   1. When the critical pressures of two closely related sub
stances are equal, the ratio of their molecular volumes in the
liquid state (and probably also in that of saturated vapour) at
their boiling-points under any equal pressures is equal to the
ratio of their boiling-points measured on the absolute scale of
temperature, and therefore also to the ratio of their absolute
critical temperatures.
   2. When the critical pressures of two nearly related sub
stances are unequal, their molecular volumes at their boiling-
points under " corresponding " pressures are (approximately)

boiling-point under 760 millim. pressure and the others at " corresponding "
pressures.

  Measurement of Astigmatism and other Ocular Defects.      427
directly proportional to their absolute critical temperatures
and inversely proportional to their critical pressures.
   3. When the critical pressures of two dissimilar substances
are unequal, the relation between their molecular volumes on
the one hand and their critical temperatures on the other is,
as a rule, not so simple as in the previous case.
 XLVII. On the Measurement of Astigmatism and some other
           Ocular Defects. By John Bridge, M.A*
1. TN seeking for the best way of determining defects of the
    -L eye with respect to refraction, especially hypermetro-
pia combined with astigmatism, I was led, in 1874, to adopt a
method which, though simple, seems practically sufficient for all
ordinary cases. I aimed chiefly at satisfying the conditions :—
   (1) That change of divergence in the pencils issuing from
points in the object viewed should be obtained without change
in the apparent magnitude of the object.
    (2) That equal changes of divergence (or convergence)
should be represented by equal displacements on a scale.
   (3) That the different parts of the object presented should
without change in their relative positions in the field of view
be seen by pencils in gradually different states of divergence,
so that different degrees of clearness should be offered simul
taneously and side by side.
   Moreover, the arrangement must be such that when an
observation is repeated, any prejudice which the observer
might form from one observation should not be allowed to
affect the next.

      G is an inclined plane on which is placed the object to be
  viewed. The object which I usually prefer is a series of
  equal black circular spots with narrow white intervals. The
  middle interval has a mark by which it may be recognized,
  and it is helpful that every 10 divisions of the scale should
  correspond to exactly one spot or exactly two. Being looked
. at very obliquely, the spots appear as very flat ellipses with
  minor axes about a fifth of their major axes, separated at the
  extremities of their minor axes by very narrow white spaces.
      '6. Let P be a point in the object at distance u from the
  lens, Q the image of P, and let FQ = v. Then
                        11,                1    f-u
                                ! whfinrtA — = -—— .
                v—f     u f                v     f
   Consequently the divergence of the refracted pencil as it
   passes F and enters the eye is indicated by the number on the
   scale under the luminous point.         For, an inch being
  divisions, (f-u) inches is -j*— (/- u) or               divisions.
   Each division represents an amount of divergence equal to
   that of a pencil whose vertex is 1000 inches distant.
      Applying this to the object on the inclined plane G when
   its position is that shown in the figure, we see that its points
   are viewed by means of converging pencils varying in con
   vergence from 0 to 180 units of the scale.
      4. The apparent magnitude of the object is unaltered by
   the motion of the table, the eye being supposed at F. For
   the rays which go through that point from two given
   points of the object are before incidence parallel to the axis,
   and strike the lens at points which are not changed by
   the motion of the table. Hence we see that the arrangement
   enables us to offer to the eye an object which gives on the
   retina an image of constant size and shape, but which makes,
   in its different parts and in its movement, a continuously
   changing demand on the power of accommodation.
       5. The range of convergence which can be offered to the
    eye is from O to B, and that of divergence from O to C. It

            Astigmatism and sotne other Ocular Defects.        429
is often necessary to increase the latter. This is done by in
serting at F the lens L. If f be the focal length of this
lens,
Thus we see that the insertion of the lens has no other effect
                                                                f*
than to remove the zero of divergence outwards by a distance ^.7,
which in units of the scale is ^^?^*.
when using the lens we must increase by 240 every number
read from the scale, but, in doing so, we must recollect that
the numbers from O to B are negative-]
   It may be noted here that the power of any lens is the
displacement which its introduction at F causes on the scale.
   6. Suppose that we wish to ascertain the punctum remotum,
that is the least divergence suitable for the eye (in hyperme-
tropia, the greatest convergence). Begin with the table at
its farthest, and move it up slowly. Clearness at last appears
at the lower part of the object, that is, the narrow white interval
between two consecutive ellipses ceases to encroach on them.
This clearness gradually includes more and more of the object,
and the observer meanwhile has his attention occupied in
noticing the progress of its upper limit. Let him arrest the
motion when the upper limit of clearness arrives at the middle.
The scale now shows the divergence corresponding to the
punctum remotum.
    If the nearest point, or greatest useful divergence, has to be
observed, we may proceed in the same way but beginning at
the nearer end. For most eyes it will be necessary to insert
the lens L, and for some even a lens of shorter focal length.
    The difference between the two numbers read from the scale
gives the accommodating power.
    7. The object observed so far has been virtually a series of
horizontal lines, so that what has been determined as the least
divergence is the least divergence suitable for a vertical section
of the eye. Now let the inclined plane be laid on its side, the
major axes of the ellipses will become vertical, and the white
 intervals may be called vertical lines.
    On determining afresh the least divergence it will often be
   * Each reading h of the scale should receive the small correction
 - dAa-r-1000, Q being distance of eye from F, in inches.

430     Measurement of Astigmatism and other Ocular Defects.
found to differ from that previously obtained, being usually
less. The difference between the two is the amount of astig
matism of the eye.
    In what precedes I have supposed the principal meridians
of the eye to be horizontal and vertical. The modifications
required by their deviation from these directions are suffi
ciently obvious. The amount of the deviation may be found
by means of a series of concentric circles with intervals of
about the same breadth, say '025 inch, viewed directly.
When this object is placed on the table and moved up slowly,
a band of clearness at last appears along a nearly horizontal
diameter. This diameter shows one meridian, the other is
shown by the tangent at the middle of any of the clear seg
ments, and these are the directions in which the lines above
called horizontal and vertical are supposed to lie.
    8. As an example illustrating the use of the apparatus, 1
will take an actual case, remarking that each result given is
the mean of several observations.
    L, R, v, h, stand for left eye, right eye, vertical lines, hori
zontal lines.
   Referring to the position, in the scale, of the punctum remotum,
I found Lw=-200, LA=-115, Rt'=-216, RA=-144.
These observations show that the eyes are both greatly affected
by hypermetropia and astigmatism, for in a perfect eye all
these numbers are equal and do not differ much from 0*.
    LA - Li' = 85 is the astigmatism of the left eve; and
B.h — Rv = 7 2, that of the right.
    9. To remedy these defects I had glasses ground, of the same
form for both eyes. They were intended to have a spherical
convex front surface, of power t 212, and a concave cylindrical
back surface with axis horizontal, of power 62.
    The eyes while using these glasses were tested, and gave
the following results: —
                Lt< = 14, LA =37, Ry=15, RA=14.
These show that the glasses very nearly destroy the astig
matism of the right eye and leave 23 of astigmatism in the
left, which was in several respects an inferior instrument.
Also by comparing these numbers with those given above we
may deduce the forms of the lenses. Thus :— Lv is increased
   * The meridians of greatest and least curvature were not exactly
horizontal and vertical, hut the difference was small enough to be
neglected.
   f B_v this I mean the power of a lens having the surface named on one
side and a plane surface on the other.

from -200 to +14, that is by 214 ; this then is the power
of the left lens for viewing vertical lines, and is consequently
the power of the spherical surface.
   LA is increased by 152 ; this is the difference between the
powers of the two surfaces, indicating for the cylindrical
surface a power of 62. Similarly it will be found that the
power of the spherical surface of the right lens indicated is
231, and that of the cylindrical surface 73.
   10. If to the numbers Lv = 14, LA = 37, K»=15, Rh=li,
the accommodating power, which time has reduced to about
40, be added, and account is also taken of the influence of
convergence of the optic axes *, we see that the patient has
acquired by means of the spectacles a very satisfactory power
of vision within the range most useful for work. For out-of-
door use another pair was provided, having 25 less power on
the spherical side, so that distant objects might be clearly
seen.

               XLVIII. Notes on Hydrogen Gas.
        By 3. Alfred Wanklyn and W. J. CooPERf.
I^HE record of some experiments in the laboratory will not
       be quite without interest to chemists. The wonderful
passivity of hydrogen gas is illustrated by the following
experiments : -
   I. A strong solution of perchloride of iron, made by dis
solving the solid chloride in water, was placed in a graduated
tube which was inverted in the usual manner so as to form a
receptacle for gas. 26 cubic centim. of hydrogen gas was
then introduced into the tube and allowed to remain in con
tact with the iron-solution for forty hours. At the expiration
of that time the volume of the gas was found to be unaltered.
The gas was then burnt.
   II. A solution of platinic chloride containing 5 per cent, of
platinic chloride was allowed to act upon hydrogen gas in a
Hempel absorption-pipette. 95 cubic centim. of hydrogen
was taken for experiment. After twenty-eight hours' exposure
the volume of the gas was found unchanged.
   III. Ferricyanide of potassium, the solution containing
25 per cent, of the dry salt, was employed in tbe Hempel
absorption-pipette. No absorption of hydrogen took place.
         * Bonders, on Accommodation and .Refraction, p. 111.
         t Communicated by the Authors.

432     Messrs. Wanklyn and Cooper on Hydrogen Gas.
   A repetition of the experiment in which potash was added
to the solution of the ferricyanide, and with exposure to bright
sunlight, showed no absorption of hydrogen during a period of
eight days.
   IV. Citric acid (spec. grav. 1-42) was tried. An exposure
of hydrogen for sixteen hours to the action of the acid pro
duced no change in the volume of the gas, and on exami
ning the gas it was found to be devoid of nitric oxide.
   V . A mixture of oil of vitriol and strong nitric acid was
altogether without action on the gas.
   VI. Aqua regia was also tried and found to be without
action on hydrogen. In this case the volume of gas was
gradually increased, viz. from 67-5 up to 110 cubic centim.
The increase^ was due to evolution of chlorine. On washing
with water the chlorine was dissolved, and there remained
66-5 cubic centim. of hydrogen which burnt in a satisfactory
 manner. This experiment was made in diffused daylight ; in
bright sunlight reaction between the chlorine and the hydrogen
must take place.
   VII. Even solution of chromic acid was found to be with
out action on hydrogen at ordinary temperatures. The
duration of the exposure was twenty-four hours, and the
readings were :—
      Volume of hydrogen before       .  .   64'8 cubic centim.
            „        „       after    .  .   65'0     „     „
   The activity of hydrogen is illustrated as follows :—
   When solution of permanganate of potash—whether it be
 strongly alkaline, or neutral, or strongly acid—is brought into
 an atmosphere of hydrogen, it is attacked by the hydrogen
 even at ordinary temperatures. The rate of the action depends
 upon a variety of circumstances which we are carefully
 studying.
   In one experiment the Hempel gas-pipette was charged
with a solution containing about 30 per cent, of caustic potash
and about 2 per cent, of permanganate of potash. The
readings were :—

       Messrs. Wanklyn and Cooper on Hydrogen Gas.           433
The gas employed in this experiment was a mixture of hy
drogen and air, consisting of about 3 volumes of hydrogen
and 1 volume of air.
   It will be noted that at the beginning of the absorption the
rate is about 5 cubic centim. in twenty-four hours ; then 2-5
cubic centim., and lastly 1 cubic centim. The retardation
evidently depends upon the diminishing proportion of hy
drogen in the gaseous mixture.
   The next experiment was made with a saturated solution of
neutral permanganate (containing 6-5 grams permanganate of
potash in 100 cubic centim. of solution) :—

was enlarged by the employment of glass beads about 4 milli
metres in diameter.

Elliptic Functions, an Elementary Text-book for Students of Mathe
   matics. By A. L. Bakeb, C.E., Ph.D. (New York : Wiley &
   Sons, 1890. Pp. iv+118.)
HPHE Editor's object is to put within reach of the English
      (? English-speaking) student " a tolerably complete outline of
the subject [of Elliptic Functions], clothed in simple mathematical
language and methods," and so to "smooth the road" to this
important branch of Mathematics. Abundant material is to be
found in the works of Abel, Euler, Jacobi, and Legendre, not to
mention the writings of mathematicians of more recent date. The
earlier matter is not easily accessible to the ordinary student, and
Mr. Baker deserves our thanks for his labour in the volume before
us. He has not aimed at originality, which is not to be looked
for in the description of work he has undertaken, but he has tried
to simplify the methods in use, so as to make them intelligible to
the average student. He adopts the Gudermannian notation as
being simpler than the Jacobian, and employs zero subscripts " to
indicate decreasing series in the Landen transformation, and of
numerical subscripts to indicate increasing series." He gives a
list of works consulted, and states that he lias refrained from any
reference to the Gudermann or Weierstrass functions "as not
within the scope of this work." There are seventeen chapters in
all, with an introductory chapter which is a condensation of an
article on the subject by the late Prof. Moseley. There are several
typographical errors, of an elementary character, and now and
again the compiler uses terms which are explained subsequently.
The last chapter contains applications to the Lemniscate, the ellipse,
and hyperbola, and besides there are exercises scattered through
out the rest of the book.
An Introduction to the Lor/ic of Algebra, with Illustrative Exercises.
   By E. W. Davis, Ph.D. (New York : Wiley & Sons, 1890.
   Pp. xv + 119.)
We have read this Introduction, which is a good piece of solid
 work, with much interest. The author states that " the book is
 precisely described by the title, and is mainly the outgrowth of a
 conviction that the Iwjic of Algebra is a very much neglected
 study." Some idea of the writer's mode of treatment will be got
 from the following statement of the various sources drawn upon
 in its compilation. The more important works consulted are :—
Argand, Sur le manure de reprcsenter quantitcs imaginaires ;
 Clifford, Common Sense of the Exact Sciences ; De Morgan, Trigo
 nometry and Double Algebra, and Introduction to his Calculus ;
Dirichlct, Zahlen-theorie ; and Tannery, Thcorie des fonctions

d'une Variable seule. There is a good analysis of the contents, in
which the subject-matter of each article is carefully stated.
    An extract from the last article, in which Mr. Davis rapidly
glances over the route pursued, will most concisely represent what
he has attempted.
    " The commutative, associative, distributive, and index laws
that held with the first simplest numbers have been made to hold
throughout. Finally, by our extensions, we have made the three
primary operations and their four inverses always possible, i. e.
always resulting in a number belonging to our scheme. In the
reasoning first employed for the handling of incommensurables,
and further developed in the treating of growths and rates, we
have the germ of ... . the Infinitesimal Calculus. The Graphic
representation leads to the Analytical Geometry of Des Cartes.
The theory of sines and cosines with its geometric applications is
Trigonometry, and leads, by the introduction of new numbers and
conceptious, to the Function Theory. The theory of double
numbers is simple and restricted, and but a faint suggestion of
what is to be found in the beautiful developments proposed by
Hamilton and Grassmann, the Peirces, and Sylvester. These are
a few only of the lines of thought open to the student. Tet, in
whatsoever direction investigation may carry him, he will find his
work essentially the same in character. Definitions and conven
tions and their logical consequences and relations make up the
whole of it. These relations form the universe wherein the Mathe
matician lives ; a universe, to be sure, of his own construction, a
product of his brain, but none the less real and substantial to
him. Here he observes and compares, and experiments ; here he
reasons out connections, discovers causes, and foretells results."
     It is only in these closing words that Mr. Davis leaves the beaten
 track, his feelings at having finished his task, we suppose, getting
 the upper hand of his usual sobriety. The rest of his work is
 characterized by great clearness in exposition and by fertility of
 illustration. His Argand diagrams make many points clear. The
 printing of such a work as this makes great demands upon the
 author and the printers, yet we have detected but few errors. On
 p. 7, line 8 up, 6 has been omitted : p. 10, line 7 up, for first a
 read 6 : p. 12, line 13 up, for d read b : p. 32, line 2 up, last state

  easily corrected.

 Theory of Differential Equations.—Part I. Exact Equations and
    Pfaffs Problem. By A. E. Foestth, Sc.D., F.B.S. (Cambridge :
    University Press, 1890. Pp. xiv + 340.)
 The work before us is the first instalment in fulfilment of a
 promise made by the author in his ' Treatise on Differential Equa
 tions ' (1885), and is written after the same thorough fashion as
 the earlier volume. The author's aim is " to include every sub
 stantial contribution to the development of the particular subject
 herein dealt with ; and the historical form, into which the treat
 ment has been cast, has facilitated the indication of the continuous
 course of the development." He has drawn upon all available
 sources, duly acknowledging his indebtedness to the several pre
 vious explorers in this field, and has further contributed investi
 gations of his own. A few illustrative examples have been made
 up or culled from the memoirs above referred to.
    The first part consists of 13 chapters. The first two chapters
 discuss the single exact equation and a system of exact equations.
 Under the former head we have a full account of the methods of
 solution given by Euler, Bertrand, Collet, Natani, and Du Bois-
 Beymond ; and under the latter head we have a generalization of
 the above method given by Euler, with an examination of Natani's
 method and of a theorem by Mayer in development of this
 method. Erobenius's conditions for uncanonical form are also
 discussed. The next 4 chapters are devoted to a historical
 summary of methods of treating PfafFs problem, Pfaff's reduction
 as completed by Gauss and Jacobi, Grassmann's method, and
 Natani's method. Chapter vii. contains the application of previous
 results to partial differential equations of the first order. The
next four chapters are occupied, in order, with Clebsch's method,
tangential transformations, Lie's method, and Frobenius's method.
 Chapter xii. gives an abstract of Darboux's method. The closing
chapter discusses Systems of Pfaffians, and is prefaced with a list
 of the memoirs which form the principal sources of our information
on this subject. The whole treatise is a splendid piece of work,
but, from the nature of the subject, is " caviare to the general."
A full index makes consultation easy. We have detected only two
trivial typographical errors (on pp. 92 and 99).

     ACTINOELEOTRICAL INVESTIGATIONS. BY A. STOLTETOW.
rpHE author sums up as follows the results of his researches, which
      have extended over almost two years, and some of which have
already appeared.
   1. When the rays of the voltaic arc fall on a plate charged with
negative electricity it is discharged ; this discharge is accompanied
by a marked fall of potential or not according as the discharge occurs
more or less rapidly.

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            437
   2. The action of the rays is strictly unipolar ; positive electricity
is not carried away.
   3. The apparent charge of neutral bodies by the rays may prob
ably be ascribed to the same cause.
    4. By far the strongest action is possessed by rays of the
highest refrangibility (\ < 295 x 10-6 millim.), which are wanting
in the sun's spectrum.
   5. It is necessary that the rays be absorbed by the surface of
the body ; the discharge is accordingly greater, the greater the
absorption.
   6. All metals are sensitive to this action ; some colouring-matters
(aniline colours) are the most sensitive. Water, which is trans
parent for the active rays, was found to be insensitive.
   7. There is no appreciable interval of time between the moment
of illumination and the corresponding discharge.
   8. Other things being equal, the discharge is proportional to the
energy of the active rays, and of the illuminated surface.
   9. The action is perceptible even with very small densities ; its
magnitude depends on the density, and at first increases more
rapidly than the latter and afterwards more slowly.
    10. Two plates between which a difference of potential due to vol
taic contact exists, represent a kind of voltaic element as long as
the electrically negative plate is illuminated by active rays.
   11. We are entitled to consider this actinoelectrical discharge
as an electrical current. ; the air (either by itself or by the action of
the particles mixed with it) plays the part of a bad conductor ; the
apparent resistance does not follow Ohm's law.
    12. The actinoelectric action is increased by the temperature.
   The author states in conclusion that the phenomena described
are only to be observed in gases. Experiments with solid and with
liquid insulators always gave a negative result. It follows from
this that actinoelectrical currents represent a kind of convection
current. (Compare the results of Bichat, Righi, Blondlot, Lenard,
and Wolff.) If it be assumed that at the boundary of metal and
air there is a difference of potential due to contact, then from the
discharge of the negatively electrical body, we may in some way
explain the charge of the feebly positively charged or neutral body.
Whether in this there is an electrolysis of gas (Arrhenius) or
not must be left &n open question.
    Convection explains only the further progress of the phenomenon ;
the first step of the electromotive excitation remains an enigma.
   The hypothesis of E. Wiedemann appears to the author very rich
in consequences ; but the inactivity of ordinary luminous rays (that
is, visible), as well as the decidedly unipolar character of the action,
is unintelligible. The analogy between the phenomena described
and the well-known discharges in Geissler's and Crookes's tubes is
striking.

observes that he has repeated tlie experiments with success ; they
may be explained by assuming that the telephone which is sensitive
for a circuit is not so when the same quantity of electricity acts as
a feebly intermittent current. By experiments with intermittent
illumination and a rotating commutator it is proved that any
possible retardation of the action could not amount to           of a
second.—Journal of the Russian Physicochemical Society, vol. xxi.

      STATIONARY LUMINOUS VIBRATIONS. BY 0. WIENER.
   The author has published in Wiedemann's Annalen, vol. xl. p. 203,
an important Memoir, in which by photographic methods he has
demonstrated the existence of stationary luminous vibrations. The
memoir is accompanied by phototypic illustrations of the results
of his experiments. His conclusions are given by himself as
follows :—
   By the foregoing research the experimental proof has been fur
 nished for the existence of stationary waves of light. A sensitive,
 perfectly transparent collodion lamina, the thickness of which was
 small in comparison with the wave-length of light (-^ about) was
 placed between two glass plates at a small distance from a metal
 mirror and making a small angle with this. After protracted ex
 posure to the spectral rays the lamina was developed, and bands
 were formed which it was proved could only be due to the action of
 stationary waves.
    A more accurate investigation of stationary waves showed that
 with perpendicular reflexion at the optically denser medium, the
 nodal points of the chemical luminous action are at distances equal
 to the multiple of half a wave-length from the reflecting surface ;
 the ventral segments are between these, that is at distances equal
 to the odd multiples of a quarter wave-length.
    Experiments in which two rectilinearly polarized waves of light
 were used, which crossed each other at right angles, showed that a
 chemical action on the sensitive plate due to an inference of the two
 rays occurred when their planes of polarization coincided, but failed
 when they were at right angles to each other. It was to be con
 cluded from this, that the chemically active vibrations of a recti
 linearly polarized wave of light are at right angles to their plane
 of polarization.

   The results of the experiments in their bearing on the theory of
light were discussed. It may merely be mentioned that the most
obvious conception of the processes brought to light by the experi
ments is obtained by assuming that vibrations of the luminiferous
medium produce vibrations of the solid particles in the same direc
tion, which effect a photochemical change of the sensitive lamina.
On the basis of this assumption the experiments lead to a decision
between the mechanical theories of light, and that in favour of
Fresnel's.
    Expressed in the language of the electromagnetic theory of light
the experiments teach that the chemical action of a rectilinearly
polarized wave of light is connected with the presence of electrical
and not of magnetic vibrations.
    As regards the method of investigation here employed, the thiu
 sensitive lamina represents in a certain sense a transparent eye
 which can simultaneously take up luminous impressions from oppo
 site directions. While in investigating the motion of light we have
 hitherto been restricted to one locality in drawing a conclusion as to
 the motion transmitted to the eye ; the possibility is now open of
 investigating the luminous motion in the place itself as regards its
amplitude, phase, and the direction of its vibrations.—Wiedemann's
 Annalen, vol. xl. p. 203, 1890.

    In the March number of the Philosophical Magazine a paper is
 published by Mr. Flux which discusses the theory of Newton's
 rings, and leads to the same results as those which I developed in
  1880 in connexion with the observations of Prof. Sohncke*, and
  which I had published in abstract in the Monatsberichte of the
  Berlin Academy, November 4, 1880, and more fully in the Annalen,
  vol. xii. p. 201 (1861). Mr. Flux, it is true, mentions my priority
  in two places ; yet from the words at the conclusion he seems to
  raise the claim of being by his theory the first to arrive at a satis
  factory conclusion. In opposition to this view I find myself com
  pelled to prove that everything which Mr. Flux adduces in refer
  ence to Newton's rings in reflected light, is completely covered by
  the contents of my research, with the exception of one unimport
  ant result. In the first place, Mr. Flux has not added a single new
  result to those which I have already found. But the agreement
  between our papers is not restricted to the results, but extends,
  not only to the details of the calculation, but also to the greater
  part of the nomenclature, and even to the figures. The proof of

Mr. Flux, apart from a different arrangement of the matter, con
tains nothing which was not taken literally, or in the ordinary
sense, from the paper already cited or from another on the same
subject*. In one point only does the statement of Mr. Flux differ
from mine, without, however, leading to any new results.
   In order to establish the statement I have just made I may be
allowed to sketch the separate sections of Mr. Flux's paper, and
at the same time refer to the corresponding ones of my own.

   The author gives the detailed comparison and thus concludes :—
In what I have said, where I have gone into all the apparent or
actual deviations between Mr. Flux's research and my own,
the contention made at the beginning of this article will appear
abundantly justified. Apart from the alteration of a proof, the
research of Mr. Flux, both as regards results and their establish
ment, is nothing further than a repetition of what 1 had already
carried out in my two researches or what Herr Gumlich had done
in his paper which is connected therewith.
   In conclusion, it may be mentioned that the confirmation which
my theoretical investigations had met with in the careful observa
tions of Prof. Sohncke is mentioned by Mr. Flux, but dismissed in
less than two lines.—Abstract of communication from the Author.
          FLUORESCENT VAPOURs. BY F. WIEDEMANN.
   Professors Ramsay and Youngf had described an experiment
according to which solutions of eosine fluoresce above the critical
temperature, without, however, as they themselves state, consider
ing it to be strictly proved. Independently of them I made at the
same time an analogous experiment which, however, gives perfectly
certain results, and which I here communicate from the Proceed
ings of the Societas Physico-medica at Erlangen for the year 1888.
   Experiments with liquids which were sealed in capillary tubes
gave a very distinct fluorescence above the critical temperature for
solutions of eosine and Magdala red in alcohol. That it is not
diffused light with which we have to deal is shown if we use as
source of light that which has passed through ammoniaeal copper
sulphate, which contains no yellow or red rays. The fluorescent
light contains these rays ; this is distinctly seen when a lens is
used, the cone of light is distinctly seen continued in the vapour,
and is especially beautiful with Magdala red. Experiments witli
saffranine gave no results, as it is decomposed. With Magdala
red there is also a feeble decrease in coloration after heating.—

   LI. On the Dynamical Theory of Electromagnetic Action.
             By Professor Andrew Gray, M.A.*
THE use of the term potential energy in electromagnetic
      theory is somewhat vague. For example, an expression
for the potential energy of a circuit and a magnetic shell is
obtained by replacing the former by its equivalent shell and
proceeding as in the magnetic theory of two shells. This
expression gives the potential energy of the system in terms
of the configuration of the two shells, and so enables the
mutual forces between the shell and the circuit, and there
fore also the work done in any relative displacement, to be
calculated. But, in the presentation of the theory, the
assumption is then made that this work is wholly due to the
expenditure of the potential energy of the substances in the
battery, and nothing is credited to a change in the intrinsic
or potential energy which the system possesses irrespective of
the store of energy contained in the battery.
   But when we consider the case of two circuits, we have
always to take into account the change in intrinsic energy.
For example, when two rigid circuits are allowed to approach
one another infinitely slowly, the battery, as is well known, is
drawn upon for twice as much energy as is required for the
work done by electromagnetic forces between the two circuits,
the balance going to increase the intrinsic energy of the system.

442              Prof. A. Gray on the Dynamical
When the circuits are separated again by external forces
applied to overcome the electromagnetic forces, the intrinsic
energy is diminished by the same amount, and the battery is
saved just as much energy in the reverse displacement as it
supplied in the direct.
   If the displacement do not take place infinitely slowly, we
have to take into account the change in the intrinsic energy
due to the change of the current in each circuit.
   Thus the change in the intrinsic energy is here very
important.
   Again, when we consider two magnets which are displaced
by their mutual forces, we find the change in the intrinsic
energy, expressed in terms of the configuration of the system,
the only thing to be taken into account. The mutual forces
set the magnets into motion, or displace them against external
resistance, and thus do work. This work can be obtained
from no other source than the intrinsic or configuration
energy of the system.
   Thus in the case of two circuits and in that of two magnets,
change of intrinsic energy plays a part; in the case of a mag
net and a circuit it apparently does not ; and I have never
seen the reason of the apparent exception anywhere clearly
stated. I think that the treatment of the intrinsic energy in
the presentation of this part of the theory of electromagnetic
action is a source of difficulty to many, and prevents clearness
of ideas regarding what is certainly not found an easy subject
when an attempt is made to master it in all its bearings.
   This difficulty is met with in the perusal of the writings of
even the greatest masters of the science of Electricity. Thus
Clerk-Maxwell, in his ' Electricity and Magnetism ' (vol. ii.
p. 179), has given a treatment of the problem of two cir
cuits, in which the change of intrinsic energy is left out of
account, and a correct result is obtained only by what seems
an inadmissible process*. This passage is a pretty close
rendering of one in Helmholtz's famous essay, Die Erhaltung
der Kraft, in which the same treatment occurs. It is evident
that here the change of intrinsic energy has not been present
to the minds of the writers, and the result is a statement
of theory which may have caused thoughtful students con
siderable embarrassment.
   Again, I have observed what seem to me traces of this
want of clearness in attempts to deduce directly from the
expressions for the intrinsic energy of a magnetic field due
to any distribution of currents, the energy dissipated per
unit of volume of the medium, in carrying the substance
round a closed cycle of magnetization. The correct way of
             ' See McConnel, ' Nature,' vol. xxxv. p. 172.

                  I'heory of Electromagnetic Action.               443
 regarding the intrinsic energy gives, as shown below, exactly
 the amount of energy, per unit of volume of the medium,
 spent in any change of magnetization, whether a complete
 cycle or not, otherwise than in increasing the intrinsic energy,
 and therefore gives at once the energy dissipated in carrying
 the medium through a complete cycle from one given state
 as to intrinsic energy back to the same state again.
     Everything seems to point to the conclusion that what we
 are in the habit of regarding as potential energy is really
 kinetic energy. Every increase of scientific knowledge of
 matter furnishes additional proof that all its properties have
 their explanation in motion, and the conviction is more and
 more forced upon every physical student that the ordinary
 division of energy into potential and kinetic results from our
 incomplete knowledge of the material system considered. If
 we had perfect knowledge of the coordinates of all the parts
 of the system and their velocities at a given instant, and,
 further, knew fully the conditions to which these coordinates
 are subject, we should ipso facto be able to define the confi
 guration at any time of any portion of the system, and to
 state bow at that time the whole kinetic energy is divided
 between that portion and the rest of the system. Thus the
 ordinary transformation of potential into kinetic energy, and
 vice versa, is only a process of redistribution of kinetic energy
 between the different parts of the system.
     It can in fact be proved that if a dynamical system be
 specified partly by a certain group of position coordinates (<f>)
and partly by velocities of other coordinates (ifr), so that the
kinetic energy is the sum of two corresponding parts Tj, T+,
of which the first is expressed as a quadratic function of the
velocities of the type <p, and the other as a quadratic function
of the momenta corresponding to the velocities >jr, the altera
tions of the position coordinates will take place precisely as if
the system had a quantity of kinetic energy T?, and a quantity
of potential energy T^*. For there being no potential energy
we can in this case write the Lagrangian equation for a
<£- coordinate as follows t :—

 which is the equation of motion we should have if Tg, were
 the potential energy of the system.
    Though molecular dynamics, notwithstanding its great ad
 vances, may never succeed in giving us a perfect knowledge
 of the coordinates, which are thus ignored in the sense that
 the energy is expressed without them, still in some cases, as
 in the general dynamical treatment of electric currents intro
 duced by Maxwell, it adds greatly to clearness of statement
 and view to adopt the idea that the intrinsic energy of the
 system, or that part of it alone concerned in electromagnetic,
 action, is really kinetic energy. Thus, in using the expression
 for this electrokinetic energy in the Lagrangian equations,
 we find the electromotive forces of induction, and the electro
 magnetic forces between the parts of the system.
    It has been shown by Maxwell (Electricity and Magnetism,
 vol. ii. chap, vi.), and the proof need not be repeated here, that
 the electrokinetic energy of a system of current-carrying
-conductors may be written as a homogeneous quadratic func
 tion of the current-strengths, which are regarded as velocities
 corresponding to generalized coordinates ylf y2, and specifying
 the different circuits. Adopting the notation yu yt, &c. for
 these velocities, and putting T for the electrokinetic energy,
we have
    T=$(Lly* + 2Ml3y1y2 + ... + Lty2* + mny2yi + ...); . (1)
 where Llt M12, &c, L2, M23, &c. are coefficients involving only
.the ordinary position coordinates of the material system, and
 fulfilling the relation Mp?=Msp. Lj, Lj, &c. are in fact the
 coefficients of self-induction for the different circuits Mi2, M,2,
 and M23 &c. the coefficients of mutual induction for the pairs
 of circuits indicated by the suffixes.
    If we denote the magnetic inductions through the different
^circuits by N„ N„ . . . N*, . . . , we have

     The quantities Nj, N2, &c. are generalized components of
 electrokinetic momentum.
     Using Lagrange's equations of motion and introducing Lord
  Rayleigh's Dissipation Function F, we have, since the coeffi
  cients in T do not contain the coordinates y, for the impressed
  electromotive forces in the different circuits the typical
  equation
                                                               w

     The electromotive forces of the type rfNt/di are the parts of
  the impressed electromotive forces which are employed in
  working against the electromotive forces due to induction.
  Thus -dNk/dt is the type of the actual electromotive force
  due to induction. Since this may be written in the form
                              _ t Q
                                 dt dyk'
   we see that the inductive electromotive force tends to diminish
   die electrokinetic energy.
      Again, the forces which must be applied to work against
   the reacting internal electromagnetic forces are
                            dT     _ dT &c
                           dxi '      dx3 '  ''
   where xv x3, &c. are coordinates determining the geometrical
   positions of the circuits. Thus, the mutual electromagnetic
   forces having equal and opposite values to these, tend to
   increase the electrokinetic energy. These two results must
   be kept clearly in mind in what follows.
      This dynamical theory, if applicable to a system of ordinary
. circuits, must, if Ampere's theory of magnetism be true, be
   also applicable to a system of magnets, or a system composed-
   partly of ordinary circuits and partly of magnets ; otherwise
   Ampere's theory cannot be a complete expression of the facts
   of the case. Maxwell has applied it only to the case of two
   circuits, and its applicability to the case of a circuit and a

446               Prof. A. Gray on the Dynamical
magnetic shell has been questioned by Mr. S. H. Burbury
 (Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 1888). I shall endeavour to test its
applicability by a comparison of its consequences in the three
simple typical cases :— (1) two ordinary circuits, (2) an ordi
nary circuit and a magnetic shell, (3) two magnetic shells.
   (1) In this case let L„ L„ M be the coefficients of self-
induction, and the coefficient of mutual induction for the two
circuits. Then we have
                  T=i(L1y1*+2My1i/,+L^il»)                      (6)
   If Ej, E3 be the electromagnetic forces, R1; R2 the resist
ances, equation (5) gives

   We shall suppose that the circuits are rigid, so that Lj, L,
are invariable. Then if the circuits be subjected only to those
changes which take place from their mutual action, and <fT
be the change in T which takes place in a small interval of
time dt,
   dT= L,yi dyi + M(y2 dfa + y^fa) + L,y2 dy3 + y^M. (8)
The work dW done by electromagnetic forces has the value
dT/dx . dx. Hence
                            dW = yiy2dU                         (9)
   This work is spent in producing kinetic energy in the dis
placed conductors (or if these are not free, in moving them
against external resistance, or in both ways) .
   The work done by the impressed electromotive forces over
and above that dissipated is
which, by (7), has the value
       Li^i <*2/i + M (yi dyt + y2 rfy,) + Lsy, dyt + 2y,y2 dM,
or, by (8) and (9), the value dH + dW, so that the energy is
all accounted for.
   This agreement (as also that in each of the cases which
follow) is of course only a consequence of the equations given
above ; but its exhibition tends to give a clearer notion of the
dynamical meaning of these equations.

   Here part of the impressed electromotive forces Ei, E2 in
each case is employed in working against the inductive elec
tromotive force, and thus in increasing the electrokinetic
energy. By the electromagnetic forces the electrokinetic
energy is increased by the amount y{y3 rfM, which al«o is the
amount of work spent in moving the circuits.
   If the conductors are displaced from rest to rest again, so
that yv y3, have resumed their steady values dyi=Q, dy3=0,
the energy furnished by the batteries is 2y1y2 a!M, of which
one half is accounted for in dH, the other by the work
done in moving the circuits, which has its equivalent in work
done against the external resistance by which the conductors
were brought to rest. This result was obtained by Sir William
Thomson so long ago as 1851.
   (2) Assuming, according to Ampere, that a magnetic shell
is equivalent to a current round its edge, and putting y3 for
this current, we have, since E2=0, 1^ = 0, instead of (7),
                   E1-|(L1y1 + My,)=R1yIl

As before we get
  dT= Lftrfft + M(y3rfyi + yidy3) + Uyidy2 + fc&dM, j
The energy furnished by the battery is, as before,
By the other circuit no energy is given.   But multiplied by y3
the second of (10) gives
                 i^vdyi + Wyidyi + yi&tfM = o.
Thus
                dH^y^y. + My.dy,,

         dI + dW = Liyidyi + Myidy2 + y&dM,
which again, of course, is the energy furnished by the battery.
   Here, if the changes are estimated for the system when
brought to rest, dyt = 0. The other current y3 does not,
however, remain constant, and we have to inquire what is its
effect upon the magnet. We know that the moment of a hard
magnet is not seriouslj' altered by a displacement produced by
the mutual forces if y, is moderate ; and the small alteration

448             Prof. A. Gray on the Dynamical
generally observed is opposite to that which would be pro
duced by the inductive change in y2. We are led to conclude
that #2f on which, according to Ampere's theory, the intensity
of magnetization depends, must remain practically constant.
Writing, then, the second of (10) in the form
where 7 is the initial current before the magnet was brought
into the field of the circuit, we see that if the dvnamical
theory is applicable, MyJL3 must be a quantity small in com
parison with y. This gives dy2 a small quantity of the second
 order, and makes the value of dT, the change in the electro-
 kinetic energy, depend only on the term hiyldyi, which is zero
 if the system is not in relative motion. Thus the fact that
 the mechanical value of a current in a conductor is not affected
 by bringing permanent magnets into its neighbourhood is
 not contradicted by the dynamical theory, if the supposition
 here made as to the value of My,/L2 be actually true. We
 have to inquire what physical reasons can be adduced in
 support of it.
    Suppose that, instead of a simple magnetic shell, we have
 a solenoid made up of equal distinct circuits, in each of
 which a current y flows. If the number of circuits per unit of
 length be n, the coefficient of self-induction per unit of length is
 47rn2A, where A is the area of the circuit, and the total induc
 tion through the solenoid (neglecting the effect of its ends)
 is 47rn2/yA, if / be its length. If the circuit carrying the
 current yi consist of n' turns of wire closely surrounding the
 solenoid, the induction through it and the solenoid is imm'yA.
 Thus the maximum value of M is iirnn'K. Thus we get
                                 M _n[
                                 L» ~ nl '
 that is, the ratio, which the theory indicates must be vanish-
 ingly small, is equal to the ratio of the number of turns in
  the circuit to the number of circuits in the solenoid. Thus
  we are led to the supposition, probable on other grounds, that
  the number of molecular circuits in the solenoid is exceed
 ingly great.
     It is also necessary, in order that the Amperian molecules
  may give an inductive magnetization in iron agreeing with
  experiment, that the self-induction of each molecular circuit
  must be great, that is A/L2 must be small. If the current
  flow in a ring channel this condition, as Maxwell has pointed
  out*, may be fulfilled by supposing the radius R of the mean

line of the channel great in comparison with r the radius of
the channel, since Lj depends on log R/r.
    (3) Considering now the case of two shells, we have the
same expressions for rfTand d\\T as in (11); but the equations
(10) become, since now ^ = 0, E^O,
                L2yidy2 + My2dyi + yiy2dM = O.J '
Thus substituting in (11) we find
                         <W= -fcfcdM,                        (14)
which is equal aud opposite to the work done by the elec
tromagnetic forces in moving the system. Here, it is to be
observed, the electrokinetic energy is diminished through the
action of the electromotive forces by just double the amount
by which the electromagnetic forces increase it.
    The performance of a finite amount of work by electro
magnetic forces in overcoming external forces, or in giving
the magnets kinetic energy, and the diminution of the elec
trokinetic energy by an equal amount, are quite consistent
with only a slight alteration of y1, y2, and therefore of the
 magnetic moments of the magnets. Indeed, the alteration
 in the magnetic moments of the magnets actually produced is
 opposite in sign to that which would be caused by dyu dy2,
 and is due no doubt to magnetization produced by a turning
 round of magnetic molecules in the body. But in an ideal
 case, in which the molecules could undergo no such altera
 tion of position, it is only necessary to suppose that L1, L,
 are each great in comparison with M to enable the effect of
 dyi, dya on the magnetic moments to be small, a supposition
 which is very possibly in accordance with fact.
    There does not seem to me, therefore, to be any insuperable
 physical difficulty in the way of the application of the general
 dynamical equations to magnets as well as to circuits carrying
 currents. Of course our ignorance of the current strength,
 &c., in the former case prevents us from making practical use
 of these equations ; but their theoretical application gives I
 think a clearer view of the energetics of electromagnetic (and
 magnetic) action than can be obtained without them.
     1 shall now consider from this dynamical point of view the
 inductive magnetization produced in iron and other sub
 stances when placed in a magnetic field. As is well known,
 the expression in (1) or (3) for the electrokinetic energy can
  be reduced to a definite integral. The following method of
 performing this reduction seems more direct andsimple than

450              Prof. A. Gray on the Dynamical
that used by Maxwell, which is the method I think generally
pursued. Starting from equation (3), viz.,
              T = i(N1y1+Nl&+ -- - +Ni2/*+ . . .),
take any circuit, say that through which the induction is
Njt, and draw any surface in the field so as to form a cap with
that circuit as bounding edge. Then, by the well-known
theorem as to the work done in carrying a unit pole in a
closed path round a circuit, we have
                        Airyic=§B.k cos 6yds,
where the integration is taken round any closed path em
bracing the circuit, H* is the magnetic force due to the current
in that circuit, and 6k the angle which H* makes with ds, an
element of the path. Hence, since the total induction through
every such surface is the same, we have
                     Nj.2/t=    J*NtH> cos 6uds.    .  .  . (15)
   Now let the surface be taken at right angles to the lines of
induction everywhere. These lines are closed curves round
the conductors, and each threads through one or more of the
circuits. It is possible to divide up the whole field by suc
cessive surfaces, each having for bounding edge any given
circuit, so that every one of those surfaces shall be everywhere
at right angles to the lines of induction. Every one of these,
if it cut through a system of closed lines belonging to any one
circuit, will pass through every point of that circuit. Of
course no one of the closed tubes of induction which the
surface thus cuts through contributes anything to the total
induction through the surface.
   Now let the direction of the closed curve, round which the
integral of H cos 6 ds is taken, be everywhere at right angles
to these surfaces, and let B be the value of the induction at
any point where this curve cuts one of these surfaces. Then,
if da be the area of an element of the surface at that point,
the induction through it is BrfS. Thus we get
                   Ntj/> = -^J^j*BH* cos Bk ds dS,
where one integral is taken over the surface and the other
round the closed curve. But this is evidently the same
thing as

induction is B, and dx dy dz is an element of volume.
   Finally, take any point on one of these surfaces, and let B
be the induction there. For every such point a surface can
be drawn having any one of the circuits as its boundary, and
hence by (1 6) and (3) we have finally for T the equation :

                  H cos d= Hi cos &i + H3 cos 03 + &c.
Hence (17) becomes
                   T= ^jyjBH cos Bdxdydz.            .    .     . (18)

   Now let the total induction through the circuit in which

energy drawn from the battery is y e£N ; and clearly by the

If the magnetization be carried through a closed cycle, so
that the medium is brought back to the same state as at first,
the electrokinetic energy returns to the same value, and the
integral of the quantity within the inner brackets, which is
d(BH), is zero. Thus the energy furnished to the medium in
the closed cycle is
the inner integral being taken with respect to B round the
cycle.
   If we take the changes per unit of volume at a place where
the induction is B and the magnetic force H, we have for the
energy given to the medium the value H<2B/47r, and for the
increase of electrokinetic energy rf(BH)/87r. Therefore, for
the energy spent otherwise than in increasing the electro
kinetic energy, we get the expression

   It is interesting to apply this result to an actual curve of
 magnetization in iron (fig. 2). For all points on the curve
 up to a little distance beyond P, the total energy given to
 the medium in producing the corresponding magnetization
 exceeds the electrokinetic energy, but for all points further
 from the origin the electrokinetic energy exceeds, and for
 points on the upper flat part of the curve very greatly exceeds,
 the energy given out to the medium by the Tbattery. [The
 point P at which OP is a tangent to the curve marks the
 point at which the energy given out to the medium and the
 electrokinetic energy are increasing at the same rate, the
 former below that point is increasing faster, above that point
 slower than the latter.]
    We are forced to conclude that for every series of mag
 netization steps from zero up to a certain point energy is
 given to the medium, and for every series from zero up to any
 further point the medium furnishes the balance of energy
 required for the electrokinetic energy. In every small step
 below P a balance of energy, over and above the electro
 kinetic energy, is given to the medium ; for every small step

 454              Prof. A. Gray on the Dynamical
 above P a balance is taken from the medium to make up
 the electrokinetic energy.
    It seems to me that these results are very intimately con
 nected with and confirm Prof. Ewing's theory of Magnetiza
 tion, published in the Philosophical Magazine for September.
 In the steep part of the curve beyond the first bend we have
 work done by the electromagnetic forces (and probably
.converted into heat) at a much greater rote than elsewhere in
 the curve. Here, according to this theory, magnets undergo
 almost all the turning of their axes they receive. Hence the co
 efficients of mutual induction must increase here most quickly,
 and consequently also the work done by electromagnetic
 forces which depend, as shown above, on the changes in these
 coefficients.
    Prof. Ewing supposes that the molecular magnets having
 been swung round into new positions of stable equilibrium
 vibrate about that position, generating Foucault currents in
 the surrounding medium, thus heating it. Now Baur, Bow-
 land, Hopkinson, and others have shown that iron has its
 magnetic susceptibility increased by rise of temperature so
 long as a certain high magnetizing force and a certain high
 temperature are not exceeded. The conclusion which follows
 from this by thermodynamic theory is that increase of mag
 netization should cool the iron. Although of course we cannot
 reason rigidly for an unclosed series of changes, owing to our
 want of knowledge of the molecular changes, it does seem
.probable that the iron is really heated in the part of the curve
 for which the curvilinear area O Q S is greater than the
 triangle 0 Q S. The hypothesis would, however, explain this
 seeming contradiction ; tor, as I understand it, the thermo
 dynamic theory does not take into account any expenditure in
 producing heat of the electromagnetic work done in altering
 the magnetic state. If the molecules could be laid hold of by
 external forces, against which they might do work in going
 round to their new positions, so as to be guided to rest in
 these positions, there would be no vibration, and the iron
 would show a cooling, according to thermodynamic theory.
 In fact the heating due to the Foucault currents, supposed to
 be thus generated, must be less than it otherwise would be by
 the thermodynamic cooling.
    In the upper part of the curve it seems probable that there
is a marked cooling. At present I am engaged in a careful
 experimental investigation of heating-effects for the whole
curve.
   Another point which may be here remarked is that (as

                   Theory of Electromagnetic Action.             455
  shown in equations (13) for a particular case) the inductions
  through the molecular circuits remain constant. Hence in a
  magnetizable body these inductions must be the same in the
  unmagnetized state of the body as in its magnetized state ;
  and this seems to show that the magnetization consists in the
  turning round, into facing on the whole in the same direction,
  different lines or chains of regularly arranged molecular mag
   nets, or molecular circuits, as opposed to an alignment of a
   number of circuits previously perfectly mixed up in their
   arrangement. For if each of these chains have its compo
   nent molecules all facing the same way, and the different
   chains be so arranged that the body has no magnetic moment
   in mass, the constant induction of large amount through each
   circuit can be accounted for ; and this appears to me to be
   the more natural explanation. A body which had its mole
   cular circuits perfectly mixed up as to direction could not, it
   seems to me, be magnetized at all, except in so far as to pro
   duce an induction through each of the circuits equal and
   opposite- to the integral of the magnetizing force over that
   circuit, unless indeed the coefficients of self-induction are in
   all cases so large as to give a considerable induction through
   each circuit due to its own current alone. If the latter were
   the case, the result of causing all the molecular circuits to face
   one way would be to produce an induction, in the same direc
   tion, over every part of a section of the body across the
   direction of the magnetizing force ; if it were not the case,
   the  induction
fi small,           across of
          in consequence      the afact
                           such      section  would
                                        that the      be everywhere
                                                 surrounding circuits
   before the alignment contribute on the whole nothing to the
   induction through a particular circuit, which induction must
   afterwards still nave the same small value.
      Thus, if the current in each circuit does not by itself pro
   duce an induction in itself considerable, a moderate magne
   tizing force, applied to a body composed of molecules perfectly
   mixed as to the directions of their axes, ought to produce
   diamagnetic quality, in consequence of the creation of the
   magnetic induction required to keep the total induction
   through each circuit at its former value.
      Of course diamagnetic quality is most simply accounted for
   by supposing the molecules immovable. The only effect of
   placing the body in a magnetic field would then be to produce
   induced currents corresponding to diamagnetization.

WE may apply the same formulaa to compare the pressures
         at the centre and upon the surface of a spherical mass
of fluid, surrounded by vacuum. If the radius be r, we have
at the centre

as was to be expected. As the curvature increases from zero>
there is at first a rise of pressure. A maximum occurs when r
has a particular value, of the order of the range. Afterwards
a diminution sets in, and the pressure approaches zero, as r
decreases without limit.
    If the surface of fluid, not acted on by external force,
be of variable curvature, it cannot remain in equilibrium.
For example, at the pole of an oblate ellipsoid of revolution
the potential will be greater than at the equator, so that in
order to maintain equilibrium an external polar pressure
would be needed. An extreme case is presented by a rectan-
fular mass, in which the potential at an edge is only one
  alf, and at a corner only one eighth, of that general over a
face.
    When the surface is other than spherical, we cannot obtain
so simple a general expression as (34) to represent the excess
of internal over superficial pressure ; but an approximate
expression analogous to (35) is readily found.
    The potential at a point upon the surface of a convex mass
differs from that proper to a plane surface by the potential of
the meniscus included between the surface and its tangent

   For a cylindrical surface of radius r, we have simply

   It is not difficult to recognize that this integral must be
related to T. For if Q be a point upon the normal equidis
tant with P from the surface A B, the potential at Q due to
fluid below A B is the same as the potential at P due to imagi
nary fluid above A B. To each of these add the potential of
the lower fluid at P. Then the sum of the potentials at P and
Q due to the lower fluid is equal to the potential at P due to
both fluids, that is to the constant 2K. The deficiency of
potential at a point P near the plane surface of a fluid, as
compared with the potential in the interior, is thus the same
as the potential at an external point Q, equidistant from the
surface. Now it is evident that §VQdz integrated upwards
along the normal represents the work per unit of area that
would be required to separate a continuous fluid of unit den
sity along the plane A B and to remove the parts beyond the
sphere of influence, that is, according to the principle of
 Dupre^ 2T. We conclude that the deficiency inj-VP<fe,
integrated along the normal inwards, is also 2T ; or that

 pressure in the superficial stratum.

 directly, without the aid of the idea of superficial tension, or
 energy, and this is easily done.

    An application of this result to a calculation of the pressure
operative between the two halves of an isolated sphere will
lead us to another interpretation of T. The pressure in the
interior is K + 2T/r, r being the radius ; and this may be
regarded as prevailing over the whole of the diametral dividing
plane, subject to a correction for the circumferential parts
which are near the surface of the fluid. If the radius r
increase without limit, the correction will be the same per
unit of length as that investigated for a plane surface. The
whole pressure between the two infinite hemispheres is thus
                    7rr2(K + 2T/r)-2T.2irr,

to retain its radius r, would be 7rr*K simply ; so that the
second term T . 2-n-r may be considered to represent the de

to one hemisphere. Regarding the matter in two dimensions,
we recognize T as the attraction per unit of length perpen

V= 2K. On the surface of the sphere,
and therefore along the circumference
of A B, V = K - 2T/r. When V was in
tegrated along the normal, from a plane             V
 surface inwards, the deficiency was
 found to be 2T. In the present application the integration
is along the oblique line A B, and the deficiency will be
 2T sec 8. Hence when r and p increase without limit, we
may take as the whole pressure over the area A B

    The term T cos 6 in the expression for the                Fip- &
total pressure appears to have its origin in
the curvature of the surface, only not disap
pearing when the curvature vanishes, in conse
quence of the simultaneous increase without
limit of the area over which the pressure is
reckoned. If we consider only a distance A B,
which, though infinite in comparison with the
range of the attraction, is infinitely small in comparison
with the radius of curvature, Tcos 6 will disappear from the
expression for the pressure, though it must necessarily remain
in the expression for the attraction. The pressure acting
across a section A B proceeding inwards from a plane surface
A E of a fluid is thus inadequate to balance the attraction of
the two parts. It must be aided by an external force per
pendicular to A B of magnitude T cos 0 ; and since the
imaginary section A B may be made at any angle, we see
that the force must be T and must act along AE.
    An important class of capillary phenomena are concerned
with the spreading of one liquid upon the surface of another,
a subject investigated experimentally by Marangoni, Van der
Mensbrugghe, Quincke, and others. The explanation is
readily given in terms of surface-tension ; and it is sometimes
supposed that these phenomena demonstrate in a special
manner the reality of surface-tension, and even that they are
 incapable of explanation upon Laplace's theory, which dealt
 in the first instance with the capillary pressures due to curva
 ture of surfaces*.
    In considering this subject, we have first to express the
 dependence of the tension at the interface of two bodies in
 terms of the forces exercised by the bodies upon themselves
 and upon one another, and to effect this we cannot do better
 than follow the method of Dupre. If T1S denote the inter-
 facial tension, the energy corresponding to unit of area of the
 interface is also T12, as we see by considering the introduction
 (through a fine tube) of one body into the interior of the other.
 A comparison with another method of generating the interface,
 similar to that previously employed when but one body was
 in question, will now allow us to evaluate Tl2.

fluid which lie on the two sides of an ideal plane passing
through the interior, is per unit of area 2T1? and the free
surface produced is two units in area. So for the second
fluid the corresponding work is 2T2. This having been
effected, let us now suppose that each of the units of area of
free surface of fluid (1) is allowed to approach normally a unit
area of (2) until contact is established. In this process work
is gained which we may denote by 4T'u, 21*12 f°r each pair.
 On the whole, then, the work expended in producing two units
of interface is 2T, + 2T2- 4T'12, and this, as we have seen, may
be equated to 2TI3. Hence
                            T12=T1 + T2-2T'1J                        (42)

    Laplace does not treat systematically the question of inter-
 facial tension, but he gives incidentally in terms of his quantity
 H a relation analogous to (42).
    If 2T'I2>T1 + T2, Tij would be negative, so that the inter
 face would of itself tend to increase. In this case the fluids
 must mix. Conversely, if two fluids mix, it would seem that
 T'u must exceed the mean of                 and T3 ; otherwise work
 would have to be expended to effect a close alternate stratifica
 tion of the two bodies, such as we may suppose to constitute a
 first step in the process of mixture*.
    The value of T'u has already been calculated (7). We may

 and in general the functions 0, or <f>, must be regarded as
 capable of assuming different forms. Under these circum
 stances there is no limitation upon the values of the inter-
 facial tensions for three fluids, which we may denote by Tu,
 T23, T31. If the three fluids can remain in contact with one
 another, the sum of any two of the quantities must exceed the
 third, and by Neumann's rule the directions of the interfaces
 at the common edge must be parallel to the sides of a triangle,
 taken proportional to T12, T28, T3j. If the above-mentioned
 condition be not satisfied, the triangle is imaginary, and the
 three fluids cannot rest in contact, the two weaker tensions,
 even if acting in full concert, being incapable of balancing
 the strongest. For instance, if T3) > T12 4- T2S, the second

      The experimenters who have dealt with this question,
  Marangoni, Van der Mensbrugghe, Quincke, have all arrived
 at results inconsistent with the reality of Neumann's triangle.
 Thus Marangoni says* :—" Die gemeinschaftliche Oberflache
  zweier Fliissigkeiten hat eine geringere Oberflachenspannung
 als die Differenz der Oberflachenspannung der Fliissig
 keiten selbst (mit Ausnahme des Quecksilbers)." Three pure
 bodies (of which one may be air) cannot accordingly remain
 in contact. If a drop of oil stands in lenticular form upon a
 surface of water, it is because the water-surface is already
 contaminated with a greasy film.
     On the theoretical side the question is open until we intro
 duce some limitation upon the generality of the functions.
 By far the simplest supposition open to us is that the functions
 are the same in all cases, the attractions differing merely by
 coefficients analogous to densities in the theory of gravitation.
 This hypothesis was suggested by Laplace, and may con
 veniently be named after him. It was also tacitly adopted by
 Young, in connexion with the still more special hypothesis
 which Young probably had in view, namely that the force in
 each case was constant within a limited range, the same in all
 cases, and vanished outside that range.
     As an immediate consequence of this hypothesis we have
from (3)
                               K = K0<r«,                          (44)

where K0, T0 are the same for all bodies.
     But the most interesting results are those which Young f
deduced relative to the interfacial tensions of three bodies.
By (12), (43),

According to (47), the interfacial tension between any two
bodies is proportional to the square of the difference of their
densities. The densities alf <r2, <r3 being in descending order
of magnitude, we may write
            Tsi = (<ri -<r2 + <r2- <r8)2T0
                = Ti2 + Tj3 + 2(<r, - <r2) (<r2 - <r3)T0 ;
so that T2l necessarily exceeds the sum of the other two inter
facial tensions. We are thus led to the important conclusion,
 so far as I am aware hitherto unnoticed, that according to this
 hypothesis Neumann's triangle is necessarily imaginary, that
 one of three fluids will always spread upon the interface of
 the other two.
    Another point of importance may be easily illustrated by
 this theory, viz. the dependency of capillarity upon abrupt
 ness of transition. " The reason why the capillary force should
 disappear when the transition between two liquids is sufficiently
 gradual will now be evident. Suppose that the transition
 from 0 to a is made in two equal steps, the thickness of the
 intermediate layer of density           being large compared to the
 range of the molecular forces, but small in comparison with
 the radius of curvature. At each step the difference of capil
 lary pressure is only one quarter of that due to the sndden
 transition from 0 to a, and thus altogether half the effect is
 lost by the interposition of the layer. If there were three
 equal steps, the effect would be reduced to one third, and so
 on. When the number of steps is infinite, the capillary
 pressure disappears altogether." *
     According to Laplace s hypothesis the whole energy of any
 number of contiguous strata of liquids is least when they are
  arranged in order of density, so that this is the disposition
  favoured by the attractive forces. The problem is to make
  the sum of the interfacial tensions a minimum, each tension
  being proportional to the square of the difference of densities
  of the two contiguous liquids in question. If the order of
  stratification differ from that of densities, we can show that
  each step of approximation to this order lowers the sum of
  tensions. To this end consider the effect of the abolition of
 a stratum 0-„+j, contiguous to <rn and <r„+2. Before the
  change we have (<r„ - <r„+i)2 + (<rn+i - <r«+2)2, and afterwards
  (an- <rn+2)2. The second minus the first, or the increase in

the sum of tensions, is thus
                    2(<7-„- <rn+i) (cr„+l - ax+2).
Hence, if <rn+1 be intermediate in magnitude between <rn and
<rn+2, the sum of tensions is increased by the abolition of the
stratum ; but, if <rn+i be not intermediate, the sum is de
creased. We see, then, that the removal of a stratum from
between neighbours where it is out of order and its intro
duction between neighbours where it will be in order is
doubly favourable to the reduction of the sum of tensions ;
and since by a succession of such steps we may arrive at the
order of magnitude throughout, we conclude that this is the
disposition of minimum tensions and energy.
    So far the results of Laplace's hypothesis are in marked
accordance with experiment ; but if we follow it out further,
discordances begin to manifest themselves. According to (47)
                   X/T11=V/T11+V/TM,                        (48)
a relation not verified by experiment. What is more, (47)
shows that according to the hypothesis Tu is necessarily
positive ; so that, if the preceding argument be correct, no
such thing as mixture of two liquids could ever take place.
    But although this hypothesis is clearly too narrow for the
facts, it may be conveniently employed in illustration of the
general theory. In extension of (25) the potential at any
point may be written
                   N^aU{f)dxdydz,                           (49)
and the hydrostatical equation of equilibrium is
                  dp=adV                                    (50)
    By means of the potential we may prove, independently of
the idea of surface tension, that three fluids cannot rest in
 contact. Along the surface of contact of any two fluids the
 potential must be constant. Otherwise, there would be a
 tendency to circulation round a circuit of which the principal
 parts are close and parallel to the surface, but on opposite

 sides. For in the limit the variation of potential will be
 equal and opposite in the two parts of the circuit, and the
 resulting forces at corresponding points, being proportional
 also to the densities, will not balance. It is thus necessary to
 equilibrium that there be no force at any point ; that is, that
 the potential be constant along the whole interface.

 466                      Lord Rayleigh on the
     It follows from this that if three fluids can rest in contact,
 the potential must have the same constant value on all the
 three intersecting interfaces. But this is clearly impossible,
 the potential on each being proportional to the sum of the
 densities of the two contiguous fluids, as we see by considering
 places sufficiently removed from the point of intersection.
    According to Laplace's hypothesis, then, three fluids cannot
rest in contact ; but the case is altered if one of the bodies be
 solid. It is necessary, however, that the quality of solidity attach
to the body of intermediate density. For suppose, for example
 (fig. 9), that the body of greatest                Fig. 9.
 density, <r,, is solid, and thatfiuids of
 densities <r2, cr3 touch it and one
 another. It is now no longer neces
 sary that the potential be constant
along the interfaces (1, 2), (1,3) ; but only along the interface
 (3, 2). The potential at a distant point of this interface may
 be represented by <r2 + <r3. But at the point of intersection
the potential cannot be so low as this, being at least equal to
°i + °j> even if the angle formed by the two faces of (2) be
evanescent. By this and similar reasoning it follows that the
conditions of equilibrium cannot be satisfied, unless the solid
be the body of intermediate density <r2.
    One case where equilibrium is possible admits of very
simple treatment. It occurs when <r2 = £ (al + <r3), and the con
ditions are satisfied by supposing (tig. 10) that the fluid interface
is plane and perpendicular to the solid              Fig, io.
wall. At a distance from O the
potential is represented by 0-i + 0-3 >
and the same value obtains at a point
P, near O, where the sphere of in
fluence cuts into (2). For the areas of
spherical surface lost by (I) and (3)
are equal, and are replaced by equal
areas of ( 2) ; so that if the above con
dition between the densities holds
good, the potential is constant all the way up to O. The
sub-case, where <r3 = 0, <r2=i<r, was given by Clairaut.
    If the intermediate densities differ from the mean of the
other two, the problem is less simple ; but the general
tendency is easily recognized. If, for example, <r3 > i(<r, + <r3),
it is evident that along a perpendicular interface the potential
would increase as O is approached. To compensate this the
interface must be inclined, so that, as 0 is approached, <j\
loses its importance relatively to 0-3. In this case therefore
the angle between the two faces of (1) must be acute.

a form given by Laplace. In discussing the equation (53)
with <r3 = 0, Young* remarks:—"Supposing the attractive
density of the solid to be very small, the cosine will approach
to -1, and the angle of the liquid to two right angles ; and on
the other hand, when <r2 becomes equal to <rj, the cosine will
be 1, and the angle will be evanescent, the surface of the
liquid coinciding in direction with that of the solid. If the
density tr2 be still further increased, the angle cannot undergo
any further alteration, and the excess of force will only tend
 to spread the liquid more rapidly on the solid, so that a thin
film would always be found upon its surface, unless it were
 removed by evaporation, or unless its formation were pre
vented by some unknown circumstance which seems to lessen
 the intimate nature of the contact of liquids with dry solids."
    The calculation of the angle of contact upon these lines is
thus exceedingly simple, but I must admit that I find some
difficulty in forming a definite conception of superficial
tension as applied to the interface of a solid and a fluid. It
would seem that interfacial tension can only be employed in
such cases as the immediate representative of interfacial energy,

as conceived by Gauss. This principle, applied to a hypo
thetical displacement in which the point of meeting travels
along the wall, leads with rigour to the required result.
   In view of the difficulties which have been felt upon this
subject, it seems desirable to show that the calculation of the
angle of contact can be made without recourse to the principle
of interfacial tension or energy. This indeed was effected by
Laplace himself, but his process is very circuitous. Let
OP M be the surface of fluid (oj resting against a solid wall
0 N of density <rt. Suppose also that <r2 - 0, and that there
is no external pressure on O M. At a point M at a sufficient
distance from O the curvature must be uniform (or the
potential could not be constant), and we will suppose it to be
zero. It would be a mistake,                       p.. ^
however, to think that the sur
face can be straight throughout
up to 0. This we may recog
nize by consideration of the po
tential at a point P just near
 enough to O for the sphere of
influence to cut the solid. As soon as this occurs, the po
tential would begin to vary by substitution of tr2 for <rj, and
equilibrium would fail. The argument does not apply if
 6>=£7r.
    We may attain the object in view by considering the
 equilibrium of the fluid M N O, or rather of the forces which
 tend to move it parallel to O N. Of pressures we have only
 to consider that which acts across M N, for on O M there is no
 pressure, and that on O N has no component in the direction
 considered. Moreover, the solid <r2 below O N exercises no
 attraction parallel to ON. Equilibrium therefore demands
 that the pressure operative across M N shall balance the hori
 zontal attraction exercised upon 0 M N by the fluid c-j which
 lies to the right of M N. The evaluation of the attraction in
 such cases has been already treated. It is represented by
 M N . ct^Kq, subject to corrections for the ends at M and N.
 The correction for M is by (41) <Xi2T0(2 sec 0- cos 0), and for
 N it is ct^Tq. On the whole the attraction in question is there

 We have next to consider the pressure. In the interior of
 M N, we have <ri9K0 ; but the whole pressure M N . oi»K0 is
 subject to corrections for the ends. The correction for M we
 have seen to be 2<ri2T0 sec 0. In the neighbourhood of N the
 potential, and therefore the pressure, is influenced by the

                    <r,(l - cos 0) =2(<r, - <r2).
    In connexion with edge-angles it may be well here to refer
to a problem, which has been the occasion of much difference
of opinion—that of the superposition of several liquids in
a capillary tube. Laplace's investigation led him to the con
clusion that the whole weight of liquid raised depends only
upon the properties of the lowest liquid. Thereupon Young*
remarks :—" This effect may be experimentally illustrated by
introducing a minute quantity of oil on the surface of the
water contained in a capillary tube, the joint elevation,
instead of being increased as it ought to be according to Mr.
Laplace, is very conspicuously diminished ; and it is obvious
that since the capillary powers are represented by the squares
of the density of oil and of its difference from that of water,
their sum must be less than the capillary power of water,
which is proportional to the square of the sum of the separate
quantities."
    But the question is not to be dismissed so summarily.
That Laplace's conclusion is sound, upon the supposition that
none of the liquids wets the walls of the tube, may be shown
without difficulty by the method of energy. In a hypothetical
 displacement the work done against gravity will balance the
 work of the capillary forces. Now it is evident that the
 liquids, other than the lowest, contribute nothing to the latter,
 since the relation of each liquid to its neighbours and to the
 walls of the tube is unaltered by the displacement. The only
 effect of the rise is that a length of the tube before in contact
 with air is replaced by an equal length in contact with the
 lowest liquid. The work of the capillary forces is the same
 as if the upper liquids did not exist, and therefore the total
 weight of the column supported is independent of these
 liquids.

   The case of Young's experiment, in which oil stands upon
water in a glass tube, is not covered by the foregoing reason
ing. The oil must be supposed to wet the glass, that is to
insinuate itself between the glass and air, so that the upper
part of the tube is covered to a great height with a very thin
layer of oil. The displacement here takes place under con
ditions very different from before. As the column rises, no
new surface of glass is touched by oil, while below water
replaces oil. The properties of the oil are thus brought into
play, and Laplace's theorem does not apply.
   That theory indicates the almost indefinite rise of a liquid
like oil in contact with a vertical wall of glass is often over
looked, in spite of Young's explicit statement quoted above.
It may be of interest to look into the question more narrowly
on the basis of Laplace's hypothesis.
    If we include gravity in our calculations, the hydrostatic
equation of equilibrium is
                     p = const. + o\ -gpz,                  (56)
where z is measured upwards, and V denotes as before the
potential of the cohesive forces. Along the free surface of
the liquid the pressure is constant, so that
                        <rY = a>K0 + gpz,                   (57)
t being reckoned from a place where the liquid is deep and
the surface plane.
    At a point upon the surface, whose distance from the wall
exceeds the range of the forces,
                    *V = K + T(l+l);            ....         (58)
or, if we take the problem in two dimensions,
                           "V = K+|,                         (59)
 where R is the radius of curvature, and K, T denote the in
 trinsic pressure and tension proper to the liquid and pro
 portional to a3. Upon this equation is founded the usual
calculation of the form of the surface.
    When the point under consideration is nearer to the wall
 than the range of the forces, the above expression no longer
applies. The variation of V on the surface of the thin layer
 which rises above the meniscus is due not to variations of
 curvature, for the curvature is here practically evanescent,
 but to the inclusion within the sphere of influence of the
 more dense matter constituting the wall. If the attraction

be a simple function of the distance, such as those considered
above in illustrative examples, the thickness of the layer
diminishes constantly with increasing height. The limit is
reached when the thickness vanishes, and the potential attains
the value due simply to the solid wall. This potential is
ct'K0, the intrinsic pressure within the wall being o^K0 ; so
that if we compare the point above where the layer of fluid
disappears with a point below upon the horizontal surface,
we find
                         ffP3 = a{oJ-a)K0                           (60)
By this equation is given the total head of liquid in contact
with the wall; and, as was to be expected, it is enormous.
   The height of the meniscus itself in a very narrow tube
wetted by the liquid is obtained from (57), (58). If R be
the radius of curvature at the centre of the meniscus,
                            gpz=2T/R;                               (61)
and R may be identified with the radius of the tube, for
under the circumstances supposed the meniscus is very ap
 proximately hemispherical.
   The calculation of the height by the method of energy
requires a little attention. The simplest displacement is an
equal movement upwards of the whole body of liquid, in
cluding the layer above the meniscus. In this case the work of
 the cohesive forces depends upon the substitution of liquid for
air in contact with the tube, and therefore not merely upon
the interfacial tension between liquid and air, as (61) might
lead us to suppose. The fact is that in this way of regarding
the subject the work which compensates that of the cohesive
 forces is not simply the elevation against gravity of the
column (z), but also an equal elevation of the very high,
 though very thin, layer situated above it. The complication
 thus arising may be avoided by taking the hypothetical dis
 placement so that the thin layer does not accompany the
 column (2). In this case the work of the cohesive forces
 depends upon a reduction of surface between liquid and air
 simply, without reference to the properties of the walls, and
 (61) follows immediately.
    Laplace's integral K was, as we have seen, introduced
 originally to express the intrinsic pressure, but according
 to the discovery of Dupre'* it is susceptible of another
 and very important interpretation. " Le travail de des-

ce qui ^quivant, le travail de d^sagregation totale de l'unite-
de volume ^gale I'attraction au contact." Attraction au
contact here means what we have called intrinsic pressure.
The following reasoning is substantially that of Dupre\
   We have seen (2) that %irm<rty'(z) represents the attraction
of a particle m placed at distance z from the plane surface of
an infinite solid whose density is a. The work required to
carry m from z - i) to z=x> is therefore

                             Jo
by (4) ; so that the work necessary to separate a superficial
layer of thickness dz from the rest of the mass and to carry
it beyond the range of the attraction is afyzK^. The com
plete disaggregation of unit of volume into infinitesimal slices
demands accordingly an amount of work represented by
<r2K0, or K. The work required further to separate the
infinitesimal slices into component filaments or particles and
to remove them beyond the range of the mutual attraction is
negligible in the limit, so that K is the total work of complete
disaggregation.
   A second law formulated by Dupre is more difficult to
accept. " Pour un meme corps prenant des volumes varies,
le travail de desegregation restant a accomplir est propor-
tionel a la densite ou en raison inverse du volume." The
argument is that the work remaining to be done upon a given
mass at any stage of the expansion is proportional first to the
square of the density, and secondly to the actual volume, on
the whole therefore inversely as the volume. The criticism
that I am inclined to make here is that Dupre's theory
attempts either too little or too much. If we keep strictly
within the lines of Laplace's theory the question here dis
cussed cannot arise, because the body is supposed to be
incompressible. That bodies are in fact compressible may
be so much the worse for Laplace's theory, but I apprehend
that the defect cannot be remedied without a more extensive
modification than Dupre^ attempts. In particular, it would
be necessary to take into account the work of compression.
We cannot leave the attractive forces unbalanced ; and the
work of the repulsive forces can only be neglected upon the
hypothesis that the compressibility itself is negligible. Indeed
it seems to me, that a large part of Dupr«5's work, important
and suggestive as it is, is open to a fundamental objection.
He makes free use of the two laws of thermodynamics, and
at the same time rests upon a molecular theory which is too
narrow to hold them. One is driven to ask what is the real

                      Theory of Surface Forces'              473
nature of this heat, of which we hear so much. It seems
hopeless to combine thermodynamics with a merely statical
view of the constitution of matter.
   On these grounds I find it difficult to attach a meaning to
such a theorem as that enunciated in the following terms* :—
" La derivee partielle du travail mecanique interne prise
par rapport au volume egale l'attraction par metre carre qu'
exercent l'une sur l'autre les deux parties du corps situees
desdeux cotes d'une section plane," viz. the intrinsic pressure.
In the partial differentiation the volume is supposed to vary
and the temperature is supposed to remain constant. The
difficulty of the first part of the supposition has been already
touched upon ; and how in a fundamental theory can we
suppose temperature to be constant without knowing what it
is? It is possible, however, that some of these theorems
may be capable of an interpretation which shall roughly fit
the facts, and it is worthy of consideration how far they may
be regarded as applicable to matter in a state of extreme cold.
   With respect to the value of K, Young's estimate of 23,000
atmospheres for water has already been referred to. It is
not clear upon what basis he proceeded, but a chance remark
suggests that it may have been upon the assumption that
cohesion was of the same order of magnitude in liquids and
solids. Against this, however, it may be objected that the
estimate is unduly high. Even steel is scarcely capable of
withstanding a tension of 23,000 atmospheres.
   So far as I am aware, the next estimates of K are those of
Dupre. One of them proceeds upon the assumption that for
rough purposes K may be identified with the mechanical
equivalent of the heat rendered latent in the evaporation of
the liquid, that in fact evaporation may be regarded as a
process of disaggregation in which the cohesive forces have
to be overcome. This view appears to be substantially sound.
If we take the latent heat of water as 600°, we find for the
work required to disintegrate one gram of water
                  . . 600x4-2xl07C.G.S.
One atmosphere is about 10° C.G.S. ; so that
                      K = 25,000 atmospheres.
The estimates of his predecessors were apparently unknown
to Van der Waals, who (in 1873) undertook his work mainly
with the object of determining the quantity in question. He
finds for water 11,000 atmospheres. Ihe application of
Clausius's equation of virial to gases and liquids is obviously

present paper, I must content myself with referring the reader
to the original memoir and to the account of it by Maxwell*.
    One of the most remarkable features of Young's treatise is
his estimate of the range a of the attractive force on the
basis of the relation T=£aK. Never once have I seen it
alluded to ; and it is, I believe, generally supposed that the
first attempt of the kind is not more than twenty years' old.
Estimating K at 23,000 atmospheres, and T at 3 grains per
inch, Young finds t that "the extent of the cohesive force
must be limited to about the 260 millionth of an inch ;" and
he continues, " nor is it very probable that any error in tho
suppositions adopted can possibly have so far invalidated this
result as to have made it very many times greater or less than
the truth." It detracts nothing from the merit of this won
derful speculation that a more precise calculation does not
verify the numerical coefficient in Young's equation. The
point is that the range of the cohesive force is necessarily of
the order T/K.
    But this is not all. Young continues :—" Within similar
limits of uncertainty, we may obtain something like a con
jectural estimate of the mutual distance of the particles of
vapours, and even of the actual magnitude of the elementary
atoms of liquids, as supposed to be nearly in contact with
 each other ; for if the distance at which the force of cohesion
 begins is constant at the same temperature, and if the particles
 of steam are condensed when they approach within this dis
 tance, it follows that at 60° of Fahrenheit the distance of the
 particles of pure aqueous vapour is about the 250 millionth of
 an inch ; and since the density of this vapour is about one
 sixty thousandth of that of water, the distance of the particles
 must be about forty times as great ; consequently the mutual
 distance of the particles of water must be about the ten
 thousand millionth of an inch. It is true that the result of
 this calculation will differ considerably according to the
 temperature of the substances compared. . . . This discor
 dance does not, however, wholly invalidate the general tenour
 of the conclusion . . . and on the whole it appears tolerably
 safe to conclude that, whatever errors may have affected the
 determination, the diameter or distance of the particles of
  water is between the two thousand and the ten thousand
  millionth of an inch." This passage, in spite of its great
  interest, has been so completely overlooked that I nave.

  ventured briefly to quote it, although the question of the size
  of atoms lies outside the scope of the present paper.
     Another matter of great importance to capillary theory I
  will only venture to touch upon. When oil spreads upon
  water, the layer formed is excessively thin, about two
  millionths of a millimetre. If the layer be at first thicker, it
  exhibits instability, becoming perforated with holes. These
  gradually enlarge, until at last, after a series of curious trans
  formations, the superfluous oil is collected in small lenses. It
  would seem therefore that the energy is less when the water
  is covered by a very thin layer of oil, than when the layer is
  thicker. Phenomena of this kind present many complications,
 for which various causes may be suggested, such as solubility,
 volatility, and—perhaps more important still—chemical hetero
 geneity. It is at present, I think, premature to draw definite
 physical conclusions ; but we may at least consider what is
 implied in the preference for a thin as compared with a
 thicker film.
         Fig. 13.              Fig. 14.               Fig. 15.
    The passage from the first state to the second may be
 accomplished in the manner indicated in figs. 13, 14, 15. We
begin (fig. 13) with a thin layer of oil on water and an
independent thick layer of oil. In the second stage
 (fig. 14) the thick layer is split into two, also thick in com
parison with the range of the cohesive forces, and the two
parts are separated. In the third stage one of the component
layers is brought down until it coalesces with the thin layer
on water. The last state differs from the first by the substitu
tion of a thick film of oil for a thin one in contact with the
water, and we have to consider the work spent or gained in
producing the change. If, as observation suggests, the last
state has more energy than the first, it follows that more
work is spent in splitting the thick layer of oil than is gained
in the approach of a thick layer to the already oiled water.
At some distances therefore, and those not the smallest, oil
must be more attracted (or less repelled) by oil than by water.
The reader will not fail to notice the connexion between this
subject and the black of soap-films, investigated by Profs.

           LIII. On the Deformation of Twisted Strips.
                       By G. H. Bryan *.
IN the March number of the Philosophical Magazine (p. 244)
      Professor Perry has described the behaviour of a twisted
strip of metal when its ends are pulled apart, and has investi
gated formulae to determine the untwisting produced. It
seemed, however, that Prof. Perry's theory hardly afforded a
satisfactory explanation of the phenomena, and the idea
occurred to me that a better clue to the correct solution
might be obtained by considering the problem as a particular
case of the deformation of a thin plate. I have pursued this
method in the present paper, and the results obtained will, I
think, be fonnd to agree very well with those found by expe
riment and described in Prof. Perrv's paper.
   It will be convenient to denote the breadth of the strip by
2a and its thickness by 2A, instead of using b and t respect
ively. We suppose h to be small in comparison with a, so
that the strip can be treated as a thin plate. Let the strip,
originally supposed plane, be twisted about its middle line
into a helicoid, the twist per unit length being <f>. If we
consider a fibre of the material whose distance from the axis
is x, its elongation per unit length will bo
   In the helicoid the lines of principal curvature will every
where cut the generating lines at an angle of 45°. If % is the
inclination to the axis of the tangent plane at the point x,

    We shall now make the assumption that the twist is suffi

also it'ip2, in comparison with unity. Now atp is the whole
angle of twist in a length of the strip equal to half its breadth,
and this will certainly be small in all cases of practical interest;
 moreover the results which we shall obtain will fully justify
 our assumption. To this order of approximation the elongation

     We now suppose that the strip is permanently twisted so
 that the helicoidal form may be taken as the unstrained state.
 We proceed to calculate the potential energy per unit length
 when the strip undergoes a small axial elongation e per unit
 length and when its twist is increased by a small amount t.
 In consequence of the lateral contraction due to longitudinal
 elongation, the distance of any point from the axis will be
 altered ; let the point x thus become displaced to a distance
 x + u from the axis. To our order of approximation, the
strains in the middle surface will be

on the stretching of the middle surface and involving the cube of the
thickness. These can, however, in the present case, be safely neglected
in comparison with the corresponding terms involving the first power of
the thickness. It is different with the terms depending on bending, as
bending may be large in comparison with the stretching.

The square root in this expression is equal to 2{ if «.= 5=, and

is equal to 2£ if <r= ^ ; hence for ordinary substances it ia
intermediate between 2£ and 2^. We see that if the strip is
thin, so that A is small compared with a, the above value of a<p
will be small. This shows that the maximum value of 8 will
occur well within the limits in which our approximation is valid.
    This maximum value is

In order that the strip may be sensitive, 8 must be large for
a given value of w. If the area 4aA of the cross section be
kept constant, this result may be brought about by making A
as small as possible, and this fact affords a further justification
of the present method of treatment.
    When 6 is approaching the maximum, its rate of increase
will of course become less rapid, and after this maximum
has been passed, 8 will diminish still more slowly than it
increased. Thus if we call 6' the maximum value of 8 and
j>' the corresponding value of          the relation between 6 and

This relation may be exhibited graphically by tracing the
cubic curve                          <%x
where x=$jtf, y=8/0' (see figure).
   The greatest negative value of dyjdx is = - \ and occurs
when a= */3, while when i = 0 we have dy/d-jc=2. This

  480            Mr. J. Trowbridge on the Motion of

  maximum is only £ of its initial rate of increase.

  and if <j> be further increased beyond 3d>', the rate of diminu
  tion of 6 will become less and less rapid.
      We also notice that the maximum value of 6 is inversely
  proportional to ah3, thus agreeing pretty closely with the
  results of Prof. Perry's first experiments.
      When <f> is large compared with <f>' my formula gives
  approximately
                                H>Eha3<f>'
  Owing, however, to our assumption that a<j) is small compared
  with unity, little value can be attached to this result. It can
  only hold if the strip is very thin indeed, and a<f> is a small
  quantity intermediate in order of magnitude between A/a and
  unity.

  ri^HE application of spectrum analysis to the measurement
    A of the approach or recession of a star in a direction
  directly away or directly toward an observer's eye is generally
   regarded as one of the greatest achievements of modern
  science. Experiments upon the oscillating discharge of elec
  tricity led me to reflect whether the method which has been
  used in star-observation might not be employed to test the
  question whether the atoms of the metals of the terminals
  between which the oscillating discharge passes are conveyed
  to and fro by the oscillating discharge, or whether they are
  shaken, so to speak, by the discharge so that they emit to the
  aether the ripples which appeal to our senses as light and
  heat. No mention is made here of a convection effect, which
  would take place too slowly to give a spectroscopic effect.
      Alter 1 had made the experiments which I will shortly
  describe, and while I was in doubt whether to publish my
  result?, a ] aper by Professor J. J. Thomson, director of the
  Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, England, appeared in the

August number of the Philosophical Magazine (1890), "On
the Velocity of the Transmission of Electric Disturbances,"
which contains the following passage : —
   " The very rapid rate with which the electric discharge is
propagated through a rare gas compels us to admit that the
electricity is not carried by charged atoms moving with this
velocity. For if it were, then if the discharge were to take
place in air at atmospheric pressure between two parallel
plates one centimetre apart, charged to a potential difference
of approximately 30,000 volts, the kinetic energy which would
have to be communicated to the atoms to make them move
with this velocity would be greater than the original potential
energy of the charged plates, assuming that the charge on
each atom is that deduced from electrolytic considerations."
   The unusual dispersion afforded by a Rowland concave
grating led me to test this hypothesis in as far as it relates to
the question, Are the molecules of metals carried with the
oscillations of electricity from terminal to terminal between
which the oscillations take place?
   A circuit of wire giving a suitable value of self-induction
was arranged in connexion with a series of Leyden jars. The
time of oscillation was calculated from the well-known for
mula Z = 27r\/Lt', in which L is the value of the self-induction
of the circuit, 0 the capacity of the Leyden jars. Preliminary
examination of the electric spark taken through this circuit
with a revolving mirror showed that the discharge was an
oscillatory one. Two different values of s'.'lf-induction were
employed. One gave the duration of a double oscillation
£ = .0000003 of a second, the other gave t = -0000024 of a
second.
   If we denote by V the velocity of light, - \ and X wave
lengths, S the speed of approach of the atom, we shall have
X= ^ y            The distance across which the oscillations took
place is 6 millimetres. Calculation shows that if the iron
atoms were conveyed to and fro between the terminals, a
broadening of the iron lines in the spectrum would result
which could be readily detected. The broadening might
amount to a space equivalent to a whole tenth-metre.
   The oscillating spark passed between two iron terminals.
One of these terminals was hollow. The hollow terminal was
placed in a line perpendicular to the slit, of the spectroscope,
so that the oscillation of the spark should bo toward and away
from the slit. If therefore the iron atoms moved to and fro
with the oscillations of electricity across the air-gap, a dis

placement of the iron lines in the spectrum of .the metal would
result. There would be both a displacement toward the less
refrangible end caused by the recession of the atom, and one
toward the more refrangible end of the spectrum caused by
the approach of the atom. The great amount of dispersion
afforded by a concave grating of 20,000 lines to the inch
enabled me to easily detect a movement equivalent to a tenth-
metre. I accordingly took a photograph of the iron lines
with the terminals in the position I have described, and on
the same plate immediately above this photograph a com
parison photograph was taken with the terminals paralled to
the slit. In this cage the iron atoms did not make their sup
posed excursions away and toward the slit, and therefore no
displacement of the spectrum-lines was to be expected.
   The photographic plate was exposed in the neighbourhood
of the great H-lines. A movable shutter enabled me to
expose different portions of the same plate without changing
any adjustments of the apparatus. The resulting photographs
showed no displacement of the iron-lines. The iron-lines in
the two photographs met exactly (continued in an unbroken
line across the double photograph), and were of the same
 breadth throughout their extent (see figure).
   The conclusion seems to be a strong one that the electrical
oscillations do not carry the atoms of metals with them—in
spark-discharges. The atom is merely shaken up and caused
to emit the vibrations or subsidiary ripples which appeal to
our senses as light and heat, while the electrical waves pass
on without conveying the atoms.

  LV. The Greater Influence of First Quantities of Electrolytes
     on Volta-Electromotive Force. By Dr. G. Gore, F.E.S.*
 IN thermochemical research, Favre and others observed
       that, on adding equal quantities of water in succession to
 a fixed amount, either of nitric or sulphuric acid, the quantity
 of heat evolved was greater with the first than with any
 succeeding dilution (Watts's ' Dictionary of Chemistry,' vol.iii.
 p. 310) ; and similar effects were noticed by J. Thomsen on
 diluting concentrated hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydri-
 odic acids. Nicol has observed that the total contraction of
 volume of a saline solution increases with the proportion of
 dissolved salt, and that each successive equivalent weight of
 the salt produces less contraction. Kohlrausch and others
                    * Communicated by the Author.

 484    Dr. Gore on the Greater Influence of First Quantities
 have also shown that very minute proportions of dissolved
 acids, salts, <fcc. exercise a relatively great influence upon
 the electric conduction-resistance of pure water ; and I have
 found " that a much greater increase of electromotive force is
 usually caused by the first amount of substance added to the
 water than by the subsequent amounts " (" On a New Method
 and Department of Chemical .Research," Phil. Mag. May 1890,
 p. 421), and have given a number of instances. According
 to the researches of M. Lindeck also {Ann. Phys. Chem. [2]
 vol. xxxv. pp. 311-331), whilst the first portion of zinc added
 to mercury increases its electromotive force in electrolytes,
 further additions have scarcely any effect.
    In the present research I have extended the inquiry, and
 have not only examined the effect of adding equal quantities
 in succession of acids and salts to a fixed amount of water,
 but of water to fixed amounts of acids and salts, and of bases
 to acids, upon the electromotive force of a simple voltaic
 couple immersed in the water at ordinary atmospheric tempe
 ratures. The electromotive force was measured by the method
 of balance, with the aid of a suitable thermoelectric pile of
 iron and German silver (see Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc. vol. iv.
 p. 130 ; 'The Electrician/ 1884, vol. xii. p. 414), and a dif
ferential astatic galvanometer having 50 ohms' resistance in
each coil.
    In consequence of the following circumstances very little
 error or inconvenience was caused by polarization:—(1) all
 the measurements were made at the null-point, when no per
 ceptible current was passing ; (2) by experience in working,
 the null-point could be almost instantly attained ; (3) the
 metals were only immersed during a very short period of time;
 (4) the positive metal was cleaned each time before immersion;
 (5) the platinum was washed each time, and heated to redness
occasionally ; and (6) to test whether the energy of the couple
remained unchanged, it was occasionally balanced in distilled
water by a similar freshly prepared one in distilled water.
   The relatively great increase of electromotive force with a
zinc-platinum couple, on adding the first unit quantity of
chlorine, bromine, iodine, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hy-
driodic, nitric, and sulphuric acid, and the chlorides, bromides,
iodides, and sulphates of potassium and sodium, and certain
other salts, to a fixed amount of water, have already been shown
in the paper referred to (Phil. Mag. May 1890, p. 421).
   The similar large effects upon a cadmium-platinum couple
in the reverse process of adding the first unit quantity of water
to a fixed amount of hydrochloric, sulphuric, and nitric acid
are shown by the following curves. The electromotive force

          of Electrolytes on Volta-electromotive Force.       485
of the couple in distilled water at 20° C. was -85 volt. The
constant difference or unit quantity of water added to each
acid was 89-1 grains. In order to obtain more reliable results,
and to make the conditions more alike, and to obtain curves
more comparable with each other, each acid was so far diluted
previous to adding the first unit quantity of water as to con
tain one equivalent weight proportion, in lOOths of a grain of
absolute acid, in 18 grains of water ; for instance, the starting-
point solution of hydrochloric acid contained '365 grain of
HC1 in that amount of water.
   The electromotive force of the couple in pure concentrated
hydrochloric acid containing 5-81 grains of H(J1 per cubic
centimetre at 15°-6 was 1-235 volt ; in pure concentrated
sulphuric acid it was 1-278 ; and in pure concentrated
nitric acid it was 1-477 volt, each at 20°-5 C. Those elec
tromotive forces, especially that of nitric acid, are much less
accurate than those obtained with the same acids when diluted
as above.

   On examining these curves, the greater effect of the first
unit quantity of water added to the acid than the succeeding
ones is distinctly visible in each case. On comparing them
with those obtained by adding unit quantities of the same
acids to water (Phil. Mag. May 1890, p. 421), we find that
the greater effects of the first added unit quantities of acid
were much more conspicuous than those of the first added
unit quantities of water ; and that whilst the first quantities
of acids added to water increased the electromotive force, the
first quantities of water added to acids decreased it. The less
conspicuous effects produced by adding water to acids than
by acids to water, were probably due to the circumstance that
the acids had each been already largely diluted, about 30 to
50 times their weight, before adding the first units of water
to them. In confirmation of this statement, I have found
by experimental measurements that both with hydrochloric
and with sulphuric acid the greater influence of the first added
unit of water was more conspicuous when the acids were less
diluted beforehand.
   The results obtained with these three acids indicate that the
greater influence of the first added unit quantity of water is
not limited to water added to absolute acid, but extends to
 that added to acid already considerably diluted, and therefore
the property under consideration is a more general one.
    I have similarly examined the effect of adding successive
 unit quantities of water to a saturated aqueous solution of
 potassium chloride, containing 25-0 grains of the salt in 77-5
 grains of water, upon the electromotive force of a zinc-
platinum couple, The annexed curve shows the results :—

                 Tote.
                            Grains of water.
  The greater effect of the first added unit quantity is in this
case also clearly manifested.
  With the object of arriving at seme idea of the relative
amounts of effect of the first and last unit portions of potas
sium chloride added to water, and to obtain a complete curve
of electromotive force of that salt in water, the degrees of
electromotive force with a zinc-platinum couple were mea
sured, using five series of aqueous solutions of the salt, com
prising the entire range from water to a saturated solution.
In order also to show the manifest effect of an extremely
minute quantity in the first addition, and not to extend the
entire curve to an extraordinary length, it was found neces
sary to divide the entire range into five sections, and to
increase the magnitude of the unit quantity to ten times its
amount in each successive section ; the unit quantities added,
therefore, are 10,000 times larger in the last section than in
the first one.

    These curves and numbers show that increasing the unit
 quantity of salt added from -0005 grain in the first section to
 5 grains or 10,000 times the amount, in the last one, only
 produced about 5'27 times the amount of average difference
 of electromotive force, and therefore the addition of the same
 weight (i. e. -0005 grain) had only about one 18y7th part
 of the average effect upon the electromotive force in the series
 of strong solutions that it had in the weak ones.
    In all these cases the phenomenon was produced, either by
increasing the degree of dilution or that of concentration of
the- liquid, and not by strong chemical union. In order

            of Electrolytes on Volta-electromotive Force.       491
therefore to ascertain whether the same effect occurred when
two electrolytic substances united chemically together I made
two experiments, in each of which the combined influences of
dilution and strong chemical union cooperated together. I
took in each experiment the same fixed quantity of the same
mixture of -365 grain of hydrochloric acid and 18 grains of
water as before, and added to this diluted acid four unit
quantities in succession of a mixture of -088 grain of NaC2O2
and 89-l grains of water in one experiment, and -115 grain
of KjCOj and 89-1 grains of water in the other. The tot'il
quantity of alkali added in each experiment was just sufficient
to neutralize two thirds of the acid. The following curves
show the results :—

   These curves show distinctly, 1st, the greater degree of in
fluence of the first unit quantity of substance added than that
of the succeeding one, and prove the existence of the same
phenomenon in cases of strong chemical nnion ; and, 2nd,
that strong chemical union increased the magnitude of the
phenomenon.
   To determine the influence upon the phenomenon of strong
chemical action alone, apart from that of dilution, I made a
precisely similar experiment to the last one, but employing
anhydrous carbonate of sodium and omitting the unit quan
tities of water. The following curve represents the results : —

   The greater effect of the first unit quantity of the anhydrous
alkali is quite oonspicuous, and is about equal in magnitude
to that of mixed soda and water in the immediately previous
experiment. The amount of such effect, however, obtained
with the first unit quantity of mixed soda and water was not
equal to the united amounts of first effect of dry soda and that
of water alone (see curve, fig. 1).
   I have found the same effect with dilute hydrochloric
acid and the anhydrous carbonates of lithium, sodium, potas
sium, rubidium, barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium, zinc,
and cadmium ; with dilute sulphuric acid and the carbonates
of rubidium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, zinc, and cad
mium ; with dilute nitric acid and the carbonates of sodium
and potassium ; with dilute hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and
hydriodic acids, and carbonate of sodium ; ditto with the car
bonates of calcium and cadmium. In no case has an exception
been observed.
   The curves of electromotive force obtained in this research
and in the one referred to (Philosophical Magazine, May 1890,
p. 421) support in greater or less degree the general conclu
sion, that when successive equal quantities of one electrolyte are
added to a fixed and much larger quantity of another, the first
added quantity has usually a much greater effect than any of
the immediately succeeding ones in altering the amount of electro
motiveforce of a voltaic couple, and consequently also in altering
that of all other properties inseparably related to it.
  This conclusion is further supported by the facts already
mentioned, viz., 1st, that on adding equal quantities of water

           of Electrolytes on Volta-electromotive Force.    493
in succession to a fixed amount of either nitric, sulphuric,
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, or hydriodic acid, the largest
amount of heat is evolved by the first quantity added ; 2nd,
by the diminishing amount of contraction which usually occurs
on adding successive equal portions of a salt to water ; and,
3rd, by the circumstance that on adding equal quantities in
succession, either of an acid or a salt, to water, the electric
conduction-resistance is much more largely diminished by the
first quantity added than by any of the succeeding ones.
    It is evident from these considerations that the property
in question, which I may term " the greater influence of first
quantities," is a very general one of electrolytes, and that the
four several phenomena mentioned are instances of it, and
are probably results of one common cause. The method of
examining this property by means of variations of electro
motive force is very convenient, and the curves thus obtained
implicitly contain more detail of information than those ob
tained by thermal measurements, because they represent more
perfectly integrated effects.
   The relatively greater increase of electric conductivity by
addition of the first unit quantity of acid or salt than by
any succeeding one, has been explained by the theory of
dissociation ; but it is also consistent with the simple
mechanical view that the molecules of the first added unit of
the dissolved substance have greater freedom and velocity of
motion ; the relatively greater electromotive force under those
conditions is also consistent with this idea. The increase of
electromotive force by addition of acid to water, and its de
crease by addition of water to acid, admit of a very simple
explanation. The degree of electromotive force depends partly
upon the average velocity of the molecules of the liquid.
Strong acids possess greater molecular velocity and excite
greater electromotive force than water. By admixture of the
acid and water heat is evolved and the average molecular
velocity of each uniting substance is diminished. When we
add a little water to a large amount of acid, the average mole
cular velocity of the mixture is less than that of the acid,
first, because water has less molecular velocity than the acid,
and, second, because heat is set free and molecular motion is
lost. But when we add a little acid to a large quantity of
water, the average molecular velocity of the mixture is greater
than that of water, because the molecular velocity of the acid
is so much greater than that of water that it more than com
pensates for the loss of motion which occurs in the form of
heat during the act of mixing.

                By Professor A. Gray, M.A*
IN the October number of the Philosophical Magazine is
      an article describing some experiments made by Dr.
Samuel Sheldon on the magnetic effect of rotation of the
plane of polarization of a beam of light transmitted through a
helix of wire. Several years ago I made some experiments
on this subject myself without obtaining any result; and
since coming to the University College of North Wales, I
have resumed the investigation without obtaining any decisive
indication of the effect of which I was in search. My method
of proceeding was, however, quite different from that of Dr.
Sheldon, and failed, I feel sure, simply through the inadequacy
of my arrangements for the detection of what can never be
more than an exceedingly small magnetic force. But before
describing my own experiments, I wish to refer to one or two
of the statements which Dr. Sheldon makes. After describing
the direct experiment of the rotation of the plane of polariza
tion of a beam of plane-polarized light by the creation of a
magnetic field, he says :—
   " Now if a difference of potential, under these conditions,
produces such a rotation of the plane, why should not a rapid
rotation of the plane under exactly the same conditions pro
duce an inverse difference of potential between the terminals
of the coil? A continuous rotation should produce a con
tinuous current of electricity, and an oscillating of the plane
an alternating current. The experiments which have been
performed verify the latter supposition."
   Dr. Sheldon then proposes to produce the " continuous
rotation " of the plane of polarization by rotating the polari
zing prism, but abandons the idea on account of the difficulty
of producing and maintaining a sufficiently high angular
velocity to give any observable effect, and substitutes oscilla
tion of the Nicol for continuous rotation. It seems to me that
the notion that " a continuous rotation should produce a
continuous current of electricity " involves a fallacy which it
may be desirable to point out.
   When a ray of plane-polarized light is subjected to the
action of a magnetic field the lines of force of which are
parallel to the direction of propagation of the beam, the plane
of polarization changes in the medium to a twisted surface.
If the medium be quite uniform, the surface has a uniform
twist from one face to the other of the stratum of substance

across which the light is propagated. Calling 0 the- angle
  which the plane of polarization of the incident light makes
 with that of the emergent light, and d the thickness of
  the medium, the twist is numerically 0/d. The greater the
 intensity of the field in the medium the greater is this twist.
     Now consider the inverse experiment proposed by Dr.
  Sheldon. The field is non-existent, to begin with ; but a
  beam of plane-polarized light produced by a Nicol prism is
  passed along the axis of a helix, the ends of which are joined
  so that the circuit is closed. Tlie Nicol is then set into rota
  tion continuously in one direction. Clearly a twist will be
  given to the plane of polarization depending on the velocity
  of rotation. If v be the velocity of light, the time taken by
  the beam to penetrate the medium is djv ; and if to be the
  angular velocity of the polarizing prism, the twist given will
  be the angle turned through in this time divided by the
  thickness, that is ea/v.
     But so long as as is constant this twist is constant, and the
. surface simply turns as a whole in the medium with angular
  velocity «u. I do not think the latter motion can produce any
  magnetic effect whatever. A magnetic field may perhaps be,
  and I should say probably is, produced when the twist is created
  by the setting of the Nicol into rotation, and annulled when the
  Nicol is stopped. For a continuous current a continuous flux
  of magnetic induction through the coil would be necessary,
  and this could only be produced by increasing the twist of the
  surface, that is by continually increasing the angular velocity
  of rotation. What is to be looked for therefore is an induced
  current when the Nicol is started, and an opposite current
  when it is stopped ; in the interval there will exist with con
  stant rotation a constant field, and the current will be zero.
     If Dr. Sheldon's idea were correct, continuous rotation of
  the Nicol prism would produce a continually increasing field-
  intensity within the coil, and thus as intense a field as might
  be named could be produced by only driving the Nicol long
  enough. Or, again, an action on the magnetic field which
  twists the plane of polarization in the direct experiment
  would be produced by merely rotating the substance round
  an axis in the direction of the magnetic force.
     With regard to the oscillation experiments, it seems pos
  sible that by this method the effect looked for may be obtained,
  as the twist of the plane of polarization changes sign at each
  swing of the polarizer. But in the account of his experiments
  given by Dr. Sheldon, there is nothing to show that the
  " sizzling " in the telephone which might be produced by the
  moving machinery was not mistaken for the magneto-optic

effect. The proper precaution for this was of coarse the
screening off of the light while the machinery was kept going,
and the circuit &c. the same as before. If, then, the sound
ceased, the inference would be that the disturbance in the
telephone was caused by the motion of the beam of light.
   My own experiments were made to test a conclusion I had
come to, that the passage of a beam of circularly-polarized
light along the axis of a solenoid, included in the circuit of a
sensitive galvanometer, would, by instituting a magnetic field,
cause an induced current to flow in one direction in the circuit,
and the quenching of the beam by annulling the field would
cause an induced current to flow in the opposite direction. I
therefore produced a beam of circularly-polarized light, and
tried the effect of introducing and removing a screen, by
which the light was alternately cut off from the coil and
allowed to pass through it. As I have stated, on neither of
the two occasions on which I made these experiments did I
find the introduction or the removal of the screen produce any
effect. The failure, I am certain, was due to the utter in
adequacy of my apparatus to detect the effect of the extremely
feeble magnetic field produced. It might be possible perhaps
to detect the effect looked for by improved arrangements,
 employing as powerful a coil and as intense a beam of light
 as possible, alternately cutting off and restoring the light by
a rapidly rotating perforated screen, and using in the circuit
of the coil a telephone instead of a galvanometer.
    My conclusion that such a field would be produced I was
glad to find corroborated by an investigation in Prof. J. J.
Thomson's 'Applications of Dynamics to Physics and Che
 mistry ' (p. 77), where it is shown that a circularly-polarized
 beam of strong sunlight ought to produce a magnetic field
 of intensity not greater than 2 x 10~18 C.G.S. units. Prof.
 Thomson states that this is much too small to be detected by
 experiment. It seems to me just possible that the above
 mode of experimenting might show some result ; at any rate
 the plan may be worthy of a trial.
    A similar mode of experimenting might be used, I think,
 to test whether the twisting of the plane of polarization of
 ordinary plane-polarized light produces any magnetic effect
 Supposing the substance (for example, a bar of heavy glass,
 or a tube containing carbon disulphide) placed along the lines
 of force between the poles of an electromagnet with perforated
 pole-pieces for Faraday's magneto-optic experiment, and sur
 rounded with a coil in circuit with a sufficiently sensitive
 galvanometer, any reaction on the field produced by the twist
 ing of the plane of polarization would be shown by an induced

current in the coil, in one direction when the beam was sent
along the specimen, and in the opposite direction when the
beam was interrupted. If the effect were too small to be
detected by a galvanometer in this way, perhaps it might be
found by alternately interrupting and restoring the beam by
a rapidly rotating perforated screen, and listening for sound
in a telephone included in the circuit of the coil.
     LVII. On the General System of Winds on the Earth.
                    By Werner von Siemens.*
IN the May number of the Meteorologische Zeitschrift there
       is a paper by Dr. Sprung, entitled " On the Theories of
the General System of Winds on the Earth," in which the
calculations of the direction and strength of general currents
of air set forth in^my communication to the Academy, of the
4th March, 1886, " On the Conservation of Energy in the
Earth's Atmosphere " t, are critically compared with Ferrel's
old theory. This paper induces me to make the following
observations which, however, are not directed against Dr.
 Sprung's objections to the strict validity of the results of my
 calculations, which objections are to a certain extent quite
just, but against the supposition that I have attempted, like
 Ferrel, " to found on theoretical calculations a theory of the
 general system of winds on the earth." Apart from not con
 sidering myself a sufficient adept in mathematics, I may say
 that 1 consider this method altogether inappropriate. So
 very complicated a problem as that of the general system of
 winds cannot possibly be constructed a priori on the basis of
 mathematical calculations, as up to now no simple basis has
 been found underlying all the phenomena. In my treatment
 " Of the Conservation of Energy in the Earth's Atmosphere,"
 I first sought to determine the forces which produce, main
 tain, and retard the motion of the air, and then to find by
 calculation the direction and magnitude of the general motion
 of the air induced by their combination. It is therefore not
 correct " that I sougnt like Ferrel to demonstrate by means
 of calculation an original state of atmospheric motion in order
 afterwards to base my further speculations thereon." Nor is
 it correct that I have taken no account in my calculations of
 the retardation of the motion of the air through friction, for

498              W. von Siemen3 on the General
the meridional flow of air, very appropriately called <f main
circulation" by Dr. Sprung, on which my theory of the
the general system of air-currents is based, depends exactly
on the balance between the upward acceleration of the air in
the equatorial                            heating of the lowest
strata through solar radiation, and the loss of energy which
the air in motion suffers during its circulation. This main
circulation has in the course of thousands of years brought
about an admixture of masses of air, which without it would
have rotated with the surface of the earth on which they rest.
I only made use of the mathematical idea of an instantaneous
frictionless admixture of the strata of air of all latitudes, to
determine in a simple manner the direction and magnitude
of the motion which has existed since remote antiquity.
Ferrel does not start, as I do, from a main circulation which
continually interchanges the strata of air rotating with the
velocity due to their latitude, and thereby gradually intermixes
them, but brings about this admixture through a frictionless
displacement in the meridional direction of the rotating rings
of air of the different latitudes in a manner not very clearly
explained. We have here essentially the same basis of calcu
lation as that underlying my idea of an admixture, and
Ferrel's and my calculation are therefore the same in result
as regards the direction of the currents of air ; on the other
hand, we differ essentially in our statements of the relative
strength of the wind north and south of the 35th degree of
latitude. I am quite of Dr. Sprung's opinion that neither
of the two theories can be considered quite correct. I look
upon mine indeed as nothing more than a first approximation
to the truth. And so in my calculations I have not taken into
consideration such complicating influences as the diminution
of temperature towards the poles, and the non-coincidence in
direction of centrifugal force and gravity. The latter fact,
the effect of which is also proved by the consideration that
the mass of air rotating in the higher latitudes must every
where have a tendency to continue moving in the greatest
circles, and therefore to strive to reach the equator, would
bring about a diminution in the pressure of the air with
approach to the poles, and would therefore essentially prejudice
the result of the calculation of the admixture, if this tendency
were not compensated by other forces having an opposite
effect. It is not, however, these but other fundamental
assumptions which determine a very great difference between
the two conceptions and lead to very different results. One
of them is the assumption by Ferrel that the so-called law of
areas in the form of the conservation of the moment of inertia

                 System of Winds on the Earth.                499
holds good for the displacement of the air rotating with the
earth's surface in a meridional direction. To this I cannot
agree, but, on the contrary, must deny that the conservation
of the moment of inertia comes into play in the motion of
the air.
   This law of areas, taken from astronomy, states that a mass
which rotates freely about another describes equal areas in
equal times. This is due to the acceleration of the rotating
mass as it approaches and its retardation as it recedes from
the centre of attraction of the fixed muss. The greater
velocity acquired by acceleration results in the description of
a larger arc in the unit of time, and so leads to the law of
areas. According to Ferrel a quantity of air rotating in any
latitude with the earth's surface cannot travel in the direction
of the meridian with an invariable absolute velocity, and
therefore with a constant vis viva as I assume it to do, but its
moment of inertia must remain constant, which corresponds
to a considerable change of velocity. In order that the
moment of inertia may remain constant (which is the case
when the linear velocity of the rotating body varies so that
equal areas are described by it in equal times), a considerable
amount of energy must be expended to produce the alteration
in the velocity of the inert mass of air. But there is no force
whatever available to perform this work. If the radius of
rotation of a rotating solid body is shortened, the force which
produces the shortening must overcome the centrifugal force.
The sum of the products of all the centrifugal forces into the
paths traversed gives the work expended in the acceleration
of the rotating mass, and this exactly suffices to maintain the
law of areas, that is, in this case the moment of inertia con
stant. But no analogous relations exist in the case of the
motion of the air on the earth's surface, where no alteration
in the force of attraction is caused by the tangential displace
ment, and no acceleration of the shifting mass by gravitation.
Nor is it clear how the neighbouring air-strata can exert a
pressure on those to be displaced capable of performing the
considerable work of acceleration which the maintenance
of the moment of inertia requires. A displacement of the
whole mass of air of a rotating ring in the meridional direction
cannot moreover take place, for the volume of such a ring of
definite thickness varies as the cosine of the latitude, and with
a polar displacement a corresponding portion of the mass of
the ring must either lag behind or return to the equator.
But even as regards that portion of the ring actually dis
placed in the polar direction, there is no physical reason for
assuming a conservation of the moment of inertia in the case
of currents of air; such an assumption would, on the contrary,

500                W. von Siemens on the General
lead to the greatest contradictions and discontinuities. For
in the assumed original condition from which both Ferrel and
I start, when as yet no meridional currents existed, the air of
each latitude rotated with the velocity of the ground upon
which it rested, and its velocity therefore diminished with the
cosine of the latitude. Now, according to Ferrer's views,
this relation must not only have been reversed with the
appearance of meridional currents, but instead of a diminution
an increase of the velocity of the air must have occurred in a
yet higher degree, if the moment of inertia of the air is sup
posed to remain constant. But why it must remain constant,
and what forces could bring about so considerable an increase
of the vis viva of the rotating air are equally incomprehensible *.
   Another of Ferrel's assumptions with which I cannot agree
is that the uppermost strata of air can slide down inclined
surfaces of equal air-pressure, for in these there is as little
tendency to tangential displacement as on a level surface.
That such a displacement could not in general take place
follows at once from the consideration, that even if a current
of air did descend, a difference of pressure would arise, with
a consequent disturbance of the balance of pressure, and the
immediate production of a back current. It hence follows
that meridional currents of air cannot be caused by the steady
increase in the temperature of the air from the poles to the
equator which (disturbances excepted) is found to exist, and
to this Dove agrees. Surfaces of equal pressure exist at all
levels throughout such an unequally heated atmosphere which
reach from the equator to the poles, and along which no
spontaneous motion of the air can take place. Notwithstand
ing the greater rarefaction or loosening of the air through
the heat of the torrid zone, the air would remain at rest, if
the indifferent equilibrium were not disturbed in some
portion of it. The real condition of equilibrium and of
   * I must emphatically protest against Dr. Sprung's statement, " that
there is the same (certainly very excusable) error contained in my assump
tion of a constant velocity of rotation of the air, as in the conception of
Hadley and Dove on the influence of the earth's rotation on the motion
of the air." Dr. Sprung is not entitled to bring forward von Helmholtz's
communication "On Atmospheric Motions " in support of this opinion,
for in this mathematical inquiry von Helmholtz has considered a " hypo
thetical case." He says, " If we assume a rotating ring of air—the axis
of which coincides with the earth's axis-to be displaced at one time to
the north and at another to the south by the pressure of similar neigh
bouring rings, the moment of inertia must remain constant, in accordance
with the well-known general mechanical principle." This is no doubt
correct, for in the assumed case the pressure of the neighbouring rings
performs the work of acceleration ; but the point in question is just
whether there are forces available to exert this displacing pressure.

relative rest of the atmosphere is that of indifferent equilibrium
with the adiabatic scale of temperature appropriate to it. In
other words, setting aside friction, no work is required to take
a mass of air from one level to another, which means in this
case that the energy expended by the expansive action of the
air is balanced by the loss of heat in cooling, and inversely.
The condition of relative rest of the atmosphere depends
therefore on the maintenance of indifferent equilibrium, every
disturbance of which makes its appearance as a storage of
energy, having the tendency to re-establish it through the
motion of the air. These disturbances are to be explained
exclusively by the unequal heating of the strata of air by the
sun's rays and their unequal cooling by radiation of heat into
space. The sun's rays heat the surface of the earth, which
then heats the strata of- air resting on it. The excess of
temperature thus brought about over the adiabatic tempera
ture of the earth, which corresponds to the mean temperature
of the whole superincumbent column of air, forms a store of
energy like a bent spring, which can only be balanced again
through the spreading of the excess temperature of the
deepest to the overlying air-layers, and thus restoring the
disturbed indifferent equilibrium. Practically, this can
 only be effected by air-currents. When the superheating is
only local, a rising of the superheated air will occur at some
locally favoured place, which will increase quickly with the
height, for the upflow in the so-formed natural chimney increases
with the height. This chimney differs from ordinary chimneys
not only in height, but essentially, in so far that it has elastic
walls, and that the pressure and density of the strata of air
 inside and outside diminish with the height. The velocity of
 the ascending air must therefore increase inversely as the
 density, for at each instant equal masses of air must pass
 through all sections of the chimney. Considering the small
 height of the atmosphere as compared with the earth's radius,
 no considerable increase of area with height takes place
 within it, and hence the velocity of the currents of air with
 np and down flow must increase and diminish absolutely with
 the air-pressure of the place. Through this upflow a greater
 portion of the sun's energy stored up in the air is therefore
 changed into the vis viva of air in motion than would be the
 case without such acceleration. The final results of the
 upflow of air limited as to space which has been overheated
 on the earth's surface, will be that this local air-current
ascends with accelerated velocity up to the very highest
 regions of the air, that at the same time the strata of air sur
 rounding the upflow descend with diminishing velocity, and

502             W. von Siemens on the General
that finally the heat produced on the earth's surface, and
thereby disturbing the equilibrium, is dispersed through all
the overlying air-strata and so restores the indifferent
equilibrium of this part of the atmosphere.
   When this heating of the layers of air near to the ground
is extended to a whole zone of the earth, the balancing of the
indifferent equilibrium disturbed through solar radiation is
effected on the same principle, although the resulting phe
nomena are quite different. In this case the upflow would no
longer be limited as to space, but comprehend the whole
torrid zone systematically, nor can it be limited as to time,
but the adjustment, like the cause of the disturbance, must
continue unlimited. A continuous system of currents com
prehending the whole atmosphere must consequently be
formed, which eventually brings about the continual trans
ference of the extra heat of the air near to the ground in the
torrid zone to the whole atmosphere at all levels and latitudes,
and restores the indifferent equilibrium disturbed in the torrid
zone, through continuous air-currents.
   If the possible lines of currents are constructed, bearing in
mind that stream-lines cannot cut one another, that the
velocity of an ascending current of air must increase directly
as the height and inversely as the pressure, and finally
that the air must maintain its velocity unaltered unless ex
pended in friction, mixture, or the work of compression, the
system of winds proposed by me is necessarily arrived at,
depending essentially on the vis inertia of the heated air set
in accelerated motion by the equatorial upflow. This vis
inertia not only forces the accelerated rising air along the
higher strata of the atmosphere, but is also the cause of its
return along the lower strata to the equator.
   It would lead me beyond the scope of this communication
were I to enter upon a closer discussion of this vis inertia
of the air, and on the influence of the vapour of water, which
considerably modifies it. But I may be allowed to say some
thing on the origin of the great stores of local energy
indicated by the maximum and minimum pressure of the air.
The sum of the pressure of the atmosphere at every part of
the earth's surface must be constant, for this sum represents
the weight of the invariable total amount of air. A reduction
of the pressure of the air at one part must therefore necessarily
be always opposed by a simultaneous increase of pressure
elsewhere. It is evidently no use to look for the originating
cause of the maxima and minima in local conditions of the
atmosphere. The barometer frequently gives intimation of
these before any alteration takes place in the state of the

atmosphere on the earth's surface. Frequently, however,
light clouds indicate an alteration already set in in the higher
strata ; and so in my paper, " On the Conservation of Energy
in the Earth's Atmosphere," I placed the origin of the maxima
and minima in the upper strata of the atmosphere, in the tem
perature and velocity of which constant alterations take place,
depending upon the place of ascent of the air, i. e. on its tem
perature and Hygroscopic state before it ascends. If no change
m the seasons took place, there would probably be great regu
larity in the currents in the upper strata of the atmosphere, which
would bring about a certain sequence in the changes of weather
not hitherto attained. We are not yet able to find out where
the air comes from which flows at any moment over any
portion of the earth's surface in a polar direction along the
higher strata of the atmosphere, and upon the place and the
season of the ascent will depend the temperature and velocity
of this air. As the expenditure of heat during the ascent of
 the air, i. e. during its working expansion, depends upon the
degree of its attenuation, and therefore on its elevation,
nearly the same diminution of heat takes place with hot as
with cold air. At all heights of the atmosphere differences
of temperature must make their appearance equal in degree
to those existing on the earth's surface, for any surplus of
heat which the air possesses before its ascent must be retained
by it after it has been rarefied and cooled through the ascent.
On this account the general condition of the atmosphere will
not be that of unstable equilibrinm but so-called stable equili
brium, for the higher strata of the atmosphere, on account of
their equatorial origin, will be warmer and lighter throughout
than they should be according to the adiabatic scale of tem
perature of the place over which they are. The velocity of
ascent of the air will increase with the quantity of heat
and moisture which it contains before its ascent ; and
therefore in the higher strata of the atmosphere of the
mean and higher latitudes, relatively warm and light cur
 rents of air of greater velocity must intermingle with colder
and slower currents.          Such a current of relatively light
and warm air, completely or partially occupying the upper
atmosphere, disturbs on its side the indifferent equilibrium
 of the lower strata of the atmosphere. The lower atmo
sphere, relatively at rest on the boundaries of the strata,
must be under too great a pressure, and must therefore ex
pand and be carried along with the quick-flowing lighter air
above it. As von Helmholtz has shown, this carrying away
 must go on with great energy, producing waves, and in con
 sequence there must be an expansion and flowing up of the

504              W. von Siemens on the General
lower air, which will continue until the indifferent equilibrium
disturbed by the lower pressure of the upper strata of the
atmosphere is again restored. When the pressure of the air
of the upper strata increases beyond that due to their elevation,
through cooling and condensation, in consequence of the dimi
nution of the width of the current with increasing latitude
the opposite effect will be produced, the limiting strata will
sink down, condensing the lower strata of air, and thereby
increasing their pressure. In both cases the disturbed indif
ferent equilibrium must eventually be again restored by the
strata of air lying below the source of disturbance delivering
by means of up-currents, or taking up by means of down-
currents, as much air as is required to restore the condition of
indifferent equilibrium in the whole height of the atmosphere.
In order to effect this the pressure of the air of the lower
strata must increase or diminish, in the first instance, until it
has adjusted itself to the scale of pressure of the indifferent
equilibrium of the disturbing upper air-strata. In other
words, the pressure on the earth's surface must vary propor
tionately with the change of pressure above, by which means
the sudden changes observed in the pressure of the air on the
earth's surface are perfectly explained. This alteration in the.
condition of the lower strata of air will continue even after
this adjustment has been effected so long as the cause in the
upper strata of the atmosphere continues ; and during that
time minimum pressures of air with ascending currents, and
maximum pressures with descending currents, of air must
occur, and set the atmosphere for a considerable distance in
whirling motion. It is only when the flow of air in the higher
strata of the atmosphere has again become normal, that a mean
position of the barometer and relative rest of the atmosphere
on the earth's surface will again prevail.             l -. ,
   The theory of the general system of winds may therefore
be summed up in the following statements :— , , ;
   1. All motions of the air depend upon disturbances of the
indifferent equilibrium of the atmosphere, and tend to bring
about its restoration.
   2. These disturbances are caused by the superheating of the
strata of air lying nearest to the earth's surface through solar
heat, by unsymmetrical cooling of the upper layers of the air
through radiation, and by the piling up of masses of air in
motion through obstructions occurring to the current.
   o. The disturbances are balanced by means of ascending
currents, which possess an acceleration of such a kind that the
increase of velocity of the air is proportional to the diminution
of its pressure.

                  System of Wiiuls on the Earth.             505
   4. Down-currents of equal magnitude correspond to the
up-currents, and in these the velocity of the air is retarded in
the same proportion as that of the upflow is accelerated.
   5. If the heating of the lower strata of air takes place
within a limited area, a local upflow occurs reaching to the
uppermost regions of the air, and presenting the appearance
of whirling columns with ascending spiral currents of air
inside and similarly directed descending currents outside.
The result of these whirling currents is a diffusion of the
surplus heat of the lower strata through which the adiabatic
equilibrium is disturbed, to the whole column of air which
took part in the whirling motion.
   6. When the sphere of disturbance of the indifferent (or adia
batic) equilibrium is very extended, comprising for instance
the whole torrid zone, the equalization of temperature can no
longer be effected by local ascending whirling currents, but
these must comprise the whole atmosphere. The conditions
are the same as with local currents, viz. an accelerated ascent
and retarded descent of the air, so that the velocity of the air
due to the action of the heat is at the different latitudes
approximately inversely proportional to the air-pressure pre
vailing there.
   7. As the air of every latitude rotates with approximately
the same absolute velocity in consequence of the constant
meridional currents which the heat produces and maintains,
the meridional combine with the terrestrial currents to form
the great system of currents of air surrounding the whole
earth, whose function it is to give a share of the surplus heat
of the torrid zone to the whole atmosphere by transferring
equatorial heat and moisture to the middle and higher lati
tudes and by originating local air-currents in them.
   8. These latter are due to the local production of altornate
increase and decrease of pressure through the disturbance of
the indifferent equilibrium in the upper strata of the atmo
sphere.
   9. The maximum and minimum air-pressures are effects of
the temperature and velocity of currents of air in the higher
6trata of the atmosphere.
 . From what precedes, the investigation of the causes and
effects of the disturbance of the indifferent equilibrium of the
atmosphere may be considered as one of the most essential
problems of meteorology, and the investigation of the geo
graphical origin of the air-currents passing over us on their
way to the poles as the most important problem in the pro
gnostication of the weather.

      To ilu Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
GENTLEMEN,                              St. Petersburg, October 24, 1890.
 \TB. C. V. BOYS has published in the September number of the
        Philosophical Magazine a paper (>l Notes on Photographs of
Rapidly Moving Objects, and on the Oscillating Electric Spark")
containing the description of a direct method for photographing a
liquid jet.
   1 myself have already successfully used the same method iu
1889, and I communicated the results of my researches to the
Russian Physico-Chemical Society at the meeting on February 11,
1890. By the aid of this method 1 have now investigated the
constitution of the jet of a pulverulent body issuing through the
orifice of an ordinary glass funnel, 3 millim. in the clear, either
under the influence of its own weight or aided by the pressure of
compressed air ; and 1 have the honour of sending you the results
in the form of the four photographs enclosed, which may interest
you. A plate or a sheet of paper sensitized with gelatino-bromide
of silver was placed vertically behind the jet, which was illuminated
in front by the spark of a Voss's machine. The enclosed photo
graphs show clearly that jets of pulverulent bodies are made up
of nodes and loops, and of detached drops like those of liquids.
The powders used were lyeopodium, emery, and sand.
   1 am continuing my researches with the object of determining
whether the constitution of jets of pulverulent bodies may be
attributed to a kind of surface-tension, or to some other cause ;
and, further, to examine the influence of heat on the phenomenon,
and so forth.
                             1 have the honour to be,

    ON DROPFING-MERCUIIY ELECTRODEs.             BY W. OSTWALD.
   1 am glad to find a perfect agreement between Mr. Brown's
observations on dropping-currents and mine. For I have asserted
that the current between a dropping electrode and an electrode of
stationary mercury is constant if the latter receives the drops, but
is much weaker, and decreasing, if not. Mr. Brown likewise
asserts that at the first moment both currents are of the same
strength. 1 have not the least doubt that this is so, for at the first

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           507
moment no real difference exists between the two eases ; but that I
did not make special mention of this of course displays a want of
aeuteness on my part, which I regret. The chief point, a " sub
sequent decrease " of the current, is also observed by Mr. Brown.
   Mr. Brown asserts, it is true, that the last facts can be explained
as well by Helmholtz's theory as by what he calls his hypothesis,
but unfortunately he has not given his explanation.
   This hypothesis is said by Mr. Brown to be opposed to the
theory of Helmholtz, of which he says : " It was perhaps unneces
sary to disprove what had not been proved." If a theory can be
proved by developing its consequences and comparing them with
experiment, the theory of Helmholtz is proved by many facts. I
may recall, for instance, the agreement between the electromotive
force of a perfect dropping electrode and the value of the E.M.F.,
which the maximum surface-tension of mercury in contact with
the same electrolyte reaches ; further, the fact that this maximum
surface-tension of mercury always shows the same value, while
the natural surface-tension depends to a great extent upon the
nature of the electrolyte in contact with it ; further, the connexion
between the currents caused by stretching the common surface and
its state of polarization, &c. On the other hand, I am not aware if
there exists a single fact in favour of Mr. Brown's hypothesis.
   But Mr. Brown prefers his own theory because it seems to him
"much simpler" than Helmholtz's theory. I must, however, con
fess that the assumption that mercury is negatively charged in
contact with sulphuric acid is, to my mind, in no perceptible
degree simpler than the assumption that it is positively charged.
   Even if Helmholtz's theory were no better proved than Mr.
Brown's, I should probably prefer the former. This may be
attributed to national prejudice, but I cannot help it.

ON THE ACTION OK OILS ON THE MOTIONS OF CAMPHOR ON THE
      SURFACE OF WATER. BY CHARLES TOMLINsON, F.R.8.
   In Lord Bayleigh's paper on the above subject, read before the
Royal Society on the 27th March last, and reported in ' Nature 'of
the 8th May, it is stated that a film of olive-oil, in two or three
cases, " was incompetent to stop the camphor motions upon a
surface including only a few square inches."
   I have often noticed this fact as a consequence of the use of
chemically-clean materials. Water, contained in a shallow glass
vessel, 4 inches in diameter, on the surface of which camphor frag
ments were active, was touched with rape-oil delivered from the
point of a penknife. The fragments continued to rotate on that
part of the surface which had not been invaded by the oil film
(Phil. Mag., November 1873). I had previously noticed that a
drop of a volatile oil, free from oxidized products, could be spread
over the whole surface of the water, without impeding the motion
of the camphor fragiueuts, which skated through and cut up the
film. In the case of old volatile oils, redistillation was fouud to be
necessary (Phil. Mag., September 1863). A similar effect was
produced by a drop of creosote (or its constituent acids) on a film
of a fixed oil that completely covered the surface of the water.
The creosote repels the oil film, cuts it up in all directions, moving
over the surface with great vigour (Phil. Mag., June 1867). So
also by attention to chemical purity, a raft of mica carrying a
bit of camphor will Moat about briskly ou the surface of water
night and day during a whole week and upwards (Phil. Mag.,
December 1869).
    By attending to the chemical purity of the materials the results
led to the explanation of many phenomena which had taken refuge
underthe vague term " molecular change," or " molecular condition,"
and to the discovery of other phenomena which had some influence
in developing theory. I propose to apply the term catharized to
 bodies thus made chemically clean, from mOapot, " pure " or
"clean" (Journal of the Chemical Society, April 1869; also
 Phil. Trans, for 1870).
    1 may be allowed to add that, in arriving at the true theory
 of the camphor motions and their varied kindred phenomena,
