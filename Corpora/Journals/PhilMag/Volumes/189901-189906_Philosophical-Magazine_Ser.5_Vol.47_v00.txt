     I. The Magnetic Fluxes in Meters and other Electrical
          Instruments.   By ALBERT CAMPBELL, B.A.*
    N all electrical measuring instruments in which the de
      <U+FB02>ecting or controlling forces are electromagnetic, the
magnetic <U+FB02>uxes and <U+FB01>elds are of great importance, and yet
there seem to be no tables published which give even rough
measurements of these, the result being that many people
who are thoroughly expert in the use of instruments have
no idea whatever of the order of magnitude of the magnetic
 <U+FB02>uxes occurring in the very commonest instruments. In
 order, therefore, to <U+FB01>ll this gap to some extent, I have
 recently carried out a series of experiments on the subject,
and although the list of instruments thus tested is not very
extensive or complete, I have been able to include in it a
good many of the more familiar types. As individual instru
ments of the same type vary somewhat amongst themselves,
it would have been waste of time to have aimed at great
accuracy in these measurements.       Accordingly, whilst guard
ing against large errors in general, I have been content in
one or two cases with results which only indicate the order
of magnitude of the quantity measured.
   In most cases the quantity determined has been B, the
magnetic <U+FB02>ux density or number of induction-tubes per square
centimetre sometimes through iron, sometimes through air.

In some cases (I), the total <U+FB02>ux, was measured, and for several
of the meters determinations of the power lost in their various
parts were also made.
                    ill/Mods of measuring B.
   METHOD I. Except when the <U+FB02>uxes were alternating, the
method used was the well-known way with a ballistic galvano—
meter. A search-coil in circuit with the galvauometer either
had the <U+FB02>ux suddenly reversed in it, or was pulled quickly
out of the <U+FB01>eld. For many of the experiments small and
very thin search-coils had to be used. For instance, in one
of the meters, the available air-gap was only 1 millim. across.
The bobbins of these small coils were made by cementing
together one or more round microscope cover-glasses between
larger strips of mica for the ends; they were wound with
from 10 to 200 turns of silk-covered copper wire of 0075
millim. diameter. Much thicker wire was used whenit was
desirable to have the resistance of the galvanometer-circuit
low. The smoothness of the mica cheeks allowed the coils to
be withdrawn from position with the necessary quickness.
                              Fig. 1.
       a “Bill?
The galvanometer was calibrated from time to time by means
of a standard pair of coils whose mutual inductance was
accurately known. As the measurement of small <U+FB02>uxes by
 the ballistic method presents no dif<U+FB01>culty, and requires only
 ordinary instruments, further description is needless.
    METHOD II. When, however, the small <U+FB02>ux is an alter
 nating one, the voltage set up in the search-coil is more
 dif<U+FB01>cult to measure; accordingly two special methods were
 here used. In the more accurate of these two methods
 the search-coil Q (<U+FB01>g. 1), through which the <U+FB02>ux was made
 to pass, instead of being in circuit with a ballistic galvano
 meter, was joined directly to a resistance-coil R, laid along
 one set of junctions of a minute thermopile Th, which last
 was connected with a sensitive galvanometer G. The re
 sistance-wire was of manganin (silk-covered) and was placed
along the junctions so as to be non-inductive, and to avoid

                 dieters and other Electrical Instruments.             3
  producing eddy-currents. The thermopile consisth of ten
  pairs of thin iron and nickel wires each 7 millim. long.v
  These metals were chosen as their thermo-electric lines are
  far apart, and almost parallel to one another.
       Some years ago the writer showed (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin.
  July 1887) that a thermopile used thus could give a fairly
  accurate measurement of the current through the resistance
' wire, the ultimate de<U+FB02>exion being proportional to the square
  of this current. Hence, for a given frequency, the mean
  square of the P.D. at the terminals of the search-coil was
  proportional to the de<U+FB02>exion. Each time it was used the
  combination was calibrated in the following manner :—A
  measured current of 1 ampere from the alternating supply
  circuit used was passed through a non-inductive resistance of
  0'2 ohm, and the resulting P.D. of 02 volt was applied to
  the ends of the resistance R.        From the observed deflexion
  of the galvanometer the mean square of the volts per division
  was found *. In all cases when the search-coil was in circuit
  the frequency n was observed, being measured by a frequency
  teller. If the resistance of the search-coil be negligible, and
  if the <U+FB02>ux follows the sine law, we have
                          v2=1()"8 X 27TILN2B82,

                 s2: area of search-coil.
  and
                B = V mean square B.
      The other method, which was by means of a telephone,
  was a rougher way, and will be described below.
       In Table I. are given some of the results obtained in the
  case of the simpler instruments, the third column giving the
  resistance of the instrument, the fourth column its full load,
  and the <U+FB01>fth the mean value of B at that load. As far as
  possible the positions from which the mean value of B were
  obtained were chosen so as to give an idea of the working
  <U+FB02>ux-density, and except where otherwise stated the values
  given refer to full load.
     ’I' The thermopile method of measuring small voltages is now in use
   in the German Reichsanstalt.

      As the numbers in the above Table throw an interesting
 light on the behaviour of many of the instruments it seems
 desirable to discuss them more fully in order.
      (1) Siemens Electrodynamometer.—ll1easuremcnts taken at
 the middle and the top of the swinging coil (of 4 turns) in
  direction perpendicular to the plane of the <U+FB01>xed coils gave
  B=120 and 40 respectively for the thin coil, and Bl—_-2l and
  16 for the thick. It will be seen that when the thick coil is
  uses} the de<U+FB02>ecting <U+FB01>eld is quite comparable with the earth’s
  <U+FB01>el .
      This, of course, introduces an error with direct currents
  unless care is taken to place the instrument so that the
  direction of the earth’s <U+FB01>eld is at right angles to that of the
  de<U+FB02>ecting <U+FB01>eld, and in the proper sense, 2'. e. with the instru
  ment looking east or west according to the direction of the
  current in the swinging coil. The above results show that
  the maximum variation at 15 amps. introduced by wrong
  placing (viz., due to a <U+FB01>eld equal to twice that of the earth
  or 0'36) would be about 2'5 per cent. of the mean de<U+FB02>ecting
  <U+FB01>eld. This was veri<U+FB01>ed by placing the electrodynamometer on
  a well-levelled turntable, and connecting its thick coil with a

               Meters and other Electrical Instruments.          5
  quite steady source of continuous current by means of twisted
  <U+FB02>exible leads. In Table II. are shown the values of the
  current indicated by the instrument when turned into various
  positions, the <U+FB01>rst column giving the direction towards which
  the front was turned in each case.
                               TABLE II.
                            Apparent         Variation from
            Direction.       Amperes.          Minimum.

                E.            15-20             1-3 °/°
     It will be seen that the extreme variation is 2'1 per cent.,
 which agrees (within the limits of error of the instrument)
 with the 2'5 per cent. variation deduced from the observed
 <U+FB01>elds. For lower currents the variation is much more, being
 in the inverse ratio of the current. Vl’ith the thin coil the
 <U+FB01>eld due to the <U+FB01>xed coil is so much stronger that the varia
 tion is slight except at the very lowest currents.
    The thick coil had 7 turns and an area of about 46 sq.
 centim., and the total maximum flux at full load was found
 to be 1850, giving mean B':_40. At full load the power
 wasted is 6'2 watts and 9'3 watts for the thick and thin coils
 respectively.
    (2) Kelvin Balance—The total <U+FB02>ux through the central
space of the coils was got by winding the search-coil round
the supporting pillar, and taking throws by reversing the
current. The resultant <U+FB02>ux was about 1600 (for full load).
By the astatic arrangement of the swinging coils the instru
ment is made independent of the earth’s <U+FB01>eld. The self
inductance is about 00016 henry.
   (3) Bi<U+FB01>lar Mirror Wattmeter.—This instrument has ranges
up to 50 or 100 amperes at 10 volts and upwards. The
numbers given refer to the <U+FB01>xed series coil. With direct
current-s it is clear that precautions have to be taken to elimi
nate the etfects of the earth’s <U+FB01>eld.
   (4) D’Arsonral Galvanometer.—This was a ballistic one
(made by Paul) with a narrow swinging coil of the Ayrton
Mather type.       The B given in the Table is that in the air
gap in the neighbourhood of the moving coil ; it would seem
to be suf<U+FB01>ciently great to be practically unaffected by the
magnetism of the earth. Besides, as it is an instrument for
use in a <U+FB01>xed position, it is only the effect of variable ex
ternal <U+FB01>elds that need to be taken into account. This point

6          Mr. A. Campbell on the Zl/agneh'c Flures in
will be discussed a little further on. To get an idea of how
the flux in the steel varies from point to point along the
annular magnet, an experiment was made with a ring-magnet
of rectangular section, having an air-gap as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2.
A small search-coil which could only just slip along the
magnet was moved by jerks into successive positions, and the
corresponding changes in the <U+FB02>ux were caiculated from the
throws on a ballistic galvanometer in circuit with the coil.
Fig. 2 shows the result, the radial breadth of the shaded
part being drawn proportional to the flux in the steel at each
position. Fig. 3 is a similar diagram for an ordinary bar
magnet. In the ring-magnet the available air-gap <U+FB02>ux was
less than one third of the maximum <U+FB02>ux at aa.
     (5) lVeston Voltmeler.——It will be noticed that B in the
air-gap of this instrument is very high, viz. 870. This might
 lead one to suppose that the earth’s <U+FB01>eld would have no
 perceptible effect on its readings, but it must be remembered
 that the <U+FB02>ux induced in a piece of iron or steel in the earth’s
 <U+FB01>eld is usually very many times greater than the <U+FB02>ux in air
 due to the earth alone. This can be easily shown by connect
 ing a coil with a ballistic galvanometcr and reversing the
 coil with regard to the earth’s <U+FB01>eld <U+FB01>rst by itself and then
 with a soft iron core in it. The throws of the galvanometer
 will be enormously increased by the presence of the core.
 To <U+FB01>nd how far the earth’s <U+FB01>eld ali'ected the flux in a perma
 nent magnet with a moderate air-gap, a coil was wound upon
 the circular one shown in <U+FB01>g. 2, and was connected with a
 galvanometer. The magnet was then turned round so as to
 quickly reverse the action of the earth’s horizontal <U+FB01>eld upon
 it. The resulting throw on the galvanometer showed that the
 maximum B in the steel, which was about 5000, was only
 changed by 3 lines per sq. cm., 2'. e. by less than 0'1 per cent.
 The behaviour of the Weston magnet tallies with this, for when
 the instrument, with a steady voltage on its terminals, was
 turned round to face each point of the compass, no change
 in the reading could be detected, although the scale could be
 read to about 1 in 1000*.
     (6) Davies Voltmeter.—1n this instrument one side of the
 rectangular moving coil moves in a narrow cylindrical air
 gap between specially shaped pole-pieces of a strong perma
 nent magnet. It gives a maximum angular de<U+FB01>exion of
 about 210°.
     (7) Ever-shed Ammeter.——A coil of 6 turns magnetizes
 two small pieces of iron with a movable piece between them,
    * At Professor Ayrton’s suggestion I have re-tested the instrument at
 the higher readings, and have detected a variation of about 0'1 per cent.

                     <U+FB01>leters and other Electrical Instruments.        7
        B was measured at about the end of one of the <U+FB01>xed pieces
        where the movable piece faces it.
           (8) Ayrton and Perry Magnifying Spring Voltmeter.—The
        small iron tube, which is surrounded by a coil and pulled
        down by it, is 7'2 centim. long, and the iron has a section of
        about 0'12 sq. centim. The number given in the table is
        the average B in the iron for the whole length of the tube
        for a load of 15 volts, 2'. e. 0'8 of fall load.
                                        Fig. 2.

          (9) Richard Recording Ammetcr.—_This has two solid iron
       cores (each 4 sq. centims. cross-sectlon) round. which .the
       current is carried by a single turn of copper strip ; an Iron
       armature carrying the pointer is attracted by these cores. B
      'was measured between one core and the armature.         It will
       be seen that the total <U+FB02>ux is large ; thus a strong de<U+FB02>ecting
       force is obtained which makes the friction of the recordlng
       pen of less account, but on the other hand much error from
      hysteresis comes in.
-‘l-<U+FB01>

8         Mr. A. Campbell on the .Magnetic F[uses in
   (10) Dollvo Voltmeter.—Here a thin wire of soft iron is
drawn down into a. solenoid. The value given is for the hollow
core of the coil (including the wire).
   (11) Nalder Voltmeter.—In this a small piece of soft iron
moves in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld produced by a coil outside it.
The number in the table is for the middle of the space within
the coil.
   (12). Tangent Galvanometer.—When the de<U+FB02>exion =45°,
the resultant <U+FB01>eld =earth’s <U+FB01>eld+cos 45°
                    _='O'26 (in London).
   (13) Kelvin Astatic jlfirror Galvanometer.-The galvano
meter was made very sensitive and almost unstable by means
of the controlling magnet. The mean control <U+FB01>eld (for this
condition) was found by measuring its sensitivity and com
paring it with that when the earth’s <U+FB01>eld alone was used.
The de<U+FB02>ecting <U+FB01>eld for 1° would be less than 0'00002, and
depends on the degree of astaticism of the suspended magnets.
   (14) Evers/ied Olunmeter—(Old type; polarized, astatic).
The number given is a rough approximation to the B due to
the shunt-coil alone at 100 volts. About the middle of the
scale the <U+FB01>eld due to the serics~coil would have the same value.
    (15) Erersllerl Olmznieter—(New type, with soft iron
needle). The B given is that due to the shunt-coil alone (at
200 volts). It is clear that the earth’s <U+FB01>eld cannot introduce
much error. In any case the errors due to external <U+FB01>elds
can be eliminated (as the makers direct) by reversing the
current and taking the mean of the readings.
   (16) Campbell Frequency—Teller.—The B is measured
between the vibrating strip and the attracting pole of the
electromagnet. It will be seen that only a quite moderate
<U+FB01>eld is required to throw the spring into strong vibration
when it is adjusted to the right length for resonance.
   (17) Double Pole Bell Telephone.—The diaphragm was so
close to the poles of the permanent magnet as to form an
almost closed magnetic circuit. A small search-coil was
wound round one of the pole-pieces (area =0'24 sq. centim.),
and the diaphragm was then laid in its place. A throw of the
galvanometer was get by pulling of both the diaphragm and
the search-coil.   Thus the <U+FB02>ux-density given refers to the
pole-pieces.
   (18) Ayrton and Perry Variable Standard of Self-Induc
tance—With the pointer at 0'038 henry, the total <U+FB02>ux within
the inner wooden bobbin was about 5200 for l ampere.
   (19) Self-Inductance Standard (L=O'2() henry).-—This

_and the height 9 centim. The B given in the table is the
 average for the whole cross-section of the coil at the middle
 of its height. The total <U+FB02>ux corresponding to this was 17,500.
 B at the centre of this cross-section was 53.
    In addition to the instruments already discussed, experi
 ments were also made upon a number of meters of different
 types, some being for direct, and some for alternating
 currents. As some of the types vary in construction from
 year to year, a few words of description in each case will make
 the results clearer.
     Aron Watt-hour Alcter (1894 type).—Range to 50 amps.
 at 100 volts. Two pendulums, each carrying shunt-coils,
 are acted on by series-coils under them, one being accelerated
 and the other retarded. With both series and shunt-currents
 passing (at full load) the mean B between the <U+FB01>xed and
 movable coils was about 70.
     Frager Watt-hour Alden—Range to 10 amps. at 100 volts.
 A meter of the “ Feeler” type, in which the shunt and series
 coils   form   an   ordinary wattmeter, whose de<U+FB02>exions are
 integrated at intervals. The mean B was measured as near
 the centre of the shunt-coil as possible.
             At full load .           .         B = 63,
             With shunt-current alone           B = 13,
             With series-current alone          B = 50.
     Hooklzam Direct-Current Ampere-hour Fletch—Range to
  100 amps. A small disk, surrounded by mercury which
  carries the current, is out twice by part of the magnetic <U+FB02>ux
  from a. strong permanent magnet (of cross-section 7'5 sq.
 centim.). The disk is thus caused to turn. On the same
 spindle is a brake disk of copper (5'4 centim. diameter),
  which is also cut by a part of the <U+FB02>ux from the same perina
  nent magnet.      Unfortunately it was not possible to take the
  meter to pieces, so the driving <U+FB02>ux could not be measured.
  By slipping a search-coil along the permanent magnet, the
  total leakage was found to be over 26,000 lines. The total
 brake <U+FB02>ux passes through the disk at four air-gaps, two and
 two in series, and has a value of about 5000 lines. The
  8 pole-pieces which direct the <U+FB02>ux have cross-sections of
  1'53 centim. each. In two of them the iron near the air-gap
 is turned down so as to leave only a thin neck of about 0'12
  sq. centim. cross-section. This is supposed to increase the
 permanence of the <U+FB02>ux. At these necks more than ,1; of
 the total <U+FB02>ux leaks from the iron. Whether they increase or
 diminish the permanence seems quite uncertain. The mean
 <U+FB02>ux density at the four air-gaps was found to be about 1020.

    The power spent in the meter at full load = 12'8 watts.
    The power spent in turning the spindle (at 2'2 revolutions
 per second) with full load was measured by the method
 (1) described below, and was found to be 0016 watts‘.
 Hence the e<U+FB02>iciency of the meter as a motor: ()‘125 per cent.
    Kelvin Ampere-hour Maura—Range to 600 amperes. In
 this a thin iron core, kept highly magnetized by a shunt
 current, is drawn down into a solenoid “'lllt'll carries the main
 current. The solenoid had 6 turns (2'. e. 3600 ampere-turns
 at full load), and was about 16 centim. long. At full load
 the flux density at the lower end of the solenoid was over
 250. \Vith the shunt-current alone the total flux through the
 moving coil and core was about 330.
    Eli/Lu Thomson Watt-hour Alden—Range to 50 amperes
 at 100 volts.    This meter consists of a small ironless motor, in
 which the series-current goes through the <U+FB01>eld-magnet coils
 and the shunt-current through the armature. (in the anna
 ture spindle is a brake disk of copper (13'5 centim. diameter),
which passes between the narrow air-gaps of three permanent
magnets of the shape shown in <U+FB01>g. 4. These magnets are
often of different strengths, being chosen to give the proper
brake-force for each individual meter. Their polar faces are
about 7'5 sq. centim. The mean B in the air-gaps was about
 700. By the method of placing the magnets the greater part
of the <U+FB02>ux acts on the brake disk. By slipping a search-coil
along one of the magnets it was found that the total <U+FB02>ux at
a was about 15000, making B about 7000. Of this flux
nearly one lzalf remains in the steel as far as the section at b.

   Driving Flam—Without the shunt-current the full load
current gives mean B           130 along the axis of the series-coils.
The shunt-current at 100 volts gives a <U+FB01>eld at right angles
to this in which B = 10. The shunt-current also passes
through a “compounding ” coil <U+FB01>xed coaxially in one of the

meters, Mr. Sidney Evershed somewhat anticipated him by announcing
(Institution of Electrital Engineers, May 12th, 1&98) one or two similar
results, making no mention, however, of the method by which the results
were obtained.

series-coils for the purpose of overcoming friction at the lower
loads. The B due to this starting coil alone is about 3.
There is a small stray <U+FB01>eld from the series-coils perceptible at
the brake disk, but as it is less than the 3,1,6 part of the <U+FB01>eld
due to the permanent magnets its effect may be neglected.
    Ejfect oft/re Earth’s Field.—Siuce the driving <U+FB02>ux density
at full load is only 130, it is clear that at the lower loads the
rate of the meter may be considerably a<U+FB02>'ected by the earth’s
<U+FB01>eld. To test this point the meter was levelled up on a turn
table (as in the case of the electrodynamometer already
described), and a constant load of 4'625 amperes at 100 volts
was kept on it. The load was measured by 0. Kelvin balance
and a re<U+FB02>ecting multicellular voltmeter. The rate of the
meter, 1'. e. spindle revolutions per watt-second, was then '
determined
     (A) with alternating current ;
    (B) with direct current, the earth’s field helping the driving
             <U+FB01>eld ;
     (C) the same, with the earth’s <U+FB01>eld opposing the driving
                <U+FB01>eld.

     It will be seen from (B) and (C) that by turning the meter
 round through 180° itsv rate at                 load is altered by 3'6 per
 cent., which is exactly what might have been predicted from
the value of B given above. The rate with alternating current
 does not lie between the rates (B) and (C) as it ought, but is
 about 05 per cent. slower than B).
     Power Spent in Meter.—The resistance of the series-coil
 T—'- 00066 ohm, and that of the shunt-coil _=' 2030 ohms;
hence the power spent in heating the coils =16'5+4'9=21-4
 watts.
     The power spent in actually driving the meter (at full load)
 was measured by two methods as follows :—
       (1) An arm of about 10 centim. long was attached to the
  spindle of the meter (at right angles to it). With full load

 12          Mr. A. Campbell on the Magnetic Fluxes in
  switched on, the tangential force f necessary to hold at rest
  the end of this arm was measured by the extension of a spiral
  spring which had been calibrated by known weights.
    Then
              Power (in watts) = 10—7     27rr . 1—1 ,
 where                                           f
       r = length of arm,
       :1 = number of revolutions per second when the spindle
            is free to move.
    (2) In the second method the shunt-circuit was disconnected
 and joined directly to a sensitive galvanometcr with a resist
 ance of 12,000 ohms in circuit. A measured current was
 sent through the series-coils, and the spindle was turned at
 about the full rate. Thus the meter acted as a dynamo and
  gave a de<U+FB02>exion on the galvanomcter. By watching the gal
 vanometer-scale it was not hard to keep this dc<U+FB02>exion steady,
 and from the known calibration of the galvanometer the
 voltage given by the armature was obtained. The total
 E.M.F. multiplied by the normal shunt-current (004% amp.)
 gave the driving-power.
    Method (1) gave for the driving-power at full load 0020
 watt, whilst method (2) gave. 0021 watt. Hence the ef<U+FB01>ciency
 of the meter as a motor is only 0095 per cent.
    Hooklzam Alternating- Current Watt-hour Alden—Range to
 10 amperes at 100 volts. In this meter a solid iron core
 forming an almost closed magnetic circuit is magnetized by
 a shunt-coil, which latter, by reason of its large inductance,
 carries a current which lags behind the main current by
 50° to 60°. A smaller U-shaped piece magnetized by the
 main current has its poles close to the upper pole of the
 larger iron core, and one of the poles carries a copper screen.
A small aluminium disk (8'8 centim. in diameter), partly
between the poles, is turned by the rotary magnetic flux
thus produced. The brake force acts on the same disk, and
is due to a tall permanent magnet about 20 centim. high
(with a narrow air-gap) , as shown in <U+FB01>g. 5.
    Brake Flam—The maximum <U+FB02>ux in this magnet was
found to be near P, and had the value 19,820, corresponding
to B=8800. Of this only 4400 lines ultimately cut the
disk, much being lost by cross leakage from Q and S to the
opposite limb. Thus less than i of the maximum <U+FB02>ux is
made use of. The mean B between the poles was found to
be 650.

            .Meters and other Electrical Instruments.         13
    Driving Flam—The distribution of the somewhat compli
cated alternating <U+FB01>eld was traced by the following method,
which also gave rough quantitative results. A telephone T
                               Fig. 5.
                              is(z<U+FB01>l
 (<U+FB01>g. 6) was arranged in a circuit with the search—coil F and
the low-resistance strip HK in such a way that the strip
could be switched out of circuit at will. One of the cou
nexions to HF was through a sliding contact, so that the
                                Fig. 6.
  resistance of the part in the telephone-circuit could be varied
  from 0'05 ohm downwards.          A current of 1 ampere was
  maintained in the strip and was from the alternating circuit
  which supplied the meter load. With the strip out of circuit
  the search-coil was moved into various positions, and the dis
  tribution of the alternating <U+FB02>ux observed by means of the
  sound in the telephone. To measure the <U+FB02>ux at any position
  H K was set to such a value that the small P.D. introduced
  by it into the telephone-circuit gave a sound of the same
  loudness as that given when the search-coil was placed in the
. <U+FB02>ux. The absolute values given by this method came out 10

14         Mr. A. Campbell on the Jlagnetic Flames in
to 15 per cent. too small ; but it proved a very convenient way
of comparing the <U+FB02>ux-densities at various positions. It was
thus found that when the main current (full load) was switched
 on in addition to the shunt-current, the <U+FB02>ux-density under
the middle pole was nearly doubled. The most curious fact
 brought to light by the method was that across the air-gap of
 the permanent magnet a considerable alternating <U+FB02>ux is in
 duced, the Value of B at that position being actually about
 1} of that between the poles of the shunt-magnet with the
shunt-current alone. The permanent magnet forms a kind ot'
secondary magnetic circuit directing around itself the alter
nating eddy-currents in the disk. Whether this has any
sensible demagnetizing effect upon the permanent magnet the
 writer has not determined.
    The <U+FB02>uxes were measured more exactly by the method of
the search-coil and thermopile described above. With shunt
alone the root of mean square B was about 50 in the air-gap
and 800 in the iron core just above the shunt-bobbin. The
shunt-current at 100 volts (86 ~ per sec.) was found to be
0031 ampere. If the current followed a sine curve its maxi
mum value would be 0'044. When a direct current of this
value was tried the <U+FB02>uxes produced were much larger than those
with the (supposed) equivalent alternating current. This is
partly due to the fact that the shunt-current does not follow
the sine law, but is no doubt also due to the existence of eddy
currents in the iron core. That these currents even in the
disk spread the flux and reduce the <U+FB02>ux-density in the air-gap
was shown qualitatively by placing a search-coil, connected
with a telephone, in the air-gap of a ring electromagnet
excited by alternating current. The sound in the telephone
was lessened when a copper disk was held near the coil in the
air-gap. The search-coil and thermopile method showed that
the <U+FB02>ux-density had been reduced by 8 per cent.
    To <U+FB01>nd how the core-<U+FB02>ux varied with alteration of the
voltage on the shunt-coil, by the same method the Bjust
above the shunt-bobbin was measured for a number of voltages
from 20 up to 100 volts. It will be seen from the curve in
<U+FB01>g. 7 that B is very nearly proportional to the potential-'
ditt'erenee. In practice it is found that the speed of rotation
is very nearly proportional to the voltage.
    Power spent in. lerter.——TO approximate to the amount of
power spent by reason of hysteresis when the shunt-current
alone is on, the iron was carried through a cycle by means of
direct current of such amount as to give a maximum B nearly
corresponding to that given with alternating current at
100 volts. The curve obtained is shown in fig. 8.

 16          Mr. A. Campbell on the Magnetic F[uses in
    From this curve it is not possible to get the exact value of
 the hysteresis loss, as the iron core is not a uniformly mag
 netized closed circuit. To get an idea, however, of the amount
 of the power wasted by hysteresis, let us suppose that the
 magnetic circuit is equivalent to a uniform iron ring of the
 same cross-section as the core of the shunt-coil, uniformly
 wound with the same number of turns 111 as the shunt-coil *
 (carrying the same current), and traversed by a <U+FB02>ux equal to
 that at the part of the meter-core for which the curve in <U+FB01>g. 6
 was taken.
    Let           c = current at any moment,
 and              s = section of ring.
 Then
       Hysteresis-loss in joules per cycle

    at 86~ per second,
            Power spent      86 x 0'00114 = 0098 watt.
    It was found by direct measurement that the actual power
 spent in the meter (with the shunt-current alone) was far
 larger than this. Accordingly measurements were made of
 the rise of temperature of the iron core by means of an iron
 nickel thermopile. Three junctions of the pile were bound
 against the iron, which had its surface well insulated with
 paint. A pad of wadding was tied over the spot, and the
 thermopile was connected with a suitable galvanometer. The
 shunt-current was switched on for 120 seconds, the de<U+FB02>exion
 being read at intervals, and on breaking the current the
 cooling was observed for several minutes. The thermopile
 and galvanometer were calibrated with a known difference of
 temperature, and the curves of heating and cooling were
 drawn. The curve of heating was then corrected by means
 of the other curve, and thus the heating of the iron (cor
rected for cooling) was found.
    At a spot just above the shunt-bobbin the corrected rise of
temperature was 0°“87 0., whilst near the air-gap it was only
about half of this. Taking account of this last fact, we may
     The exact value of n, was not known, but the value (1200) used
was estimated from the resistance and gauge of the shunt-wire and the
size of the coil.

therefore from the results above,

Since the hysteresis-loss is about 0'10 watt, it will be seen
that the eddy-current loss       1'48 watts.
    The power lost by eddy-currents in the disk was similarly
measured, and was found to be about 0'02 watt.
    In the shunt-coil the (FR loss =0'57 watt ; and hence the
total copper and iron losses =2'17 watts.
    Direct Measurement of Total P0wer.—-The total power
given to the meter was measured by the three-voltmeter
method, in which was used a re<U+FB02>ecting electrostatic voltmeter
accurate to about 1 in 1000 at all the points of the scale
required. The result obtained was 2'06 watts, which agrees
fairly well with the total watts shown by the other methods.
    Driving-Power.—The driving-power at full load was also
measured by the method of the spring-balance described
above; it was found to be 0'00073 watts.         Taking account
of the series-coil (whose resistance was 0009 ohm) the total
power spent at full load is over 3 watts ; and hence
                Motor ef<U+FB01>ciency      0024 per cent.
    Scheefer Alternating-Current Watt-hour Alden—Range to

shunt-coil on the other.     An aluminium cylinder is turned
by the rotary <U+FB01>eld thus produced, and on the same spindle is
a brake disk with a single magnet exactly like those in the
Elihu Thomson meter.
    The mean B between the poles of this magnet was about
  480. With the shunt-current alone the 4/ mean B2 between
  the shunt-pole and the driving cylinder was 570. The total
  power spent with the shunt alone on is 11'5 watts, of which
  7'1 watts are due to 02R loss.

by air-friction on four aluminium vanes.

was 00% ohm ; hence the power spent in it =10'0 watts.
    The power spent in the copper stampings which form the
secondary coil was found by measuring their rise of tem
perature with a small copper-iron junction. This rise (at
full load) was found to be about 0°‘33 C. per minute, the
cooling being negligible. The volume of copper was about
 21'4 0.0. ; whence the power spent =0'40 watt.
    The driving-power was found to be 0'0069 watt ; therefore
the motor ef<U+FB01>ciency =O'066 per cent.

Calculating from the dimensions of the coil, however, the
resistance was found to be 8'5 x 10—6 ohm. From this and
the value of the power (0'40 watt) we <U+FB01>nd that the secondary
current attains the extraordinary value of 220 amperes.

 small, particularly in the case of the alternating-current

 is spent in heating conductors (either by e dy-currents
 or otherwise). If a small fraction of this wasted energy
 could be employed to overcome with certainty the friction at
 the IOWest loads, a great advantage would be gained thereby.

   Serlz<U+FB02>‘.
    HAT the dielectric of a condenser becomes warmed when
       an alternating electromotive force is applied to the
terminals of the condenser has long been known, and the
study of this heating effect has been undertaken by numerous
observers. KleinerT used a thermo-electric couple imbedded
in the dielectric to measure the rise of temperature, and noted
a considerable heating effect in ebonite, gutta percha, glass,
and mica, but none at all in paraf<U+FB01>n and kolophonium. He
reports that in spite of all attempts by variations of the con
ditions of the experiment, no heating could be detected
in these two last-named substances. On the other hand,
Boucherot i has made para<U+FB02>in-paper condensers for use on the
3200-volt commercial circuits of Paris, some of which became
so hot in use that they were obliged to be cut out. Boucherot
says of the heating effect that if a condenser rises as much as
30° C., it should be rejected. That this is good advice is
evident from the fact that paraf<U+FB01>n melts at 54° C. ; and hence
when 30° C. above the temperature of a summer’s day (say,
25" C. or 77° F.), the paper would be <U+FB02>oating in melted
paraf<U+FB01>n.
   Bedell, Ballantyne, and Williamson§ report experiments
upon a paraf<U+FB01>n-paper condenser of 1'5 microfarad capacity,
the ef<U+FB01>ciency of which was found to be 95'6 °/o, or 4'4 °/o
lost in heat. The loss was determined by a three-voltmeter
method, similarly to measurements on a transformer. It was
put upon a 500-volt circuit at a frequency of 160, and the
current was therefore about 0'7 ampere, the apparent watts
about 350, and the heating effect 15-4 watts. The tempe
rature rose one degree per hour.
   Threlfall I! reports a test on a paraf<U+FB01>n-paper condenser of
his own construction which had a capacity of 01% micro
farad, and on a circuit of 3000 volts and a frequency of 60
the rise of temperature was less than one-<U+FB01>fth of a degree per
hour. The apparent watts would. be about the same as in the
experiment of Bedell, Ballantyne, and Williamson, although
the capacity was only one-twelfth as much. Threlfall concludes,
apparently, that since his condenser had only one-twelfth the

electric capacity, it also had only one-twelfth the capacity
for heat of the other condenser; and since the temperature
rose <U+FB01>ve times more slowly, therefore that the percentage 105s
of energy was only one-sixtieth as great, that is, all, of 3 °/o,
or 0'05 °/°, giving his condenser an ef<U+FB01>ciency of 99'95 °/° l
The reasoning is, however, quite inconclusive, for nothing is
said concerning the thickness of the paraf<U+FB01>n- aper dielectric
and the volume of the condenser. Suppose t e dielectric 0f
the smaller condenser to be 0'0129 inch thick, which is three
times the thickness of the other. (It might have been as
thick as that, seeing it sustained for a considerable period an
alternating voltage of 3000.) Then the volume per unit of
capacity would be nine times as great as the other, and the
heat required to raise its temperature as rapidly would be
nine times as great, assuming the capacity for heat and rate
of radiation the same for both. The loss would then have
been 0'45 °/o instead of 005 ° 0. This illustrates how entirely
inconclusive any determination merely of rise of temperature
is, unless all such circumstances as heat capacity, rate of
cooling, thickness of dielectric (or intensity of the electro
static induction) are speci<U+FB01>ed.
    The enormous discrepancy between the results above re
ferred to as to the quantity of the heating effect in condensers,
and the almost entire lack of precise statements as to its
numerical value, led us to undertake, more than a year ago,
to measure this energy loss in such a way that it could be
expressed absolutely.                .
   We proposed to measure by means of a wattmeter the
energy dissipated in a condenser when it is subjected to an
alternating electromotive force.    In order that the frequency
of charge and discharge be perfectly de<U+FB01>nite, the electromotive
force should be a simple harmonic one, that is, the upper har
monics of the fundamental should be absent. This is most
easily e<U+FB01>'ected b inserting in the circuit in series with the
 condenser a coil' of wire having large self-induction, but
 without an iron core. The variable permeability of the iron
will give rise to upper harmonics, especially if the magnetic
induction of the core attains large values; and hence a coil
without an iron core is necessary. Moreover, if the self
induction is not large enough it will reinforce some of the
upper harmonics instead of quenching them; and the presence
 of the coil will be detrimental rather than bene<U+FB01>cial.       The
best value of the self-induction of the coil is such that the
fundamental is reinforced to a maximum degree; in other
words, it is that value of L given by the equation
                           t=21r~/L_C,

   Method of Measuring Energy dissipated in Condensers.     21
where t is the period of the fundamental component of the
impressed electromotive force and C the capacity of the
condenser.
   There is another practical advantage resulting from this
 arrangement, namely, that the resulting resonance raises the
 electromotive force at the terminals of the condenser very
 greatly, saving the necessity of raising the voltage by trans
formers. And a third advantage now a pears in the fact that
the wattmeter may be inserted across t e low-voltage supply
 wires to measure the total power expended upon coil and
 condenser. Then subtracting the Pr loss of the coil, the
 remainder will be the power expended upon the condenser.
 This supposes, of course, that there is no iron core and no
 eddy-current loss in the copper coil itself.

    Fig. 1 shows the connexions for this method with the coil

 supply-wires of an alternating circuit, S is an adjustable re
 sistance, E is a dynamometer, F a wattmeter, R a non

measured leaves the condenser loss. This remainder is found
to be also proportional to the square of the current. Hence
 we may write it Pr" and r,is the “equivalent resistance ” of
the condenser, which it is desired to <U+FB01>nd. This does not
 indicate the nature of the process by which energy is dissi
 pated in a condenser, but simply that for a given condenser
 made of a given dielectric at a given temperature and fre
 quency, the heating effect is the same as though there were a
 certain resistance r, in series with a perfect condenser of the
 same capacity. For the same dielectric r, changes with
 changes in the temperature or the frequency; and for another
 dielectric with the same capacity, temperature, and frequency
 r, would be different.

whereas upon the condenser there may be an Al__ e_ 0
active electromotive force of several thousand      snug..-»
Volts. The nonindnctive resistance R is at
most a few hundred ohms. On the contrary, if the shunt
resistance were applied directly at the terminals of the con
denser, it would necessarily be several thousands of ohms, it
must be capable of carrying the entire shunt-current of the
wattmeter, it must be strictly non-inductive, and be of
known value—conditions dif<U+FB01>cult to ful<U+FB01>l. In the resonance
method a small inductancein the shunt-resistance or the
movable coil of the wattmeter produces no appreciable error;
whereas in the simple wattmeter method it produces a large
error.

24     Messrs. E. B. Rosa and A. W. Smith on a Resonance
   To illustrate this point let us take a special case. Suppose
the resistance His 500 ohms and the inductance of the shunt
circuit, including both the resistance R and the movable coil
of the wattmeter, is 0003 henry, 27m being 800.             Then
pL = 2'4 and tan ¢1=O'0048, ¢1=16’ 30”, the angle of
lag of the shunt-current behind the electromotive force.
Suppose the true angle of the condenser-current, qb, (<U+FB01>g. 4), is
89° 40’ ahead of the electro
motive force. Then the dif
ference of phase of the two
currents in the wattmeter will
be ¢=¢1+¢2=89° 56’ 30”,
and the power factor, cos ¢,
of the expression watts:
E1 cos¢wi|l be cos 89°56’30"
instead of cos 89° 40’, that is
"00102 insteadof'00582; thus
the wattmeter would indicate
that the power absorbed in the
condenser was only about one
sixth of what it really is. If
the lag of the shunt-current
were more than 20’ (a not
improbable value in many
cases), the de<U+FB02>exion of the wattmeter would be negative!
It is possible that this explains why it has often been claimed
 that the loss in certain condensers is too small to be measured
by a wattmeter.        For example, Swinburne *, speaking of
some of his own condensers, says “a condenser that takes
 2000 volts and 10 amperes has a loss that is too low to measure
 —that is to say, it is less than 5 or 10 watts.”
   On the other hand, if by means of a resonance-coil the
current and electromotive force have been brought very
nearly, if not exactly, into phase, any small lag of the shunt
current will make no appreciable error. Thus, the cosine of
10° is '9848, and of 10° 16’ 30” is '9840, a difference of less
than one part in a- thousand.
   In order to determine the precise values of 1', and rw a
Wheatstone bridge is joined to A D and the condenser short
circuited, so that the resonance-coil and the <U+FB01>xed coil of the
wattmeter and the lead-wires form the fourth arm of the
bridge. The resistance is then quickly measured just after
the wattmeter has been read and the alternating circuit broken,
and changes due to temperature are included.

   Method of Measuring Energy dissipated in Condensers.
                    Dt<U+FB01>iculty of the Method.
   We have seen that the presence of a resonance-coil in series
with the condenser (1) quenches, to a large extent at least, the
upper harmonics, 2) raises the voltage upon the condenser,
thus avoiding transforming up, (3) enables measurements to
be made more safely and more conveniently upon a low voltage,
and (4) transfers the wattmeter problem from the most un
favourable case (where the angle of phase-difference is nearly
90°) to the most favourable case where the current and
electromotive force are nearly in phase. There is, however,
one serious di<U+FB01>iculty in the method. If the resonance-coil is
made of small wire, it has a great resistance, and of the total
power measured only a small part is expended on the con
denser. Thus the condenser loss is the difference between
two relatively large quantities, and cannot be determined as
 accuratel as would be desired. If, on the other hand, a
 large coi<U+FB01>of larger wire is used so that its resistance is small,
 there will be eddy-currents in the copper of the coil, and the
 power expended on the coil will be greater than Pr... This
 excess will go into the remainder as condenser loss, and may
give rise to a considerable error. If the wire is of large cross
 section, but stranded, so that its resistance is small and the
 eddy-currents negligible, then a large coil will have a large
 inductance, and no dif<U+FB01>culty appears. The method is then
 accurate as well as quick and convenient.
                       The Resonance Ratio.
    As the condenser is alternately charged and discharged
 energy is handed to and fro between the coil and the condenser.
 ‘Vhen the condenser is charged to its maximum extent the
 current is zero and all the energy is potential and residing in
 the condenser.    A quarter of a period later the condenser is
 discharged and the current is a maximum; the energy is now
 kinetic, and resides in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld of the resonance
 coil. At other instants the energy is partly potential (in the
 condenser) and partly kinetic (in the coil).     As this transfer
 of energy to and fro continues, the dynamo supplying the
 current furnishes just encugh energy to make good the losses,
 that is, the heating effect in the wires and the dielectric of the
 condenser. The losses due to electromagnetic radiation and
 mechanical vibrations are usually negligible.

    was '38, r, was '72.    Hence            =46'4, agreeing very
    nearly with the ratio of the voltages. In this case the coil
    was of large wire (No. 5 B & S), and had considerable eddy
    current loss.     Hence the value '72 for 'r, was too large, and
    the degree of resonance was lower than it would have been in
    the absence of eddy-currents.     In another case, using a coil of
    No. 10 wire, the impressed electromotive force was 29'5 volts,
    the voltage on the coil or the condenser was 1808, and the

       A second arrangement of the resonance-coil is to put it in
    parallel with the condenser (<U+FB01>g. 5), and impress upon both a
    high electromotive force. Each of the two parallel circuits
    from B to 0 takes its own current, independentl 0f the
    other, but being nearly opposite in phase they near y cancel
    each other in the supply wires. Hence a small transformer
    is suf<U+FB01>cient to supply the small current needed, although

 sum of the two being relatively very small (curve‘4) and in
 phase with the impressed electromotive force (curve 1). The
 shunt resistance must be applied at the high voltage terminals,
 but as a small amount of self-induction produces no appre
 ciable error in the wattmeter, the movable coil may be long
 enough to make the wattmeter quite sensitive, and so a quite
 small shunt current may be used. This requires a larger
 resistance, but with much smaller carrying capacity, since a
 much smaller shunt current will su<U+FB01>ice than when the main
 current differs largely in phase from the shunt current.
    To illustrate this point, suppose as before that for a given
 condenser the angle of advance of the current is 89° 40'.
 The power factor, cos ¢, in the expression watts=EI cos ¢
 is in this case '00582. If now a resonance-coil be placed in

as in the second, and this requires a relatively large shunt
current.
    A modi<U+FB01>cation of the method, if a second small transformer
is available, is to transform down again to a low voltage, and
put the shunt circuit of the wattmeter on the low voltage
secondary of this second transformer. The current will now
be almost exactly opposite in phase to the high electromotive
force at the terminals of the condenser, and by interchanging
the terminals the wattmeter de<U+FB02>exion will be the same as
before, if the shunt resistance is reduced in the ratio of trans
formation. The currents in the two coils of the wattmeter
are so nearly in phase with one another that a small change
in the phase of the shunt current will produce no appreciable
error.

energy is dissipated in the process, we may de<U+FB01>ne the per
centage of loss as the ratio of the energy dissipated to the
energy stored. The ef<U+FB01>ciency is then unity minus the loss,

   The net ef<U+FB01>ciency, e, is therefore slightly less than the
gross ef<U+FB01>ciency, 17, for values of qb nearly 90°; but, as the
angle ¢ diminishes, 6 falls rapidly below 1), and for
¢=7 2° 20’ 30” the energy dissipated is equal to the energy
stored, and the net ef<U+FB01>ciency is therefore zero, while the
gross ef<U+FB01>ciency is about 38 per cent. For greater angles of
lag the loss is greater than the maximum energy stored, and
6 becomes negative (see <U+FB01>g. 9).
   For ordinary cases the angle ¢ is greater than 88°, and e
and 1/ are nearly equal. Since the wattmeter method gives
directly the value of (I) it is much easier to express the value
of the net ef<U+FB01>ciency 6 (namely, l—vr cot ¢) than the value
of n. For small values of cot (I: this is suf<U+FB01>ciently exact to

    If the equivalent resistance of the condenser is taken to be
 a series resistance then we have E cos d: for the active E.M.F.,
 E sin d: for the condenser E.M.F., and the same result follows.
                  Example of the Resonance Method.
     The condenser used was one which we had made ourselves,
  and consisted of paraf<U+FB01>ned paper and tinfoil. The paper was
  12 x 17 centim. and '0038 centim. thick ; the tinfoil was
  '0025 centim.thick, and its e<U+FB02>'ective area was 10x 15 centim.
  approximately. The paper and tinfoil were piled up dry and
  clamped between brass plates. It was then placed in melted
    ara<U+FB01>in and maintained for some hours at 100° to 150° C.
  This condenser then had a volume of about 300 cub. centim.
  and a capacity of about '8 microfarad.
      The resonance-coil consisted of 3000 metres of N0. 10 wire
   (B and S gauge, '259 centim. diameter) wound into a coil of
   40 centim. internal diameter, 56 centim. external diameter,
   and 17 centim. axial len th.    Its resistance was about 10 ohms
   and its inductance 1'60 enrys. This coil was wound in ten

    Method of Measuring Energy dissipated in Condensers. 37
 sections, so that by choosing different sections or combina
 tions of sections, a wide range of inductance could be secured.
 In this particular case the entire coil was used. The fre
 quency of the alternating electromotive force was varied by
 varying the speed of the generator, complete resonance being
 attained at a speed of 2175, for which the frequency is 145.
The current was 1'20 amperes, the resistance rc+rw was
 9'82 ohms, IQ(rc+rw)=14'l5 watts. The wattmeter gave a
 de<U+FB02>exion of 188, corresponding to 37'6 watts. This leaves
 2345 watts for condenser loss, or E1 cos ¢.
 E being 1808, 1=1-20, EI=2169, and cos¢= Zii’ei; ='0108;
          1r cot¢=3'39 per cent.,     e=96'61 per cent.
    The quantity of the eddy-current loss in the coil does not
 of course appear. From subsequent experiments we became
satis<U+FB01>ed that it was large enough to cause a serious error in
the above value of the condenser loss. Hence we shall not
give any of the other values found using this coil. The
 results obtained over a range of from 400 to 2250 volts
showed that the loss is sensibly proportional to the square of
the electromotive force. This conclusion is not seriously
affected by the presence of eddy-currents, since the latter are
themselves proportional to the square of the E.M.F. and yet
are not large enough to swamp the condenser loss.
   We therefore wound up a coil of nearly 2000 metres No. 14
wire (B and S gauge, diam. '160 centim.), in 41 layers of
45 turns each, external diameter of the coil being 37 centim.
The eddy-current loss in this coil is less, owing to the smaller
diameter of the wire and the smaller quantity; a subsequent
measurement by an independent method gave 3'2 per cent. as
the increase of the effective resistance by the eddy-currents
at a frequency of 120. At a lower frequency it would, of
course, be less. Its use will therefore illustrate the method
and give a fairly accurate value of the condenser ef<U+FB01>ciency.
       Measurements on Beeswax and Rosin Condensers.
   We give below a series of measurements on the ef<U+FB01>ciency
of a set of commercial condensers made of tinfoil and paper,
the latter being saturated with melted beeswax and rosin.
We understand that they are piled up dry, as we have done
with condensers made in our laboratory, and while immersed
in the melted beeswax and rosin placed in a receiver from
which the air is exhausted, to free them from air and moisture.
With the details of the process we are not, however,

A Method of Measuring Energy dissipated in Condensers.        39
acquainted, and cannot say whether it is something in the
method of manufacture or the nature of the dielectric which
makes the dissipation of energy so large ; we presume, how
ever, that it is the latter. There were six condensers joined
together, each being a solid slab of about 11 centim. x 15 cen
tim.x 1'5 centim., thus having a volume of about 250 cub.
centim., and a capacity of one third of a microfarad.
   The six slabs were placed on a table, joined together in
parallel, and in series with the resonance-coil (which was at a
distance from them and from the measuring instruments),
loosely covered with a woollen cloth, and coil and condenser
subjected to an alternating electromotive force of about
50 volts, and a frequency of 120.        N0 effort was made to
secure the maximum degree of resonance, and the voltage on
the condensers was found to be about 900. In a short time
the temperature of the condensers had risen to 30°, as indi
cated by a thermometer inserted between two of them, and
the <U+FB01>rst set of readings was taken. The loss of energy in
the condensers was greater than it had been at lower tem
peratures, and continued to increase as the temperature rose.
   At the same time, owing to this increase in the equivalent
resistance of the condenser, the resonance ratio decreased and
the current and voltage on the condenser decreased. The
loss at 36°C. is 50 per cent. greater than at 30° 0., and is
approaching a maximum. At 39° it is 9'5 per cent., and the
fourth reading at sensibly the same temperature (but which
doubtless was a little higher, at least in some of the conden
sers) showed a slightly less less. At 47° C. the loss had
decreased to 8'0 per cent., and at 49°‘5 C. to 6'5 per cent.,
only two-thirds its maximum value.      The condensers were not
all at the same temperature, and the indicated temperatures are
therefore not exact. But they show unmistakabl a maximum
value of the condenser loss, or energy converte into heat, at
about 39°C., and beyond that a very considerable diminution.
No further readings were taken until the condensers had
risen several degrees, when it was suddenly noticed that one
pair was better than the others and getting soft. The ther
mometer in a cooler pair registered 59°, but the warmest pair
was considerably higher. The loss was astonishingly large,
but the condenser had not broken down. Moreover, the
“leakage current” had not greatly increased, for while 839
volts gave 1'50 amperes at 49°‘5, 433 volts gave '80 ampere
at 59° C. To be in exact proportion to the voltage the current
should have been “774 instead of '80 at the higher tempera
ture, a comparatively small difference.
   To <U+FB01>nd so large a loss in commercial condensers of good

40                Dr. E. H. Cook on Experiments
repute was a surprise to us. To <U+FB01>nd a. well marked maximum
as the temperature rose, beyond which the loss decreased as
the beeswax and rosin composition softened was a second
surprise. To <U+FB01>nd so large a loss as the last observation
shows without the condensers giving way, and without any
very large leakage current, was a third surprise.
    In order therefore to verify these results by a totally
different method, and to determine as accurately as possible
the losses in some paraf<U+FB01>n-paper condensers which we possessed
which showed relatively very small heating effects, we built
a special form of calorimeter, into which the condensers could
be placed and the heat directly measured. The calorimeter
was copied after the large respiration calorimeter which one
of us designed for experiments under the atrona e of the
U.S. Government, and which is locates at aresleyan
 University.      The description of the calorimeter and the
 results obtained with it are reserved for a subsequent com
 munication.      We will only add that they fully con<U+FB01>rm the
 unexpected results obtained by the resonance method given
above concerning the dissipation of energy in beeswax and

           IlI. Experiments with the Brush Discharge.
 By E. H. COOK, .DJSC. (Lond.), Clifton Laboratory, Bristol‘.
                                [Plate 1.]
 1‘HE ordinary phenomena which accompany the brush
         discharge are well-known, but in view of the recent
 extension of our knowledge of electric discharges in high
  vacua, it seemed desirable to study the subject a little more
  closely. The following experiments have been made with
 this object.
     Most of the results have been obtained with an ordinary
  Wimshurst machine with 15-inch plates, but they have also
  been produced with the discharge from an induction-coil, as
  well as, though less readily, with a plate frictional machine.
     In experiments requiring the production of the brush for
  a short period the machine was turned by hand, but Where a
  long-continued effect was desired, motion was obtained by
  the use of one of Henrici’s hot-air motors. The number of
  revolutions of the plates was counted by means of a tacho
  meter, and the number of volts was taken as being about equal

  Association at Bristol, 1898.

to what would be produced by the same speed of rotation
between knobs of one centimetre diameter. (See Joubert,
Foster and Atkinson, ‘ Electricity and Magnetism,’ p. 103.)
    In all cases the results have been produced at ordinary
atmospheric temperatures and pressures, but, of course, the
brilliancy of the effects varies with the climatic conditions.
For this reason no attempts have been made to measure the
size of the brush, because it differs so much from day to day.
The experiments described can be reproduced under varying
conditions, and the effects may therefore be regarded as normal
 accompaniments of this kind of discharge.
                 1. Shape of the Brush-Discharge.
     As is well known, if a discharge of negative electricity takes
 place from a pointed conductor, and if the point he examined
 in a darkened room, it will be seen that it is surrounded by a
 faint spot of light of a violet or violet-blue colour. It, on the
 contrary, a similar experiment be made with positive electricity,
 the point will be seen to be surrounded by an innumerable
 number of lines of light of a similar violet-blue colour, forming
 what is called the brush.       It is stated, on the authority of
 Faraday, that the glow which surrounds the negative point is
 separated from it by a dark space. Undoubtedly this is the
 case when the discharge is taken in rare<U+FB01>ed air, but at the
  ordinary pressures I have been unable to detect it, althou h
  the brush has been examined under the microscope. T e
  glow seems to be in contact with the point. The positive dis
  charge, however,bchaves differently. When carefully observed
  it is seen that the lines do not start from the exact end but at
  some slight distance away (2 or 3 millims.). They appear to
  keep in a bunch for a little distance and then to diverge. The
  size of the positive brush is much increased by the proximity
  of an earth-connected plate or sphere, and the outline of the
  luminous portion is altered by the shape and nearness of this
  “ earth.” Thus, when an “earth ” is some distance away, the
  emanation from a point may take the shape of a fan with the
  side lines at right angles to the point as in the <U+FB01>gure. If to
  such a brush an “earth” be brought to within a few centi
  metres, the lines will curve themselves round and the angle
  of the fan instead of being 180 degrees will become much
  less. The glow at a point giving negative electricity becomes
  brighter if an earth-connected body he brought near, but it
   does not alter in size until the body is very close (less than a
   centimetre), when small sparks pass between the point and
   the body.

   The angle of the point makes a considerable difference to
the shape of the positive fan. If the end consists of a small
angle, for example a. needle, the bounding lines of the fan
enclose a small angle, and the whole of the luminous portion

is very small. As the angle increases so does also the angle
of the fan. The <U+FB01>gures show the kinds of discharge obtained
from brass points of varying angles. They were obtained
from the positive side of a machine, and under similar con
ditions of proximity to earth-connected plates. The dis
charges are drawn of about actual size, but the wires and
points are drawn larger than they were for the sake of
clearness. The approximate differences of potential between
the knobs of the machine when giving these discharges are

                   with the Brush Discharge.                    43
stated.    The appearance of the discharge obtained from
concave ends is also shown.       Concave terminals behave like
angular ones.
                 2. Force of VVz'ndf'rom Points.
    The mechanical force exerted by the strongly electri<U+FB01>ed air
particles which are repelled from the points is well known,
and the experiment of blowing out a candle is one of the
commonest shown as illustrating the action of points. I The
magnitude of the force was roughly measured by causing
the discharge to play upon one pan of a delicate Robervahl
balance and measuring the weight necessary to restore the
equilibrium. Care was taken to use the same point and to
change the polarity by reversing the machine. This was the
only way in which comparative experiments were possible.
If the attempt be made to measure from two different points
it will be found that the minute di<U+FB01>'crences in the points,
notwithstanding every care to make them precisely similar,
will show themselves by entirely altering the appearance of
the brush, and great differences in magnitude will be observed,
even with the same kind of electricity, from the different
brushes.
    In order that vibration might be avoided as far as possible,
 the measurements were made on a stone slab, built up from
 the foundations of the laboratory.          The following results
 were obtained :—
         Wimshurst machine .         .  .  .    . 15 in. plate.
         No. of sectors on each plate     .    .  16.
         Size of sectors . .    .   .   . . ._ 8 sq. cm.
 (1) Speed of revolution .             . . . 450 per minute.
       Potential-di<U+FB01>'erence corresponding to
         this speed, about .        . . . .       43,000 volts.
       Force from positive brush equal to
         a weight of 0'29 gramme.
       Force from negative brush equal to
          a weight of 0'24 gramme.
  (2) Speed of revolution . . . . .               182 per minute.
       Potential-di<U+FB02>'erence .       . . .         35,000 volts.
       Force from positive brush equal to a
          weight of 008 gramme.
       Force from negative brush equal to
          a weight of 0066 gramme.
       The best distance of brush from pan
          of balance 0'04 metre.

44                Dr. E. H. Cook on Experiments
Induction-Coil :—
      Length of primary wire . 200 feet (500 turns).
      Length of secondary wire . 60,000 feet (490,000 turns).
       Capacity of condenser . . 2 microfarads.
      Length of spark in air .       . 0'07 metre.
               Corresponding to
   * Potential-di<U+FB01>'erence of about . 63,000 volts.
       Force from positive brush equal to a weight of
         0‘0l gramme.
       Force from negative brush equal to a weight
         of 0'01 gramme.
    It will thus be seen that the magnitude of the force is
greater from the positive side of the machine than from the
negative.
    An attempt was now made to <U+FB01>nd the maximum distance at
which this mechanical disturbance could make itself felt.
For this purpose the following experiment was arranged. A
single <U+FB01>bre of unspun silk was stretched across the <U+FB01>eld of
view of the microscope, and on this was hung a little paper
index which was blown aside by the wind from the pornt.
The maximum distance at which any de<U+FB02>exion could be
observed was then noted, and in this way a comparison was
instituted. Care was again taken not to use different points,
but to alter the polarity by reversing the machine. Also,
during the experiment, the whole apparatus was carefully
protected from extraneous currents of air. It was found that
with the machine with a potential-difference of 33,000 volts
the positive brush produced an effect at a distance of 0'6 metre,
the negative at a distance of 0'48 metre.         When the potential
difference had fallen to about 25,000 volts the distances
observed were for the positive 0'32 metre, and for the negative
0'28 metre. With the coil giving a spark of 4 centimetres
 (41,500 volts) the positive brush affected the thread at a
distance of 0'32 metre, and the negative moved it at the
same distance.
    These results therefore con<U+FB01>rm the former; for the positive
brush affected the silk at the greater distance, and also pro
duced the greater pressure upon the pan of the balance. But
they show how very quickly a moving electri<U+FB01>ed particle of
air is brought to rest by surrounding air.
  it These details are given in order that an idea may be formed of the
kind of apparatus wor ed with, and that if any one should desire to
repeat the experiments he may know what results to expect. The
actual numbers will vary with the apparatus.

                    with the Brush Discharge.                 45
               3. Electrical Action at a Distance.
   If an electroscope or a leyden-jar be laced at some distance
from a point from which a brush-discharge is taking place,
it will become charged. If the brush be a positive one the
electroscope or jar will be charged positively ; if the brush be
a negative one it will be charged negatively.
   The distances at which the effects make themselves evident
vary with the potential and the atmospheric conditions.
Statements of lengths therefore are only valuable as allowing
of comparison being made between experiments which are
performed at the same time and in the same laboratory. The
same relation will, of course, hold, but the actual measure
ments will be different. With these reservations the following
are given :—
    With the plates of the machine revolving at the rate of
450 revolutions, and giving a difference of potential of about
43,000 volts, an electroscope was affected at a distance of
1'8 metres from the point. N0 difference was made by altering
the polarit .
    When t e plates were revolving at the rate of 105 revolu
 tions, and the potential-di<U+FB02>'erence was 25,000 volts, the
 same electroscope was affected at a distance of 1'0 metre.
    The size of the collecting- late of the electroscope makes a
 considerable difference in t e ability of the instrument to
 become charged. The larger this plate the greater the
 distance at which it can be charged. A point on the plate
 reduces the distance somewhat, probably because it allows
 the electricity to escape as fast as it can be collected.
    No increased effect could be obtained by increasing the
 condensation.
    The shape of the point which gives the best results is
 acute. This is different from the effect in producing lumi
 nosity. In that case it will be seen that a larger luminous
 brush is obtained with a greater angle up to 90°.
    Notwithstandin the enormously greater difference of
 potential produce , the brushes from the coil used were quite
 unable to in<U+FB02>uence the electroscope at distances equal to those
 obtained from the machine. Thus, when the coil was giving
 sparks of 0'07 metre in length and thus causing a potential
 ditference of about 63,000 volts, the positive brush was only
 capable of charging the electroscope at a distance of 0'62 metre
 and the negative at the same distance.
    The same relative results were obtained when the brushes
 were used for charging a leyden-jar. Thus, with a difference
 of potential of about 40,000 volts, a jar was charged by the

46               Dr. E. H. Cook on Erperiments
positive brush from the machine at a distance of 0'55 metre.
The negative brush charged it negatively at the same distance.
With a concave terminal this distance was reduced to
0'50 metre.
   With the coil giving a spark of about 0'7 metre (63,000
volts) the jar was charged at a distance of only 0'14 metre.
   But, as has been already stated, these distances vary greatl .
 With favourable atmospheric conditions, and a plate on t e
electroscope 16 by 23 centims., it was found that the electro
scope could be readily affected at a distance of 4 metres from
the point attached to the 15-inch Wimshurst machine. On
comparing these distances with those obtained when measuring
the mechanical force of the wind from the point, it is seen
that the electrical effects are felt at a much greater distance,
amounting, if we take the maximum distances, to more than
six times.
   It is not at all necessary that the conductor ending in the
point should be directed towards the electroscope. The
instrument will be found to be in<U+FB02>uenced in almost any
position; in fact, when experimenting in frosty weather, I
have obtained results at equal distances all round the point,
even in the exactly opposite direction. It is therefore clear
that the point is the centre of a disturbance which radiates
from it in all directions.
   The interposition of objects between the point and the
electroscope gives interesting results. A wire-cage, if com
pletely covering the instrument and earth-connected, will
prevent it from being charged, but if it is not completely
covered, even if only one side of the base is tilted up, the '
instrument will become charged. The same wire-cage held
between the point and electroscope has no effect. Plates of
metal, wood, or other material placed between, do not alter
the effect unless they are either close up to the point or to the
electroscope. In both cases a diminished effect is observed.
   Experiments were tried with the view of discoverin if the
effects could be produced through substances; 2'. e. if 'ke the
Rontgen rays the brush-discharges possessed any penetrative
power. Although by this mode of experimenting de<U+FB01>nite
proof could not be obtained, several of the results are instruc
tive. Thus, if the electroscope be placed at from 2 to 3
metres away from the point, and a board 56 by 78 by 15 centims.
be interposed midway in the path of the discharge, the leaves
are easily affected, almost as easily as if the board were absent.
The same thing happens if sheets of metals are interposed.
The direction of the point does not affect the result. If the
sheet be placed within 30 centims. of the point, the effect on

                    with the Brush Discharge.                  47
the leaves is not produced.      If the sheet be placed near to
the electroscope (within 10 centims.) no effect is produced on the
leaves, but as the distance is increased the leaves diverge more
and more ; thus at 50 centims. the effect is nearly as much as
 when the board is midway.      It is impossible while witnessing
these experiments to avoid calling to mind the similarity of
the effects produced to those which one sees on the coast when
 a long billow rushing onwards towards the shore meets with
 a solitary rock in its path. The rock is grasped on all sides,
 but while immediately behind it the water is comparatively
 still, the waves soon curl as it were round the sides and meet
 each other at a short distance behind.     The result being that
 the effect of the rock is to interfere wit-h the wave for only a
 short distance immediately behind it. Beyond that there is
 as much commotion in the line from the middle of the rock to
 the shore as at the edges.
     If while the electroscope leaves are diverged and the
 machine working, a person walks between the point and the
 instrument, the leaves will sway with his movements, but will
 not fall together.
     The production of the effect all round the point extends to
 positions under the machine, for I have repeatedly obtained
 the divergence of the leaves when the electroscope was placed
  directly under the machine, which stood on an inch board on
  the bench, which had a two-inch top.
       4. Chemical Action produced by the Brush-Discharge.
     The formation of ozone by the working of an ordinary
 electrical machine is well known, but whether positive or
 negative is more active in its production has not been
 investigated.    It was therefore determined to examine the
 action of the brush-discharge in producing this and other
 chemical changes. The whole of the work contemplated has
 not been completed, but some results of interest may be
 mentioned. Considerable dif<U+FB01>culty was experienced, in con
 sequence of the hi h potentials used, in preventing leakage.
  In some cases lea<U+FB01>age took the form of brushes at other
  places than the points required. In such cases the results
  were useless. In consequence of this, whenever it was
  necessary to lead the brush away from the point only the
  most strongly insulated wire was used, and this was <U+FB01>rst
  specially examined in order to see if any cracks or thin
  places were in it.    Whenever the wire had to be led into
 <U+FB02>asks or bottles it was found that the best material for bungs
  was solid para<U+FB01>n. But it was found very dif<U+FB01>cult to produce
  good brushes inside glass vessels, because the interior surface

48              Dr. E. H. Cook on Experiments
very soon became rapidly charged, and this seemed to pre
vent the production of the brush.
              Experiments with Potassium Iodide.
   The chemical action produced by the brushes in air may be
the formation of ozone, the production of oxides of nitrogen,
and perhaps other less known combinations. Potassic iodide
would be decomposed by ozone and the oxides of nitrogen,
and it is therefore a suitable substance to experiment with.
After many trials the simplest apparatus was found to be the
most useful. The points attached to the positive and negative
sides of the machine were placed at such a distance above the
surface of some standard potassic iodide solution that no
actual spark from the point could ass to the solution (with
the machine and potential used, t is was anything beyond
2 centim.). This precaution was taken in order that no breaking
up of the iodide should take place in consequence of the
spark passing through it. The solution was contained in glass
or porcelain dishes, and as solution of potassic iodide (unless
perfectly pure) becomes slightly coloured when exposed for
some time to air and light, a similar quantity of the standard
solution was placed in an extra dish of equal size at the same
time. At the conclusion of the experiment the amount of
iodine set free from this blank was estimated and subtracted
from that produced under the brushes.
   The results obtained have differed among themselves as far
as actual amounts of iodine set free at one brush compared
to the amount set free at the other, but they have all agreed
in this important particular, that the amount of iodine produced
by the negative brush from the machine is always very much
greater than the amount produced by the positive in the
same time.
   With points prepared as similarly as possible, and every
precaution taken to avoid leakage, it was found that from <U+FB01>ve
to eight times as much iodine was set free by the negative
brush as by the positive. The following are details of a
typical experiment :—
   Speed of rotation of plates of machine, 300 per minute.
   Potential-difference about 40,000 volts.
   Distance of points from surface of solution, 4 centims.
   Amount of iodine liberated by the negative brush over that
      in blank in half-hour, 0'000762 gramme.
   Amount of iodine liberated by the positive brush over that
      in blank in half-hour, 0'000127 gramme.
   The greatest amount of iodine liberated in one hour in this
way amounted to 0001778 gramme; assuming this to be

                    with the Brush Discharge.                 49
produced by the formation of ozone, which then decomposes
the iodide, it would correspond to the formation of
0000112 gramme of ozone.
    Condensing the electricity produces very little effect. For
with the jars on, similar results have been obtained to those
without the jars. Thus with points 4 centims. away and a
potential-di<U+FB01>'erence of about 40,000 volts, 0'00l778 gramme
of iodine was produced at the negative brush, and 0000190
gramme at the positive in one hour.
   A diminution of potential-difference reduces the amount of
chemical action ; but the substance of which the point is
composed is immaterial. Thus, with 25,000 volts difference,
0'000698 gramme of iodine was set free by the negative in
half an hour, as against 0'000762 gramme with 40,000 in the
same time.
   The distance of the point from the surface of the liquid
makes an important difference. It has already been stated
that all the experiments were made when the points were
farther away than that at which a. spark could pass.    The best
effects are caused when the points are just farther away than
this. Thus when the points were 12 centims. away 0'000021
gramme was liberated by the negative, as against 0'000063
gramme when 8 centims. away, and 0000508 gramme when
4 centims. away.
   Similar experiments to the above made with the brushes
obtained with the coil have given different results. In this
case it was found that invariably the brush from the positive
terminal liberates the greater amount of iodine. The difference
between the amounts produced by the positive and negative
brushes is not, however, so great as that by the machine. In
this case also we <U+FB01>nd differences between individual experi
ments, but as before always an excess by the same pole.
The average of many experiments gave from three to <U+FB01>ve
times as much iodine set free under the positive brush to
that set free under the negative. These numerical results
apply to the coil whose dimensions are given above.
   It was found that with the machine and coil as described,
a much greater quantity of decomposition was caused by
brushes from the machine than from the coil.        This corre-,
sponds to the amount of visible brush produced.
                   Action on other Substances.
   The power of the brushes to produce other chemical
actions has been partially investigated. So far no reducing
actions have been observed, but oxidizing ones are always
present. In these cases with the machine brushes more action

50               Dr. E. H. Cook on Experiments
takes place at the negative than at the positive, and generally
the same conditions apply as in the case of potassic iodide.
Thus about four times as much iron is oxidized from the
ferrous to the ferric condition by the negative as by the
positive brush.
                     5. Efect on the Electrodes.
   It is stated* on the authority of Wheatstone that :—
“ Metallic dust is in every case torn away from the electrode
by the brush discharge.” This statement is one which would
 be supposed to be true when it is considered that such is
known to be the case with the spark-discharge. But it is
 contradicted by spectroscopic evidence, for the spectrum of
the glow-discharge shows no trace of metallic lines. It is the
same “ whatever the nature of the metal, and is due solely to
 the incandescent gas.”1' In order to test the statement
 several experiments were made. The brushes were obtained
 from copper points, and made to play upon the surface of
 some dilute nitric acid placed in dishes under them. The
points were brought as near as possible to the surface, 2'. e.
as near as possible without producing a spark-discharge.
 They were so near that minute waves were formed during
the whole time of the experiment by the wind from the points.
No possible loss of copper could therefore occur if any were
torn off from the point. The machine was run at 1ts highest
speed, and thus the greatest difference of potential available
(from 40,000 to 50,000 volts) was obtained. The experiment
was continued for two hours, during the whole of which time
very <U+FB01>ne luminous brushes were being produced at each point.
At the conclusion of the experiment the acid was carefully
concentrated by evaporation and tested for copper. Not- a
trace could be found in either. Thus showing that no metallic
particles were torn of the points. Moreover, I have examined
microscopically a pair of points which I had cut and prepared
from a piece of guttapercha-covered wire. These points have
been continuously in use for some months, and it is certain
that at a low computation brushes must have been drawn
from them for at least 150 hours.         The edges seem as sharp
as when cut, and sensible alteration has not taken place in
t em.
   Of course these results apply to the potential and quantity
worked with. Higher potential and increased quantity may
give quite different results.

  6. Action of the Brush-Discharge upon Photographic Plates.
    The productions of chemical actions by the brush-dis
charges immediately gave one the desire to try the action
upon photographic plates. The <U+FB01>rst experiments of this kind
were made shortly after the discovery by Rontgen ; but as
they did not lead to any results which were of such general
interest as the latter, the study was discontinued for a time
but taken up again recently.
    In these experiments, as in the former, the brush from the
machine gives better results than that from the coil, but the
positive seems to be more effective than the negative.         In
the latter case a longer exposure is necessary, and sometimes
less de<U+FB01>nite results are obtained.    Films of different kinds
were used, but because of the greater ease in development,
ordinary “slow” plates were most frequently employed

        Action of Brush-Discharge upon a Sensitive Film.
    If a photographic plate be placed on the table in a dark
room with the uncovered <U+FB01>lm upwards, while the positive or
negative brush from a machine or coil be arranged at some
distance (say 4 feet) above it and the point turned towards it;
the plate after development will be found to be “fogged,”
showing that a decomposition of the silver salts has been
brought about, similar to that produced by exposure to light.
With the brush from the positive terminal the reduction of the
silver compound is fairly uniform all over the plate, but when
the negative is used there are “ blotches ” in several places,
showing that the reducing action has taken place in some
spots more than in others. There is therefore produced at
the point an emanation of some kind, whether it be an undu
latory movement or a stream of particles, which possesses the
power of reducing silver salts.
   If between the point and the sensitive <U+FB01>lm a solid object
he placed, a shadow of the object will be thrown upon the
plate. This shadow is sharp if the object is close to the
plate, but its edges are ill-de<U+FB01>ned if it be at some distance
from it, in this particular exactly resembling light. Pl. I.
(<U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2) shows this, the object being a piece of sheet
zinc cut into the shape of the letter H and placed <U+FB01>rstly at
1'5 centim. away from the plate, and secondly at 10 centims., the
point being about 30 centims. away and the potential about
35,000 volts. By measuring the size of the object and images,
and the distance between them, it is easy to <U+FB01>nd the position
of the source from which the rays emanate. When this is
done it is found that the rayigproceed from the extreme end

ot' the point and not at some distance from it. The visible
divergence of the brush does not start exactly from the pomt
but at some little distance in front of it. It would seem
therefore that the point of the emanation of these rays does
not coincide with that of the visible part of the brush—dis
charge.
    The next step was to <U+FB01>nd if the effect could be produced
after re<U+FB01>exion. This was shown with the following apparatus.
A cardboard box was made of the shape shown in sketch.
                                           A
                   _>
                                              a:
A B is a mirror, U the positive terminal of the machine, D an
 object, and E the photographic plate. Internal reflexion was
 carefully prevented and the experiment made in the dark
 room. The point was about 20 centims. from the mirror and the
 mirror about the same distance from the plate. The object,
 which was a piece of sheet-zinc, was from 1 to 5 centims. from
the plate.    When the machine was worked, and no mirror in
 position, it was found that the exposed plate was una<U+FB01>'ected,
 the rays we may imagine being absorbed by the sides of the
 box.    This experiment also shows that the fogging of the
 plate is not caused by any ozone which may accompany the
 discharge.    When, however, the mirror is in position a dis
 tinct image is formed upon the plate after a slight exposure
  (5 minutes was usually given). Supposing the effects to be
'caused by the emission of electri<U+FB01>ed particles from the terminal
 it might be imagined that these would be re<U+FB02>ected from the
 mirror and so turned from their course as to impinge upon
 the plate. In order to discover if this explanation be correct,
 the mirror A B (which was of glass in the <U+FB01>rst experiment)
  was replaced by a sheet of metal. Now, if electri<U+FB01>ed particles
 fall upon this and it be earth-connected, their electricity will

                    with the Brush Discharge.                  53
be immediately discharged, and therefore when they subse- -
quently impinged upon the plate no effect would be produced.
This was found not to be the case, as is shown by P1. I. (<U+FB01>g. 3),
which was produced by employing a piece of tin for the
re<U+FB02>ecting surface instead of glass.
    That the metal plate did receive the impact of electri<U+FB01>ed
particles was shown by the fact that sparks could be drawn
from it from time to time.                               -
    In view of the statement of Tesla, that the ef<U+FB01>ciency of
the metals as regards their re<U+FB02>ecting powers for w-r‘ays
 follows their order in the voltaic series, an attempt was made
to test if any variation of re<U+FB02>ecting power could be detected
in the present case. For this purpose the metal re<U+FB02>ecting
plate was varied, but the experimental results show that no
conclusions can be drawn indicating any connexion between
the re<U+FB02>ecting-power and position in the electrochemical series.
 In fact the re<U+FB02>exion seems to depend upon the brightness of
the surface, and therefore agrees exactly with the re<U+FB02>exion
of light.
   _ 7. Penetrative Efects produced by the Brush-Discharge.
    The remarkable results obtained by Rontgen and others
induced an attempt to imitate the e<U+FB02>'ects by the brush-discharge.
For this purpose a sensitive plate was wrapped in brown
paper (two folds), and on the paper were placed sundry small
articles, such as coins, keys, &c., and the whole exposed to the
brush-discharge. The experiment was made in a darkened
room, and the point placed at about 5 to 6 centims. above the
coins, the plate lying on the table. An exposure of 30 minutes
was given, and on developing the plate the outline of the
articles was distinctly shown. This experiment was repeated
with brushes of diti'erent polarity and source (Le. coil and
machine), and in every case the same results were obtained.
Probably the cause of this action is that the substances
become charged and act inductively upon the silver salt in the
sensitive <U+FB01>lm, causing a partial decomposition or production
of a “latent image,” which decomposition is carried still
further in the process of development of the plate. The next
step was to see if the outline of the bones could be produced
without the <U+FB02>esh. Numerous experiments were made, but
although in all cases the outline of the band could be repro
duced in no case did the bony skeleton show itself.
    None of these effects could be obtained when a piece of
vulcanized <U+FB01>bre was included in the wrapping. This substance
has been shown by Gitt'ard and others to be impervious to
w-rays, and, of course, it is equally impervious to light.

54               Dr. E. H. Cook on Experiments
    As the thickness of the wrapping increased, de<U+FB01>nition on
 the developed plate became less and less. Thinking the effect
 might be due to the fact that the brown paper wrapping was
 not light-tight experiments were made to test this idea, and
 it should here be mentioned that the brown paper referred to
is that which is used by photographic-plate makers to wrap
 sensitive plates in. Firstly, a plate wrapped in one fold was
 exposed for one hour to the light of an ordinary 8 c. p. glow
 lamp illuminated by a 105 volt alternating current. A negative
 was obtained clearly showing images of the objects placed on
 the brown paper. This seemed to support the idea. Then
 a wrapped-up plate was simply exposed to diffused daylight
 for two hours.     A very faint and blurred image of the coins
 &c. was obtained.      Thus showing that the paper was not
 absolutely light-tight. Moreover, by exposing to very power
  ful light, such as that from burning magnesium and the
  lime-light, clearer effects were obtained, showing that the
 EIOI‘G powerful light is capable of getting through the paper
   etter.
        8. Reproduction of Prints (S's. by Brush-Discharge.
     Whilst engaged in obtaining a perfectly light-tight
  wrapping for the plates it happened that a piece of ordinary
  notepaper Was used and the whole exposed to the action of
  the brush. On developing the plate a clearly-de<U+FB01>ned image of
  the watermark of the paper was produced (fig. 4). This induced
  tryin to copy in a similar way printing, writing, pictures,
  &c.     n every case this has been done with complete success.
  If aphotograph, or adrawing, or printing, or writing be placed
  in contact with the sensitive <U+FB01>lm and exposed to the brush
  discharge, a clearly-de<U+FB01>ned and very sharp reproduction is
  obtained. This seems to be more readily produced by the
  positive brush than by the negative. The effect on the plate
  can also be produced if the drawing be not in contact with
  the <U+FB01>lm but separated from it by one or two layers of paper
  or cardboard. In the latter case, however, the de<U+FB01>nition is
  not so good.
     The effects produced when the drawings are in contact
  cannot be produced simply by keeping the plate and print in
  contact, at any rate for the same time as was used in my
  experiments, but can be brought about by exposing the plate
  to a powerful light, providing the wrappings are not too
  many.
     One of the results of these experiments, of a somewhat
  startling character perhaps, is that the writing on a letter
  inside an enVelope can be reproduced.          It may be some

                    with the Brush Discharge.                   55
 comfort, however, to know that there is considerable difficulty
 in recognizing the words owing to the folding of the paper,
 and thus one word coming immediately on the to of another.
 Fig. 5 shows the result obtained when a printe invitation
 card enclosed in an envelope was exposed to the brush
 discharge, the envelope being placed on the sensitive <U+FB01>lm.
 Notice the texture of the paper, and the opacity caused by
 the gum and double thickness of paper.
                    Light from the Discharge.
    The great similarity between the effects recorded in the
 foregoing pages and those produced by ordinary light led to
 experiments being made to compare them.
    The <U+FB01>rst point which suggested itself was to see whether the
 interposition of a body which was transparent to ordinary
 light, between the point and plate, made any difference in the
 result.   A plate of clear glass was used, and the shadow of
 an object obtained. N0 difference was observed in the sharp
 ness of the image. The glass was now blackened with lamp
 black until it was so opaque to light that the flame of an
 ordinary candle could not be seen through it when it was
 held at a distance of 5 centims. from the <U+FB02>ame. When this
 was held between the point and the photographic plate no
 effect whatever could be obtained.
    Again, the law of inverse squares was proved in the follow
 ing manner :—A small cross cut out of thin sheet-zinc was
 placed at a certain distance from the sensitive plate and its
 shadow obtained. The plate was now moved so that the
 shadow should fall upon a different part of the <U+FB01>lm, and the
 object was placed at a different distance away. Another
 shadow was now obtained. This was of a different size to
the former. The two <U+FB01>gures were then measured, and the
sizes compared with the object and the distance of the brush.
   These results therefore indicate that the effects are produced
by the light which the brush emits.        Moreover, after many
trials, I have been enabled to reproduce all the effects with
arti<U+FB01>cial sources of light. Many of them can be produced by
employing daylight, and probably all could thus be formed,
but the length of exposure required has hitherto prevented
this from being done.
   But, notwithstanding this apparently simple explanation, it
is quite possible that we have something else taking place at
the same time.
   Suppose that the point is the centre of a disturbance from
which waves are emitted. These waves will be of various
lengths, some capable of affecting the optic nerve, and some

56         On Eavpe'rimmts with the Brush Discharge.
of shorter and some of longer wave-length than these. The
reduction of the silver salts in the sensitive <U+FB01>lm may be
caused by more than one kind of these waves. Before then
it is possible to say that the effects are caused by the actinic
power of the waves of short wave-length only, it is necessary
to separate these waves in some such manner as that employed
by Tyndall to separate heat-waves from those of light.
Various experiments have been made to do this, but hitherto
without success.     The investigation is being pursued in this
direction.
   The actual amount of light given out by the brush-discharge
is not much, and in the re<U+FB02>exion experiments which have
been described it Was found impossible for the most delicate
eye, even after being kept in absolute darkness for a con
siderable time, to distinguish the outline of the object; but the
shadow was nevertheless easily produced on the photographic
plate. The numerous experiments which have been made
show that, so far as one can judge, the effects produced by
the brush are far more de<U+FB01>nite than would be expected, when
the very smallluminosity of the discharge is remembered.
Or, in other words, that the emanation from the point contains
a much larger proportion of rays capable of bringing about
chemical decomposition than would be supposed when we
remember only its luminosity.
   In order that some approximation might be obtained between
the light-giving power of the discharge and ordinary light, the
following experiment was made. A comparison was <U+FB01>rst ob
tained between the light from a standard candle and the smallest
burner procurable, the as being burnt under the usual con
ditions for regulating t e pressure. This burner was now
compared with the light from the brush. The ordinary Bunsen
photometer, as used in gas-testing, was employed, and the
light from the machine carefully screened off. In order that
a good brush might be obtained an “ earth” was placed near
the terminal. The actual <U+FB01>gures obtained varied with the
climatic conditions, but not so much as would be expected,
and the following numbers may be taken as an approximation,
but, of course, only an approximation, to the relative lumi
nosity of a standard candle and the brush from the machine
used.
   Distance of candle from photometer . . . 60 inches.
   Distance of 1i ht      ,,      ,,       . . . 3'25 inches.
      Therefore, éandle : Light : : 3600 : 10'56.
   Distance of light from photometer       . . . 56 inches.
   Distance of positive brush from photometer . 4 ,,
Therefore, Light from positive brush : Candle : : 1: 267,200.

  Irregulam'ties ofMeteorological and lllagnetic Phenomena.      57
   The light from the negative point is less than that from the
positive. Brass points were used when making this com
parison, but no difference was observed with other points.
The potential-difference was about 30,000 volts.
     Comparison of the Actinic Power of the Brush with that
                              of Light.
    In order to roughly test this an ordinary negative was
taken and <U+FB01>xed in a frame together with a piece of bromide
paper. The frame was then exposed in the dark room to the
light from a standard wax-candle. The same negative was
then treated in the same way and exposed to the brush-dis
charge for a given time. The prints were then <U+FB01>xed and
compared in order to see if they were over or under exposed.
The experiments were then repeated until the effects were
equal. After many experiments the nearest comparison that
could be obtained was that the light from the candle at a
distance of 15 centim. and 20 seconds’ exposure produced
the same effect as that rom the positive brush at the same
distance and 15 minutes exposure. From this the relative
powers would be as l to 45.           The potential-di<U+FB01>'erence when
making these tests was about 30,000 volts.
    On comparing this number with that obtained from the
photometric experiments it will be seen how widely they differ,
and it may therefore be considered as certain that the emana
tion from the point consists very largely of those waves
which are capable of bringing about chemical changes.
IV. On the Analogy of some Irregularz'ties in the Yeang
    Range of Meteorological and Magnetic Phenomena. By
    Dr. VAN RIJCKEVORSEL *.
                                [Plate 11.]
AT the Toronto Meeting of the British AssociationT I
        called the attention of Section A to the fact that if the
 normal temperatures for every day of the year are plotted
 down in a curve, such curves are strikingly similar for
 stations spread over a very large area. An area which is
 larger than our continent for some of the particulars shown
 by these curves, while for others it extends over Western
 Europe only, or over part of it.
    I am now able, to a certain degree, to give an answer to
 the query at the end of that paper : “Is it temperature alone
 of which the irregularities are so extremely regular? How
           * Communicated by the Author.
           1' Paper published in the Phil. Mag. for May 1898.

58       Dr. van Rijckevorsel on Irrrgularities in the Yearly
does the barometer behave? Do the winds, do the magnetic
elements, show something pointing to a common origin?”
The answer is most certainly a positive one, as I hope to
show now.
   On the diagram (Plate II the uppermost curve, marked T,
shows the temperature of every day of the year for the Helder
in the Netherlands. The next curve, marked H, shows the
horizontal, and the following one Z the vertical component of
the earth’s magnetic force as shown by the registering instru—
ments at Utrecht. The curve marked R the rainfall at the
same station. The curve marked P shows the barometric
pressure at Greenwich; the last curve, D, the magnetic
declination at the same station.
   T shows the mean of 50 years’ observations, H of 33 years
between 1857 and 1696, Z of 30 years in the same period.
For the magnetic data it is not always possible to use all the
years for which values are available; for if in any case a
serious break occurs in a series, which cannot be safely
bridged over by <U+FB01>ctitious values, or if a discontinuity occurs
such as may be occasioned by a slight alteration in the instru
ment or in the adjustment of the scale, it is, as a rule, necessary
to reject that whole year—this for more than one reason, but
chie<U+FB02>y on account of the secular variation which is so irregular.
It is unnecessary, however, to explain this now at any length.
   R is the result of the 40 years 1856—95, P of the 18 years
discussed by Mr. Glaisher", viz. 1841-58, and lastly D of
the 30 years 1865—94, of which I owe the three years which
have not been published in the publications of the Observatory
to the courtesy of the Astronomer-Royal.
   Of course not all these series are of the same quality; some
are decidedly not long enough ; but although a large amount
of material is still being computed, I am at present only
able to show what there is in this diagram. The 19 years
for air-pressure are decidedly not enough, and at the same
time all those who are interested in terrestrial magnetism can
form a judgment for themselvcs as to the intrinsic worth of
the data for the vertical component. But for my present aim
the material is about suf<U+FB01>cient.
   All the curves have been smoothed down in the same
manner as explained in my <U+FB01>rst paper on this subject. For
the magnetic curves, however, a preliminary operation was
thought to be advisable, because the effect of the secular
variation throughout the year would otherwise tilt the curves
and render them less easily comparable with the others. This
very simple operation was to take the difference between the
      * 9th and 10th Reports of the British Meteorological Society.

       Range of Meteorological and Magnetic Phenomena.         59
mean for the ten <U+FB01>rst days of the year and that for the ten
 lastdays, and to interpolate this difference over the days of
 the year. The secular change has been taken into conside
ration in no other way; so that the <U+FB01>gures from which these
curves are drawn are simply the mean of the scale-readings
 for a certain number of years.   Except for my purpose, they
 have therefore no value whatever.
    The scales on which these six curves are drawn are also
 purely arbitrary. For H and Z even the scale-divisions
 as published in the annals of the Kom'nklg'jk Nederlandsch
 meteorologisch Instituut at Utrecht have not been reduced to
 any of the customary magnetic units. The factors by which
 the original <U+FB01>gures have been multiplied in order to form the
 ordinates of these curves, ranging from 4 to 123 were simply
 chosen so that the consecutive maxima and minima of the
 different curves should be, on an average, approximatively of
 the same importance. In other words, in the vertical dimen—
 sions the curves have been compressed or expanded so as to
 render the phenomenon I wish to show as prominent as
possible.
    And I think it will be admitted that it is prominent.    Of a
 few doubtful points I will speak later on.      But if we except
 these for the present, Ithink that it is perfectly apparent that,
'however dissimilar the general behaviour of the individual
 curves may be, every single maximum and every minimum in
 one curve is, with an astonishing regularity, repeated in all
 the others. Far from it that the curves should be parallel.
 In many cases a maximum in one curve occurs earlier or later
 than in most of the others. In still more cases, what is a
 large bump or a deep valley in one curve may <U+FB01>nd its corre
 spondent in a hardly perceptible movement in another curve.
 A few of these differences in behaviour shall be, later on,
 explained away in a satisfactory manner. Others may be due
 to insu<U+FB02>icience, as yet, of the data at command. But even
 if a certain—decidedly small—number of instances should
 remain where one of the curves really has a secondary maximum
 and accompanying minimum not shown by the others, why
 should it not? It may be a local anomaly; it may be that
 indeed for, say, the barometer an agent enters also upon the
 scene which has less grip, or none at all, upon the thermometer
  or the magnetometers. There are certainly not many such
  exceptions to the general phenomenon shown in the curves
  under discussion.    Indeed, they are so few that I incline to
  think that we may predict even now that as soon as we shall
  he possessed of a suf<U+FB01>cient number of suf<U+FB01>ciently good obser
  vations in every case it will indeed be found that to every

 60       Dr. van Rijckevorsel 0n Trregularitz'es in the Yearly
 irregularity in one yearly curve, either for any magnetic or
 any meteorologic p lenomenon, a corresponding irregularity
 will be apparent in all the other curves for the same region,
 if not always, as will be shown, for the same station. But
 even if some doubtful point should remain, I think proof is
 so abundant even now that, even if I should be found ulti
 mately to have overrated it in some instances, this can no
 more invalidate the principle.
     Another very valuable test for my opinion that the ana
 logies pointed out here cannot be accidental, is furnished by
 this diagram for Paris *. The uppermost line shows the
 temperature as resulting from 130 years’ observations. The
 lower one shows the magnetic declination, but this is the
 result of only 12 years of observation between 1785 and 1796
 by Cassini. Not very good observations we should now call
 them : there are several breaks and changes of continuity
 which I had to bridge over as best 1 could. Moreover, the
 readings were not taken rigorously at the same hour of the
 day. I think this is more than su<U+FB02>icient, with such a short
 series, to account for a certain number of doubts and queries
 which I cannot explain away. But upon the whole 1 think
 it will be admitted that the concordance between the two curves
 is just as satisfactory as in the large diagram. Therefore, at
 least also in this respect, things a century ago were what they
 are now.
    One possibility I must point out. It may he that one or
 more of these curves ought in reality to be inverted. This
seems preposterous. Still, with so many maxima and minima
following each other in rapid succession, it is not so. (I have
numbered 17 maxima; but I am perfectly sure that a larger
number than this are just as real as these, only they are so
 small as not to be detected yet, as long as we are obliged to
 smooth down the curves to such an extent.) Take a maximum
and the following minimum, which slightly precedes the cor
responding feature of the other curves, and invert the curve :
they will then simply be converted into a maximum and a
preceding minimum slightly lagging behind a similar feature
in the other curves. One of my magnetic curves is inverted
-—needless to say which, because a scale ma read from right
to left or from left to right. But also I ave had serions
doubts as to the advisability of inverting one or two others.
    You will see at once that in some cases my vertical lines 1
   * This diagram is not reproduced, as the text is suf<U+FB01>ciently clear
without it.
   1' Continuous vertical lines connect the maxima, lines of long dots the
minima belonging together.

      Range of Meteorological and Magnetic Phenomena.            61
indicate a maximum where, in good faith, such a thing is not to
be discovered. This is quite true. I call attention to the
lines 6, 13, 14, 15. There is certainly no, or hardly an,
apparent maximum in the temperature-line there. But if we
look for a moment at this larger collection of temperature
curves', of which it is not possible to give such a large diagram,
it will at once be seen that for the three last of these numbers
the curves for the whole of the United Kingdom show a small
but decided maximum in all these cases. For 13 this also
appears in some curves for southern stations, such as Mont~
 pellier. On the other hand, at 6 the maximum which the
 curve for the Holder does not show is most distinctly shown
 by the curves of the stations to the south and east of the
Netherlands.
    There is, I think, a most valuable use of the method here
 explained. For one phenomenon any of the maxima may be
 less apparent than for another.       It may even be not at all so,
 (It would seem as if magnetism were a more sensitive organ
 than meteorology.)        But as soon as some of the curves show
 a certain maximum, there is some presumption that the others
 ought to do so, even if they do not. In other words, that
 there is at that particular moment an in<U+FB02>uence at work which
 would manifest itself by creating a maximum in those curves
 also, if only our series of observations were long enough or the
 methods of observation sensitive enough. lfat some moment
  of the year the vertical intensity or the rainfall show a
  maximum or minimum, even an unimportant one, the tem
  perature and declination must show it too—it may be smaller
  or larger, or somewhat larger or later, but it must be there.
  And should it decidedly not be there, depend upon it that here
  is something worth investigating.
     But again the point now under discussion gives us a
  valuable clue to the direction in which we must look for the
  origin of the anomalies of our curves; and this may lead
  perhaps in some cases to a guess as to their causes. From
  what has just been said it is of course very probable that the
  maxima in 14 and 15 are due to the in<U+FB02>uence of some cause
  which has its seat to the north or northwest of the Netherlands,
  the one in 13 to one in the southwest, but that in 6 to an
  in<U+FB02>uence coming from the southeast.
     I must here refer again to a very remarkable minimum
  occurring in some curves on or about the 1st of July, which
  has been mentioned in the Toronto paper 1'. The mass of
  material which has since come into my possession has shown

          This second diagram shows for a certain number of stations
      the daily mean temperature for the month of July and parts
      of June and August. The order in which the curves are
      arranged is more or less the same as that in which the im
      portance of this minimum decreases.         At the same time—and
      this is important—the order is such that the <U+FB01>rst places are
      very near some point to the west of Scotland, and that the
      others gradually go further and further away from that centre.
          Only four of these show a decided minimum; the most
       pronounced one occurs at Arbroath in the east of Scotland,
       and the next at Valencia ; the two others are Rothesay near
       the west coast of Scotland and Thorshavn on the Faroe Islands.
          After these places the minimum assumes a less decided
       character; it is no longer a valley, but only a less steep
       incline of the ascending curve. These stations form another
       circle round Scotland ; they are: Berufjord, on the east coast

      Range of Meteorological and Magnetic Phenomena.               63
of Iceland *, Christiansand, on the west coast of Norway,
Greenwich, and the stations in the Netherlands.
   Much importance must be attached to the fact that at
Stykkisholm, on the west coast of Iceland, this minimum is
not at all perceptible, and hardly, if at all, at Brest. And
some importance also to the fact that it sets in <U+FB01>rst at the two
Scotch stations, next at Valencia and the Faroer.
    If you consider these facts I think that you will own that
here is an anomaly which must have its origin at the coast of
the west of Scotland, and probably at no great distance. For
if this origin were at a greater distance from the Scottish
coast, it would be hardly conceivable that its in<U+FB02>uence should
die out so rapidly on the two straight lines Thorshavn,
Berutjord, Stykkisholm, and Scotland, England, Brest.
    rl‘hus far I believe my conjecture is backed by what con
stitutes a certain amount of proof. But the road, or rather
roads, which this minimum subsequently follows through
part of Europe is decidedly bewildering. Brussels shows it,
Paris most decidedly; so do Lyons, Montpellier, Triest, and
Klagcnfurt; while, curiously enough, south and north of the
line uniting these stations, both in the German and the
Italian stations, I cannot <U+FB01>nd a trace of it.
    But in the North of Europe also there are decidedly some
traces of it. Both Copenhagen and Haparanda show them,
so do Baltischport and Kem on the western side of the
White Sea.        In this part of Europe the boundary beyond
which this feature is not traceable is a line passing west of
Konigsberg, Petersburg, and Archangel. Some traces of
this minimum are also to be found in a group of stations of
which Warsaw is the northernmost.
    There is another fact which may be connected with the
 strange distribution of this minimum. Nearly in the whole
 of Russia and the North of Europe the highest point of the
whole curve has a strong tendency to occur in August, in
the very beginning for the eastern stations with a single
 maximum, while those with a double summer maximum show
the highest one about the middle of August. This may,
 for instance, be seen in the curves for Thorshavn, Berufjord,
 and Christiansand. In the west and south of Europe, on the
 contrary, the July maximum, on an average, is decidedly,
   * I owe these northern stations to the kindness of Dr. A. Paulsen,
 Director of the Meteorological Observatory at Copenhagen. I owe thanks
 to a great many more gentlemen for the kindness with which material,
 even manuscript, was placed at my disposal; but their names will come
 more naturally when the time shall ultimately have come to publish the
 whole of this investigation.

64      Dr. van Rijckevorsel on Irregularities in the Yearly
although not much, higher than the August one. This is an
indication of the southern ori in of this July maximum. May
not this be an explanation ? Tate in June Europe is invaded
from a point 05 the Scottish coast b a strong minimum, but
a week or so later by a strong maximum from the south or
southwest, let us say tropical Africa. Therefore it is probable
that the <U+FB01>ght, so to speak, of these two features, in the <U+FB01>rst
place causes the distribution just spoken of, and that the
curious particulars which accompany it must <U+FB01>nd their expla
nation in local circumstances.
   A wild hypothesis ? I know it is. But 1 give it in order
to show how vividly some meteorological problems are put
before us by this method, and how a path is shown at the
same time to their evolution. For can there be much doubt
but that, as soon as we shall he possessed of more data, not
about temperature only, more and more of these roblems must
make great progress towards a solution? Sne curve for
magnetic declination or for rainfall may throw a ray of light
on an intricate point which at once solves it.
   Another argument to the same purpose. There will be
seen, not without some effort perhaps, a very slight minimum
between the 10th and 15th of May in the three upper curves
(Pl. II.). There are other features of the same importance, ofa
greater one even. There need be no fear of my discussing them
all, for the very plausible reason that I do not know anything
about them. They may either prove interesting some day,
or vanish completely, when meteorologists shall be able to
discuss longer series of observations. But this one is worth a
moment’s notice, for it is really the mark of the so-much
discussed “ Ice-saints.”    You will notice a trace of it in the
three upper curves, not in the two lower ones. (The rainfall
is too doubtful to be quoted here.) Well, these two lower
curves belong to Greenwich, and you will see that the hand
mark, if I may express myself thus, of these cold saints
tends to vanish in the British Isles. The temperature-curve
for Greenwich indeed shows it still, that for Valencia perhaps,
but certainly in Scotland it is not visible. Here again the
southern, or southeastern, origin of this phenomenon, which I
hinted at at Toronto, is con<U+FB01>rmed by other curves than those
for the temperature.
   As hinted at before, some of these curves leave for the
moment a doubt. It will be. seen that between July and
November I left in some of the vertical lines a break in the lower
regions of my diagram. In nearly every case it is only the
barometer that is at fault. I already have stated the cause:
the series of 19 years which I used is not long enough. I
regret that l have been unable to be ready in time with a

       Range of Meteorological and Allagnetic Phenomena.      65
longer series. But I fully expect that when this is quite
computed these doubts will be cleared away.
   There is, however, another class of doubts which must
perhaps be allowed as yet to stand over. It will be seen that
between the maxima marked 15 and 16 I suggest for the
upper curves two minima and an unimportant maximum
between them, while lower down I have only been able to
trace a single minimum. This may of course be consistent
with the facts. Eventually for one phenomenon a certain
maximum may become so slight that it can no longer be
detected, at least not by our present methods; and thus the
two minima before and after it may merge into one, although
other phenomena show two minima.
    Another fact of the same nature occurs perhaps between the
July and August maxima, between the vertical lines 9 and 10.
The dotted line between these two is much more crooked than
the lines 9 and 10 seem to warrant. On the other hand,
nearly all the lines show very slight indications that this
minimum is indeed a double one separated by a very slight
 maximum. But this feature is so faint that I did not feel jus
ti<U+FB01>ed for the present in drawing the vertical lines accordingly.
    Again the line 17 is a doubtful one. Of course this is
 partly only a technical di<U+FB02>iculty. Where the curves are so
 near together as in this part of the diagram, the vertical lines
 must seem—not really be—-more crooked than they are in the
 summer part of the diagram, where they expand to such a
 length. Still I have a feeling that line 17 is also in reality
 composed of two maxima, of which one, in December, ought
 to have the number 17, and another, chie<U+FB02>y in January, the
 new number 18.
     I might of course multiply instances like these, but I feel
 that this is at present useless.  The seventeen lines which I
 have numbered will, I think, he found in future to be a near
 approximation to truth for Western Europe so far as the most
 remarkable features go. But numberless other subsidiary '
 vertical lines may eventually be <U+FB01>lled in in course of time
 when more and better material shall be at hand than I could
 avail myself of as yet.
     But this, I think, is the result of this part of the work:
 There is one potent cause which for a large part rules all
  meteorological and magnetic phenomena, and in<U+FB02>uences them
 all in a similar way nearly simultaneously.
     1 do not of course pretend to teach a new doctrine in these
  words, but I think I have shown a new proof of it. And
  also how largely the simple method which I have used may in
 future contribute to the solution of meteorological problems.

66                  Lord Kelvin on the Age of the
     V. The Age of the Earth as an Abode <U+FB01>tted for Life.
          By the Right Hon. Lord KELVIN, G. C. V. O. *
§ 1. THE age of the earth as an abode <U+FB01>tted for life is cer
              tainly a subject which largely interests mankind in
general. For geology it is of vital and fundamental impor
tance—as im ortant as the date of the battle of Hastings is
for English istory—yet it was very little thought of by
geologists of thirty or forty ears ago; how little is illus
trated by a statement'l', which will now read, given originally
from the presidential chair of the Geological Society by
Professor Huxley in 1869, when for a second time, after a
seven years’ interval, he was president of the Society.
   “I do not suppose that at the present day any geologist would be found
      to deny t at the rapidity of the rotation of the earth may be
diminishing, that the sun may be waxing dim, or that the earth itself may
be cooling. Most of us, I sus ect, are Gallios, ‘who care for none of
these things,’ being of opinion that, true or <U+FB01>ctitious, they have made no
practical difference to the earth, during the period of which a record is
preserved in strati<U+FB01>ed deposits.”
    § 2. I believe the explanation of how it was possible for
Professor Huxley to say that he and other geologists did not
care for things on which the age of life on the earth essen
tially depends, is because he did not know that there was
valid foundation for any estimates worth considering as to
absolute magnitudes. If science did not allow us to give any
estimate whatever as to whether 10,000,000 01'10,000,000,000
years is the age of this earth as an abode <U+FB01>tted for life, then
1 think Professor Huxley would have been perfectly right in
saying that geologists should not trouble themselves about
it, and biologists should go on in their own way, not en
quiring into things utterly beyond the power of human
understanding and scienti<U+FB01>c investigation. This would have
left geology much in the same position as that in which
English history would be if it were impossible to ascertain
whether the battle of Hastings took place 800 years ago, or
800 thousand years ago, or 800 million ears ago. If it were
absolutely impossible to <U+FB01>nd out which of these periods is
more probable than the other, then I agree we might be
Gallios as to the date of the Norman Conquest. But a

                  Earth as an Abode <U+FB01>ttedfor Life.                       67
change took place just about the time to which I refer, and
from then till now geologists have not considered the question
of absolute dates in their science as outside the scope of their
investigations.                               .
   § 3. I may be allowed to read a few extracts to indicate
how geological thought was expressed in respect to this
subject, in various largely used popular text-books, and in
scienti<U+FB01>c writings. which were new in 1868, or not so old as
to be forgotten. I have several short extracts to read and
I hope you will not <U+FB01>nd them tedious.
    The <U+FB01>rst is three lines from Darwin’s “ Origin of Species,”
 1859 Edition, p. 287.
   “In all probability a far longer period than 300,000,000 years has
elapsed since the latter part of the secondary period.”
    Here is another still more important sentence, which I read
to you from the same book :—
   “He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles
of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced
 a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how inconqirehensibly
vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume.”
    I shall next read a short statement from Page’s ‘ Advanced
 Students’ Text-Book of Geology,’ published in 1859 :—
   “Again where the FORCE seems unequal to the result, the student
 should never lose sight of the element TIME: an element to which we can
set no bounds in the past, any more than we know of its limit in the
future.”
    “It will be seen from this hast     indication that there are two great
schools of geological causation—t- e one ascribing every result to the
 ordinary operations of Nature, combined with the element of unlimited
time, the other a ealing to agents that operated during the earlier
 epochs of the woriii) with greater intensity, and also for the most part
 over wider areas. The former belief is certainly more in accordance with
 the spirit q" right philosophy, though it must he confessed that many
 problems in geology seem to <U+FB01>nd their solution only through the
 admission of the latter hypothesis.”
     § 4. I have several other statements which I think you may
bear with some interest. Dr. Samuel Haughton, of Trinity
 College, Dublin, in his ‘Manual of Geology,’ published in
 1865, p. 82, says :—
    “The in<U+FB01>nite time of the geologists is in the past; and most of their
speculations regarding this subject seem to imply the absolute in<U+FB01>nity of
 time, as if the human imagination was unable to grasp the eriod of time
requisite for the formation 01'. a few inches of sand or feet 0 mud, and its
subsequent consolidation into rock.” (This delicate satire is certainly
 not overstrained.)
    “Professor Thomson has made an attempt to calculate the length of
 time during which the sun can have gone on burning at the present rate,
 and has come to the following conclusion :-—‘ It seems, on the whole, most
                                         b
                                      F2

  8                  Lord Kelvin on the Age of the
probable that the sun has not illuminated the earth for 100,000,000 years,
and almost certain that he has not done so for 500,000,000 ears. As for
the future, we may say with equal certainty, that the inha itants of the
earth cannot continue to enjoy the light and heat essential to their life
for many million years longer, unless new sources, now unknown to us,
are prepared in the great storehouse of creation."
    I said that in the sixties and I repeat it now; but with
charming logic it is held to be inconsistent with a later state
ment that the sun has not been shining 60,000,000 years ;
and that both that and this are stulti<U+FB01>ed by a still closer
estimate which says that probably the sun has not been
shining for 30,000,000 years l And so my efforts to <U+FB01>nd some
limit or estimate for Geological Time have been referred to
and put before the public, even in London daily and weekly
papers, to show how exceedingly wild are the wanderings
of physicists, and how mutually contradictory are their con
clusions, as to the length of time which has actually passed
since the early geological epochs to the present date.
     Dr. Haughton further goes on—
    “ This result (100 to 500 million years) of Professor Thomson’s, although
very liberal in the allowance of time, has o<U+FB02>'ended geologists, because, having
been accustomed to deal with time as an in<U+FB01>nite quantity at their disposal,
 they feel naturally embarrassment and alarm at (my attempt of the science
oi Physics to place a limit upon their speculations. It is quite possible
t at even a hundred million of years may be greatly in excess of the
actual time during which the sun s heat has remained constant.”
     § 5. Dr. Haughton admitted so much with a candid open
mind; but he went on to express his own belief (in 1865) thus :—
    “ Although I have spoken somewhat disrespectfully of the geological
calculus in my lecture, yet I believe that the time during whic organic
life has existed on the earth is practically in<U+FB01>nite, because it can be shown
to be so great as to be inconceivable by beings of our limited intelligence.”
    Where is inconceivableness in 10,000,000,000? There is
nothing inconceivable in the number of persons in this room,
or in London. We get up to millions quickly. Is there any
thin      inconceivable in 30,000,000 as the population of
England, or in 38,000,000 as the population of Great Britain
and Ireland, or in 352,704,863 as the population of the
British Empire? Not at all. It is just as conceivable as half
a million years or 500 millions.
       6. The following statement is from Professor Jukes’s
‘ Students’ Manual of Geology: ’—
   “The time required for such a slow process to effect such enormous
results must of course be taken to be inconceivany great. The word
‘inconeeivably' is not here used in a vague but in a. literal sense, to
indicate that the lapse of time required for the denudation that has
produced the present surfaces of some of the older rocks, is vast beyond
any idea of time which the human mind is capable of conceiving.”

                   Earth as an Abode <U+FB01>tted for Life.                     69
   “ Mr. Darwin, in his admirably reasoned book on the origin of specie s,
so full of information and suggestion on all geological sub'ects, estimates
the time required for the denudation of the rocks of the \ eald of Kent,
or the erosion of space between the ranges of chalk hills, known as the
North and South Downs, at three hundred millions of years.             The
grounds for forming this estimate are of course of the vaguest de
scription. It may be possible, perhaps, that the estimate is a hundred
times too great, and that the real time elapsed did not exceed three
million years, but, on the other hand, it is just as likely that the time
which actually elapsed since the <U+FB01>rst commencement of the erosion till it
was nearly as complete as it now is, was really a hundred times greater
than his estimate, or thirty thousand millions of years.”
    §7. Thus Jukes allowed estimates of anything from
3 millions to 30,000 millions as the time which actually
passed during the denudation of the Weald. On the other
hand Professor Phillips in his Rede lecture to the University
of Cambridge (1860), decidedly prefers one inch per annum
 to Darwin’s one inch per century as the rate of erosion ; and
 says that most observers would consider even the one inch
 per annum too small for all but the most invincible coasts!
 He thus, on purely geological grounds, reduces Darwin’s
 estimate of the time to less than one one-hundredth. And,
 reckoning the actual thicknesses of all the known geological
strata of the earth, he <U+FB01>nds 96 million ears as a possible
 estimate for the antiquity of the base of the strati<U+FB01>ed rocks ;
 but he gives reasons for supposing that this may be an over_
estimate, and he <U+FB01>nds that from stratigraphical evidence
alone, we may regard the antiquity of life on the earth as
possibly between 38 millions and 96 millions of years.
 Quite lately a very careful estimate of the antiquity of
strata containing remains of life on the earth has been
given by Professor Sollas, of Oxford, calculated according
to stratigraphical principles which had been pointed out by
Mr. Alfred Wallace. Here it is*:—“So far as I can at
present see, the lapse of time since the beginning of the
Cambrian system is probably less than 17,000,000 years,
even when computed on an assumption of uniformity, which
to me seems contradicted by the most salient facts of geology.
Whatever additional time the calculations made on physical
data can afford us, may go to the account of pie-Cambrian
deposits, of which at present we know too little to serve for
an independent estimate.”
   § 8. In one of the evening Oonversaziones of the British
Association during its meeting at Dundee in 1867 I had a
conversation on geological time with the late Sir Andrew
Ramsay, almost every word of which remains stamped on
          ‘1‘ “The Age of the Earth,” ‘ Nature,’ April 4th, 1895.

70                  Lord Kelvin on the Age ofthe
my mind to this day. We had been hearing a brilliant and
sug estive lecture by Professor (now Sir Archibald) Geikie
on t e geological history of the actions by which the existing
scenery of Scotland was produced. I asked Ramsay how long
a time he allowed for that history. He answered that he
could suggest no limit to it. I said, “ You don’t suppose
things have been going on always as they are now? You
don’t suppose geological history has run through 1,000,000,000
years?” “Certainly Ido.” “ 10,000,000,000 years Y” “ Yes.”
“ The sun is a <U+FB01>nite body. You can tell how many tons it is.
Do you think it has been shining on for a million million
years?” “ I am as incapable of estimating and under
standing the reasons which you ph sicists have for limiting
geological time as you are incapable of understanding the
geological reasons for our unlimited estimates.” I answered,
“You can understand physicists’ reasoning perfectly if you
give your mind to it." I ventured also to say that p ysicists
were not wholly incapable of appreciating geological dif<U+FB01>
culties; and so the matter ended, and we had a friendly
agreement to temporarily differ.
    § 9. In fact, from about the beginning of the century till
that time (186 7), geologists had been nurtured in a philosophy
originating with the Huttonian system: much of it substantially
very good philosophy, but some of it essentially unsound and
misleading : witness this, from Playfair, the eloquent and able
expounder of Hutton :—
   “ How often these vicissitudes of decay and renovation have been
repeated is not for us to determine; they constitute a series of which as
the author of this theory has remarked, we neither see the beginning nor
the end ; a circumstance that accords well with what is known concerning
other parts of the economy of the world. In the continuation of the
different species of animals and vegetables that inhabit the earth, we
discern neither a beginning nor an end; in the planetary motions where
geometry has carried the eye so far both into the future and the past we
 iscover no mark either of the commencement or the termination of the
present order.”
    §10. Led by Hutton and Playfair, Lyell taught the
doctrine of eternity and uniformity in geology; and to
explain plutonic action and underground heat, invented a
thermo-electric “perpetual” motion on which, in the year
1862, in my paper on the “ Secular Cooling of the Earth”*,
published in the ‘ Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh,’ I commented as follows :—

   “ To sup r-se, as Lyell, adopting the chemical hypothesis, has done *,
that the substances, combining together, may be again separated electro
lytically by thermo-electric currents, due to the heat generated by their
combination, and thus the chemical action and its heat continued in an
endless cycle, violates the principles of natural philosophy in exactly the
same manner, and to the same degree, as to believe that a clock con
structed with a self-winding movement may ful<U+FB01>l the exPectations of its
ingenious inventor by going for ever.”
    It was only by sheer force of reason that geologists have
been compelled to think otherwise, and to see that there was
a de<U+FB01>nite beginning, and to look forward to a de<U+FB01>nite end,
of this world as an abode <U+FB01>tted for life.
   § 11. It is curious that English philosophers and writers
should not have noticed how Newton treated the astro
nomical problem. Playt'air, in what I have read to you, speaks
of the planetary system as being absolutely eternal, and
unchangeable: having had no beginning and showing no
 signs of progress towards an end. He assumes also that the
 sun is to go on shining for ever, and that the earth is to go on
 revolving round it for ever. He quite overlooked Laplace’s
 nebular theory ; and be overlooked Newton’s counterblast
 to the planetary “perpetual motion.” Newton, commenting
 on his own ‘ First Law of Motion,’ says, in his terse Latin,
 which I will endeavour to translate, “ But the greater bodies
 of planets and comets moving in spaces less resisting, keep
 their motions longer.” That is a strong counterblast against
 any idea of eternity in the planetary system.
     § 12. I shall now, without further preface, explain, and I
 hope brie<U+FB02>y, so as not to wear out your patience, some of the
 arguments that I brought forward between 1862 and 1869,
 to show strict limitations to the possible age of the earth as
 an abode <U+FB01>tted for life.
     Kant 1' pointed out in the middle of last century, what had
 not previously been discovered by mathematicians or physical
 astronomers, that the frictional resistance against tidal cur
 rents on the earth’s surface must cause a diminution of the
 earth’s rotational speed.           This really great discovery in

Natural Philosophy seems to have attracted very little
attention,—indeed to have passed quite unnoticed,—among
mathematicians, and astronomers, and naturalists, until about
1840, when the doctrine of energy began to be taken to
heart. In 1866, Delaunay suggested that tidal retardation
of the earth’s rotation was probably the cause of an out
standing acceleration of the moon’s mean motion reckoned
according to the earth’s rotation as a timekeeper found by
Adams in 1853 by correcting a calculation of Laplace whic
had seemed to prove the earth’s rotational speed to be uni
form ‘. Adopting Delaunay’s suggestion as true, Adams, in
conjunction with Professor Tait and myself, estimated the
diminution of the earth’s rotational speed to be such that
the earth as a timekeeper, in the course of a century, would
get 22 seconds behind a thoroughly perfect watch or clock
rated to agree with it at the beginning of the century.
According to this rate of retardation the earth, 7,200 million
years ago, would have been rotating twice as fast as now:
and the centrifugal force in the equatorial regions would
have been four times as great as its present amount, which
is gig of gravity. At present the radius of the equatorial
sea-level exceeds the polar semi-diameter by 21% kilometres,
which is, as nearl ' as the most careful calculations in the
theory of the eartli’s <U+FB01>gure can tell us, just what the excess
of equatorial radius of the surface of the sea all round would
 be if the whole material of the earth were at present liquid
 and in equilibrium under the in<U+FB02>uence of gravity and centri
 fugal force with the present rotational speed, and } of what
 it would be if the rotational speed were twice 'as great.
 Hence, if the rotational speed had been twice as great as
 its present amount when consolidation from approximately
 the <U+FB01>gure of <U+FB02>uid equilibrium took lace, and if the solid
 earth, remaining absolutely rigid, had been gradually slowed
 down in the course of millions of years to its present speed
 of rotation, the water would have settled into two circular
 oceans round the two poles: and the equator, dry all round,
 would be 64'5 kilometres above the level of the polar sea
 bottoms. This is on the supposition of absolute rigidity of
 the earth after primitive consolidation. There would, in
 reality, have been some degree of yielding to the gravitational
 tendency to level the great gentle slope up from each pole to
 equator. But if the earth, at the time of primitive consolida

20 per cent. faster than at present, traces of its present <U+FB01>gure
must have been left in a great preponderance of land, and
probably no sea at all, in the equatorial regions. Takin
into account all uncertainties, whether in respect to Adams’
estimate of the rate of frictional retardation of the earth’s
rotatory speed, or to the conditions as to the rigidity of the
earth once consolidated, we may safely conclude that the
earth was certainly not solid 5,000 million years ago, and
was probably not solid 1,000 million years ago *.
    6 13. A second argument for limitation of the earth’s ave,
 which was really my own <U+FB01>rst argument, is founded on t e
consideration of underground heat.             To explain a <U+FB01>rst rough
and ready estimate of it I shall read one short statement.
 It is from a very short paper that I communicated to the
 Royal Society of Edinburgh on the 18th December, 1865,
 entitled, “The Doctrine of Uniformity in Geology brie<U+FB02>y
 refuted.”
   “The ‘Doctrine of Uniformity ’ in Geology, as held by many of the
most eminent of British Geologists, assumes that the earth’s surface and
upper crust have been nearly as they are at present in temperature, and
other physical qualities, during millions of millions of years. But the heat
 which we know, by observation, to be now conducted out of the earth yearly
is so great, that if this action had been going on with any approach to
 uniformity for 20,000 million years, the amount of heat lost out of the
 earth would have been about as much as would heat, by 100° C., a
 quantit of ordinary surface rock of 100 times the earth’s bulk.        This
 would e more than enough to melt a mass of surface rock equal in bulk
 to the whole earth. No hypothesis as to chemical action, internal <U+FB02>uidity,
 effects of pressure at great depth, or possible character of substances in
 the interior of the earth, possessing the smallest vestige of probability,
 cm justify the supposition that the earth’s upper crust has remained
 nearly as it is, while from the whole, or from any part, of the earth, so
 great a quantity of heat has been lost.”       7
     § 14. The sixteen words which I have emphasized in read
 ing this statement to you (italics in the reprint) indicate the
 matter-of-fact foundation for the conclusion asserted. This
 conclusion suf<U+FB01>ces to sweep away the whole system of geolo
 gical and biological speculation demanding an “inconceiv
 ably ” great vista of past time, or even a few thousand million
 years, for the history of life on the earth, and approximate
 uniformity of platonic action throughout that time; which,
 as we have seen, was very generally prevalent thirty years

haul down her colours either to ‘ Catastrophe’ or ‘Evolution.’ Instead,
therefore, of acceding to the request to ‘ hurry up’ we make a demand
for more time.”
   Professor Poulton: Presidential Address to the Zoological Section, 1896.
“Our argument does not deal with the time required for the origin of
life, or for the development of the lowest beings with which we are
acquainted from the <U+FB01>rst formed beings, of which we know nothing.
Both these processes may have required an immensity of time ; but as we
know nothing whatever about hem and have as yet no prospect of
acquiring any information, we are compelled to con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to as
much of the process of evolution as we can infer from the structure of
living and fossil forms—that is, as regards animals, to the development
of the simplest into the most complex ProtOZoa, the evolution of the
Metazoa from the Protozoa, and the branching of the former into its
numerous Phyla, with all their Classes, Orders, Families, Genera, and
Species. But we shall <U+FB01>nd that this is quite enough to necessitate a very
large increase in the time estimated by the geologist.”
     § 15. In my own short paper from which I have read you
 a sentence, the rate at which heat is at the present time lost
 from the earth by conduction outwards through the upper
 crust, as proved by observations of underground temperature
 in different parts of the world, and by measurement of the
 thermal conductivity of surface rocks and strata, suf<U+FB01>ced to

of Edinburgh *, I had considered the cooling of the earth
due to this loss of heat; and by tracing backwards the
 process of cooling had formed a de<U+FB01>nite estimate of the
greatest and least number of million years which can
 possibly have passed since the surface of the earth was
everywhere red hot. I expressed my conclusion in the
following statement 1' :—

   “ We are very ignorant as to the effects of high temperatures in altering
the conductivities and speci<U+FB01>c beats and melting temperatures of rocks,
and as to their latent heat of fusion. \Ve must, therefore, allow very
wide limits in such an estimate as I have attempted to make ; but I think
we may with much probability say that the consolidation cannot have
taken place less than 20 million years ago, or we should now have more
underground heat than we actually have ; nor more than 400 million years
ago, or we should now have less underground heat than we actually have.
That is to say, I conclude that Leibnitz’s epoch of emergence of the
consistentior status [the consolidation of the earth from red hot or white
hot molten matter] was probably between those dates."
     § 17. During the 35 years which have passed since I gave
 this wide-ranged estimate, experimental investigation has
 supplied much of the knowledge then wanting regarding the
 thermal properties of rocks to form a closer estimate of the
 time which has passed since the consolidation of the earth,
 and we have now good reason ' for judging that it was more
 than 20 and less than 40 million years ago; and probably
 much nearer 20 than 40.
     §18. Twelve years ago, in a laboratory established by
 Mr. Clarence King in connexion with the United States
 Geological Survey, a very important series of experimental
 researches on the physical properties of rocks at high
 temperatures was commenced by Dr. Carl Barus, for the
 purpose of supplying trustworthy data for geological theory.
 Mr. Clarence King, in an article published in the ‘ American
 Journal of Science’ ', used data thus supplied, to estimate
 the age of the earth more de<U+FB01>nitely than was possible for me
 to do in 1862, with the very meagre information then available
 as to the speci<U+FB01>c heats, thermal conductivities, and tem era
 tures of fusion, of rocks.         I had taken 7000° F. (3781 C.)
\as a high estimate of the temperature of melting rock.               Even
 then I might have taken something between 1000° C. and
  2000° C. as more probable, but I was most anxious not to
 under-estimate the age of the earth, and so I founded my
  primary calculation on the 7000° F. for the temperature of
 melting rock. \Ve know now from the experiments of Carl
 Barns 1- that diabase, a typical basalt of very primitive
 character, melts between 1100° C. and 11700, and is tho
 roughly liquid at 1200°. The correction from 3871° C. to
  1200° or 1/3'22 of that value, for the temperature of solidi<U+FB01>
  cation, would, with no other change of assumptions, reduce
  my estimate of 100 million to 1/(5'22)2 of its amount, or a
  little less than 10 million years; but the eti'ect of pressure
  on the temperature of solidi<U+FB01>cation must also be taken into

76               Lord Kelvin on the Age of the
account, and Mr. Clarence King, after a careful scrutiny of
all the data given him for this pur ose by Dr. Barns, concludes
that without further experimenta data “ we have no warrant
for extending the earth s age beyond 24 millions of years.”
    § 19. By an elaborate piece of mathematical book-keeping
I have worked out the problem of the conduction of heat
outwards from the earth, with speci<U+FB01>c heat increasing up to
the melting-point as found by Riicker and Roberts-Austen
and by Barns, but with the conductivity assumed constant;
and, by taking into account the augmentation of melting
temperature with pressure in a somewhat more complete
manner than that adopted by Mr. Clarence King, I am not
led to differ much from his estimate of 24 million years.
But, until we know something more than we know at present
as to the probable diminution of thermal conductivity with
increasing temperature, which would shorten the time since
consolidation, it would be quite inadvisable to publish any
closer estimate.
      20. All these reckonings of the history of underground
heat, the details of which I am sure you do not wish me to
put before you at present, are founded on the very sure
assumption that the material of our present solid earth all
round its surface was at one time a white hot liquid.           The
earth is at present losing heat from its surface all round from
year to year and century to century.          We may dismiss as
utterly untenable any supposition such as that a few thousand
or a few million years of the present regime in this respect
was preceded by a few thousand or a few million years of
heating from without. History, guided by science, is bound
to <U+FB01>nd, if possible, an antecedent condition preceding every
known state of affairs, whether of dead matter or of living
creatures. Unless the earth was created solid and hot out
of nothing, the regime of continued loss of heat must have
been preceded by molten matter all round the surface.
   §2l. I have given strong reasons* for believing that
immediately before solidi<U+FB01>cation at the surface, the interior
was solid close up to the surface: except comparatively small
portions of lava or melted rock among the solid masses of
denser solid rock which had sunk through the liquid, and
possibly a somewhat large space around the centre occupied
by platinum, gold, silver, lead, copper, iron, and other dense
metals, still remaining liquid under very high pressure.
   §22. I wish now to speak to you of depths below the

great surface of liquid lava bounding the earth before
consolidation; and of mountain heights and ocean depths
formed probably a few years after a <U+FB01>rst emergence of solid
rock from the liquid surface (see § 24, below), which must have
been quickly followed by complete consolidation all round the
globe. But I must <U+FB01>rst ask you to excuse my giving you all
my depths, heights, and distances, in terms of the kilometre,
 bein about six-tenths of that very inconvenient measure the
Eng ish statute mile, which, with all the other monstrosities
of our British metrical system, will, let us hope, not long
survive the legislation of our present Parliamentary session
destined to honour the sixty years’ Jubilee of Queen Victoria’s
reign by legalising the French metrical system for the United
Kingdom.
    § 23. To prepare for considering consolidation at the surface
let us go back to a time (probably not more than twenty
years earlier as we shall presently see—§ 24) when the solid
nucleus was covered with liquid lava to a depth of several
kilometres; to <U+FB01>x our ideas let us say 40 kilometres (or 4
 million centimetres). At this depth in.lava, if of speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity 2'5, the hydrostatic pressure is 10 tons weight (10
 million grammes) per square centimetre, or ten thousand
 atmospheres approximately. According to the laboratory
 experiments of Clarence King and Carl Barns * on Diabase,
 and the thermodynamic theory‘l' of my brother, the late
 Professor James Thomson, the melting temperature of
 diabase is 1170° C. at ordinary atmospheric pressure, and
 would be 142U° under the pressure of ten thousand atmo
 spheres, if the rise of temperature with pressure followed the
 law of simple proportion up to so high a pressure.
     § 24. The temperature of our 40 kilometres deep lava
 ocean of melted diabase may therefore be taken as but
 little less than 14200 from surface to bottom. Its surface
 would radiate beat out into space at some such rate as two
 (gramme-water) thermal units Centigrade per square centi
 metre per second 1. Thus, in a year (31% million seconds)

 78                    Lord Kelvin on the Age of the
 63 million thermal units would be lost per square centimetre
 from the surface. This is, according to Carl Barns, very
 nearly equal to the latent heat of fusion abandoned by a
 million cubic centimetres of melted diabase in solidifyinginto
 the glassy condition (pitch-stone) which is assumed when
 the freezing takes place in the course of a few minutes.
But, as found by Sir James Hall in his Edinburgh experi
 ments * of 100 years ago, when more than a few minutes is
 taken for the freezing, the solid formed is not a glass but a
 heterogeneous crystalline solid of rough fracture; and if a
 few hours or days, or any longer time, is taken, the solid
 formed has the well known rough crystalline structure of
basaltic rocks found in all parts of the world. New Car]
Barns <U+FB01>nds that basaltic diabase is 14 per cent. denser than
melted diahase, and 10 per cent. denser than the glass pro
 duced by quick freezing of the liquid. He gives no data,
 nor do Riicker and Roberts-Austen, who have also experi
 mented on the thermodynamic properties of melted basalt,
give any data, as to the latent heat evolved in the consolida
 tion of liquid lava into rock of basaltic quality. Guessing
 it as three times the latent heat of fusion of the diabase
 pitch-stone, I estimate a million cubic centimetres of liquid
 frozen per square centimetre per centimetre per three years.
This would diminish the depth of the liquid at the rate of a
million centimetres per three years, or 40 kilometres in twelve
y ears.
    § 25. Let us now consider in what manner this diminution
of depth of the lava ocean must have proceeded, by the
 freezing of portions of it; all having been at temperatures
very little below the assumed 1420° melting temperature of
the bottom, when the depth was 40 kilometres. The loss of
heat from the white-hot surface (temperatures from 1420° to
perhaps 1380° in different parts) at our assumed rate of two
 (gramme-water Centigrade) thermal units per sq. cm. per
sec. produces very rapid cooling of the liquid within a few
centimetres of the surface (thermal capacity '36 per gramme,
according to Barus) and in consequence great downward
rushes of this cooled liquid, and upwards of hot liquid,
spreading out horizontally in all directions when it reaches
the surface. When the sinking liquid gets within perhaps
20 or 10 or 5 kilometres of the bottom, its temperaturei

somewhat faster than the descending liquid around it, till it

ocean becomes silted up to the surface.

     §26. Upon the suppositions we have hitherto made we
have, at the stage now reached, all round the earth at the
 same time a red hot or white hot surface of solid granules or
 crystals with interstices <U+FB01>lled by the mother liquor still
 liquid, but ready to freeze with the slightest cooling. The
 thermal conductivity of this heterogeneous mass, even
 before the freezing of the liquid part, is probably nearly
 the same as that of ordinary solid granite or basalt at a.
 red heat, which is almost certainly * somewhat less than the
thermal conductivity of igneous rocks at ordinary tempera

would cool when wholly solidi<U+FB01>ed take a large macadamising

out with a pair of tongs and leave it on the hearth, or on a

       Probable Origin of Basaltic Rock *.              28, 29.)
   § 28. We have hitherto left, without much consideration,
the mother liquor among the crystalline granules at all
depths below the bottom of our shoaling lava ocean. It was
probably this interstitial mother liquor that was destined
to form the basaltic rock of future geological time. What
ever be the shapes and sizes of the solid granules when <U+FB01>rst
falling to the bottom, they must have lain in loose heaps
with a somewhat large preportion of space occupied by
liquid among them.        But, at considerable distances down in
the heap, the weight of the superincumbent granules must
tend to crush corners and edges into <U+FB01>ne powder. If the
snow shower had taken place in air we may feel pretty sure
 (even with the slight knowledge which we have of the hard—
nesses ot' the crystals of telspar, mica and hornblende, and
of the solid granules of quartz) that, at a depth of 10 kilo
metres, enough of matter from the corners and edges of the
granules of different kinds, would have been crushed into
 powder of' various degrees of <U+FB01>neness, to leave an exceed
 ingly small proportionate volume of air in the interstices
 between the solid fragments. But in reality the effective
 weight of each solid particle, buoyed as it was by hydrostatic
 pressure of a liquid less dense than itself by not more than
 20 or 15 or 10 per cent., cannot have been more than from
 about one-<U+FB01>fth to one-tenth of its weight in air, and there
 fore the same degree of crushing effect as would have been
 experienced at 10 kilometres with air in the interstices, must
 have been experienced only at depths of from 50 to 100 kilo
 metres below the bottom of the lava ocean.
    § 29. A result of this tremendous crushing together of the
solid granules must have been to press out the liquid from
 among them, as water from a sponge, and cause it to pass
upwards through the less and less closely packed hea s of
 solid particles, and out into the lava ocean above the lieap.
 But, on account of the great resistance against the liquid
 permeating upwards 30 or 40 kilometres through interstices
 among the solid granules, this process must have gone on
 somewhat slowly ; and, during all the time of the shoaling of
 the larva ocean, there may have been a considerable proportion
 of the whole volume occupied by the mother liquor amon
 the solid granules, down to even as low as 50 or 100 kilo
 metres below the top of the heap, 01' bottom of the ocean, at

 each instant. When consolidation reached the surface, the
 oozing upwards of the mother liquor must have been still
 going on to some degree. Thus, probably for a few years
 after the <U+FB01>rst consolidation at the surface, not probably for
 as long as one hundred years, the settlement of the solid
 structure by mere mechanical crushing of the corners and
 edges of solid granules, may have continued to cause the
 oozing upwards of mother liquor to the surface through
 cracks in the <U+FB01>rst formed granite crust and through fresh
 cracks in basaltic crust subsequently formed above it.

    § 30. When this oozing everywhere through <U+FB01>ne cracks
in the surface ceases, we have reached Leibnitz’s consistentior
status; beginning with the surface cool and permanently
 solid and the temperature increasing to 1150° C. at 25 or 50
or 100 metres below the surface.
       Probable Origin of Continents and Ocean Depths of
                      the Earth.       31—37.)
    § 31. If the shoaling of the lava ocean up to the surface
 had taken place everywhere at the same time, the whole sur
 face of the consistent solid would be the dead level of the
 liquid lava all round, just before its depth became zero.    On
 this supposition there seems no possibility that our present
 day continents could have risen to their present heights,
and that the surface of the solid in its other parts could have
sunk down to their present ocean depths, during the twenty
 or twenty-<U+FB01>ve million years which may have passed since the
 consistentior status began or during any time however long.
Rejecting the extremely improbable hypothesis that the conti
nents were built up of meteoric matter tossed from without,
upon the already solidified earth, we have no other possible
alternative than that they are due to heterogeneousness in
different parts of the liquid which constituted the earth before
its solidi<U+FB01>cation. The hydrostatic equilibrium of the rotating
liquid involved only homogeneousness in respect to density
over every level surface (that is to say, surface perpendicular
to the resultant of gravity and centrifugal force) : it required
no homogeneousness in respect to chemical composition. Gon
sidering the almost certain truth that the earth was built up of
meteorites falling together, we may follow in imagination the
whole process of shrinking from gaseous nebula to liquid lava
and metals, and solidi<U+FB01>cation of liquid from central regions
outwards, without <U+FB01>nding any thorough mixing up of dif
ferent ingredients, coming together from different directions

 82              . Lord Kelvin on the Age qf the
  of space—any mixing up so thorough as to produce even
  approximately chemical homogeneousness throughout every
  layer of equal density. Thus we have no ditiicnlty in under
  standing how even the gaseous nebula, which at one time
  constituted the matter of our present earth, had in itself a
 heterogeneousness from which followed by dynamical neces
 sity Europe, Asia, Africa, America, Australia, Greenland, and
 the Antarctic Continent, and the Paci<U+FB01>c, Atlantic, Indian,
 and Arctic Ocean depths, as we know them at present.
     §32. We may reasonably believe that a very slight degree
  of chemical heterogeneousness could cause great di<U+FB01>'erences
  in the heaviness of the snow shower of granules and crystals
 on diti'erent regions of the bottom of the lava ocean when
 still 50 or 100 kilometres deep. Thus we can quite see how
 it may have shoaled much more rapidly in some places than
  in others. It is also interesting to consider that the solid

 the bed of a <U+FB02>owing stream, or like dry sand blown into
 sand-hills by wind) by the eastward horizontal motion which
 liquid descending in the equatorial regions must acquire,
 relatively to the bottom, in virtue of the earth’s rotation.      It
 is indeed not improbable that this in<U+FB02>uence may have been
 largely effective in producing the general con<U+FB01>guration of
the great ridges of the Andes and Rocky Mountains and of
 the W'est Coasts of Europe and Africa. It seems, however,
certain that the main determining cause of the continents and
ocean-depths was chemical differences, perhaps very slight
differences, of the material in different parts of the great lava
ocean before consolidation.
    § 33. To <U+FB01>x our ideas let us now suppose that over some
   reat areas such as those which have since become Asia,
Europe, Africa, Australia, and America, the lava ocean had
silted up to its surface, while in other parts there still were
depths ranging down to 40 kilometres at the deepest. In
a very short time, say about twelve years according to our
former estimate (§ 24) the whole lava ocean becomes silted
up to its surface.
    § 34. We have not time enough at present to think out
all the complicated actions, hydrostatic and thermodynamic,
which must accompany, and follow after, the cooling of the
lava ocean surrounding our ideal primitive continent. Bv
a hurried view, however, of the affair we see that in virtue
of, let us say, 15 per cent. shrinkage by freezing, the level
of the liquid must, at its greatest supposed depth, sink six
kilometres relatively to the continents : and thus the liquid

                  Earth as an Abode <U+FB01>tted jbr sze.              83
  must recede from them ; and their bounding coast-lines must
  become enlarged. And just as water runs out of asandbank,
  drying when the sea recedes from it on a falling tide, so
  rivulets of the mother liquor must run out from the edges of
  the continents into the receding lava ocean. But, unlike
  sandbanks of incoherent sand permeated by water remaining
  liquid, our uncovered banks of white-hot solid crystals, with
 interstices full of the mother liquor, will, within a few hours
 of being uncovered, become crusted into hard rock by cooling
 at the surface, and freezing of the liquor, at a temperature
 somewhat lower than the melting temperatures of any of the
 crystals previously formed. The thickness of the wholly
 solidi<U+FB01>ed crust grows at <U+FB01>rst with extreme rapidity, so that
 in the course of three or four days it may come to be as
 much as a metre. At the end of a year it may be as much
 as 10 metres; with a surface, almost, or quite, cool enough
 for some kinds of vegetation. In the course of the <U+FB01>rst few
 weeks the regime of conduction of heat outwards becomes
 such that the thickness of the wholly solid crust, as long as
 it remains undisturbed, increases as the square root of the
 time; so that in 100 years it becomes 10 times, in 25 million
 years 5000 times, as thick as it was at the end of one year ;
 thus, from one year to 25 million years after the time of
 surface freezing, the thickness of the wholly solid crust might
 grow from 10 metres to 50 kilometres. These de<U+FB01>nite num
 bers are given merely as an illustration; but it is probable
 they are not enormously far from the truth in respect to what
 has happened under some of the least disturbed parts of the
 earth’s surface.
    § 35. We have now reached the condition described above
in § 30, with only this difference, that instead of the upper
surface of the whole solidi<U+FB01>ed crust being level we have
in virtue of the assumptions of          33, 34, inequalities of
6 kilometres from highest to lowest levels, or as much more
than 6 kilometres as we please to assume it.
    § 36. There must still be a small, but important, proportion
of mother liquor in the interstices between the closely packed
uncooled crystals below the wholly solidi<U+FB01>ed crust. This
liquor, differing in chemical constitution from the crystals, has
its freezing-point somewhat lower, perhaps very largely lower,
than the lowest of their melting-points. But, when we con
sider the mode .of formation (§ 25) of the crystals from the
mother liquor, we must regard it as still always a solvent
ready to dissolve, and to redeposit, portions of the crystalline
matter, when slight variations of temperature or pressure
tend to cause such actions. glow as the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of

the liquor is less, by something like 15 per cent., than the
speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the solid crystals, it must tend to <U+FB01>nd its
way upwards, and will actually do so, however slowly, until
stopped by the already solidi<U+FB01>ed impermeable crust, or until
itself becomes solid on account of loss of heat by conduction
outwards. If the up er crust were everywhere continuous
and perfectly rigid t e mother liquor must, inevitably, if
suf<U+FB01>cient time be given, <U+FB01>nd its way to the highest places of
the lower boundary of the crust, and there form gigantic
pockets of liquid lava tending to break the crust above it
and burst up through it.
    §37. But in reality the upper crust cannot have been
in<U+FB01>nitely strong ; and, judging alone from what we know of
properties of matter, we should expect gigantic cracks to
occur from time to time in the upper crust tending to shrink
 as it cools and prevented from lateral shrinkage by the non
 shrinking uncooled solid below it. When any such crack
 extends downwards as far as a pocket of mother liquor
 underlying the wholly solidi<U+FB01>ed crust, we should have an
 outburst of trap rock or of volcanic lava just such as have
been discovered by geologists in great abundance in many
parts of the world.           We might even have comparative]
 small portions of high plateaus of the primitive solid earti
 raised still higher by outbursts of the mother liquor squeezed
 out from below them in virtue of the pressure of large sur
rounding portions of the superincumbent crust.              In any such
action, due to purely gravitational energy, the centre of
 gravity of all the material concerned must sink, although
 portions of the matter may be raised to greater heights ; but
 we must leave these large questions of geological dynamics,
 having been only brought to think of them at all just now by
 our consideration of the earth, antecedent to life upon it.
     § 38. The temperature to which the earth’s surface cooled
 within a few years after the solidi<U+FB01>cation reached it, must
 have been, as it is now, such that the temperature at which
 heat radiated into space during the night exceeds that re
 ceived from the sun during the day, by the small difference
 due to heat conducted outwards from within *.                 One year
    “ Suppose, for example, the cooling and thickening of the upper crust
 has proceeded so far, that at the surface and therefore approximately for
 a few decimetres below the surface, the rate of augmentation of tem
 perature downwards is one degree per centimetre. Taking- as a rough
 average '005 C.G.S. as the thermal conductivity of the surface rock, we
 should have for the heat conducted outwards '005 of a gramme water
 thermal unit centigrade per sq. cm. per sec. (Kelvin, Math. and Phys.
 Papers, vol. iii. p. 226). Hence if (ibid. p. 223) we take 361?“, as the

  after the freezing of the granitic interstitial mother liquor at
  the earth’s surface in any locality, the average temperature
  at the surface might be warmer, by 60° or 80° Cent., than if
  the whole interior had the same average temperature as the
  surface. To <U+FB01>x our ideas, let us suppose, at the end of one
 year, the surface to be 80° warmer than it would be with no
 underground heat : then at the end of 100 years it would be
  8° warmer, and at the end of 10,000 years it would be '8 of
  a degree warmer, and at the end of 25 million years it would
 be '016 of a degree warmer, than if there were no under
  ground heat.
     §39. When the surface of the earth was still white-hot
 liquid all round, at a temperature fallen to about 1200° Cent,
 there must have been hot gases and vapour of water above
 it in all parts, and possibly vapours of some of the more
 volatile of the present known terrestrial solids and liquids,
  such as zinc, mercury, sulphur, phosphorus. The very rapid ~
 cooling which followed instantly on the solidi<U+FB01>cation at the
 surface must have caused a rapid downpour of all the vapours
 other than water, if any there were ; and a little later, rain
 of water out of the air, as the temperature of the surface
 cooled from red heat to such moderate temperatures as 40°
 and 20° and 10° Cent., above the average due to sun heat
 and radiation into the aether around the earth. What that
 primitive atmosphere was, and how much rain of water fell
 on the earth in the course of the <U+FB01>rst century after consoli
 dation, we cannot tell for certain ; but Natural History and
 Natural Philosophy give us some foundation for endeavours
 to discover much towards answering the great questions,—
 Whence came our present atmosphere of nitrogen, oxygen,
 and carbonic acid? Whence came our present oceans and
 lakes of salt and fresh water? How near an approximation
 radiations] emissivity of rock and atmosphere of gases and watery vapour
 above it radiating heat into the surrounding vacuous space (tether), we
 <U+FB01>nd 8000 X ‘005, or 40 degrees Cent. as the excess of the mean surface
 temperature above what it would be if no heat Were conducted from
 Within outwards. The present augmentation of temperature downwards
 may be taken as 1 degree Cent. per 27 metres as a rough average derived
from observations in all parts of the earth where underground temperature
 has been observed. (See British Association Reports from 1868 to 1895.
 The very valuable work of this Committee has been carried on for these
twenty-seven years with great skill, perseverance, and success, by
 Professor Everett, and he romises a. continuation of his reports from
 time to time.) This with t e same data for conductivity and radiational
emissivity as in the preceding calculation makes 40°/2700 or 00148" Cent.
per centimetre as the amount by which the average temperature of the
earth’s surface is at present kept up by underground heat.

 86            .     Lord Kelvin on the Age of the
 to present conditions was realized in the <U+FB01>rst hundred cen
 turies after consolidation of the surface?
      §40. We may consider it as quite certain that nitrogen
  gas, carbonic acid gas, and steam, escaped abundantly in
  bubbles from the mother liquor of granite, before the primi
  tive consolidation of the surface, and from the mother liquor
  squeezed up from below in subsequent eruptions of basaltic
  rock; because all, or nearly all, specimens of granite and
  basaltic rock, which have been tested by chemists in respect
  to this question ‘, have been found to contain, condensed in
  minute cavities within them, large quantities of nitrogen,
  carbonic acid, and water. It seems that in no specimen of
  granite or basalt tested has chemically free oxygen been dis
   covered, while in many, chemically free hydrogen has been
  found ; and either native iron or magnetic oxide of iron in
  those which do not contain hydrogen. From this it might
I seem probable that there was no free oxygen in the primitive
   atmosphere, and that if there was free hydrogen, it was due
   to the decomposition of steam by iron or magnetic oxide of
   iron.    Going back to still earlier conditions we might judge
   that, probably, among the dissolved gases of the hot nebula
   which became the earth, the oxygen all fell into combination
   with hydrogen and other metallic vapours in the cooling of
   the nebula, and that although it is known to be the most
   abundant material of all the chemical elements constituting
   the earth, none of it was left out of combination with other
   elements to give free oxygen in our primitive atmosphere.
       § 41. It is, however, possible, although it might seem not
   probable, that there was free oxygen in the primitive atmo
   sphere. With or without free oxygen, however, but with
    sunlight, we may regard the earth as <U+FB01>tted for vegetable life
    as now known in some species, wherever water moistened the
    newly solidi<U+FB01>ed rocky crust cooled down below the tempera
    ture of 80° or 70° of our present Centigrade thermometric
    scale, a year or two after solidi<U+FB01>cation of the primitive lava
    had come up to the surface. The thick tough velvety coating

   of the Mammoth hot springs and on the beds of the hot water
  streams <U+FB02>owing from the Geysers in the Yellowstone National
   Park of the United States. This vegetation, consisting of
   confervae, all grows under <U+FB02>owing water at various tempera
  tures, some said to be as high as 7~l° Cent. We cannot doubt
  but that some such confervae, if sown or planted in a rivulet
   or pool of warm water in the early years of the <U+FB01>rst century
   of the solid earth’s history, and if favoured with sunlight,
  would have lived, and grown, and multiplied,and would have
  made a beginning of oxygen in the air, if there had been
  none of it before their contributions. Before the end of the
  century, if sun-heat, and sunlight, and rainfall, were suitable,
  the whole earth not under water must have been <U+FB01>tted for
  all kinds of land plants which do not require much or any
  oxygen in the air, and which can <U+FB01>nd, or make, place and
  soil for their roots on the rocks on which they grow; and
  the lakes or oceans formed by that time must have been
  quite <U+FB01>tted for the life of many or all of the species of water
  plants living on the earth at the present time.        The moderate
V warming, both of land and water, by underground heat,
  towards the end of the century, would probably be favourable
  rather than adverse to vegetation, and there can be no doubt
  but that if abundance of seeds of all species of the present
  day had been scattered over the earth at that time, an im
  portant proportion of them would have lived and multiplied
  by natural selection of the places where they could best
  thrive.
      §42. But if there was no free oxygen in the primitive
  atmosphere or primitive water, several thousands, possibly
  hundreds of thousands, of years must pass before oxygen
  enough for supporting animal life, as we now know it, was
  produced. Even if the average activity of vegetable growth
  on land and in water over the whole earth was, in those early
  times, as great in respect to evolution of oxygen as that of
  a Hessian forest, as estimated by Liebig‘ 50 years ago, or
  of a cultivated English hay<U+FB01>eld of the present day, a very
  improbable supposition, and if there were no decay (ea-ema
  causz's, or gradual recombination with oxygen) of the plants
  or of portions such as leaves falling from plants, the rate of
   evolution of oxygen, reckoned as three times the weight of
  the wood or the dry hay produced, would be only about

 6 tons per English acre per annum or 115 tons per square
 metre per thousand years.         At this rate it would take only
 1533 years, and therefore in reality a much longer time
 would almost certainly be required, to produce the 2'3 tons
 of oxygen which we have at present resting on every square
 metre of the earth’s surface, land and sea*. But probably
 quite a moderate number of hundred thousand years may
 have su<U+FB02>iccd. It is interesting at all events to remark that,
 at any time, the total amount of combustible material on the
 earth, in the form of living plants or their remains left dead,
 must have been just so much that to burn it all would take
 either the whole oxygen of the atmosphere, or the excess of
 oxygen in the atmosphere at the time, above that, if any,
 which there was in the beginning. This we can safely say,
 because we almost certainly neglect nothing considerable in
 comparison with what we assert when we say that the free
 oxygen of the earth’s atmosphere is augmented only by
 vegetation liberating it from carbonic acid and water, in
 virtue of the power of sunlight, and is diminished only by
 virtual burniug'l' of the vegetable matter thus produced.
 But it seems improbable that the average of the Whole
 earth —dry land and sea-bottom—contains at present coal,
 or wood, or oil, or fuel of any kind originating in vegeta
 tation, to so great an amount as ‘767 of a ton per square
 metre of surface ; which is the amount at the rate of one ton
 of fuel to three tons of oxygen, that would be required to
 produce the 2'3 tons of oxygen per square metre of surface,
 which our present atmosphere contains. Hence it seems
 probable that the earth’s primitive atmosphere must have
 contained free oxygen.
    §43. Whatever may have been the true history of our
atmosphere it seems certain that if sunlight was ready, the
 earth was ready, both for vegetable and animal life, if not
 within a century, at all events within a few hundred cen
turies after the rocky consolidation of its surface. But was
the sun ready? The well founded dynamical theory of the
sun’s heat carefully worked out and discussed by Helmholtz,
   * In our present atmosphere, in average conditions of barometer and
thermometer we have, restingv on each square metre of the earth’s surface,
ten tons total weight, of which 7-7 is nitrogen and 2'3 is oxygen.
   T This “ virtual burning ” includes eremacausis of decay of vegetable
matter, if there is any eremacausis of decay without the intervention of
microbes or other animals.   It also includes the combination of a portion
of the food with inhaled oxygen in the regular animal economy of pro
vision for heat and power.

 life, except in so far as 1 have referred to vegetation, as
 possibly having been concerned in the preparation of an
 atmosphere suitable for animal life as we now have it.
 Mathematics and dynamics fail us when we contemplate
the earth, <U+FB01>tted for life but lifeless, and try to imagine the
 commencement of life upon it. This certainly did not take
 place by any action of chemistry, or electricity, or crystalline
 grouping of molecules under the in<U+FB02>uence of force, or by any
 possible kind of fortuitous concourse of atoms. We must
pause, face to face with the mystery and miracle of the
 creation of living creatures.
                      ADDENDUM .—May 1898.
     Since this lecture was delivered I have received from
 Professor Roberts-Austen the following results of experiments
 on the melting-points of rocks which he has kindly made at
 my request :—

     These results are in conformity with what I have said in
§§ 26—28 on the probable origin of granite and basalt, as
they show that basalt melts at a much lower temperature
than felspar, hornblende, mica, or quartz, the crystalline in
gredients of granite. In the electrolytic process for pro

Company at their Foyer-s works, alumina, of which the
melting-point is certainly above 1700° C. or 1800° C., is
dissolved in a bath of melted cryolite at a temperature of
about 800° C. So we may imagine melted basalt to be a
solvent for felspar, hornblende, mica, and quartz at tempera
tures much below their own separate melting-points; and we
can understand how the basaltic rocks of the earth may have
resulted from the solidi<U+FB01>cation of the mother liquor from
which the crystalline ingredients of granite have been
deposited.
            VI. 011 the Rate of Explosion in Gases.
               By D. L. CHAPMAN, B.A. (0won.)".
THE object of the investigation of which an account is
       given in this paper is the discover of formulae to
express the maximum rates of explosion 1n gases and the
maximum pressure in the explosive wave.
   The data which I propose to use are taken almost entirely
from the Bakerian Lecture of 1893, on “The Rates of
Explosion in Gases,” by Prof. Dixon. The maximum
velocities of explosion given below are in all cases those
measured by Prof. Dixon or under his direction. Experi
mental conclusions only will be quoted; for a complete
account of the experiments themselves, the reader is referred
to the above-mentioned paper, and to several papers which
were subsequently published in the ‘Journal of the Man
chester Literary and Philosophical Society’ and in the
‘ Journal of the Chemical Society.’
   Ignoring for the present all minor details connected with
particular cases, which may be more conveniently discussed
at a later stage, it is suf<U+FB01>cient for our purpose to state at the
outset that it has been established that the maximum velocity
of explosion, in a mixture of de<U+FB01>nite composition and at <U+FB01>xed
tem erature and pressure, has a de<U+FB01>nite value, independent
of t 0 diameter of the tube when that diameter exceeds a
certain limit. The relations existing between temperature '
and pressure and the velocity of explosion are such that an
increase of temperature causes a fall in the velocity, whereas
an increase of pressure has the reverse effect up to a certain
limit, beyond which the velocity remains constant.
   For the suggestion that an explosion is in its character
essentially similar to a sound-wave, we are also indebted to
Prof. Dixon; and there is little doubt that all subsequent
advance must be made with this suggestion as the leading
             it Communicated by Prof. Dixon, F.R.S.

idea *. Although Prof. Dixon’s sound-wave formula has
yielded such excellent results, he has pointed out the necessity
of further a priori work in the subject.
        The Rate of Ea'plosion for an In<U+FB01>nite Plane Wave.
    In the following attempt to establish a formula for the
velocity of explosion, l have made certain assumptions which
have not as yet received sn<U+FB02>icient experimental con<U+FB01>rmation ;
but they are, I think, justi<U+FB01>ed by the results. For instance,
it is assumed that, once the maximum velocity is reached, the
 front of the explosion wave is of such a character that we may
 suppose steady motion.          This, as Prof. Schuster has pointed
 out in a note to the Bakerian Lecture, is not an impossibility
 when chemical change is taking place, since the implied
 relation between pressure and density is possible under such
 circumstances. This point, however, requires further investi
gation. The wave is assumed to be an in<U+FB01>nite plane wave.
This assumption is justi<U+FB01>ed by the fact that the diameter of
the tube is without in<U+FB02>uence on the found velocity. I propose
 to limit the term “ explosive wave ” to the space within which
 chemical change is taking place. This space is bounded by
 two in<U+FB01>nite planes. On either side of the wave are the
 exploded and unexploded gases, which are assumed to have
 uniform densities and velocities. The statement that the
 exploded gas possesses uniform density and velocity for some
 distance behind the wave requires further justi<U+FB01>cation, which
 can only be imperfectly given after a discussion of the general
problem.
    How the true explosive wave is actually generated in
 practice is a question without the scope of the present investi~
 gation. In order to avoid the discussion of this point, I
 shall substitute for it a physical conception, which, although
 unrealizable in practice, will render aid in illustrating the
views here advanced.
    Let us sn pose that the gas is enclosed in an in<U+FB01>nite
 cylinder AB ‘D, provided with a piston E, and that the
 explosive wave XYZS has just started. The initial velocity
 of this wave will be small; the initial pressure along the
 plane XS will also be small compared with that ultimately
 attained. As the wave proceeds in the direction AB, the
 piston E is supposed to follow it in such a manner that
    " In the earlier researches Berthelot’s theory was accepted as a working
 hypothesis. It was only. after the dif<U+FB01>culties attending the measurement
  0 the rates Of GXPIOSIOH 1n mixtures contalnlng lnel‘t gases had been over
  come that the inadequacy of Ber-thelot’s theory became evident and the
 superiority of the sound-wave theory could be demonstrated.             .

92                  Mr. D. L. Chapman on the
the ressure at EF is always kept equal to the pressure
at S. During this process the velocity of the wave will
gradually increase, until ultimately its velocity will be
uniform, its t 'pe constant, and the exploded gas within
the area EX F homogeneous.            It is this ultimate steady
                              Fig. 1.

state alone which I propose to consider.      During the process
just described the velocity will of course constantly increase
until it attains a maximum. After the velocity has become
uniform, and the wave permanent in type, it is obvious that
another permanent state may be reached in the following
way :-Suppose a piston is introduced immediately behind
the permanent wave, and that this piston is made to move
forward more rapidly than the previous one, the pressure and
density behind the wave will thus be increased, and after a
certain period of time another steady state will be reached.
All this is equivalent to the statement that the permanent
velocity of explosion is a function of the density of the
exploded gas.
   I shall now proceed to prove the latter statement.
   Since the discussion is limited to the wave of permanent
type, we may write down the condition of steady motion,

     This formula of Riemann assumes a relation to subsist
 between V, p, and v at all points of the wave: and from it

    I shall now calculate the energy lost when a gas is allowed
to burn and the products of combustion are collected at the
normal tem erature and pressure.
    Assume t at one of the gases is enclosed in the cylinder A
and the other in the cylinder B (<U+FB01>g. 2). These gases are forced

The gain of energy is the work performed by the pistons
a and b; and the loss of energy is the heat evolved at D,
together with the work performed on the piston e. The total
energy lost is the difference of these. The volume of gas in
A and B is r0 ; therefore the work performed by the pistons

    Then

   This establishes a relation between V and v. The velocity
of a permanent explosion is therefore a function of the density
of the exploded gas.
   When an explosion starts its character and velocity are
continually changing until it becomes a wave permanent in
type and of uniform velocity.          I think it is reasonable to
assume that this wave—2'. e. the wave of which the velocity
has been measured by Prof. Dixon—is that steady wave
which possesses minimum velocity; for, once it has become a
permanent wave with uniform velocity, no reason can be
discovered for its changing to another permanent ane
having a greater uniform velocity and a greater maximum
pressure.
   This particular velocity may be discovered by eliminating 2:
from the equations                          -

  It may be well to point out that under these circumstances
the entropy of the exploded gas is a maximum.          This may be
easily shown thus :—

    It is assumed throughout that the exploded gas behind the
 wave remains at constant temperature and pressure, and has

98                  Mr. D. L. Chapman on the
a uniform velocity. Therefore during the explosion momentum
is generated by the moving piston. In an-actual explosion in
a tube not provided with a piston the whole mass of gas cannot
move forward with this uniform velocity, for there would then
be a vacuum at the end of the tube where the explosion started,
and the pressure at that end would be         zero, making it im
possible to account for the generation of     momentum. There
 is, however, no need to assume that the       whole exploded gas
acquires a uniform velocity. In fact the      velocity of the wave
 would be the same if it were followed by a layer of exploded
gas of uniform density and velocity, and would be unaffected
by any subsequent disturbance which must take place behind
the explosive wave.                                 1
    It is therefore necessary to prove that behind the explosive
 wave there is a layer of homogeneous gas. This evidently
 must he        any disturbance behind the wave can only more
forward with a velocity less than that of the wave itsetf.
    The forward velocity of any disturbance in the exploded
 gas will be given by the sum of the velocity of the gas and
 the velocity of sound in the gas.

              Calculation of the Rates of Explosion.
    In attempting to calculate the rates of explosion from the
formula there is some doubt as to what value should be adopted
for the speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant volume.         This constant has
 only been directly found at comparatively low temperatures.
 MM. Berthelot, Le Chatelier, and Mallard have made atteinpts
 to <U+FB01>nd the speci<U+FB01>c heats of the elementary gases and of carbon
 monoxide at hi h temperatures by measuring the pressure of
explosion. Bei't<U+FB01>elot arrives at the conclusion that the speci<U+FB01>c
heat at constant volume increases with the temperature, and at
 4400° C. attains the value 9'6.     M. Berthelot’s experiments
 do not, however, agree with those of MM. Le Chatelier and
 Mallard, and two series of experiments conducted b the latter _
 experimenters do not agree with one another.           he speci<U+FB01>c
 heat at constant volume may, however, be calculated from
 the; velocity of explosion with the aid of the proposed formula.
 A few explosions have therefore been selected and the speci<U+FB01>c
 heats and temperatures calculated from them ; speci<U+FB01>c heats
 at intermediate temperatures being found by interpolation. It
was immediately erceived that the. sPeci<U+FB01>c heats of 0,, H2,
 N2; and CO migfit for all practical purposes be taken as
identical at all temperatures.                    ‘
   A few words are necessary regarding explosions in which
water is formed. If the speci<U+FB01>c heat of steam is taken as
-%>< speci<U+FB01>c heat of the diatomic gases, the found rates of ex
plosion fall below the calculated rates when the dilution with
inert gas is great, and vice versd when the dilution is small.
It is possible to account for this by two theories. The <U+FB01>rst
theory is that at high temperatures the water is dissociated,
whereas at low temperatures the combination of hydrogen and
oxygen is complete. The seeping theory is that the speci<U+FB01>c heat

of steam rises more rapidly with the temperature than the spe
ci<U+FB01>c heat of the diatomic gas. The theory of dissociation is
rendered improbable by the fact that dilution of electrolytic
gas with oxygen lowers the rates a little more than dilution
with an equal volume of nitrogen. The adoption of such an
hypothesis would render it necessary for us to suppose that the
chemical reaction does not proceed to its limit. Moreover, it
would make it dif<U+FB01>cult to calculate the rates whenever steam
is formed, for it would then be impossible, with our present
knowledge, to say how far the chemical reaction would pro
ceed in any particular case. We are therefore encouraged to
test the <U+FB01>rst theory, i. e. that the speci<U+FB01>c heat of steam rises
more rapidly with the temperature than that of the diatomic
gases. The speci<U+FB01>c heat of steam at different temperatures
has therefore been calculated from a few selected rates, as in
the case of the elementary                      ases; and the values thus found
are used to calculate the ot er rates.                     The results are given

    On referring to the explosion of ethylene with excess of
 oxygen it is seen that CO, is not completely dissociated until
 a temperature of 3500° C. is reached. In all cases the tem
 perature of explosion of cyanogen with excess of oxygen is
 above this, and therefore CO, is never formed.
                    The Pressure of Explosion.
    The maximum pressure of explosion may be calculated with
 the aid of the two formulae

   The pressure for an explosion of equal volumes of cyanogen
and oxygen calculated from this formula is 57 atmospheres.
Jones and Bower* by breaking glass tubes obtain the value
58 atmospheres.
VII. The Aqueous Fusion of Glass, its Relation to Pressure
     and Temperature. First Paper. By CARL BARUS 1'.
SOME time ago I publishedi a series of results due to the
      action of hot water at 1850 on glass, the water being
kept liquid by pressure. It was shown that the water con
tained in sealed capillary glass tubes increased in compressi
bility while it steadily diminished in bulk, as described in the
subjoined summary of two consistent experiments with
different tubes. During the observations the column soon
became turbid, but it remained translucent enough to admit
of measurement. As the action at 185° proceeded, the
length of the thread of water decreased. This thread was
contained within the walls of the tube between two terminal
threads of mercury (the lower being movable and trans
mitting pressure), and therefore decrease in the length of the
thread can only mean contraction of volume of the system of
glass and water in contact. The results are as follows :—

   At the conclusion of the experiment the thread was solid,
as I supposed, at high pressure (300 atm.), though not
apparently so at low pressure. This was inferred since the
mercury thread advancing under pressure did not, on removal
of pressure, return again as a whole, but broke into small
parts in a way to make further measurement without
immediate value". 011 breaking the tube apart after cooling,
and examining it under the microscope, the capillary canal
was found to be nearly, if not quite, <U+FB01>lled with a white glassy
incrustation. This shows that the glass swells in marked
degree on hydration, whereas the combined volume of glass
and water put into action, simultaneously contracts. If the
values of v/V given in the table be examined, it appears that
whereas the original volume increment per unit of volume is
greater than '103 for the rise of temperature from 24° to 185°
at 20 atmospheres, this increment has nearly vanished after
50 minutes of reaction. The thread at 185° is now only as
long as it was at 24°. After 60 minutes of reaction it is even
markedly shorter at 185° than at 24°, pressure remaining
constant throughout.
   At the same time the compressibility, B, of the silicated

onward.

water at 185° is found to increase regularly from '000077
near the beginning of the experiment, to over '000221, or
more than three times its initial value on the same isothermal
 (185°). This result is wholly unexpected, since without
exception, the effect of solution is a decrease of the compressi
bility of the solvent, in proportion as more body is dissolved.
Silicated water in the present experiment shows the reverse
effect. Now although the hydration increases the volume of
the glass, the gradual choking of the capillary canal goes on
uniformly from top to bottom of the thread of water. Hence,
since the bore is diminished at the same rate throughout the
wetted tube, the observations for compressibility would remain
to the same degree unchanged, cast. par. Supposing that <U+FB01>ne
particles of the glass were broken off* and gradually accumu
lated on the mercury meniscus near the bottom of the thread
of water, it would be possible to account for the data for ,8
cited, in consideration of Fthe radual constriction of the
thread near the bottom. In suci a case, however, the com
pressing thread of mercury would not have advanced and
retreated through this debris with the observed regularity.
In general mere stoppage and clogging would have been
noticed in duplicate experiments 1'.          I also made correlative
experiments with saturated solutions of zinc sulphate in water
and naphthalene in alcohol. In both cases markedly increased
compressibilities were possible in a turbid column, and due to
the precipitation of part of the dissolved salt, isothermally,
by pressure. During compression a partpf the dissolved body
is changed from the liquid to the solid state by pressure, and
hence the apparent increase of compressibility.
    From this point of view I have endeavoured to account
preliminarily for the observed regular increase of 3 given in
the table, though I confess some reluctance to this explana
tion : I have supposed that the dissolved silicate is precipitated
out of solution by pressure and redissolved on removing
pressure, thus producing accentuated compressibility; that
this e<U+FB01>'ect increases as more silicate is taken up in solution,
until <U+FB01>nally the whole thread becomes too viscous for further
observation. However this may be, the fact of a regularly
and enormously increased compressibility remains as colla
teral evidence of the stage of progress of the reaction.
     2. There is a <U+FB01>nal result to be Obtained from this experi
ment, and it is to this that my remarks chie<U+FB02>y apply. The
reaction of the water on the glass must be along the surface
   it This does not occur. See below.                                _

cathetometer did not seem to diminish.

of contact of both bodies. For a given length of thread this
surface decreases as the radius, r, of the tube.       On the other
hand, the volume of water decreases as the square of the radius,
'r, of the capillary tube. In fact, if V be the volume and S
the surface for a given length of thread, S/V=2/r. Let abe
the rate of absorption of water in glass, 1'. e., the number of
cub. centim. of water absorbed per square centim. of surface
of contact, per minute. . If v is the volume absorbed by S
cm.2 per minute, v=a S and therefore v/V=2 a/r. Hence, if
r is large, the apparent e<U+FB02>'ect of absorption vanishes ; but in
proportion as r is smaller, or as the tube becomes more <U+FB01>nely
capillary, the effect of absorption will become more obvious
to the eye.     In other words, the length of the column of water
included between the two terminal threads of mercury will
decrease faster for small values of the capillary radius.
In the above results 12/ V taken directly from the table is
about '003 cub. centim. per minute. The diameter of the tube
measured microscopically was found to be about '045 centim.
 Therefore a='000034 cub. centim. is the volume of water
absorbed per square centim. of surface of contact, per minute,
at 185°. This is about 180 kg., per sq. metre, per year, at 185°.
     True the phenomenon is not quite so sim le as here com
puted, for as the action proceeds the water iiolds more body
in solution, the area of unchanged glass increases, and
possibly the liquid must diffuse or percolate through the
layer of opalescent accretion to reach it. As against the
seriousness of this consideration, one may allude to the
 regularity of the above results in the lapse of time and the
occurrence of a reaction-rather accelerated as time increases.
     In view of the large surfaces of reaction available even in
small bulks of porous or triturated rock and the fact that the
intensity of the reaction increases rapidly with temperature,
I cannot but regard this result as important.         Direct experi
ments * have been made with care to detecta possible thermal
effect (rise of temperature) of the action of water on hot glass,
but thus far without positive results. The dif<U+FB01>culties of such
experiments are very great. To insure chemical reaction,
they must be made with superheated water under pressure,
with allowances for heat conduction &c., all of which make the
measurement of small increments of temperature very
uncertain. If, however, rise of temperature may be associated
with the marked contraction of volume in the system water
glass speci<U+FB01>ed, one may note, in the <U+FB01>rst place, that for a

I have since made similar experiments with superheated water (200°).

  Uranium Radiation and Electrical Conductionproduced.                 109
capillary canal about one half millimetre in diameter, the
absorption of water is as great as 18 per cent. of the volume
contained per hour. In <U+FB01>nely porous rock correspondingly
larger absorptions are to be anticipated. Again, the tempera
tures and pressures given in the above experiments would be
more than reached by a column of water penetrating a few
miles below the earth’s surface. Finally, the action of water
on silicates will be accelerated in proportion as higher
 temperatures are entered with increasing terrestrial de th.
Eventually, therefore, heat must be evolved more rapidly than
 it is conducted away.
     With the above proviso, one may reasonably conclude that
the action of hot water on rock within the earth constitutes a
furnace whose ef<U+FB01>ciency increases in marked degree with the
depth of the seat of reaction below sea-level.

 THE remarkable radiation emitted by uranium and its
          compounds has been studied by its discoverer, Becquerel,
 and the results of his investigations on the nature and pro
 perties of the radiation have been given in a series of papers
 in the Comptes Rendus'l'.        He showed that the radiation, con
 tinuously emitted from uranium compounds, has the power
 of passing through considerable thicknesses of metals and
 other opaque substances; it has the power of acting on a
 photographic plate and of discharging positive and. negative
 electri<U+FB01>cation to an equal degree. The gas through which
 the radiation passes is made a temporary conductor of electri
 city and preserves its power of discharging electri<U+FB01>cation for
 a short time after the source of radiation has been removed.
      The results of Becquerel showed that Rontgen and uranium
 radiations were very similar in their power of penetrating
 solid bodies and producing conduction in a gas exposed to
 them; but there was an essential difference between the two
 types of radiation. He found that uranium radiation could
 be refracted and polarized, while no definite results showing

                                          § 1. Comparison of Methods of Investigation.
   The properties of uranium- radiation may be investigated
by two methods, one depending on the action on a photo
graphic plate and the other on the discharge of electri<U+FB01>cation.
The photographic method is very slow and tedious, and admits
of only the roughest measurements. Two or three days’
exposure to the radiation is generally required to produce any
marked effect on the photographic plate. In addition, when
we are dealing with very slight photographic action, the

             the Electrical Conduction produced by it.           111
fogging of the plate, during the long exposures required, by
the vapours of substances* is liable to obscure the results.
On the other hand the method of testing the electrical dis
charge caused by the radiation is much more rapid than the
photographic method, and also admits of fairly accurate
quantitative determinations.                                ‘
    The question of polarization and refraction of the radiation
can, however, only be tested by the photographic method.
The electrical experiment (explained in § 2) to test refraction
is not very satisfactory.
                 § 2. Polarization and Refraction.
    The almost identical effects produced in gases by uranium
and Rontgen radiation (which will be described later) led me
to consider the question whether the two types of radiation
did not behave the same in other respects.
    In order to test this, experiments were tried to see if
uranium radiation could be polarized or refracted. Becquerel‘l'
had found evidence of polarization and refraction, but in
repeating experiments similar to those tried by him, I have
been unable to <U+FB01>nd an evidence of either. A large number
 of photographs by t e radiation have been taken under
various conditions, but in no case have I been able to observe
any effect on the photographic plate which showed the presence
of polarization or refraction.
    In order to avoid fogging of the plate during the long
exposures required, by the vapours of substances, lead was
employed as far as possible in the neighbourhood of the
plate, as its effect on the <U+FB01>lm is very slight.
    A brief account will now be given of the experiments on
refraction and polarization.
    Refraction—A thick lead plate was taken and a long
narrow slit cut through it; this was placed over a uniform
layer of uranium oxide ; the arrangement was then equivalent
'to a line source of radiation and a slit. Thin prisms of glass,
aluminium, and paraf<U+FB01>n-wax were <U+FB01>xed at intervals on the
'lead plate with their edges just covering the slit. A photo
graphic plate was supported 5 mms. from the slit. The plate
was left for a week in a dark box. On developing a dark
line was observed on the plate. This line was not appreciably
broadened or displaced above the prisms. Different sizes of
slits gave equally negative results. If there was any appreci
able refraction we should expect the image of the slit to be
displaced from the line of the slit.
     *‘Russell, Proc. Roy. Soc. 1897.     1' C. R. 1896, p. 559.

  112    Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
     Becquerel* examined the opacity of glass for uranium
  radiation in the solid and also in a <U+FB01>nely-powdered state by
  the method of electric leakage, and found that, if anything,
  the transparency of the glass for the radiation was greater in
  the <U+FB01>nely-divided than in the solid state. Ihave repeated
 this experiment and obtained the same result. As Becquerel
 stated, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to reconcile this result with the presence
 of refraction.
    Polarization.—An arrangement ver similar to that used
 by Becquerel was employed.         A deep hole was out in a thick
 lead plate and partly <U+FB01>lled with uranium oxide. A small
 tourmaline covered the opening. Another small tourmaline
 was cut in two and placed on top of the <U+FB01>rst, so that in
 one half of the opening the tourmalines were crossed and in
 the other half uncrossed.       The tourmalines were very good
 optically. The photographic plate was supported 1 to 3 mm.
 above the tourmalines. The plate was exposed four days, and
 on developing a black circle showed up on the plate, but in
 not one of the photographs could the slightest difference in
 the intensity be observed. Becquerel-l- stated that in his
 experiment the two halves were unequally darkened, and
 concluded from this result that the radiation was doubly
 refracted by tourmaline, and that the two rays were unequally
absorbed.
                     § 3. Theory of Ionization.
    To explain the conductivity of a gas exposed to Rontgen
 radiation, the theory 1 has been put forward that the rays in
passing through the gas produce positively and negatively
charged particles in the gas, and that the number produced
per second depends on the intensity of the radiation and the
pressure.
    These carriers are assumed to be so small that they will
move with a uniform velocity through a gas under a. constant
potential gradient. The term ion was given to them from
analogy with electrolytic conduction, but in using the term
it is not assumed that the ion is necessarily of atomic dimen
sions ; it may be a multiple or submultiple of the atom.
    Suppose we have a gas between two plates exposed to the
radiation and that the plates are kept at a constant difference
of potential. A certain number of ions will be produced
per second by the radiation and the number produced will in
general depend on the pressure of the gas. Under the electric

               the Electrical Conduction produced by it. i    113
<U+FB01>eld the positive ions travel towards the negative plate and
the negative ions towards the other plate, and consequently
a current will pass through the gas. Some of the ions
will also recombine, the rate of recombination being pro
portional to the square of the number present. The current
 passing through the gas for a given intensity of radiation will
 depend on the difference of potential between the plates, but
 when the potential-di<U+FB01>'erence is greater than a certain value
 the current will reach a maximum. When this is the case
 all the ions are removed by the electric <U+FB01>eld before they
 can recombine.
    The positive and negative ions will be partially separated
by the electric <U+FB01>eld, and an excess of ions of one sign may be
blown away, so that a charged gas will be obtained. If the ions
are not uniformly distributed between the plates, the potential
gradient will be disturbed by the movement of the ions.
    If energy is absorbed in producing ions, we should expect
the absorption to be proportional to the number of ions pro
duced and thus depend on the pressure. If this theory be
applied to uranium radiation we should expect to obtain the
following results :—
    (1) Charged carriers produced through the volume of the
             as.
    (2) Ionization proportional to the intensity of the radiation
           and the pressure.
    (3) Absorption of radiation proportional to pressure.
    (4) Existence of saturation current.
    (5) Rate of recombination of the ions proportional to the
           square of the number present.
    (6) Partial separation of positive and negative ions.
    (7) Disturbance of potential gradient under certain con
           ditions between two plates exposed to the radiation.
    The experiments now to be described suf<U+FB01>ciently indicate
that the theory does form a satisfactory explanation of the
electrical conductivity produced by uranium radiation.
    In all experiments to follow, the results are independent of
the sign of the charged plate, unless the contrary is expressly
stated.
          § 4. Complea' Nature of Uranium Radiation.
    Before entering on the general phenomena of the conduction
produced by uranium radiation,an account will be given of some
experiments to decide whether the same radiation is emitted
by uranium and its compounds and whether the radiation 1s

homogeneous. Rontgen and others have observed that the
z-rays are in general of a complex nature, including rays of
wide di<U+FB02>'erences in their power of penetrating solid bodies.
The penetrating power is also dependent to a large extent on
the stage of exhaustion of the Crookes tube.                  _
   In order to test the complexity of the radiation, an electrical
method was employed. The general arrangement 1s shown
in <U+FB01>g. 1.
                              Fig. l.
    The metallic uranium or compound of uranium to be
 employed was powdered and spread uniformly over the centre
 of a horizontal zinc plate A, 20 cm. square. A zinc plate B,
 20 cm. square, was <U+FB01>xed parallel to A and 4 cm. from it.
 Both plates were insulated. A was connected to one pole of
 a battery of 50 volts, the other pole of which was to earth;
 B was connected to one pair of quadrants of an electrometer,
 the other pair of which was connected to earth.
    Under the influence of the uranium radiation there was a
 rate of leak between the two plates A and B. The rate of
 movement of the electrometer-needle, when the motion was
 steady, was taken as a measure of the current through the
 gas.Successive layers of thin metal foil were then placed over
 the uranium compound and the rate of leak determined for
 each additional sheet. The table (p. 115) shows the results
 obtained for thin Dutch metal.
    In the third column the ratio of the rates of leak for each
 additional thickness of metal leaf is given. Where two
 thicknesses were added at once, the square root of the observed
 ratio is taken, for three thicknesses the cube root.         The
 table shows that for the <U+FB01>rst ten thicknesses of metal the rate
 of leak diminished approximately in a geometrical progression
 as the thickness of the metal increased in arithmetical pro
 gression.

two plates for a saturating voltage is proportional to the
intensity of the radiation after passing through the metal.
The voltage of 50 employed was not suf<U+FB01>cient to saturate the
gas, but it was found that the comparative rates of leak under
similar conditions for 50 and 200 volts between the plates
were nearly the same.               When we are dealing with very
small rates of leak, it is advisable to employ as small a voltage
as possible, in order that any small changes in the voltage
of the battery should not appreciably affect the result. For
this reason the voltage of 50 was used, and the comparative
rates of leak obtained are very approximately the same as
for saturating electromotive forces.
    Since the rate of leak diminishes in a geometrical pro
gression with the thickness of metal, we see from the above
statement that the intensity of the radiation falls off in a
geometrical progression, 2'. e. according to an ordinary absorp
tion law. This shows that the part of the radiation considered
is approximately homogeneous.
    With increase of the number of layers the absorption
commences to diminish. This is shown more clearly by using
uranium oxide with layers of thin aluminium leaf (see table
    116).
P . It will be observed that for the <U+FB01>rst three layers of aluminium
foil, the intensity of the radiation falls 011' according to the
ordinary absorption law, and that, after the fourth thickness,
the intensity of the radiation is only slightly diminished by
adding another eight layers. I

   The aluminium foil in this case was about '0005 cm. thick,
so that after the passage of the radiation through '002 cm. of
aluminium the intensity of the radiation is reduced to about
910 of its value. The addition of a thickness of '001 cm. of
aluminium has only a small effect in cutting down the rate
of leak. The intensity is, however, again reduced to about
half of its value after passing through an additional thickness
of '05 cm., which corresponds to 100 sheets of aluminium
foil.
   These experiments show that the uranium radiation is
complex, and that there are present at least two distinct types
of radiation—one that is very readily absorbed, which will be
termed for convenience the a radiation, and the other of a
more penetrative character, which will be termed the B
radiation.
   The character of the B radiation seems to be independent
of the nature of the <U+FB01>lter through which it has passed. It
was found that radiation of the same intensity and of the same
penetrative power was obtained b cutting off the a radiation
by thin sheets of aluminium, tinfoi , or paper. The B radiation
passes through all the substances tried with far greater facility
than the a radiation. For example, a plate of thin cover
glass placed over the uranium reduced the rate of leak to 310
of its value; the B radiation, however, passed through it
with hardly any loss of intensity.
   Some experiments with different thicknesses of aluminium
seem to show, as far as the results go, that the B radiation is
of an approximately homogeneous character. The following
table gives some of the results obtained for the Bradiation
from uranium oxide :—

    The rate of leak is taken as unity after the a radiation has
 been absorbed by passing through ten layers of aluminium
 foil. The intensity of the radiation diminishes with the
 thickness of metal traversed according to the ordinary
 absorption law.      It must be remembered that when we are
 dealing with the B radiation alone, the rate of leak is in
 general onlya few per cent. of the leak due to the a radiation,
 so that the investigation of the homogeneity of the B radiation
 cannot be carried out with the same accuracy as for the a
 radiation. As far, however, as the experiments have gone,
 the results seem to point to the conclusion that the B radiation
 is approximately homogeneous, although it is possible that
 other types of radiation of either small intensity or very
 great penetrating power may be present.
   § 5. Radiation emitted by dq'ferent Compounds of Uranium.
    All the compounds of uranium examined gave out the two
t pes of radiation, and the penetrating power of the radiation
for both the a and Bradiations is the same for all the compounds.
    The table (p. 118) shows the results obtained for some of
the uranium compounds.
    Fig. 2 shows graphically some of the results obtained for
the various uranium compounds. The ordinates represent
rates of leak, and the abscissas thicknesses of aluminium
through which the radiation has passed.
    The different compounds of uranium gave di<U+FB01>'erent rates
of leak, but, for convenience of comparison, the rate of leak
due to the uncovered salt is taken as unity.
    It will be seen that the rate of decrease is approximately
the same for the <U+FB01>rst layer of metal, and that the rate of
decrease becomes much slower after four thicknesses of foil.
    The rate of leak due to the B radiation is a di<U+FB01>'erent
proportion of the total amount in each case. The uranium

 metal was used in the form of powder, and a smaller area of
 it was used than in the other cases. For the experiments on
 uranium oxide a thin layer of <U+FB01>ne powder was employed,
and we see, in that case, that the ,8 radiation hears a much
 smaller proportion to the total than for the other compounds.
 When a thick layer of the oxide was used there was, how
 ever, an increase in the ratio, as the following table shows :—

    The amount of the a radiation depends chie<U+FB02>y on the
 surface of the uranium compound, while the ,8 radiation
 depends also on the thickness of the layer. The increase of
the rate of leak due to the ,8 radiation with the thickness of
the layer indicates that the B radiation can pass through a
considerable thickness of the uranium compound. Experi
ments showed that the leak due to the a radiation did not
increase much with the thickness of the layer. I did not,
however, have enough uranium salt to test the variation of
the rate of leak due to the B radiation for thick layers.
    The rate of leak from a given weight of uranium or
uranium compound depends largely on the amount of surface.
The greater the surface, the greater the rate of leak. A small
crystal of uranium nitrate was dissolved in water, and the
water then evaporated so as to deposit a thin layer of the
salt OVer the hottom of the dish. This gave quite a large
leakage. The leakage in such a case is due chie<U+FB02>y to the
a radiation.
 _ Since the rate of leak due to any uranium compound
depends largely on its amount of surface, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to
compare-the quantity of radiation given out by equal amounts
of different salts: for the result will depend greatly on the

1‘20    Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
state of division of the compound. It is possible that the
apparently very powerful radiation obtained from pitchblende
by Curie * may be partly due to the very <U+FB01>ne state of division
of the substance rather than to the presence of a new and
  owerful radiating substance.
   The rate of leak due to the B radiation is, as a rule, small
compared with that produced by the a radiation. It is
dif<U+FB01>cult, however, to compare the relative intensities of the
 two kinds. The a radiation is strongly absorbed by gases
 (§ 8), while the B radiation is only slightly so. It will be
 shown later      8) that the absorption of the radiation by the
 gas is approximately proportional to the number of ions
 produced. If therefore the B radiation is only slightly
 absorbed by the gas, the number of ions produced by it is
 small, i. e. the rate of leak is small.      The comparative rates
 of leak due to the a, and B radiation is thus dependent on the
 relative absorption of the radiations by the gas as well as on
 the relative intensity.
    The photographic actions of the a and B radiations have
 also been compared. A thin uniform layer of uranium oxide
 was sprinkled over a glass plate; one half of the plate was
 covered by a piece of aluminium of suf<U+FB01>cient thickness to prac
 tically absorb the a radiation. The photographic plate was <U+FB01>xed
 about 4 mm. from the uranium surface. The plate was exposed
 48 hours, and, on developing, it was found that the darkening of
 the two halves was not greatly different. ()n the one half of the
 plate the action was due to the B radiation alone, and on the
 other due to the a; and B radiations together. Except when
 the photographic plate is close to the uranium surface, the
 photographic action is due principally to the B radiation.

    The above results show what a great difference there is in
the power of penetration of the two types of radiation.                                   The
transparency of aluminium for the ,8 radiation is over 100
times as great as for the a radiation.                                    The opacity of the
metals aluminium, copper, silver, platinum for the ,8 radiation
follows the same order as their atomic weights. Aluminium
is the most transparent of the metals used, but glass is more
transparent than aluminium for the )3 radiation.                                     Platinum
has an opacity 16 times as great as aluminium. For the
a radiation, aluminium is more transparent than Dutch metal
or tinfoil.
    For a thickness of aluminium '09 cm. the intensity of the
 B radiation was reduced to '25 of its value; for a thickness
 of copper '03 cm. the intensity was reduced to '23 of its
 value. These results are not in agreement with some given
 by Becquerel *, who found copper was more transparent than
 aluminium for uranium radiation.
    The B radiation has a penetrating power of about the same
 order as the radiation given out by an average w-ray bulb.
 Its power of penetration is, however, much less than for the
 rays from a “hard” bulb.                                      The a radiation, on the other
 hand, is far more easily absorbed than rays from an ordinary
 bulb, but is very similar in its penetrating power to the
 secondary radiationT sent out when w-rays fall upon a metal
 surface.
    It is possible that the a radiation is a secondary radiation
 set up at the surface of the uranium by the passage of the
 ,8 radiation through the uranium, in exactly the same way

 as a diffuse radiation is produced at the surface of a metal by
 the passage of antgen-rays through it. There is not, how
 ever, sutticient evidence at present to decide the question.
                       § 7. Thorium Radiation.
    While the experiments on the complex nature of uranium
 radiation were in progress, the discovery * that thorium
 and its salts also emitted a radiation, which had general
 properties similar to uranium radiation, was announced. A
 few experiments were made to compare the types of radiation
 emitted by uranium and thorium.
    The nitrate and the sulphate of thorium were used and gave
 similar results, although the nitrate appeared to be the more
 active of the two. The leakage effects due to these salts were
 of quite the same order as those obtained for the uranium
 compounds; but no satisfactory quantitative comparison can
 be made between the uranium and thorium salts'as the amount
 of leak depends on the amount of surface and thickness of
 the layer.
   It was found that thorium nitrate when <U+FB01>rst exposed to the
air on a platinum plate was not a steady source of radiation,
and for a time the rate of leak varied very ca riciously, being
sometimes <U+FB01>ve times as great as at others.             he salt was very
deliquescent, but after exposure of some hours to the atmo
sphere the rate of leak became more constant and allowed of
rough comparative measurements. Thorium sulphate was
more constant than the nitrate.
   The absorption of the thorium radiation was tested in the
same way as for uranium radiation. The following table
gives some of the results. The aluminium foil was of the
same thickness ('0005 cm.) as that used in the uranium
experiments :—

    The curve showing the relation between the rate of leak
and the thickness of the metal traversed is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2
 (p. 118), together with the results for uranium.
‘ It will be seen that thorium radiation is different in pene
 trative power from the a radiation of uranium. The radiation
 will pass through between three and four thicknesses of alu
 minium foil before the intensity is reduced to one-half, while
 with uranium radiation the intensity is reduced to less than a
 half after passing through one thickness of foil.
     With a thickTayer of thorium nitrate it was found that the
 radiation was not homogeneous, but rays of a more penetrative
 kind were present. On account of the inconstancy of thorium
 nitrate as a source of radiation, no accurate experiments have
  been made on this point.
     The radiations from thorium and uranium are thus both
  complex, and as regards the a type of radiation are different
  in penetrating power from each other.
     In all the experiments on uranium and thorium, care was
  taken that no stray radiation was present which would obscure
  the results. Such precautions are very necessary when the
  rate of leak, due to the radiation transmitted through a con
  siderable thickness of metal, is only a small percentage of the
  total. The method generally employed was to cover the layer
  of active salt with the metal screen, and then place in position
  over it a large sheet of lead with a rectangular hole cut in it
  of smaller area than that of the layer of salt. The lead was
  pressed tightly down, and the only radiation between the
  parallel plates had to pass through the metal screen, as the
  lead was too thick to allow any to go through.
           §8. Absorption of Uranium Radiation by Gases.
      The a radiation from uranium and its compounds is rapidly
   absorbed in its passage through gases. The absorption for
   hydrogen, air, and carbonic acid was determined, and was
   found to be least in hydrogen and greatest in carbonic acid.
   To show the presence of absorption, the following arrange
   ment (<U+FB01>g. 3) was used :—                             I
      A layer of uranium-potassium sulphate or uranium oxide
   was spread uniformly over a metal plate P, forming alamella
   of 11 cm.diameter. A glass vessel Gr, 12 cm. in diameter, was
   placed over the layer. Two parallel metal plates A and B,
   1'5 cm. apart, were insulated from each other by ebonite
   rods. A circular opening 7 cm. in diameter was cut in the
     late A, and the opening covered by a sheet of aluminium
   ibil 00005 cm. thick.      The plate B was connected through a

124      Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
rod R to a screw adjustment S, so that the condenser AB
could be moved as a whole parallel to the base-plate. The
system AB was ad'usted parallel to the uranium surface and
did not rotate wit the screw. The rod R passed through
                             Fig. 3.

a short glass tube <U+FB01>xed in the ebonite plate C.           A short
piece of indiarubber tubing T was passed over the glass
tube and a projecting <U+FB02>ange in which the rod R was screwed.
This served the same purpose as the usual stuf<U+FB01>ng-box, and
allowed the distance of AB from the uranium to be adjusted
under low pressures.          -
   The plate A was connected to one pole of a battery of
60 volts, the other pole of which was to earth. The plate B
was connected through the screw to one pair of quadrants of
an electrometer, the other pair of which was to earth. In
order to avoid the collection of an electrostatic charge on the
  lass surface due to the conduction between the uranium and
t e glass near it, it was found very necessary to coat the
inside of the glass cylinder with tinfoil. The tinfoil and
base-plate P were connected to earth.
   Since the surface of the uranium layer may be supposed
to be giving out radiation uniformly from all parts, the
intensity of the radiation at points near the centre of the
uranium surface should be approximately uniform. If there
were no absorption of the radiation in the gas, we should
expect the intensity of the radiation to vary but slightly with

             the Electrical Conduction produced by it.                             125
distances from the surface small compared with the diameter
of the radiating surface.
   The radiation passing through the aluminium produces
conductivity between A and B (<U+FB01>g. 3), and the rate of
leak depends on the intensity of the radiation which has
passed through a certain thickness of gas and the aluminium
foil. As the s stem AB is moved from the base-plate, if
there is a rapi absorption of the radiation in the gas, we
should expect the rate of leak to fall off rapidly, and this
is found to be the case.             The following table gives the results
obtained for air, hydrogen, carbonic acid, and coal-gas. For
the <U+FB01>rst reading the distance d of the aluminium foil from the
base-plate was about 3'5 mm.

 distances from the base-plate. It will be seen that the
 current decreases most rapidly in carbonic acid and least in
 hydrogen.          As the distance from the base-plate increases in
 arithmetical progression, the rate of leak diminishes approxi
 mately in geometrical progression. The rapid decrease of
the current is due to the absorption of the radiation in its
 passage through the gas. The decrease of the current in air
at 190 mm. pressure is also shown in the <U+FB01>gure. Since the
absorption is smaller for air at this pressure than at normal
pressure, the rate of leak diminishes much more slowly with
the distance.
   In the above experiments both the a and B radiations
produce conductivity in the gas. A thin layer of uranium
oxide was, however, used, and in that case the rate of leak due
to the [3 radiation may be neglected in comparison with that
produced by the a radiation.                    '
   The results that have been obtained on the variation of the
rate of leak with distance may be simply interpreted on the
theory of the ionization of the gas through which the radia
tion passes. It is assumed that the rate of ionization is

            the Electrical Conduction produced by it.        127
proportional to the intensity of the radiation (as is the case
in Rontgen-ray conduction), and that the intensity of the
radiation near the uranium surface is constant over a plane
parallel to that surface. This is very approximately the case
if the distance from the uranium surface is small compared
with the diameter of the radiating surface.
    For simplicity we will consider the case of an in<U+FB01>nite
plane of uranium giving out homogeneous radiation.
    If I be the intensity of the radiation close to the uranium
surface, the intensity at a distance .2: is equal to Ir“ where A.
is the coe<U+FB01>icient of absorption of the gas. The intensity is
diminished in passing through the layer of aluminium foil A
 (<U+FB01>g. 3) in a constant ratio for all distances from the uranium.
 The intensity at a. distance .2' after passing through the
 aluminium is thus 1dr“ where x is a constant. The rate of
 production of the ions between two parallel planes between
 A and B (<U+FB01>g. 3) at distances .1; +¢Zw and .z' from the uranium
 is therefore proportional to Ink—“dc. If r be the distance of
 A from the uranium, and l the distance between A and B,
 the total number of ions produced per second between A and
 B is proportional to
                             2+1“

 When a “saturating” electromotive force (see §16) acts
 between A and B, the current is proportional to the total
 number of ions produced. Now, as the system AB is moved
 from the radiating surface, ;— (1—e‘“) is a constant for any
 particular gas. We thus see that the rate of leak is propor
 tional to F“, or the rate of leak decreases in geometrical
 progression as the distance 7' increases in arithmetical pro
 gresswn.
    This result allows us to at once deduce the value of the
 coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption for different gases from the data we
 have previously given.
    The results are given in the following table :—

 or, to express the same results in a different way, the
 intensity of the radiation from an in<U+FB01>nite plane of uranium
 is reduced by absorption to half its value after having passed
 through
                        3 mm. of carbonic acid,
                        4'3 mm. of air,

                      16'3 mm. of hydrogen.
  ‘ We see that the absorption is least in hydrogen and greatest
 in carbonic acid, and follows the same order as the density of
 the gases.
    The values given above are for the a radiation. The B
 radiation is not nearly so rapidly absorbed as the a, but, on
 account of the small electrical leakage produced in its passage
through the gas, it was not found feasible to measure the
absorption in air or other gases.
    The absorption of the a radiation by gases is ver much
greater than the absorption of rays from an ordinary (grookes’
tube. In a previous paper * it has been shown that the value
 of 7t for the radiation from the particular bulb used was '01.
The absorption coe<U+FB02>icient for the a radiation is 1'6, or 160
times as great. The absorption of the B radiation in gases is
probably of the same order as the absorption for ordinary
w-rays.
            § 9. Variation of Absorption with Pressure.
    The absorption of the a radiation increases with increase
of pressure and very approximately varies directly as the
pressure.                                          .

   For the purpose of comparison the rate of leak at the
distance d is taken as unity in each case. It can readily be
deduced from the results that the intensity of the radiation is
reduced to half its value after passing through
                            4'3 mm. of air at 760 mm.

    The absorption is thus approximately proportional to the
pressure for the range that has been tried.                        It was not
found feasible to measure the absorption at lower pressures
on account of the large. distances through which the radiation
must pass to be appreciably absorbed.
      A second method of measuring the absorption of the radia
tion in gases, which depends on the variation of the rate
of leak between two plates as the distance between them is
varied, is given in § 12.

130       Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
investigated the subject, and came to the conclusion that in
some cases the rate of leak varied as the pressure, and in
others as the square root of the pressure, according to the
voltage employed. Their tabulated results, however, do not
show any close agreement with either law, and in fact, as I
hope to show later, the relation between the rate of leak and
the pressure is a very variable one, depending to a large

 rounding conductors, as well as on the gas employed. The
 subject is greatly complicated by the -rapid absorption of the
 radiation by gases, but all the results obtained may be inter
 preted on the assumption that the rate of production of ions
 at any point varies directly as the intensity of the radiation
 and the pressure of the gas.
     To determine the e<U+FB02>'ects of pressure, an apparatus similar
 to <U+FB01>g. 3 was used, with the difference that the plate A was
 removed. The uranium compound was spread uniformly
 over the central part of the lower plate.                 The movable
 plate, which was connected with the electrolneter, was 10 cm.

             the Electrical Conduction produced by it.           131
in diameter and moved parallel to the uranium surface.
The base-plate was connected to one pole of a battery of
100 volts, the other pole of which was connected to earth.
The rate of movement of the electrometer-needle was taken
as a measure of the current between the plates. In some
cases the uranium compound was covered with a thin layer of
aluminium foil, but although this diminished the rate of leak
the general relations obtained were unaltered.
   The following tables give the results obtained for air,
hydrogen, and carbonic acid at different pressures with a
potential-difference of 100 volts between the plates—an
amount suf<U+FB01>cient to approximately “saturate ” the gases air
and hydrogen. Much larger voltages are required to produce
approximate saturation for carbonic acid.

   The current at atmospheric pressure is in each case taken as
unity for comparison, although the actual rates of leak were
different for the three gases. Fig. 5 (p. 130) shows these
results graphically, where the ordinates represent current
and the abscissze pressure. The dotted line shows the position
ofthe curve if the rate of leak varied directly as the pressure.
It will be observed that for all three gases the rate of leak
<U+FB01>rst of all increases directly as the pressure, and then
increases more slowly as the pressure increases. The differ
ence is least marked in hydrogen and most marked in
carbonic acid. In hydrogen the rate of leak is nearly pro
portional to the pressure.
   The relation between the rate of leak and the pressure
depends also on the distance between the plates. The following
few numbers are typical of the results obtained. There was
a potential-di<U+FB02>'erence of 200 volts between the plates and the
rate of leak is given in scale-divisions per mm.

For small distances between the plates the rate of leak is
more nearly proportional to the pressure than for large dis—
tances.                                                          ' ~
   The differences between the results for various gases and
for different distances receive a simple explanation if we
consider that the intensity of the radiation falls off rapidly
 between the plates on account of the absorption in the gas.
 The tables given for the relation between current and pres
 sure, where the distance between the plates is small, show
 that when the absorption is small, the rate of leak varies
 directly as the pressure. For small absorption the intensity
 of the radiation is approximately uniform between the plates,
 and therefore the ionization of the gas is uniform throughout
 the volume of the gas between the plates. Since under a
 saturating electromotive force the rate of leak is proportional

               the" Electrical Conduction produced b]; it.        133
   to the total ionization, the above experiments show that the
   rate of production of the ions at any point is proportional to
   the pressure. It has been previously shown that the absorp
   tion of the radiation is approximately proportional to the
   pressure.

  be equal to

  of the total number of ions produced at the pressure p, to the

or the rate of leak when the pressure is small is proportional
to the pressure.
    If the absorption is large between the plates at both the
pressures p1 and 12,, the value of r is nearly unity—i. e. the
rate of leak is approximately independent of the pressure.
Ex erimental results on this point are shown graphically in
<U+FB01>g. 7 (p. 138).
    For intermediate values of the absorption, the value of r
changes more slowly than the pressure.
   With the same distance between the plates, the difference

134     Prof. E. Rutherford 0n Uranium Radiation and
between the curves (<U+FB01>g. 5) for air and hydrogen is due to the
greater absorption of the radiation by the air.     The less the
absorption of the gas, the more nearly is the rate of leak pro
portional to the pressure. For carbonic acid the rate of
leak decreases far more slowly with the pressure than for
hydrogen; this is due partly to the much greater value of the
 absorption in carbonic acid and partly to the fact that
 100 volts between the plates was not suf<U+FB01>cient to saturate the
  as.
    If we take the rate of leak between two parallel plates
 some distance from the source of radiation, we obtain the
 somewhat surprising result that the rate of leak increases at
 <U+FB01>rst with diminution of pressure, although a saturating elec
 tromotive force is applied.
    The arrangement used was very similar to that in ii . 3.
 The rate of leak was taken between the plates A and B, wiich
 were 2 cm. apart, and the plate A was about 1'5 cm. from
 the uranium surface. The following table gives the results

 The results are represented graphically in <U+FB01>g. 6.
    The rate of leak reaches a maximum at a pressure of less
 than half an atmosphere, and then decreases, and at a pressure
 of 100 mm. the rate of leak is still greater than at atmo
 spheric pressure.
    This result is readily explained by the great absorption of
 the radiation at atmospheric pressure and the diminution of
 absorption with pressure.

     If d,=3 cm., d1=1, the leak is a maximum when the
 pressure is about i} of an atmosphere.               On account of the
 large distance of the plates from the uranium surface in
 the experimental arrangements, no comparison between
experiment and theory could be made.
     In all the investigations on the relation between the pres
 sure and the rate of leak, large electromotive forces have
 been used to ensure that the current through the gas is
 proportional to the total ionization of the gas.             With low
 voltages the relation between current and pressure would be

 136     Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
 very different, and would vary greatly with the voltage and
 distance between the electrodes as well as with the gas. It
 has not been considered necessary to introduce the results
 obtained for small voltages in this paper, as they are very
 variable under varying conditions. Although they may all be
 simply explained on the results obtained for the saturating
 electromotive forces they do not admit of simple calculation,
 and only serve to obscure the simple laws which govern the
 relations between ionization, absorption, and pressure. The
 general nature of the results for low voltages can be deduced
 from a consideration of the results given for the connexion
 (see § 16) between the current through the gas and the
 electromotive force acting on it at various pressures.
    The above results for the relation between current and
pressure may be compared with those obtained for Rontgen
radiation. Perrin * found that the rate of leak varied directly
as the pressure for saturating electromotive forces when the
radiation did not impinge on the surface of the metal plates.
This is in agreement with the results obtained for uranium
radiation, for Perrin’s result practically asserts that the ioni
zation is proportional to the pressure. The results, however,
of other experimenters on the subject are very variable and
contradictory, due chiefly to the fact that in some cases the
results were obtained for non-saturating electromotive forces,
while, in addition, the surface ionization at the electrodes
greatly complicated the relation, especially at low pressures.
         §11. Amount of Ionization in Di<U+FB01>'erent Gases.
   It has been shown that the a radiation from uranium is
rapidly absorbed by air and other gases. In consequence of
this the total amount of ionization produced, when the radia
tion is completely absorbed, can be determined.
   The following arrangement was used :—-A brass ball 2'2 cm.
in diameter was covered with a thin layer of uranium oxide.
A thin brass rod was screwed into it and the sphere was <U+FB01>xed
centrally inside a bell-jar of 13 cm. diameter, the brass rod
passing through an ebonite stopper. The bell-jar was <U+FB01>xed
to a base-plate, and was made air-ti ht. The inside and out
side of the bell-jar were covered wit tinfoil. In practice an
E.M.F. of 800 volts was applied to the outside of the bell
jar. The sphere, through the metal rod, was connected to
one pair of quadrants of an electrometer. It was assumed
that, with such a large potential-di<U+FB01>'erence between the bell
jar and the sphere, the gas was approximately saturated and

    The results for hydrochloric acid and ammonia are only
 approximate, for it was found that both gases slightly altered
 the radiation emitted by the uranium oxide. For example,
 before the introduction of the gas the rate of leak due to air
 was found to be 100 divisions in 69 sec.; after the introduction
 of hydrochloric acid 100 divisions in 72 sec.; and with air
 again after the gas was removed 100 divisions in 74 sec.
    The rate of leak is greatest in coal-gas and least in hydro
 gen, but all the gases tried show roughly the same amount
 of ionization as air. In the case considered both kinds of
 radiation emitted by uranium are producing ionization in
 the gas. By covering over the uranium oxide with a few
 layers of thin tinfoil it was found that, for the arrangement
  used, the rate of leak due to the penetrating ray was small in
 comparison with the rate of leak due to the a radiation.
    The effect of diminution of the pressure on the rate of leak
 for air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid is shown in <U+FB01>g. 7,
 where the abscissae represent pressure and the ordinates rate
 of leak. In the case of air and carbonic acid it was found
 that the rate of leak slightly increased at <U+FB01>rst with diminu
 tion of pressure. This was ascribed to the fact that even
 with 800 volts acting between the uranium and the surround
 ing conductor the saturation for atmospheric pressure was
 not complete. It will be observed that the rate of leak in
 air remains practically constant down to a pressure of
 400 mm., and for carbonic acid down to a pressure of r
 200 mm. In hydrogen, however, the change of rate of leak
 with pressure is more rapid, and shows that all the radiation

 138    Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
emitted by the uranium was not completely absorbed at
atmospheric pressure, so that the total ionization is pro
bably larger than the value given in the table.

   Assuming that there is the same energy of radiation
emitted whatever the gas surrounding the uranium and that
the radiation is almost completely absorbed in the gas, we
see that there is approximately the same amount of ionization
in all the gases for the same absorption of energy. This is a
very interesting result, as it affords us some information on
the subject of the relative amounts of energy required to
produce ionization in different gases. In whatever process
ionization may consist there is energy absorbed, and the
energy required to produce a separation of the same quantity
of electricity (which is carried by the ions of the gas) is
approximately the same in all the gases tried.
   From the results we have just given, it will be seen how
inde<U+FB01>nite it is to speak of the conductivity of a gas produced
by uranium radiation. The rati0-0f the conductivities for
different gases will depend very largely on the distance
apart of the electrodes between which the rate of leak is
observed. When the distance between the electrodes (e. 9.
two parallel plates) is small, the rate of leak is greater in

            the Electrical Conduction Produced by it.        139
carbonic acid than in air, and greater in air than in hydrogen.
As the distance between the plates is increased, these values
tend to approximate equality. If, however, the rate of leak is
taken between two plates some distance from the radiating
surface (e. g. the plates A and B in <U+FB01>g. 3), the ratio of the
rates of leak for different gases will depend on the distance
of the plate A from the surface of the uranium.           If the
plate A is several centimetres distant from the uranium, the
rate of leak will be greater with hydrogen than with air, and
greater in air than in carbonic acid —the exact reverse of the
other case. These considerations will also apply to what is
meant by the conductivity of a gas for uranium radiation.
   In a previous paper* I found the coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption
of a gas for Rontgen rays to be roughly proportional to the
conductivity of the gas.       The conductivity in this case was
measured by the rate of leak between two plates close together
and not far from the Crookes tube.         The absorption in the
air between the bulb and the testing apparatus was small.
If it were possible to com-pleter absorb the Rontgen radia
tion in a gas and measure the resulting conductivity, the total
current should be independent of the gas in which the radia
tion was absorbed. This result follows at once if the ab
sorption is proportional to the ionization produced for all
gases. The results for uranium and Rontgen radiation are
thus very similar in this respect.
  § 12. Variation of the Current between two Plates with the
                       Distance between them.
   The experimental arrangement adopted was similar to that
in <U+FB01>g. 3 with the plate A removed. Two horizontal polished
zinc plates 10 cm. in diameter were placed inside a bell-jar.
The lower plate was <U+FB01>xed and covered with a uniform layer
of uranium oxide, and the upper plate was movable, by
means of a screw, parallel to the lower plate. The bell-jar
was air-tight, and was connected with an air-pump. The
lower plate was connected to one pole of a battery of 200
volts, the other pole of which was earthed, and the insulated
top plate was connected with the electrometer. The exterior
surface of the glass was covered with tinfoil connected to
earth.

greatest distance apart of 1'5 cm.
   It will be observed that the rate of leak increases nearly
proportionally to the distance between the plates for short
distances, but for air at atmospheric pressure increases very
slowly with the distance when the distances are large.
   If there were no appreciable absorption of the radiation by
the gas, the ionization would be approximately uniform
between the plates, provided the diameter of the uranium
surface was large compared with the greatest distance between
the plates. The saturation rate of leak would in that case
vary as the distance. If there is a large absorption of the
radiation by the gas, the ionization will be greatest near the
uranium and will fall off rapidly with the distance. The
saturation rate of leak will thus increase at <U+FB01>rst with the
distance, and then tend to a constant value when the radiation
is completely absorbed between the plates.
    The results given in the previous table allow us to deter
mine the absorption coetlicient of air at various pressures.
My attention was <U+FB01>rst drawn to the rapid absorption of the
radiation by experiments of this kind.

in    10.
    ITor the pressure p the saturation rate of leak between the
plates is thus proportional to 1—e_P"°“.                       .
    If p and d are varied so that p x d is a constant, the rate
 of leak should be a constant. This is approximately true as
 the numbers previously given (see <U+FB01>g. 8) show. It must,
however, be borne in mind that the conditions, on which the
 calculations are based, are only approximately ful<U+FB01>lled in
 practice, for we have assumed the uranium surface to be
 in<U+FB01>nite in extent and that the saturation is complete.
    The variation of the rate of leak with distance agrees fairl
 closely with the theory. When {mod is small the rate of leak
 is nearly proportional to the distance between the plates and
 the pressure of the gas. \Vhen pMd is large the rate of leak
 varies very slowly with the distance.

   The value of pko can be deduced from the experi
mental results, so that we have here an independent method
of determining the absorption of the radiation at different
pressures.
   The lower the pressure the more uniform is the ionization
between the plates, so that the saturation rate of leak at low
pressures is nearly proportional to the distance between the
plates. This is seen to be the case in <U+FB01>g. 8, where the curve
for a pressure of 187 mm. is approximately a straight line.
Similar results have been obtained for hydrogen and carbonic
acid.

   Air that has been blown by the surface of a uranium com
pound has the power of discharging both positive and negative
electri<U+FB01>cation. The following arrangement was used to <U+FB01>nd
the duration of the after-conductivity induced by uranium
radiation :—A sheet of thick paper was covered over with a
thin layer of gum-arabic, and then uranium oxide or uranium
potassium sulphate in the form of <U+FB01>ne powder was sprinkled
over it. After this had dried the sheet of paper was formed
into a cylinder with the uranium layer inside. This was then
placed in a metal tube T (<U+FB01>g. 9) of 4 cm. diameter.          A

blast of air from a gasometer, after passing through a plug C
of cotton-wool to remove dust, passed through the cylinder T
and then down a long metal tube connected to earth.
   Insulated electrodes A and B were <U+FB01>xed in the metal tube.
The electrometer could be connected to either of the elec
trodes A or B. In practice the quadrants of the electro
meter were <U+FB01>rst connected together. The electrode A or B
and the electrometer were then charged up to a potential of
30 volts, and the quadrants then separated.
   When the uranium was removed there was no rate of leak
at either A or B when a rapid current of air was sent through
the tube. On replacing the uranium cylinder and sending a
current of air along the tube, the electrometer showed a

              the Electrical Conduction produced by it.       143
gradual loss of charge which continued until the electrode
was discharged.
   When the electrode A was charged to 30 volts there was
no rate of leak of B. The rate of leak of B or A is thus
proportional to total number of ions in the gas. The ions
recombine in the interval taken for the air to pass between
A and B. The rate of leak of B for a saturating voltage,
when A is to earth, is thus less than that of A.
    For a particular experiment the rate of leak of the electrode
A was 146 divisions per minute. When A was connected to
 earth, the saturation rate of leak of B was 100 divisions per
minute. The distance between A and B was 44 cm., and the
mean velocity of the current of air along the tube 70 cm. per
 second. In the time, therefore, of '63 see. the conductivity
 of the gas has fallen to '68- of its value.
    If we assume, as in the case of R'ontgenized air *, that the
loss of conductivity is due to the recombination of the ions,
the variation of the number with the time is given by
                                __ = __ an2 ,
                                dt
 where n is the number of ions per 0.0. and aa constant. If
 N is the number of ions at the electrode A, the number of
 ions n at B after an interval t is given by

                               n    N
    Now the saturating rates of leak at A and B are propor
 tional to N and n, and it can readily be deduced that the
 time taken for the number of ions to recombine to half their
 number is equal to 1'3 sec. This is a much slower rate of
 recombination than with antgenized air near an ordinary
 Crookes tube.
     The amount of ionization by the uranium radiation is in
 general much smaller than that due to R<U+FB01>ntgen rays, so that
 the time taken for the ions to fall to half their number is
 lon er.
     'lghe phenomenon of recombination of the ions is very similar
 in both uranium and Rontgen conduction. In order to test
  whether the rate of recombination of the ions is proportional
  to the square of the number present in the gas, the following
  experiment was performed :—

A passed through a plug of cotton-wool, E, in order to remove
dust from the air and to make the current of air more
uniform over the cross-section of the tube. The air assed
by the uranium surface and then through a gauze E into
the testing cylinder B of 2'8 cm. diameter. An insulated
rod 0, 1'6 cm. in diameter, passed centrally through the
 cylinder B and was connected with the electrometer. The
cylinders A and B were connected to one pole of a battery of
32 volts, the other pole of which was to earth.
   The potential-ditierence of 32 volts between B and C was
suf<U+FB01>cient to almost completely remove all the ions from the

 In the third column are given the observed rates of leak, and

 The two numbers with the asterisk were used to determine
 the constants of the equation. The agreement of the other
 numbers is closer than would be expected, for in practice the
 velocity of the blast is not constant over the cross-section,
 and there is also a slight loss of conductivity of the gas due
 to the diffusion of the ions to the side of the long tube.
    It will be observed that the rate of recombination is very
 slow when a small number of ions are present in the gas, and
 that the air preserves one quarter of its conducting power
after an interval of 8 seconds.

    The method* adopted to determine the velocity of the
ions in Rontgen conduction cannot be employed for uranium
conduction. It is not practicable to measure the rate of re
combination of the ions between the plates on account of the
very small after-conductivity in such a case ; and, moreover,

disturbs the electric <U+FB01>eld between the plates.

types of conduction are the same.
    In order to compare the velocities an apparatus similar to
<U+FB01>g. 10 was used. The ions were blown by a charged wire A,
and the conductivity of the gas tested immediately afterwards
at an electrode B, which was <U+FB01>xed close to A. The electrode
A was cylindrical and <U+FB01>xed centrally in the metal tube L,
which was connected to earth. For convenience of calcula
tion it is assumed that the electric <U+FB01>eld between the cylinders
is the same as if the cylinders were in<U+FB01>nitely long.
    Let a, b be the radii of the electrode A and the tube L
          (internal) ;
    Let V be the potential of A (supposed positive).
    The electromotive intensity X (without regard to sign) at

     In the above equations it is assumed that the current of
air is uniform over the cross-section of the tube, and that the
ions are uniformly distributed over the cross-section; also,
that the movement of the ions does not appreciably disturb
the electric <U+FB01>eld. Since the value of t can be calculated from
the velocity of the current of air and the length of the elec
trode, the values of the velocities of the ions under unit
potential gradient can at once be determined.
     The equation (1) shows that p; is proportional to V,—
2'. e. that the rate of leak of the electrode A varies directly as
the potential of A, provided the value of V is not large
enough to remove all the ions from the gas as it passes
by the electrode. This was experimentally found to be the
case.
     In the comparison of the velocities the potential V was
adjusted to such a value that p2 was about one half. This was
determined by testing the rate of leak at B with a saturating
electromotive force. The amount of recombination of the
ions between the electrodes A and B was very small, and
could be neglected.
     The uranium cylinder was then removed, all the other
parts of the apparatus remaining unchanged. An aluminium
cylinder was substituted for the uranium cylinder, and m-rays
were allowed to fall on the aluminium. The bulb and
induction-coil were placed in a metal box in order to care
fully screen off all electrostatic disturbances. The rays were
only allowed to fall on the central portion of the cylinder.
The intensity of the rays was adjusted so that, with the same
current of air, the rate of leak was comparable with that
produced by the uranium. It was then found that the value
of p, was nearly the same as for the uranium conduction.
For example, the rate of leak of B was reduced from 38 to
14 scale-divisions per min. by charging A to a certain small
potential, when the air was blown by the surface of the
uranium. When Rontgenized air was substituted, the rate of
leak was reduced from 50 to 18 divisions per min. under the
same conditions. The values of pa were '63 and '64 respec
tively. This agreement is closer than would be expected,
as the bulb was not a very steIady source of radiation.

148     Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
    This result shows that the ions in Rontgen and uranium
conduction move with the same velocity and are probably
identical.   The velocity of an ion in passing through a gas
is proportional to 7%, where e is the charge carried by the ion,
and m its mass. Unless e and m vary in the same ratio it
 follows that the charge carried by the ion in uranium and
 Rontgen conduction is the same, and also that their masses
are equal.
    It was found that the velocit of the negative ion was
 somewhat greater than that of t e positive ion. This has
been shown to be the case for ions produced by Rontgen
rays *. The difference of velocity between the positive and
negative carrier is readily shown. The rate of leak of B is
observed when charged positively and negativel . When B
 was charged positively the rate of leak measure the number
 of negative ions that escaped the electrode A, and when
 charged negatively the number of positive ions.       The rate of
leak was always found to be slightly greater when B was
charged negatively.       This is true whether A is charged
 positively or negatively, and shows that there is an excess of
 positive ions in the gas after passing by the electrode A.
    The difference of velocities of the ions can also readily
 be shown by applying an alternating electromotive force to
the electrode A suf<U+FB01>cient to remove a large proportion of the
ions as the air passes by. The issuing gas is always found
to be positively charged, showing that there is an excess of
positive over negative ions.
    A large number of determinations of the velocities of the
 uranium ions have been made, with steady and alternating
 electromotive forces, when the air passed between concentric
 cylinders or plane rectangular plates.      In consequence of the
 inequality of the velocity of the current of air over the
 cross-section of the tube, and other disturbing factors which
 could not be allowed for, the determination could not be
 made with the accuracy that was desired. For an accurate
 determination, a method independent of currents of air is
very desirable.
          § 15. Potential Gradient between two Plates.
    The normal potential gradient between two plates is altered
 by the movement of the ions in the electric <U+FB01>eld.
   Two methods were used to determine the potential gradient.
                    * Zeleny, Phil. Mag. July 1898.

             the Electrical Conduction produced by it.                149
In the <U+FB01>rst method a thin wire or strip was placed between
two parallel plates one of which was covered with uranium.
The wire was connected with the electrometer, and after being
left some time took up the potential in the air close to the
wire. In the second method the ordinary mercury- or
water-dropper was employed to measure the potential at a
P oint.
    For the <U+FB01>rst method two large zinc plates were taken
and placed horizontal and parallel to one another. A layer
of uranium oxide was spread over the lower plate. The
bottom plate was connected to one pole of a battery of 8 volts,
and the top plate was connected to earth.             An insulated thin
zinc strip was placed between the plates and parallel to
them. The strip was connected with the electrometer, and
gradually took up the potential of the point.                   By moving
the strip the potential at different points between the plates
could be determined.
    The following table is an example of the results obtained.

the uranium the potential falls OE uniformly between the
Plates.
   The method given above is not very satisfactory when the
strip is close to the plates, as it takes up the potential of the
point very slowly.
   The water- or mercury-dropper was more rapid in its
action, and gave results very similar to those obtained by the
<U+FB01>rst method. Two parallel brass plates were placed vertically
and insulated.       One plate was connected to the positive and

  150     Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
  the other to the negative pole of a battery. The middle
  point of the battery was placed to earth. The water-dropper
  was connected with the electrometer. The potential at a point
  was <U+FB01>rst determined without an uranium near. One plate
  was then removed, and an exact y similar plate, covered with
  the uranium compound, substituted. The potential of the
  point was then observed again. In this way the potential at
  any point with and without the uranium could be determined.
  The curve shown in <U+FB01>g. 11 is an example of the potential
  gradient observed between two parallel plates 6'6 cm. apart.
  The dotted line represents the potential gradient when the
  uranium is removed. The ordinates represent volts and the
  abscissa distances from the plate covered with the uranium
' compound.

     It will be observed that the potential gradient is diminished
  near the uranium and increased near the other plate. The
  point of zero potential is displaced away from the uranium.
     From curves showing the potential gradient between two
  plates, the distribution of free electri<U+FB01>cation between the plates
  can be deduced. By taking the <U+FB01>rst differential of the curve
  we obtain do the electric force at any point, and by taking
                                                                       2

equal to —-41rp, where p is the volume-density of electri<U+FB01>ca
tion at any point. In order to produce the disturbance of
the electric <U+FB01>eld shown in <U+FB01>g. 11, there must be an excess
of ions of one kind distributed between the plates.        Such a
result follows at once from what has been said in regard to
the inequality of the ionization between the plates due to the
absorption of the radiation.
   It was found that the potential gradient approached more
and more its undisturbed value with increase of the electro
motive force between the plates. The displacement of the
point of zero-potential from the uranium surface increased
with diminution of electromotive force. For example, for
two plates 51 mm. apart, charged to equal and opposite
potentials, the points of zero potential were 28, 30, 33 mm.
from the uranium when the differences of potential between
the plates were 16, 8, and 4 volts respectively.
   When the uranium was charged positively, the point of
zero potential was more displaced than when it was charged
negatively. This is due to the slower velocity of the positive
ion.
   The slope of potential very close to the surface of the
uranium has not been investigated. The deviation from the
normal potential slope between the plates depends very
largely on the intensity of the ionization produced in the gas.
With very weak ionization the normal potential gradient is
only slightly affected.
   Child * and Zeleny 1' have shown that the potential gradient
between two parallel plates exposed to Rontgen rays is not
uniform. In their cases the ionization was uniform between
the plates, and the disturbance in the <U+FB01>eld manifested itself in
a sudden drop at both electrodes.         in the case considered
for uranium radiation, the ionization is too small for this
effect to be appreciable.       The disturbance of the <U+FB01>eld is due
chie<U+FB02>y to the inequality of the ionization, and does not only
take place at the electrodes.
   § 16. Relation between Current and Electromotz've Force.
   The variation with electromotive force of the current
through a gas exposed to uranium radiation has been investi
gated by Becquerel I, and later by de Smolan and Beattie§.

152     Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
The veneral relation between the current through the gas and
the .M.F. acting on it is very similar to that obtained for
gases exposed to Rontgen radiation. The current at <U+FB01>rst
increases nearly proportionally with the E.M.F. (provided
the E.M.F.’s of contact between the metals are taken into
account), then more slowly, till <U+FB01>nally a stage is reached,
which may he termed the “ saturation stage,” where there is
only a very slight increase of current with a very large
increase of electromotive force. As far as experiments have
gone, uranium oxide, when immersed in gases which do not
attack it, gives out a constant radiation at a de<U+FB01>nite tempera
ture, and the variation of the intensity of radiation with the
temperature over the ordinary atmospheric range is inap
preciahlc. For this reason it is possible to do more accurate
work with uranium radiation than with Rontgen radiation,
for it is almost impossible to get a really steady source of
w-rays for any length of time.
   It was the object of these experiments to determine the
relation between current and electromotive force with accuracy,
and to see whether the gas really becomes saturated; 2'. e.,
whether the current appreciably increases with electromotive
forces when the electromotive forces are great, but still not
su<U+FB02>icient to break down the gas and to produce conduction
in the gas without the uranium radiation.
   A null method was devised to measure the current, in order
to be independent of the electrometer as a measuring instru
ment and to merely use it as an indicator of di<U+FB02>'erence of
potential.
                            Fig. 12.
   Fig. 12 shows the general arrangement of the experiment.
A and B were two insulated parallel zinc plates : on the lower

           the Electrical Coiuluction produced by it.       153
plate A was spread a uniform layer of uranium oxide. The
bottom plate was connected to one pole of a battery of a large
number of storage-cells, the other pole of which was to earth.
The insulated plate B was connected to one pair of quadrants
of an electrometer, the other pair of which was to earth.
Under the in<U+FB02>uence of the uranium the air between the plates
A and B is made a partial conductor, and the potential of B
tends to become equal to that of A.        In order to keep the
potential of B at zero, B is connected through a very high
resistance T of xylol, one end of which is kept at a steady
potential. If the amount of electricity supplied to B through
the xylol by the battery is equal and opposite in sign to t e
quantity passing between A and B, the potential of B will
remain steadily at zero. In order to adjust the potential to
be applied to one end of the xylol-tube T, a battery was
connected through resistance-boxes R1 R2, the wire between
being connected to earth.     The ratio of the          e acting
on T to the E.M.F. E of the battery is given by
In practice R1+R2 was always kept constant and equal to
10,000 ohms, and, in adjusting the resistance, plugs taken
from one box were transferred to the other. The value of e
is thus proportional to R1, and the amount of current supplied
to B (assuming xylol obeys Ohm’s Law) is proportional to R1.
If the resistances are varied till the electrometer remains at
 the “earth zero,” the current between the. plates is pro
portional to R1. If the value of the              applied is too
 great the needle moves in one direction, if too small in the
opposite direction. For fairly rapid leaks the current could
 be determined to an accuracy of l per cent.; but for slow
electromotive leaks this accuracy is not possible on account
 of slow changes of the electrometer zero when the quadrants
 are disconnected.
    The following tables show the results of an experiment with
uranium oxide. The surface of the uranium was 14 cm.
square. In order to get rid of stray radiation at the sides
lead strips, which nearly reached to the top plate, were placed
round the uranium. 16 volts were applied to the resistance
box, and a resistance of 10,000 ohms kept steadily in the
 circuit.

   Under the column of volts the difference of potential
between A and B is given. The current is given in terms of
the resistance R1 required to keep the electrometer at the
earth zero. It will be observed that for the <U+FB01>rst few readings
Ohm’s Law is approximately obeyed, and then the current
increases more gradually till for large E.M.F.’s the rate of
increase is very slow.         For the plates '5 cm. apart the
rate of leak for 335 volts is only 50 per cent. greater than
the rate of leak for 1 volt.
   The same general results are obtained if the surface of the
uranium is bare or covered with thin metal. The disadvantages
of covering the surface with thin tin or aluminium foil are (1)
that the intensity of the radiation is considerably decreased ;
(2) that the ions diffuse from under the tinfoil through any
small holes or any slight openings in the side. The drawback
of using the uncovered uranium in the form of <U+FB01>ne powder,
is that under large electric forces the <U+FB01>ne uranium articles
are set in motion between the plates and cause an a ditional
leakage.     In practice the rate of leak was measured with
potential-differences too small to produce any appreciable
action of this kind.
   In order to investigate the current-electromotive-force
relations for different gases the same method was used, but
the leakage in this case took place between two concentric
cylinders. The apparatus is shown in the lower part of
<U+FB01>g. 12 : C and D were two concentric cylinders of brass 4'5
and 3'75 cm. in diameter, insulated from each other.

The ends of the cylinder D were closed by ebonite collars,
and the central cylinder was sup orted in position by brass
rods passing through the ebonite. he surface C was uniformly
covered with uranium oxide. The cylinder D was connected
to one pole of a battery, the other pole of which was to earth.
The cylinder C was connected to the electrometer. The

   The above results are expressed graphically in <U+FB01>g. 13,
where the ordinates represent current on an’arbitrary scale
 and the abscissae volts. In the tables iven for hydrogen and
 carbonic acid it will be observed tint the current has a
 de<U+FB01>nite value when there is no external electromotive force
 acting.     The reason for this is probably due to the contact
 difference of potential between the uranium surface and the
interior brass surface of the outside cylinder.               When the
 external cylinder was connected to earth the inside cylinder
 became charged’“ to —'12 volt after it was left a short time.
   * This      henomenon has been studied by Lord Kelvin, Beattie, and
S. de Smoian, and it has been shown that metals are charged up to small
potentials under the in<U+FB02>uence of uranium radiation.          The steady
di<U+FB02>erence of potential between two metal latss between which the
radiation falls is the same as the contact i<U+FB01>'erence of potential. An

        Results of this kind are shown more clearly in <U+FB01>g. 14, which
        gives the current-electromotive-force curves for hydrogen
        and carbonic acid for small voltages. When there is no
        external electromotive force acting, the current has a <U+FB01>xed
        value; if the uranium is charged positively, the current
        increases slowly with the voltage; when the uranium is
         charged negatively, the current is at <U+FB01>rst reversed, becomes
         zero, and rapidly increases with the voltage until for about
         1 volt between the plates the positive and negative currents
         are nearly equal.    The curve for carbonic acid with a positive
         charge on the uranium is also shown.           It will be seen that
         the initial slope of the curve is greater for carbonic acid than
         for hydrogen.
            It is remarkable that the current with zero E.M.F. for
        hydrogen is about two-thirds of its value when 216 volts are
        acting between the plates. The ions in hydrogen diffuse more
         rapidly than in air, and in consequence a large proportion

   If the radiation fell between two plates of exactly the same
metal, the inequality between the positive and negative
current values for low voltages would almost disappear, but
even in that case there would still be an apparent current
through the gas, due to the fact that the negative carriers
diffuse with greater rapidity than the positive. E<U+FB01>'ects of
this kind have been studied for Bontgen radiation by Zeleny *.
   For large E.lll.F.’s no appreciable difference in the value
of the current could be detected whether the uranium was
positively or negatively charged, 1'. e. positive and negative
electri<U+FB01>cations are discharged with equal facility.
   For the different gases the current tends more rapidly to a
saturation value in hydrogen than in air, and more rapidly in
air than in carbonic acid.             In all these cases there is still a
slight increase of current with increase of E.M.F. long after
the “ knee ” of the saturation curve has been passed, and in
no case has complete saturation been observed at atmospheric
pressure, even for a potential gradient of 1300 volts per cm.
   The explanation of the general form of the curves showing
the relation between current and electromotive force for
ionized gases has been given in a previous paper-I: In the

 158     Prof. E. Rutherford on Uranium Radiation and
 case of uranium conduction the phenomenon is still further
 complicated by the want of uniformity of ionization between
 the plates and the resulting disturbance of the electrostatic
 <U+FB01>eld due to the excess of ions of one kind between the
 plates.
    The ionization of the gas is greatest near the uranium sur
 face, and falls off rapidly with the distance. The rate of
 recombination of the ions thus varies from point to point
 between the plates, being greatest near the surface of the
uranium.
    The equations which express completely the relation between
 the current and electromotive force for the rate of leak between
two parallel plates, one of which is covered with uranium, are
 very complex and cannot be expressed in simple form. The
disturbance of the electrostatic <U+FB01>eld between the plates, due to
the movement of the ions, has to be considered as well as
the variable rates of recombination at the different points, and
the difference of velocity between the positive and negative
Ions.
    The great dif<U+FB01>culty in producing complete saturation, i. e. to
 reachastage when all the ions     roduced reach the electrodes,
 may be due to one or more of t ree causes:—
    (1) Rapid rate of recombination of the ions very near the
surface of the uranium.
    (2) Presence of very slow moving ions together with the
more rapidly moving carriers.
    (3) An effect of the electric <U+FB01>eld on the production of
the ions.
   The effect of (3) is probably very small, for there is no
experimental evidence of any such action unless the electro
motive forces are very high. That the slow increase of the
current in strong <U+FB01>elds is due to (1) rather than (2) receives
some support from an experiment that has been recently
tried. Instead of measuring the current with the uranium
covering one electrode, the air which had passed over uranium
was forced between two concentric cylinders between which
the electromotive force was acting. The rate of leak was
found to only increase 2 or 3 per cent. when the              was
increased from 16 to 320 volts. This increase is much smaller
than in the results previously given. Since the effect of (2)
would be present in both cases, this experiment seems to show
that the difficulty in removing all the ions from the gas is not
due to the presence of some very slow-moving carriers.

           the Electrical Conduction produced by it.      159
                       Eject of Pressure.
   Some current electromotive-force curves for small voltages
have been obtained at different pressures. Examples of the
results are shown in <U+FB01>g. 15, which gives the relation between
the current and the electromotive force at pressures of 760,
380, 190, and 95 mm. of mercury.
   These results were obtained with a different apparatus and
by a different method to that given in <U+FB01>g. 12. Two parallel
insulated metal plates, about 3 cm. apart, one of which was
covered with uranium oxide, were placed inside an air-tight
vessel. One plate was connected to earth and the other to
the electrometer. The plate connected to the electrometer
was then charged up to a potential of 10 volts. On account
of the presence of the uranium oxide the charge slowly leaked
away, and the rate of movement of the electrometer-needle
measured the current corresponding to different values of the
electromotive force.
                             Fig. 15.

                           VOLT   .
  _The method did not admit of the accuracy of that pre
 V1ously employed (see <U+FB01>g. 12). The rate of leak for small
fractlons of a volt could not be determined, so that in the
 curves <U+FB01>g. 15 it is assumed that the current was zero when
the electromotive force was zero. This is probably not quite

   160    Prof. E. Rutherford 0n Uranium Radiation and
  accurate owing to the slight contact-difference of potential
   between the plates, so that there was a small initial current
  for zero external electromotive force.
     The general results show that the gas tends to become more
  readily saturated with diminution of pressure. The variation
  of the current with the E.M.F. depends on two factors—the
  velocities of the ions, and their rate of recombination.       Some
   experiments on the velocity of the carriers* in ultra-violet
  light conduction showed that the velocity of the ions in a
  given electric <U+FB01>eld is inversely proportional to the pressure.
  This is probably also true for the ions in Rontgen conduction;
  so that under the pressure of 95 mm. the ions would move
  eight times as fast as at atmospheric pressure. The variation
  of the rate of recombination with pressure has not yet been
  determined.
     The curve for hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is also
  given in <U+FB01>g. 15, and shows that hydrogen is about as easily
  saturated as air at 190 mm. pressure.
         § 17. Separation of the Positive and Negative Ions.
     It is a simple matter to partially separate the positive and
  negative ions in uranium conductions and produce an
  electri<U+FB01>ed gas. The subject of the production of electri<U+FB01>
  cation hy passing a current of air over the surface of uranium
  enclosed in a metal vessel has been examined by Beattie T,
  who found the electri<U+FB01>cation obtained was of the same sign
  as the charge on the uranium.          His results admit of a simple
  explanation on the theory of ionization. The gas near the
  surface of the uranium is far more strongly ionized than that
  some distance away on account of the rapid absorption of the
  radiation by the air.      For convenience of explanation, let us
  suppose a piece of uranium, charged positively, placed inside
  a metal vessel connected to earth, and a current of air passed
  through the vessel. Under the in<U+FB02>uence of the electromotive
  force the negative ions travel in towards the uranium, and the
  positive ions towards the outer vessel. Since the ionization
  is greater near the surface of the uranium, there will be an
. excess of positive ions in the air some distance away from
  the uranium. Part of this is blown out by the current of air,
  and gives up its charge to a <U+FB01>lter of cotton-wool.        The total
  number of negative ions blown out in the same time          is much
  less, as the electromotive intensity, and therefore the     velocity
  of the carrier, is greater near the uranium than near       the out
  side cylinder. Oonsequently there is an excess of           positive

           the Electrical Conduction produced by it.           161
ions blown out, and a positively electri<U+FB01>ed gas is obtained.
As the potential—difference between the electrodes is increased,
the amount of electri<U+FB01>cation obtained depends on two opposing
actions. The velocity of the carriers is increased, and conse
quently the ratio of the number of carriers removed is dimi
nished.   But if the gas is not saturated, with increase of
electromotive force the number of ions travelling between the
electrodes is increased, and for small voltages this increase
more than counterbalances the diminution due to increase of
velocity. The amount of electri<U+FB01>cation obtained will there
fore increase at <U+FB01>rst with increase of voltage, reach a maxi
mum, and then diminish; for when the gas is saturated no
more ions can be supplied with increase of electromotive
force. This is exactly the result which Beattie obtained, and
which I also obtained in the case of the separation of the ions
of Riintgenized air. The fact that more positive than nega
tive electri<U+FB01>cation is obtained is due to the greater velocity
with which the negative ion travels. (See § 14.)
   The properties of this electri<U+FB01>ed gas are similar to that which
has been found from R<U+FB01>ntgen conduction. The opposite sign
of the electri<U+FB01>cation obtained by Beattie for uranium in
duction, and by myself for Rdntgen conduction *, is to be
expected on account of the different methods employed. For
obtaining electri<U+FB01>cation from Riintgenized air a rapid current
of air was directed close to the charged wire. In that case
the sign of the electri<U+FB01>cation obtained is opposite to that of
the wire, as it is the carriers of opposite sign to the wire which
are blown out before they reach the wire. In the case of
uranium the current of air <U+FB01>lled the cross-section of the space
between the electrodes ; and it has been shown that under such
conditions electri<U+FB01>cation of the same sign as the uranium is to
be expected.
            § 18. Discharging-power of Fine Gauzes.
   Air blown over the surface of uranium loses all trace of con—
ductivity after being forced through cotton-wool or through
any <U+FB01>nely divided substance. In this respect it is quite
similar to Riintgenized air. The discharging-power of cotton
wool and <U+FB01>ne gauzes is at <U+FB01>rst sight surprising, for there is
considerable evidence that the ions themselves are of molecular
dimensions, and might therefore be expected to pass through
small ori<U+FB01>ces; but a little consideration shows that the ions,
like the molecules, are continually in rapid motion, and, in
addition, have free charges, so that whenever they approach
within a certain distance of a solid body they tend to be
attracted towards it, and give up their charge or adhere to

the surface. On account of the rapidity of diffusion * of the
ions, the discharging-power of a metal gauze, with openings
very<U+FB02>large compared with the diameter of a carrier, may be
considerable. The table below gives some results obtained for
the discharging-power of <U+FB01>ne copper gauze. The copper
gauze had two strands per millim., and the area occupied by
the metal was roughly equal to the area of the openings. The
gauzcs <U+FB01>lled the cross-section of the tube at A (<U+FB01>g. 9), and
were tightly pressed together. The conductivity of the air
was tested after its passage through the gauzes, the velocity
of , the air along the tube being kept approximately constant.
The rates of leak per minute due to the air after its passage
through different numbers of gauzes is given below.

    After passing through 5 gauzes the conductivity of the air
has fallen to less than 1} of its original value.                    Experiments
were tried with gauzes of different degrees of coarseness with
the same general result. The discharging-power varies with
the coarseness of the gauze, and appears to depend more on
the ratio of the area of metal to the area of the openings than
on the actual size of the opening. If acopper gauze has such
a power of removing the carriers from the gas, we can readily
see why a. small plug of cotton-wool should completely abstract
the ions from the gas passing through it. The rapid loss of
conductivity is thus due to the smallness of the carrier and
 the consequent rapidity of diffusion.
                        § 19. General Remarks.
    The cause and origin of the radiation continuously emitted
by uranium and its salts still remain a mystery. All the
results that have been obtained point to the conclusion that
uranium gives out types of radiation which, as regards their
e<U+FB01>'ect on gases, are similar to Rontgen rays and the secondary
radiation emitted by metals when Rontgen rays f'all upon
them. If there is no polarization or refraction the similarity

is complete. J. J. Thomson * has suggested that the re
 grouping of the constituents of the atom may give rise to
 electrical effects such as are produced in the ionization of a
 gas.     Rontgen’sT and Wiedemann’sI results seem to show
 that in the process of ionization a radiation is emitted which
 has similar properties to easily absorbed Biintgen radiation.
 The energy spent in producing uranium radiation is probably
 extremely small, so that the radiation could continue for long
 intervals of time without much diminution of internal energy
 of the uranium. The effect of the temperature of the uranium
 on the amount of radiation given out has been tried. An
 arrangement similar to that described in § 11 was employed.
 The radiation was completely absorbed in the gas. The
 vessel was heated up to about 200° 0.; but not much differ»
 ence in the rate of discharge was observed.                 The results of
 such experiments are very di<U+FB01>icult to interpret, as the variation
 of ionization with temperature is not known.
     1 have been unable to observe the presence of any secondary
 radiation produced when uranium radiation falls on a metal.
 Such a radiation is probably produced, but its effects are too
 small for measurement.
     In conclusion, I desire to express my best thanks to
 Prof. J. J. Thomson for his kindly interest and encouragement
 during the course of this investigation.

     HAT this \Hllk is a thorough one on its subject is a matter of
       course, but it is more than this, it is a most interesting one. As
Dr. Routh remarks in the opening words of his preface, “ so many
questions which necessarily excite our interest and curiosity are
discussed in the dynamics of a particle that this subject has always
been a favourite one with students.”          He puts the question, how
is it that by observing the motion of a pendulum we can tell the
time of rotation of the earth, or, knowing this, can deduce the
latitude of the place ? Other such problems excite our curiosity
at the very beginning of the subject. When We study the replies
to those problems we <U+FB01>nd new objects of interest, and so we
mount higher and higher until we include the planetary per
turbations, and take account of the <U+FB01>nite size of bodies. So far
does Dr. Routh carry us until he approximates quite closely to
his familiar Rigid Dynamics. One has hitherto associated his
work and name primarily with this latter subject, but as for
some forty years the whole mathematical curriculum must have
occupied his thoughts, he must have many potential books in his

    I may be allowed to add that the method in the form used by
me, involving the use of prismatic slabs transversely magnetized,
does not admit of application to Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt, since in
this case the induced magnetization would depend almost altogether
upon the shape of the substance and but slightly upon its
susceptibility; In Lord Kelvin’s note upon this subject the
restriction that the method may be applied to these bodies only
which are diamagnetic or slightly magnetic is implied in the title.

XI. Radiation Phenomena in the Magnetic Field.—lt[agrwtic
   Perturbations of the Spectral Lines. By THOMAS PRESTON,
    M.A., 17.80., F.R.S.*
IN the April number of this Magazine‘l' I described a
       series of observations on “Radiation Phenomena in a
strong Magnetic Field.”           Brie<U+FB02>y stated, the results obtained
showed that while the majority of spectral lines became
triplets when the source of light was placed in the magnetic
<U+FB01>eld and viewed across the lines of force, yet this did not
hold good of all lines, for some were observed to be resolved
into quartets, or sextets, or other forms by the magnetic
<U+FB01>eld under precisely the same circumstances.
    I pointed out at that time that these quartets &0.
might be regarded as modi<U+FB01>ed forms of the normal or
standard triplet form, and might possibly be derived from it
by reversal.      Thus, if each line of a triplet be reversed (that
is, if an absorption-band occurs along its middle), then we
have six lines instead of three, and so on for the other forms.
I also pointed out, however, that the general appearance of
these modi<U+FB01>ed forms did not by any means favour that
explanation, for they possessed none of the ordinary cha
racteristics of reversals.       Nevertheless, this explanation could

166           Dr. T. Preston on Radiation Phenomena
not be ignored till it had been proved by experiment that the
modi<U+FB01>cations were actually caused by other agencies, and
this I endeavoured to do by two lines of attack.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, if these phenomena are due to reversal, it
is likely that they will cease to exist when the quantity of
vapour in the source of light is greatly reduced. I accord
ingly tried sparking with weak solutions of salts instead of
with metallic electrodes, but in no case did the quartets, or
other modi<U+FB01>cations, reduce to the triplet form, but on the
contrary they became clearer and more precise as the lines
became sharper with the reduced quantity of vapour. Never
theless this was not regarded as conclusive or even seriously
in opposition to the supposition of' reversal, for the appearance
of reversed lines in the strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld when the spark
is blown about might differ from that of an ordinary reversal.
    I accordingly endeavoured to gradually increase the strength
of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld and observe if the components of the
supposed reversed line remained at the same distance apart
or became more widely separated as the strength of the <U+FB01>eld
increased. The extent to which I was able to increase the
<U+FB01>eld at that time was not, however, suf<U+FB01>cient to enable me to
determine with suf<U+FB01>cient certainty whether the reversal
hypothesis was tenable or not.             For although the com
ponents of the supposed reversed line appeared to separate
under the increased <U+FB01>eld, yet this separation was not su<U+FB02>'i
ciently great to overthrow the reversal hypothesis, for it
 might be said that the absorbed band along the middle of the
line had merely become a little wider. The weight of
evidence, however, appeared to be against the reversal theory;
 and in order to further test this matter I had a powerful
 electromagnet specially built which it was hoped would
 furnish a <U+FB01>eld su<U+FB02>iciently strong to determine matters
 decisively, and in this respect it has not disappointed expect
ation. Thanks to the courtesy of the University Authorities
and of the Curator, Dr. W. E. Adeney *, I was able to resume
work at the Royal University with improved apparatus, and
it was soon found that the reversal theory must be abandoned
and that the explanation of the various deviations from the
normal triplet-types must be sought for in other agencies.
    Bet'ore describing these more recent results, it will render
 the explanation more intelligible if we refer for a moment to
<U+FB01>gs. 1, 2, 3, 4. In <U+FB01>g. 1 the three lines A, B, O are
   it I am deeply indebted to Dr. Adeney throughout this and the
  revious investigations, for he invited me to the Royal University
 Iaboratories and facilitated my work under conditions which necessarily
 interfered with his own researches.

  the standard type becomes resolved by the action of the
  magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and <U+FB01>g. 2 in the same way represents a

 a triplet in which the middle line A has become'a doublet.
 These lines are all plane-polarized, the vibrations in the side
 lines B and C being parallel to their length, while the
 vibrations in the central constituents A are in the per
 pendicular direction, when the light is viewed across the lines
 of force.
    Hence, if a double-image prism be placed before the slit of
the spectroscope in the path of the beam of light, the two
plane-polarized parts can be separated so that one part (say
A) forms one image on the slit, while the other part (B and
 C) forms another image on the slit. These two images, being
 separated, give rise to two spectra in the <U+FB01>eld of view of the
spectroscope which may be separated or may be caused to
partially overlap if so desired. As a consequence a triplet or
a quartet which appears in the <U+FB01>eld of view, as shown in
<U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2, without the double-image prism, becomes trans
formed by the double-image prism into <U+FB01>gs. 3 and 4.          Thus
the light vibrating parallel to the lines of force (A) is
separated from that vibrating in the perpendicular direction
(B and O), and this facilitates observation in the case of small
separations and‘in the case of overlapping lines. This sepa
ration of the two parts can of course be effected by a Nicol’s
prism, but the double-image prism has the advantage of
showing the two parts simultaneously.
   The question now before us is—can the quartet shown in
<U+FB01>gs. 2 and 4 be derived from the triplets <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 3 by
mere reversal of the central line A. In answer to this
question, it is to be remarked that it is not the central line
A alone which shows as a doublet, for in some cases the
                               N2

168          Dr. T. Preston on Radiation Phenomena
side lines B and C show as doublets and in others as triplets;
and again, in some quartets the distance between the central
pair A is almost as great as, and it may be greater than, the
distance between the side lines B and C. Further, as the
magnetic field increases in strength, the distance between the
members of the central pair A (fig. 4) increases at the same
rate as the distance between the side lines B and 0. Again,
when the side lines B and C are each resolved into doublets
 (or triplets) the separation of the constituent lines of each of
these doublets (or triplets) increases with the magnetic <U+FB01>eld
like the separation of the components of the normal triplet
 A B 0 shown in <U+FB01>g. 1; and in face of these facts the reversal
 theory becomes quite untenable.
    The general phenomenon, therefore, which remains to be ,
explained is the further resolution of each constituent of the
 normal triplet into a doublet or a triplet or some other system;
 and, as we shall see immediately, the electromagnetic theory
 proposed by Dr. Larmor* may be extended to embrace all
 the phenomena yet observed. Before proceeding to consider
 this explanation, however, it is necessary to refer to a
 particular case which was recently announced as having been
 observed by MM. Becqucrel and Deslandres 1’, and subse
 quently by Messrs. J. S. Ames, R. F. Earhart, and H. M.
 Reese 1, and which they refer to as an example of“ reversed
 polarization.” This phenomenon is represented to be as
 follows.
    Consider the triplet shown in <U+FB01>g. 1 ; then in the normal
 state of affairs the vibrations in A are parallel to the lines of
 force, while the vibrations in B and C are perpendicular to
 the lines of force. Now in the spectrum of iron the authors
 just named have recorded that they observed triplets in which
 the vibrations in the middle line were perpendicular to the lines
 of force, while the vibrations in the side lines were parallel to
 the lines of force—the reverse of the normal case. Stated in
 this way the phenomenon is very startling, and appears at
 <U+FB01>rst sight to be directly contradictory to all theoretical
 expectation. But if we return to <U+FB01>g. 4, it will be seen at
 once that this phenomenon, supposing it to exist, can be
  regarded merely as an extreme case of the quartet. For, as
 we have already said, the horizontally vibrating lines A of
 the quartet may be close together or widely separated. They
  may be even more widely separated than the vertically
 vibrating lines B and 0 (<U+FB01>g. 5), and in some particular cases

 B and C may be very close together, or coincide, while the
 centre pair A are separated by a considerable space, as shown
in <U+FB01>g. 6. In this extreme case we are furnished with a
 triplet in which the centre as it were encloses the sides.
 But this is no specially new form, being quite continuous
 with the other types of modi<U+FB01>cation.

    Once the doubling of the centre line (A, <U+FB01>gs. 2 or 4) is
explained, the other types follow in sequence as expected
variations, for the cause which converts A into a doublet
may be suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful to separate the constituents of A
more widely than B is separated from O, and the separation
of the constituents of A might be tolerably large, even
though the separation of B and O is quite insensible.
Thus, if the so-called reversed polarization is shown by any
lines, the explanation offers no dif<U+FB01>culty once we have ex
plained the quartet, but it is doubtful if the lines indicated in
the spectrum of iron by the French and American observers
just mentioned show this peculiarity. Iron was one of the
<U+FB01>rst substances which [ examined *, because I considered it
might present peculiarities, but I did not observe in it any
marked differences from the behaviour of other substances.
Several quartets and other slight modi<U+FB01>cations occur, but the
lines referred to by the French and American observers do
not, on my photographic plates, exhibit the exact peculiarity
attributed to them. The central part corresponding to A in
<U+FB01>g. 4 is a doublet without doubt, but the remainder (corre
sponding to the lines B and O, <U+FB01>g. 4) does not appear to be by
any means a single line, but looks rather like a triplet of which

this paper turned out on analysis to be quartets.

170          Dr. T. Preston on Radiation Phenomena
the side lines are broad and weak, while the centre is much
denser. It is just possible, and indeed probable, that these
modi<U+FB01>cations may be really quartets, of which the side lines
B and U are broad and weak, and overlap at their inner
edges, giving the appearance of a bright central line winged
with two weaker bands.
   The distance between the side lines B and O is about
the same as that between the com onents of A, and when the
double-image prism is not used, tlie lines in question photo
graph as triplets, i. e. as bands having three ribs or denser
parts running along them lengthwise. With a much stronger
<U+FB01>eld it could be determined whether the part BC in these
lines is really a triplet or an overlapping doublet; but as they
are all weak lines requiring long exposure (four hours in my
 case), it is not easy to arrange to have a very strong <U+FB01>eld for
 such a long time. However, it is a matter of very little
 importance at present, for if we can explain the quartet we
 are on the highway to the explanation of all the various
 modi<U+FB01>cations.
    For this purpose let us revert to Dr. Larrnor’s paper
 already cited. In this investigation he considers merely the
 simple case of a single ion describing an elliptic orbit under
 a central force directly proportional to the distance. This
 electric charge, when subject to the in<U+FB02>uence of the magnetic
 <U+FB01>eld, is so acted on that its elliptic orbit is forced into
 precession round the direction of the magnetic force, that is,
 as a <U+FB01>rst approximation. For the equations of motion of the
 ion moving round a centre of force in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld are,
 as a <U+FB01>rst approximation, the same as those which obtain for
 a particle describing an elliptic orbit under a central force
 when the orbit precesses or revolves round a line through its
 centre drawn in the direction of the lines of magnetic force.
 If N be the natural frequency of revolution of the particle in
 its orbit and n the frequency of revolution of the orbit in its
 precessional movement, the combined movement is equivalent
 to three coexisting motions of frequencies N +n, N, and
 N—n respectively. When n is small compared with N so
 that its square may be neglected, the equations of motion of
 the particle in the revolving orbit become identical with those
 of the moving ion in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
    This simple theory therefore predicts that a single spectral
 line should be converted into a triplet by the action of the
 magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and that the constituents of this triplet should
 be plane-polarized when viewed across the lines of force. It
 teaches us that the cause of the tripling is the forced precession
 of the ionic orbits round the lines of magnetic force, and it

                          in the Magnetic Field.                      171
   assigns a dynamical cause for this precession in the action of
   the magnetic <U+FB01>eld on the ionic charge moving through it.
       But up to this point the electromagnetic solution deals
   with a perturbation which is really not the full equivalent
   of a precessional movement of the orbit, and therefore the
   investigation given by Dr. Larmor applies, as he himself
   states, to a single simple case. For the equations of motion
   of a particle describing under a central force an elliptic orbit
   which precesses with angular velocity to round a line whose
   direction-cosines are (l, m, n) are
       a":—.Q2.z'+20(ny—m5)+w2w—w7l(l.z'+my+nz),                  .   (1)
   with two similar equations for and '2, whereas the equations
  of motion of the ionic charge moving under a central force in
  a magnetic <U+FB01>eld are, as given by Dr. Larinor,
                         55= —Q2x+k(ny'—mé),          .   .   .    .  (2)
   with two similar expressions for :1) and        The latter equation
   coincides with the former if we neglect m” and take 2w=k,
   that is, when the precessional motion is relatively small.
       The motion imposed on the ion by the electromagnetic
  theory is therefore merely a simple type of precessional pertur
  bation of the orbit, and, as other perturbations may occur,
  and indeed ought to be expected to occur, it is clear that the
  simple triplet is not the only form which we should expect to
   meet with when the matter is investigated experimentally.
   Thus, if the orbit besides having a precessional motion has in
  addition an apsidal motion, that is a motion of revolution in
   its own plane, then each member of the triplet arising from
  precession will be doubled, and we are presented with a
  sextet as in the case of the D2 line of sodium. Similarly, if
  the inclination of the plane of the orbit to the line round
  which precession takes place be subject to periodic variations,
  then each member of the precessional triplet will itself become
  a. triplet, and so on for other types of perturbation.
,     It is quite unnecessary to enter into these matters in any
  detail here, for the whole explanation was fully given and
  published in 1891 by Dr. G. J. Stoney *, that is, six years
  before the effects requiring explanation had been observed.
      Dr. $toney’s aim was to explain the occurrence of doublets
  and equidistant satellites in the spectra of gases, that is in
  the normal Spectra unaffected by the magnetic <U+FB01>eld—for at

resolves itself into three series of doublets like the D doublet
in sodium, and Dr. Stoney’s object was to explain the exist
ence of these pairs of lines.     For this purpose be considered
what the effect would be on the period of the radiations from
a moving electron if subject to disturbing forces. In the
 <U+FB01>rst place be determined that if the disturbing forces cause
 the orbit to revolve in its own plane, that is, cause an apsidal
 motion, then each spectral line will become a doublet. The
 frequencies of the new lines will be N+n and N—n, where N
 is the frequency of the original line and n the frequency of
 the apsidal revolution. This is very easily deduced by
 Dr. Stoncy from the expressions for the coordinates of the
 moving point at any time t. Thus if a particle describes an
 ellipse under a force directed towards its centre (law of direct
 distance), its coordinates at any instant are
                   x=a cos .Qt,          y :1: sith,
  in which Q is equal to 21rN, where N is the frequency of
  revolution. But if, in addition, the ellipse revolves around
  its centre in its own plane with an angular velocity on, it is
  easily seen by projection that the coordinates at any time
  are
                 .c=a cos .Qt cos wt— b sin .Qt sin wt,
                 y=a cos .Qt sin mt + 1) sin .Qt cos wt,
  and these are equivalent to
          w=.l_.(a + 6) cos (.Q+w)t +%(a-—b) cos (.Q—m)!,
          y = t (a + t) sin (Q + w)t— {<U+FB01>e—b) sin (.Q—‘w<U+FB02>,
  and these in turn are equivalent to the two opposite circular
   vibrations
    .c1=%(a +6) cos ((2 + w)t      x2: §(a—b) cos (.0 —-a>)t
    ‘y1=§(a+ b) sin (Q +w)t } y2= —§(a —b) sin (Q—m)t } '
   The resultant motion is consequently equivalent to two
   circular motions in opposite senses of frequencies N +12 and
   N—n.
      This is an analysis of the motion without any regard to the
   dynamical origin of it; but if we treat it from a dynamical
   point of view, the equations of motion will exhibit the forces
   which are necessary to bring about the supposed motion.
   Thus, if the orbit rotates with angular velocity to in its own

axes of reference, the equations of motion are

 and y components of a force 2am, where v is the velocity of
 the particle, acting in a direction perpendicular to v, that is
 along the normal to the path of the particle, and represent
 the forces which a charged ion would experience in moving
 through a magnetic <U+FB01>eld with the lines of force at right
 angles to the plane of the orbit, if 20.» be taken equal to k in
 Dr. Larmor’s equations             The other pair of terms, (0% and
  (023/, represent a centrifugal force arising from the imposed
  rotation m. If we neglect 0,2, the above equations become
  identical with those which hold in Larmor’s theory for the
 moving ion, as they obviously should, for an apsidal motion in
 the plane of the orbit is the same thing as a precession about a
  line perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, and in this case
  there will be no component in the direction of the axis round
  which precession takes place ; accordingly the middle line of
  the procession triplet will be absent, and we are furnished
  merely with a doublet.
       Now in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld the perturbing force, being the
   magnetic force, is <U+FB01>xed in direction, and on this account the
   doublets and triplets arising from perturbations caused by it
   are polarized. On the other hand, if the perturbing forces be
   not constant in direction, this polarization should cease to
   exist, and polarization should not be expected in the case of
   any lines of the normal spectrum, even though these happen
   to be derived from other lines by perturbations in the manner
   conceived by Dr. Stoney.
       In the same way the general case of precessional motion
   may be worked backwards in order to discover the types of
   force which produce the perturbation. Thus, taking the axes

show that the perturbing forces consist <U+FB01>rstly of a force
2mvsi110 ; where v is the velocity of the particle and 0 the
angle which its direction makes with the axis round which the
 precession 0: takes place. This force acts along the normal to
the plane of v and w (the direction of the velocity and the axis
of rotation), and is precisely the force experienced by an
 ion moving in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld in Larmor’s theory. The
 remaining terms containing as“? are the components of a
centrifugal force arising from the rotation round the axis
 (l, m, n), and this is negligible only when w is relatively
small.
    If the direction I, m, n be taken to be that of the lines of
magnetic force, and it' the axis of z be taken to coincide with
this direction, then the equations (4) simplify into

and these are the equations of motion of a particle describing
an elliptic orbit which precesses with angular velocity a: round
the axis of z. The two <U+FB01>rst of these equations contain a: and
y and give the projection of the orbit on the plane .v, y, at
right angles to the axis of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. This pro
jection is an ellipse revolving in its own plane with an apsidal
angular velocity w, and gives rise to the two side lines of the
normal triplet of frequencies (.0 in!) /2'1r. ()n the other hand,
the vibration parallel to the axis of z is unaffected by the
precessional motion and gives rise to the central line of the
triplet of frequency Q/21r.
    Now in order to account for the quartet (<U+FB01>g. 2) we must
introduce some action which will double the central line A
while the side lines B and C are left undisturbed. That is,
we must introduce a double period into the last of equations
 (5) while the <U+FB01>rst and second remain unchanged. This is
easily done if we write the equation for z in the form
                           z=Asith . . . . . . . . (6)

                      in the Magnetic Field.                    175
and remark that this will represent two superposed vibrations
of different periods, if we regard A as a periodic function of
the time instead of a constant. That is, if we take A to be
of the form a sin nt, we shall have
       z=a sin at sin Qt=%[cos (Q—n)t——cos (Q+n)t],
which represents two vibrations of equal amplitude and of
 frequencies (Q—n)/21r and (Q +n)/2'1r as required to roduce
 the quartet. The magnitude of n determines whet er the
 separation of the constituents of the central line A (<U+FB01>g. 2)
 shall be less than, or greater than, the separation of the side
 lines B and C, and if the former is sensible while the latter is
 insensible we are presented with the case depicted in <U+FB01>g. 6—
 although, as I have said before, my observations do not
 con<U+FB01>rm the existence of this case.
    The supposition made above to account for the doubling of
 the middle line, viz. that the amplitude of the 2' component of
 the vibration varies periodically, is one which appears to be
 justi<U+FB01>ed when we consider the nature of the moving system and
 the forces which control it. For the revolving ion is part of
 some more or less complex system which must set in some
 de<U+FB01>nite way under the action of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld—say with
 its axis along the direction of the magnetic force—and, in
 coming into this position, the inertia of the system will cause it
 to vibrate with small oscillations about that position of equi
 librium, and this vibration superposed on the precessional
 motion of the ionic orbit gives the motion postulated above
 to explain the quartet.
    This, indeed, comes to the same thing asa suggestion made
 by Professor G. F. FitzGerald about a year ago—shortly
 after I discovered the existence of the quartet form (Oct. 1897).
  In Professor FitzGrerald’s view, the ion revolving in its orbit is
  equivalent to an electric current round the orbit, and therefore
 the revolving ion and the matter with which it is associated
  behave as a little magnet having its axis perpendicular to the
  plane of the orbit. The action of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld will be to
  set the axis of this magnet along the lines of force, and in
  taking up this set the ionic orbit will vibrate about its position
  of equilibrium just as an ordinary magnet vibrates about its
  position of rest under the earth’s magnetic force.
     In a similar way a periodic change in the ellipticity of the
  orbit produces a doubling of the lines, while a periodic
  oscillation in the apsidal motion renders the line nebulous or
  diffuse; and by treating these cases in the foregoing manner
  the corresponding forces may be discovered. It is clear,

 176         Dr. T. Preston on Radiation Phenomena
 therefore, that perturbations of this kind are suf<U+FB01>cient to
account for all the observed phenomena, and, further, that
 perturbations of this kind are almost certain to be in
operation throughout some, at least, of the ionic motions.
    The existence of all these variations of' the normal triplet
type are therefore of great interest, not only in showing that
t o perfect uniformity required for the production of the
normal triplet is not maintained, as we should expect, in all
cases, but also as an experimental demonstration that the
causes supposed by Dr. Stoney, in 1891, to be operative in
producing doublets and satellites in the natural spectra of
gases may be really the true causes by which they are produced.
    Nevertheless Dr. Stoney’s explanation of the natural doublets
is opposed by a serious dif<U+FB01>culty in the fact that the two lines
of' a given doublet, sa the two D lines of sodium, behave in
(lifterent ways, as if they arose from different sources rather
than from the perturbation of the same source. For, in
addition to the differences previously known to exist, there is
the difference of behaviour in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.          Thus D1
is a wide-middled quartet in which the distance between the
central lines A (<U+FB01>g. 4) is nearl as great as the distance
between the side lines B and C, while D2 shows as a sextet of
uniformly spaced lines.
    In a similar manner individual members of the natural
triplets which occur in the natural spectra of the zinc,
cadmium, magnesium, &c. group behave differently. Thus
it' we denote the members of one of the natural triplets
by the symbols T1, T2, T3, in ascending order of' retran
gibility (For example the triplet 5086, 4800, 4678 of
cadmium, or the triplet 481], 4722, 4680 of zinc, or the
green I) triplet of magnesium), we <U+FB01>nd that T3 in all cases, in
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, shows as a pure triplet, or suffers accord
ing to the foregoing merely precessional perturbation. On
the other hand, T2 shows in each case as a quartet while T1 is
a diffuse triplet in which each of the members may prove to
be complex on further resolution. This would seem to point
to an essential difference in the characters of the lines T1, T2, T3,
as if they sprang from different origins rather than immedi
ately from the same. It is also of great interest to note that,
so far as my observations yet show, these natural triplets
behave differently according as they belong to Kayser and
Runge’s <U+FB01>rst subsidiary series or to the second subsidiary
series.   Thus if the triplet T1, T2, T3, belongs to the <U+FB01>rst
subsidiary series, then the magnetic effect decreases from T1
to T3, while if it belongs to the second subsidiary series, the
magnetic e<U+FB02>'ect increases from T1 to T3.         Examples of this

                      in the Magnetic Field.                 177
latter class are shown in my communication to this Journal
(April 1898, p. 335), where the increasing character of the
magnetic effect is well exhibited in the natural triplets 5086,
4800, 4678 of cadmium, and          4811, 4722, 4680 of zinc.
Further examples of this, and other peculiarities, I hope to
give in the near future as soon as I have fully examined and
veri<U+FB01>ed them.
                           General Law.
    The <U+FB01>rst general survey of the magnetic effect on the
 spectral lines of any given substance did not appear to favour
 the view that the phenomena are subject to any simple law.
 According to the electromagnetic theory the separation, 8k,
 of the side lines of a magnetic triplet should, under the same
 conditions, vary directly as L2 as we pass from line to line of
 the same spectrum. The possibility of such a law as this
 seemed to be refuted by the fact that some lines are largely
 affected in the magnetic field while others, of nearly the same
 wave-length in the same spectrum, are not appreciably affected
 under the same circumstances. In this connexion, however,
 I pointed out * that “ it is possible that the lines of any one
 substance may be thrown into groups for each of which 5)»
 varies as 7t”, and each of these groups might be produced by
 the motion of a single ion. The number of such groups in a.
 given spectrum would then determine the number of different
 kinds of ions in the atom or molecule.
     “ Homologous relations may also exist between the groups
 of different spectra, but all this remains for complete in
 vestigation.’_’
    Although the investigation referred to in the foregoing is
 still far from complete, yet the measurements so far made
 uniformly tend to con<U+FB01>rm the above speculation. For the
 corresponding lines of the natural groups into which a given
 spectrum resolves itself possess the same value of e/m or 57t/7t2,
 and, further, this value is the same for corresponding lines in
 homologous spectra of different substances.
    To illustrate the meaning of this, take the case of mag
 nesium, cadmium, and zinc, which are substances possessing
 homologous spectra and belonging to the same chemical
 group (Mendelejeff’s second group). The spectra of these
 metals consist of series of natural triplets. The <U+FB01>rst triplet
 of the series in magnesium is the green 6 group consisting
 of the wave-lengths 5183'8, 5172'8, 5167'5; while the <U+FB01>rst
 cadmium triplet consists of the lines 5086, 4800, 4678, and
                   * Phil. Mag, April 1898, p. 337.

 178        On Radiation Phenomena in the Magnetic Field.
 the <U+FB01>rst zinc triplet consists of the lines 4810?, 4722, 4680.
 Each of these triplets belongs to Kayser and Runge’s second
 lvflit’llst’rie, being the <U+FB01>rst terms, corresponding to 11:3, in
 their formula. We should consequently expect these groups
 to behave similarly in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld and to show effects
 which are similar for correspondin lines. That this expect
ation is realized is shown by the f0 lowing table :—
     Magnesium.     Cadmium.     Zinc.   :m/e or )9/6).    Character.

   l
     Thus the corresponding lines 51838, 5086, and 48107 of
the different substances possess the same value for m/e, while
the other corresponding lines also possess a common value
 for the quantity m/e. The value of this quantity changes
from one set of lines to another, showing, as we should expect,
that the different sets arise from differences in the source
which produces them.
     Not only is the quantity m/e the same for corresponding
lines in homologous spectra, but, as shown in the above table,
the character of the magnetic effect is also the same for
corresponding lines. Thus, while the lines along the lowest
row, 5167'5, 4678, 4680, are all of the pure triplet type, the
lines of the middle row all become resolved into similar
quartets in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and the lines forming the top
row are all somewhat diffuse and show as “soft ” triplets of
which the constituents may be really complex on further
resolution.
     It thus appears that the observation of radiation pheno—
mena in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is likely to afford a valuable means
of inquiry into the so far hidden nature of the events which
bring about the radiation from a luminous body, and also to
give us, perhaps, some clearer insight into the structure of
matter itself.

arbitrary function f(t) to have any arbitrarily given value for
all values of t from O to 1', and to be zero for all negative
values of t and all positive values greater than 7. Thus 'r is
what we may call the transit-time of the wave, that is, the
 time it takes to pass any <U+FB01>xed plane arallel to its front; or
 the time during which any point of t 0 medium is moved by
 it. The thicknesses, or, as we shall sometimes say, the wave
 lengths, of the two kinds of waves are ur and 117 respectively,
 being for the same transit-times directly as the propagational
 velocities.
     § 8. And now for our problem of re<U+FB01>exion and refraction.
 At present we need not occupy ourselves with the case of
 purely distortional waves with vibratory motions perpendicular
 to the plane of the incident, re<U+FB02>ected, and refracted rays. It
 was fully solved by Green‘ with an arbitrary function to
 express the character of the motion (including therefore the
 case of a solitary wave or of an in<U+FB01>nite procession of simple
 harmonic waves). He sh0\\'ed that it gave precisely the
 “ sine law” which Fresnel had found for the re<U+FB01>exion and
 refraction of waves “polarized in the plane of incidence.”_
 The same law has been found for light, regarded as electro
 magnetic waves of one of the two orthogonal polarizations,
 by von Helmholtz, H. A. Lorenz, J. J. Thomson, FitzGerald,
 and Rayleigh          'None of them has quite dared to say that
  the physical action represented by his formulas for this case is
  a to-and-fro motion of the ether perpendicular to the plane of
  incidence, re<U+FB02>exion, and refraction ; nor has any one, so far
  as I know, absolutely determined whether it is the lines of
  electric force or of magnetic force that are perpendicular
  to that plane in the case of light polarized by re<U+FB02>exion at the
  surface of a transparent medium. For the action, whatever
  its physical character may be, which takes place perpendicular
  to that plane, they all seem to prefer “ electric displacement,”
   of which thepnly conceivable meaning is motion of electricity _
  to and fro perpendicular to the plane. 7 If they had declared,
  or even suggested, de<U+FB01>nitely this motion of ether, they Would

have been perfectly in harmony with the undulator theory of
light as we have it from Young and Fresnel. We shall return
to this very simple problem of re<U+FB01>exion and refraction of
purely distortional waves in which the motion is perpendicular
to the plane of the three rays, in order to interpret in the very
simplest case the meaning, for a solitary wave, of the “change
of phase ” discovered by Fresnel and investigated dynamically
by Green for a procession of periodic waves of simple harmonic
IgltitiOll) experiencing “total internal reflexion.”   (See § 20
  e 0w.
    § 9. Meantime we take up the problem of the four reflected
and refracted waves produced by a single incident wave of
purely distortional character, in which the motion is in a
plane perpendicular to the <U+FB01>ve wave-fronts. Taking this for
XOY, the plane of our diagram, let YOZ be the interface
between the two mediums. We shall <U+FB01>rst consider one
single incident wave, 1, of the purely distortional character.
By incidence on the interface it will generally introduce
re<U+FB02>ected and refracted waves 1', 1,, of its own kind, that is
purely distortional, and J', J,, re<U+FB02>ected and refracted waves
of the condensational-rarefactional kind. The diagrams re
present, for two cases, sections of portions of the <U+FB01>ve waves
by the plane XOY. F and R show the front and rear of
 each wave; and the lines of shadin belonging to it show
the direction of the motion, or of t e component, which it

gives to the medium.        The inclinations of the fronts and rears

the <U+FB01>ve waves is zero, and the values of a and ,8 are as shown
in the following table :- —

densational, and there is no incident distortional wave.
There would be no interest in treating simultaneously the
results of two incident waves, one distortional (I) and the
other condensational (J).
    § 11. We may make various suppositions as to the inter
facial conditions, in respect to displacements of the two
mediums and in respect to mutual forces between them.
Thus we might suppose free slipping between the two : that
is to say, zero tangential force on each medium; and along
with this we might suppose equal normal components of
motion and of force ; and whatever supposition we make as
to displacements, we may suppose the normal and tangential
forces on either at the interface to be those calculated from
the strains according to the ordinary elastic solid theory, or
to be those calculated from the rotations and condensations or
dilatations, according to the ideal dynamics of ether suggested
in the article referred to in the <U+FB01>rst footnote to § 1. We shall

  on each solid to be that which I have found it must be

  ment of ether, and the lines of magnetic force coincide with
  axes of rotation of etherial substance. According to this

interesting result. It has long been known that for vibrations
perpendicular to the plane of the incident, re<U+FB02>ected, and
 refracted rays, unequal densities with equal rigidities of the
 two mediums, whether compressible or incompressible, gives
 Fresnel’s sine-law : and unequal rigidities, with equal
densities, gives his tangent-law. But for vibrations in the
plane of the three rays, and both mediums incompressible,
 unequal rigidities with equal densities give, as was shown by
 Rayleigh in 1871*, a complicated formula for the re<U+FB02>ected
ray, vanishing for two different angles of incidence, if the
motive forces in the waves are accordin to the law of
 the elasticity of an ordinary solid.     Now we <U+FB01>nd for vibrations
 in the plane of the rays, Fresnel’s sine-law, with its continual
increase of re<U+FB02>ected ray with increasing an les of incidence
up to 90°, if the restitutional forces fol ow the law of
dependence on rotation which I have suggested‘l' for ether,
and if the waves of condensation and rarefaction travel at
velocities small in comparison with those of waves of dis
tortion.

ideal problem of dynamics, it seems quite unimportant in the

the vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of the incident
and re<U+FB02>ected rays, and therefore, that it is for vibrations in
this plane that Fresnel’s tangent-law is ful<U+FB01>lled.
    §16. Of our present results, it is (35) of §14 which is really
important; inasmuch as it shows that Fresnel’s tangent-law
is ful<U+FB01>lled for vibrations in the plane of the rays, with the
rotational law of force, as I had found it in 1888 * with the
elastic-solid-law of force, provided only that the propagational
velocities of condensational waves are small in comparison
with those of the waves of transverse vibration which
constitute light.
    §17. By (28) we see that when a“, the velocity of the
wave-trace on the interface of the two mediums, is greater
than the greatest of the wave-velocities, each of b, b,, c, c, is
essentially real. A case of this character is represented by
 <U+FB01>g. 2, in which the velocities of the condensational waves
 in both mediums are much smaller than the velocity of the
 refracted distortional wave, and this is less than that of the
 incident wave which is distortional. When one or more of
 b, 12,, c, c, is imaginary, our solution (26) (28) remains valid,
 but is not applicable to f regarded as an arbitrary function ;
 because although f(t) may be arbitrarily given for every real
 value of t, we cannot from that determine the real values of

     The primary object of the present communication was to
 treat this case in a manner suitable for a single incident soli
 tary wave whether condensational or distortional ; instead of
 in the manner initiated by Green and adopted by all subsequent
 writers, in which the realized results are immediately applicable
 only to cases in which the incident wave-motion consists of
 an endless train of simple harmonic waves. Instead, therefore,
 of making f an exponential function as Green made it, I

that both kinetic and potential energy are very small for any

      These real resultants of imaginary waves are not plane
   waves. They are forced linear waves sweeping the interface,
   on which they travel with velocity 11-1; and they produce
   disturbances penetrating to but small distances into the
   medium to which they belong. Their interpretation in con

   'SINCE the date of the last communication, which I made to
       - this Journal in February 1892, I have been continually
   engaged in the employment of platinum thermometers in
   various researches. But although I have exhibited some of
   my instruments at the Royal Society and elsewhere and have
  described the results of some of these investigations, I have
   not hitherto found time to publish in a connected form an
   account of the construction and application of the instruments
   themselves, or the results of my experience with regard to the
   general question of platinum thermometry. As the method
   has now come into very general use for scienti<U+FB01>c purposes, it
    may be of advantage at the present time to collect in an
   accessible form some account of the progress of the work, to
    describe the more recent improvemtnts in methods and
   apparatus, and to discuss the application and limitations of
    the various formulae which have from time to time been
   proposed.
       The present paper begins with a brief historical summary,
   with the object of removing certain common misapprehensions
    and of rendering the subsequent discussion intelligible. It
    then proceeds to discuss various formulae and methods of
    reduction, emplOying in this connexion a proposed standard
    notation and nomenclature, which I have found convenient in
    my own work. I h "e in a subsequent paper to describe some
    of the more recent developments and applications of the
    platinum thermometer, more particularly those which have
    occurred to me in the course of my own work, and which have
   not as yet been published or described elsewhere.

                            Historical Summary.
      The earlier experiments on the variation of the electrical
   resistance of metals with temperature were either too rough,
   or too limited in range, to afford any satisfactory basis for a
  formula. The conclusion of Lenz (1838), that the resistance
  reached a maximum at a comparatively low temperature,
  generally between 200° and 300° 0., was derived from the
  empirical formula,
                            R°/R=1+at+bz’, . . . . . (L)
  in which R° and R stand for the resistances at 0° and t° 0.,
  respectively. This conclusion resulted simply from the
  accident that he expressed his results in terms of conductivity
  instead of resistance, and could be disproved by the roughest
‘qualitative experiments at temperatures beyond the range
  0° to 100° (1., to which his observations were restricted.
  Matthiesseu (1862), in his laborious and extensive investiga
  tions, also unfortunately fell into the same method of
  expression.     His results have been very widely quoted and
  adopted, but, owing to the extreme inadequacy of the formula,
  the accuracy of his work is very seriously impaired even
  within the limits of the experimental range to which it was
  con<U+FB01>ned. The so-called Law of Clausius, that the resistance
  of pure metals varied as the absolute temperature, was a
  generalization founded on similarly incomplete data. The
  experiments of Arndtsen (1858), by which it was suggested,
  gave, for instance, the temperature-coef<U+FB01>cients '00394 for
  copper, '00341 for silver and '00413 for iron, all of which
  differ considerably from the required coef<U+FB01>cient '003665.
  The observations, moreover, were not suf<U+FB01>ciently exact to
  show the deviation of the resistance-variation from lineality.
 The experiments of Sir William Siemens (1870) did not
 a<U+FB01>'ord any evidence for the particular formula which he pro
 posed, at least in the case of iron. These formulae have been
 already discussed in previous communications*, but con
 sidering the extent to which they are still quoted, it may be
 instructive to append the curves representing them, as a
graphic illustration of the danger of applying for purposes of
extrapolation formulae of an unsuitable type. The curves
labelled Morris‘l' and Benoit, which are of the same general
character but differ in steepness, may be taken as representing
 approximately the resistance-variation of specimens of pure
 and impure iron respectively.
     The <U+FB01>rst experiments which can be said to have afforded
any satisfactory basis for a general formula were those of

 The wires on which he experimented were wound on clay
 cylinders and heated in vapour-baths of steam (100°), mercury
  (360°), sulphur (440°), and cadmium (860°), and in a liquid
 bath of mercury for temperatures below 360°. The resistances
 were measured by means of a Becquerel differential galvano
 meter and a rheostat consisting of two platinum wires with a
 sliding mercury-contact.               It is evident that the values which
 he assumed for the higher boiling-points are somewhat rough.
 The boiling-point attributed to cadmium, following Deville
 and Troost, is about 50° too high according to later experi
 ments by the same authorities, or about 90° too high according
 to Carnelley and Williams.                  It would appear also that no
  special precautions were taken to eliminate errors due to
 thermoelectric e<U+FB02>'ects, to changes in the resistance of the
 leading wires, and to defective insulation, &0. In spite of
 these obvious defects it is surprising to <U+FB01>nd how closely the
 results as a whole agree with the observations of subsequent
 investigators. The resistance-variation of all the more common,

  where R is the resistance at any temperature t, and Bo the

  he gives for iron and steel represent correctly (in opposition
  to the formula of Siemens) the very rapid increase in the rate
  of change of resistance with temperature, as shown by the
  relatively large positive value of the coef<U+FB01>cient 1). He gives
  also in the case of platinum a small negative value for I) (a
  result since abundantly con<U+FB01>rmed), although the specimen
  which he used Was evidently far from pure *. This formula,
  which is the most natural to adopt for representing the
  deviations from linoality in a case of this kind, had been
  previously employed to a. limited extent by others for the
  variation of resistance with temperature; but it had not pre

      The work of the Committee of the British Association in
  1874 was mainly con<U+FB01>ned to investigating the changes of
  zero of a Siemens pyromcter when heated in an ordinary <U+FB01>re
  to moderately elevated temperatures. Finding that the pyro~
  mcter did not satisfy the fundamental criterion of giving.
  always the same indication at the same temperature, it did.
  not seem worth while to pursue the method further, and the:
  question remained in abeyance for several years. In the
  meantime great advances were made in the theory and
’ practice of electrical measurement, so that when I com
  menced to investigate the subject at the Cavendish Labo
  ratory, the home of the electrical standards, in 1885, I was
  able to carry out the electrical measurements in a more
  satisfactory manner, and to avoid many of the sources of
  error existing in previous work. The results of my investi
  gations were communicated to the Royal Society in June
  1886, and were published, with additions, in the ‘Philoso
  phical Transactions’ of the following year. Owing to a
  personal accident, no complete abstract of this paper as a
  whole was ever published; and as the paper in its original
  form is somewhat long and inaccessible, many of the points
  it contained have since been overlooked. The greater part of
  the paper was occupied with the discussion of methods and
  observations with air-thermometers; but it may not be amiss
  at the present time to give a summary of the main conclusions

which it contained, so far as they relate .to the subject of
platinum thermometry.
   (1) It was shown that a platinum resistance-thermometer,
if suf<U+FB01>ciently protected from strain and contamination, was
practically free from changes of zero over a range of 0° to
1200° 0., and satis<U+FB01>ed the fundamental criterion of giving
always the same indication at the same temperature.
   (2) It was proposed to use the platinum thermometer as a
secondary standard, the temperature pt on the platinum scale
being de<U+FB01>ned by the formula                                       '
                   pt=100(R—R°)/(R’—-R°), . . . . (1)
in which the letters R, R°, R' stand for the observed resist
ances at the temperatures pt, 0°, and 100° (J. respectively.
   (3) By comparing the values of pt deduced from different
pairs of specimens of platinum wires, wound side by side and
heated together in such a manner as to be always at the same
temperature, it was shown that different wires agreed very
closely in giving the same value of any temperature pt on the
platinum scale, although differing considerably in the values
of their temperature-coe<U+FB01>icieiits. (See below, p. 209.)
   (4) A direct comparison was made between the platinum
scale and the scale of the air-thermometer by means of several
different instruments, in which the coil of platinum wire was
enclosed inside the bulb of the air-thermometer itself, and so
arranged as to be always at the same mean temperature as the
mass of air under observation. As the result of this com
parison, it was shown that the small deviations of the platinum
scale from the temperature t by air-thermometer could be
represented by the simple difference-formula
                  D=t—pt=d(t/100-—1)t/100,. . . . (2)
with a probable error of less than 1° C. over the range 0° to
650° C.
   (5) It was inferred from the comparisons of different
specimens of wire referred to in (3) (which comparisons were
independent of all the various sources of error affecting the
air-thermometer, and'could not have been in error by so much
as a tenth of a degree) that the simple parabolic formula did
not in all cases represent the small residual differences between
the wires.
   (6) It was shown by the direct comparison of other typical
metals and alloys with platinum, that the temperature-variation _
of the resistance of metals and alloys in general could probably
be represented by the same type of formula over a consider
able range with nearly the same order of accuracy as in the

  singularities due to change of state or structure, such as those
 occurring in the case of iron at the critical temperature, or in
 the case of tin at the point of fusion.
     This paper attracted very little attention until the results
 Were con<U+FB01>rmed by the independent observations of Gri<U+FB02>iths*,
 who in 1890 applied the platinum thermometer to the deter
 mination of certain boiling- and freezing-points, and to the
 testing of mercury thermometers of limited scale. The
 results of this work appeared at <U+FB01>rst to disa ree materially
 with the difference-formula already quoted, t e discrepancy
 amounting to between 6° and 7° at 440° C. After his work
 had been communicated to the Royal Society a direct com
 parison Was made with one of my thermometers in his appa
 ratus; and the discrepancy was traced to the assumption by
 Griffiths of Regnault’s value 448°‘38 O. for the boiling-point
 of sulphur. We therefore undertook ajoint redetermination
 of this point with great care, employing for the purpose one
 of my original air-thermometers which had been used in the
 experiments of 1886. The results of this determination were
 communicated to the Royal Society in December 1890, and
 brought the observations of Grif<U+FB01>ths into complete harmony
with my own and with the most accurate work of previous
observers on the other boiling- and freezing-points in question.
The agreement between his thermometers when reduced by
the difference-formula (2), employing for each instrument the
appropriate value for the difference-coef<U+FB01>cient d, was in fact
0 oser than I had previously obtained with platinum wires
from different sources. But the agreement served only to
con<U+FB01>rm the convenience of the method of reduction by
means of the Sulphur Boiling-Point (S.B.P.) which we
proposed in that paper 1'.

discuss the results of later work, to explain in detail the
notation and phraseology which I have found to be useful in
connexion with platinum thermometry. This notation has
already in part been adopted by the majority of workers
in the platinum scale, and it would be a great saving in time
and space if some standard system of the kind could be gene
rally recognized. In devising the notation special attention
has been paid to the limitations of the commercial typewriter,

 the present time are required to be typewritten. It is for
 this reason desirable to avoid, wherever possible, the use of
 Greek letters and subscript diacritics and indices.
    The Fundamental 1nterval.—The denominator, R’ —R°, in
 formula (1) for the platinum temperature pt, represents the
 change of resistance of the thermometer between 0° and
 100° 0., and is called the fundamental interval of the thermo
 meter, in accordance with ordinary usage. It is convenient,
 as suggested in a previous communication, to adjust the
 resistance of each thermometer, and to measure it in terms
of a unit such that the fundamental interval is approxi
mately 100. The reading of the instrument will then give
directly the value of pt at any temperature, subject only to a
small percentage correction for the error of adjustment of the
fundamental interval.
    The Fundamental Coe<U+FB02>icient.—The mean value of the tem
perature-coef<U+FB01>cient of the change of resistance between 0°
and 100° (1. is called the fundamental coef<U+FB01>cient of the wire,
and is denoted by the letter c. The value of c is given by the
expression (R'- R°)/100R°. The value of this coef<U+FB01>cient is
not necessary for calculating or reducing platinum tempe
ratures, but it is useful for identifying the wire and as giving
an indication of its probable purity.
    The Fundamental Zero.—The reciprocal of the fundamental
coef<U+FB01>cient a is called the fundamental zero of the scale of the
thermometer, and is denoted by the symbol pto, so that
pt°=l/c. The fundamental zero, taken with the negative
sign, represents the temperature on the scale of the instrument
itself at which its resistan        would vanish. It does not
necessarily possess any ph .ical meaning, but it is often more
convenient to use than the fundamental coef<U+FB01>cient (e. 9.,
Phil. Trans. A, 1887, p. 225). It may be remarked that,
if the resistance has been accurately adjusted so that the
fundamental interval is 100 units, R°, the resistance at 0° (1.,
will be numerically equal to pt°.
   The Di<U+FB01>'erence Formula.—It is convenient to write the
formula for the difference between tand pt in the form already
given (2), as the product of three factors, d x (t/100— 1) x 15/1 00,
rather ,than in the form involving the square of t/lOO, which I
originally gave, and which has always been quoted. Owing
to the form in which it was originally cast, I <U+FB01>nd that most
observers have acquired the habit of working the formula in
the following manner.         First <U+FB01>nd the square of t/100,
then subtract t/lOO, writing the <U+FB01>gures down on paper, and
<U+FB01>nally multiply the difference by the difference-coef<U+FB01>cient d
with the aid of a slide-rule. It is very much easier to work
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 47. No. 285. Feb. 1899.            P

198     Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
the formula as the product of three factors, because the sub
traction (I/lOO—l) can be safely performed by mental
arithmetic. The whole process can then be performed by
one application of the slide-rule, instead of two, and it is
unnecessary to write down any intermediate steps on paper.
    The Paraholic Function.—lt is convenient to have an
abbreviation for the parabolic function of t vanishing at
0° and 100°, which occurs so frequently in questions of
thermometry. I have found the abbreviation [7(t) both sug
gestive and useful for this purpose. The formula may then
 be written in the abbreviated shape, t=pt+d Xp(t).
    The “S.B.P.” lllethod 0f Reduction.—Assuming the differ
ence-formula, the value of the di<U+FB01>'erence-coetticient d may be
determined by observing the resistance R”, and calculating
the corresponding value of the platinum temperature pt”, at
some secondary <U+FB01>xed point t”, the temperature of which is
known on the scale of the gas-thermometer. The boiling
point of sulphur (S.B.P.) is generally the most convenient
to use, and has been widely adopted for this purpose. As
suming that this point is chosen for the purpose, and that the
height of the barometer at the time is 760+]; millims., the
corresponding temperature is given by the formula
                     t”=444'53+ "082 h,
provided that h is small, and the corresponding value of the
parabolic function by the formula
                     p(t”) = 15-32 + '0065 1.,
whence d=(t”—pt”)/p(t”).
   With the best apparatus it is possible to attain an order of
accuracy of about 0'1 per cent. in the value of d obtained by
this method, at least in the case of thermometers which are
not used at temperatures above 500°. At higher temperatures
the exact application of the formula would be more open to
question, and it may be doubted whether the value of the
di<U+FB01>'erence-coe<U+FB01>icient would remain constant to so small a
fraction of itself.
   Other Secondary Fixed Points.—-For very accurate work
between 0° and 100° C. it might be preferable to use a value
of d determined at 50° 0., either by direct comparison with
an air-thermometer or by comparison with a standard platinum
thermometer. The latter comparison would be much the
easier and more accurate. Although the most- careful com
parisons have hitherto failed to show that the value of d
obtained by assuming the S.B.P. does not give correct results

           Prof. H. L. 0allendar on Platinum Thermomet'ry.               199
   between 0° and 100° 0., it is quite possible that this might not
' always be the case.
       For work at low temperatures it would be preferable, from
   every point of view, to make use of the boiling-point of oxygen
   as the secondary <U+FB01>xed point. There appears to be a very
   general consensus of opinion that the temperature of liquid
   oxygen boiling under a pressure of 760 mm. is —182°'5 0.,
   on the scale of the constant-volume hydrogen or helium
   thermometer *. It is quite possible that, as in the case of
   water and most other liquids, the temperature of the boiling
  liquid would be different from that of the condensing vapour
  at the same pressure ; but the boiling liquid is the most con
  venient to employ, and it appears that its temperature is
  steady to two or three tenths of a degree, and reproducible by
   different observers to a similar order of accuracy. I have
  found it convenient for purposes of distinction to employ the
  symbol d° to denote the value of d deduced from the boiling
  point of oxygen, and the symbol d” to denote that deduced
  from the boiling-point of sulphur. The formulae for the
  pressure correction in the case of oxygen are approximately
             ¢= -1s2-5 + -020 It; p(t) = 5-16-'00093h.
       T/ze Resistance Formula—I have shown in the paper
  already referred to that the adoption of the parabolic differ
  ence-formula for the relation between pt and t is equivalent
  to assuming for the resistance-variation the formula
                           R/R°=1+at+bt’.. . . . .                   .   (3)
  The values of the coefficients a and b are found in terms of c
  and d, or vice versd, by means of the relations
                  a=c(1 + d/lOO),        b= —cd/10,000.
      Graphic Method of Reduction.—The quickest and most
  generally convenient method of reducing platinum tempe
  ratures to the air-scale is to plot the difference t—pt in terms
  of t as abscissa, and to deduce graphically the curve of differ
  ence in terms of pt as abscissa, as described and illustrated
  in my original paper. This method is particularly suitable at
  temperatures up to 500° 0., as the difference over this range
  is relatively small and accurately known. It is also very con
  venient if a large number of determinations are to be made
  with a single instrument. It is not so convenient in the case
  of a number of different instruments with different coef<U+FB01>cients,
     '* The experimental evidence for this number is not quite satisfactory,
  owing to differences in the atmospheric pressure and im urities in the
  oxygen. It must be understood that the adoption 0 this value is
  provisional and subject to correction.

each of which is used for a comparatively limited number of
determinations. In such a case the trouble of drawing the ’
separate curves, with sufficient care to be of use, would more
than counterbalance the advantage to be gained by the
method.
    Ileycock and quv'l/e’s .Uelllod.—ln order to avoid this
dif<U+FB01>culty Messrs. Heycock and Neville, in their classical
researches at high temperatures “ devised an ingenious modi
<U+FB01>cation of procedure, which has given very good results
in their hands, but is not quite identical with the simple
di<U+FB01>'erence-formula. They described a difference-curve in the
usual manner, giving the value of the difference in terms of
[It as abscissa for a standard value (1:1'50 of the difference
coefficient. The appropriate values of d were determined in
the case of each pyrometer by the S.B.P. method. In re
ducing the observations for any given values of pt and (l, the
value of the difference corresponding to pt was taken from
the curve for ¢l=1'50, and was then multiplied by the factor
d/l'50 and added to pt. This method is very expeditious
and convenient, and gives results which are in practical
agreement with the pure difference-formula, provided that,
as was almost invariably the ease in their observations, the
values of d do not differ materially from the average 1'50.
If, however, the pure difference-formula is correct, the method
could not be applied in the case of values of d differing con
siderably from the average.            The difference between the.
methods cannot be simply expressed in terms of either pt or t
for considerable variations in the value of d. But for a small
variation 8d in the value of d in the vicinity of the normal
value, it is easy to show that the difference St between
the                          as given
       true value ofthet value
t—~pt=d_p(t),iand                 found by           difference-formula
                                              the method
                                          by the            of Heycock
and Neville, is approximately
                      8t: 8d(dt/dpt— 1);»(z) Jr.
    Neglecting the variation of d entirely, the error would be
                         8’t= 8d(dt/dpt)p(t) .
    For example, at t=1000°, p(t) =90, (dt/dpt)=l'40, we
should <U+FB01>nd for a variation of d from 1'50 to 1'60, the values
$t=3°'8 (H. & N.), and 5’t=12°'8 (variation neglected).
    This is an extreme case. In the observations of Heycock
and Neville, the values found for the coefficient d seldom

   T The value of dt/dpt at an point is readily found by differentiating

  varied so much as '04 on either side of the mean, in the case
 of their standard wire. It is, moreover, quite possible that
 these variations may have been partly due to fortuitous differ
 ences at the S.B.P. and at the <U+FB01>xed points, in which case it
 is probable that the Heycock and Neville method of reduction
 would lead to more consistent results than the pure difference
 formula, because it does not allow full weight to the apparent
 variations of d as determined by the S.B.P. observations.
 It is clearly necessary, as Heycock and Neville have shown,
 and as the above calculation would indicate, to take some
 account of the small variations of d, at least in the case of
 pyrometers in constant use at high temperatures. The method
 of Heycock and Neville appears to be a very convenient and
 practical way of doing this, provided that the variations of d
 are small. It must also be observed that, although the indi
 vidual reductions by their method may differ by as much as
 1° or 2° at 1000° from the application of the pure difference
 formula, the average results for the normal value of d will be
in exact agreement with it.
    Dz<U+FB01>'erence-Formula in Terms of pt.—In discussing the
 variation of resistance as a function of the temperature, it is
most natural and convenient to express the results in terms of
the temperature t on the scale of the air-thermometer by
means of the parabolic formula already given. This formula
has the advantage of leading to simple relations between the
temperature-coef<U+FB01>cients; and it also appears to represent the
general phenomenon of the resistance-variation of metals
over a wide range of temperature with greater accuracy than
any other equally convenient formula. When, however, it
is simply a question of <U+FB01>nding the temperature from the
observed value of the resistance, or from the observed reading
of a platinum thermometer, over a comparatively limited
range, it is equally natural, and in some respects more con
venient, to have a formula 'which gives t directly in terms of
pt or B. This method of expression was originally adopted
by Griffiths, who expressed the results of vthe calibration of
his thermometers by means of a formula oil the type
                 t—pt=apt+bpt2+cpt3+dpt4.          .  .   .
The introduction of the third and fourth powers of pt in
this equation was due to the assumption of Regnault’s value
for the boiling-point of sulphur. If we make a correction
for this, the observations can be very fairly represented by a
parabolic formula of the type already given, namely,
           t—pt=d’(pt/100—l)pt/lOO=dQ)(pt).             .   . (4)

202      Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
    This formula is so simple and convenient, and agrees so
closely over moderate ranges of temperature with the ordinary
difference-formula, as to be well worth discussion. I have
been in the habit of using it myself for a number of years in
 approximate reductions at moderate temperatures, more par
 ticularly in steam-engine and conductivity experiments, in
 which for other reasons a high degree of accuracy is not
 required. It has also been recently suggested by Dickson
 (Phil. Mag, Dec. 1897), though his suggestion is coupled
 with a protest against platinum temperatures.
     The value of the difference-coef<U+FB01>cient d’ in this formula
 may be determined as usual by reference to the boiling-point
 of sulphur, or it may be deduced approximately from the
 value of the ordinary difference-coefficient d by means of the
 relation
                d’=d/(l—'077d), or d=d’/(1+'077d’).
     If this value is chosen for the coef<U+FB01>cient, the two differ
  ence-formulae will of course agree at 0°, 100°, and 445° C.,
  but will differ slightly at other tern eratures.           The order of
  agreement between the formulae is s own at various points of
  the scale by the annexed table, in which t represents the
  temperature given by the ordinary formula t—pt=l'50p(t),
  and t’ the temperature calculated by formula (4) for the same
  value of pt, choosing the value d’=1'695, to make the two
  formulae agree at the S.B.P.

      It will be observed that the difference is reasonably small
   between the limits —200° and +600°, but that it becomes
   considerable at high temperatures. A much closer agreement
   may be readily obtained over small ranges of temperature by
   choosing a suitable value of d'. The two formulae become
   practically indistinguishable between 0° and 100°, for in
   stance, if we make d’ =d. For steam-engine work I generally
   selected the value of d’ to make the formulae agree at 200° C.

For work at low temperatures, it would be most convenient to
select the boiling-point of oxygen for the determination of
either difference-coef<U+FB01>cient. The two formulae are so similar
that they cannot be distinguished with certainty over a
moderate range of temperature. But if the values of the differ
ence-coef<U+FB01>cients are calculated from the S.B.P., the balance
of evidence appears to be in favour of the original formula (2).
 Formula (4) appears to give differences which are too large
between 0° and 100° C.; and it does not agree nearly so
 well as (2) with my own air-thermometer observations .over
the range 0° to 650° C. It appears also from the work of
Heycock and Neville to give results which are too low at high
temperatures as compared with those of other observers.
   It is obvious, from the similarity of form, that the differ
ence-formula (4) in terms ofpt corresponds, as in the case of
formula        to a parabolic relation between the temperature
and resistance, of the type
t: —t0+a/R/RO+ bl(R/RO)2=a/l(R/RO_1) +b1/(R/Ro_l)2
‘Vhen R = 0, t = — to = —(a”—b”).             AlSO b’: b”, and
u’=a”—2t)”.
   The values of the fundamental coef<U+FB01>cient 0, and of the fun
damental zero pt°, are of course the same on either formula,
provided that they are calculated from observations at 0° and
100° 0., but not, if they are calculated from observations
outside that range. The values of the coef<U+FB01>cients a” and b”
are given in terms of d’, and either pt°, or c, by the relations
  a”=pt°(l—d’/100)=(1—d’/100)/c, and d’=10,000b”c’.
   Formulae of this general type, but expressed in a slightly
different shape, have been used by Holborn and Wien for
their observations at low temperatures, and recently by
Dickson for reducing the results of Fleming and other
observers. But they do not employ the platinum scale or
the difference-formula.
   illazimum and Mm'mum Values of the Resistance and
Temperature.-—-It may be of interest to remark that the dif
ference-formulae (2) and (4) lead to maximum or minimum
values of pt and t respectively, which are always the same
for the same value of d, but lie in general outside the range
of possible extrapolation. In the case of formula (2), the
resistance reaches a maximum at a temperature t= —a/2b=
(5000/d) (1+d/100). The maximum values of pt and R are
given in terms of d and c by the equations
      pt (max.) = (1 + d/100) t/2 = (2500/d) (1 + d/lOO)’,
 R/R° (max.) = l +pt (max.)/pt°= 1 + (25000/d) (l + d/100)°.

204        Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry
     Similarly in the case of the difference-formula (4) in terms
of pt, the maximum or minimum value of t is given in terms
of d’ by the equation
         t(max.)= (l—d’/100)pt/2= — (2500/d’) (l-d'/100)’.

He objects to the usual formula. (3) on the grounds, (1)
that it leads to a maximum value of the resistance in the
 case of platinum at a temperature of about t=3250° 3., and
 (2) that any given value of the resistance corresponds to two
 temperatures. He asserts that “ both of these statements
 indicate physical conditions which we have no reason to sup
 pose exist.” In support of contention (1), he adduces a rou h
 observation of Holhorn and Wicn' to the effect that t e
     '1' Wied. Ann. Oct. 1805, p. 386. Mr. Diclcon and some other writers
 appear to attach too nmch weight to these observations of Messrs. I lolborn
 and VVien. So far as they go, they afford a very fair confirmation of the
  fundamental principles of platinum-thermometry at high temperatures;
  but the experiments themselves were of an incidental character, and
  were made with somewhat unsuitable apparatus. Only two samples of
  wire Were tested, and the resistances employed were too small for
  accurate measurement. The wires were heated in a badly-conducting
  muffle and were insulated by capillary tubes of porcelain or similar
  material. The temperature of the wire under test was assumed to be the
  mean of the tem eratures indicated by two thermo-junctions at its
  extremities ; but t 1e authors state that “ the distribution of temperature
  in the furnace was very irregular.” The resistance was measured by a
  modi<U+FB01>cation of the potentiometer method, and no attempt was made to
  eliminate residual thermoelectric e<U+FB01>ects. Under these conditions the
   observations showed that the resistance was not permanently changed by
   exposure to a temperature of 1600° C., at least within the limits of
   accuracy of the resistance measurements. It is quite easy, however, by
   electric heating as in the “ meldomefer,” to verify the difierence-f'ormula
  at high temperatures, with less risk of strain or contamination or bad
  insulation. (See l’etavel, Phil. Trans. A (1898), p. 601.)
      The two series of observations excluding the series in which the tube
   of the muf<U+FB02>e cracked, and the thermocouples and wire were so con
   taminated with silicon and furnace-gases as to render the observations
   valueless) overlapped from 1050° to 1250° 0., and showed differences
   between the two wires varying from 10° to 46° at these temperatures,
   the errors of individual observations in either series being about 10° to
   15°. It must be remembered, however, that the two wires were of
   different sizes and resistances; they were heated in different fin-naces;
   they were insulated with different materials; and their temperatures
   were deduced from different thermocou les. Taking these facts into
   consideration, it is remarkable that the 0 served agreement should be so
   close. The observations at the highest temperatures in both cases, with
   the furnaces full blast and under the most favourable conditions for
   securing uniformity of temperature throughout the length of the wire, are
   in very close agreement with the difference-formula (2), assuming d=1'75.
       The second specimen was also tested at lower temperatures, but the

       Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.                205
resistance of one of their wires had already nearly reached
6R° at a temperature of about 1610° 0., whereas the maximum
calculated resistance in the case of one of my wires (with acoe<U+FB01>i
cient c='00340) was only 6'576R°. He omits to notice that
the result depends on the coef<U+FB01>cients of the wire.                 >
    The wire used by Holborn and Wien had a fundamental
coefficient c='00380, and the highest value of the resistance
actually observed was not 6lt° as suggested, but R/R°=‘i'53,
at a temperature t=l610o 0., deduced from thermo-junctions
at each end.       If we assume zl=l'70 as a probable value of
the di<U+FB02>'erence-coei<U+FB01>cient for their wire, the difference-formula
 (2) would give,
    at t: 1610°, D=414°, pt=1196°, whence R/R°=5'54.
    It would be absurd to attach much weight to so rough an
observation, but it will be seen that, so far as it goes, the
result is consistent with the usual formula, and does not bear
out Mr. Dickson’s contention. A more important defect in
arguments (l) and               lies in the fact that maximum and
minimum values of the resistance are known to occur in
the case of lnanganin and bismuth within the experimental
range, and that such cases can be at least approximately
 represented by a formula of the type                    but cannot be
represented by a formula of the type (6).
    As shown by Table 1. above, the formula proposed by
 Dickson agrees fairly well with formula (3), in the special
case of platinum, through a considerable range. But- the
case of platinum is exceptional. If we attempt to apply a
 formula of Dickson’s type to the case of other metals, we are
 met by practical difficulties of a serious character, and are
 driven to conclude that the claim that it is “more represen
 tative of the connexion between temperature and resistance
 than any formula hitherto proposed,” cannot be maintained.
 observations are somewhat inconsistent, and lead to values of d which
 are rather large and variable, ranging from 3'7 to 2'6. These variations
 are robably due to errors of observation or reduction. This is shown
by t e work of Mr. Tory (B.A. Report, 1897), who made a direct coul
parison between the Pt—PtRh thermocouple and the platinum-thermo
meter by a much more accurate method than that of Holborn and Wien.
 He found the parabolic difference-formula for the platinum thermometer
to be in very fair agreement hetwsen 100° and 800° C. with the previous
series of observations of Holborn and Wien on this thermocouple (\Vied.
Ann. 1892), and there can be little doubt that the discrepancies shown
by their later tests were due chie<U+FB02>y to the many obvious defects of the
method.' For a more detailed criticism of these observations, the reader
should refer to a letter by Grif<U+FB01>ths in ‘ Nature,’ Feb. 27th, 1896. It is
suf<U+FB01>cient to state here that the conclusions which these observers drew
from their experiments are not justi<U+FB01>ed by the observations themselves.

  206     Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
  If, for instance, we take the observations of Fleming on very
  pure iron between 0° and 200° 0., and calculate a formula of
  the Holborn and \Vicn, or Dickson, type to represent them,
  we arrive at a curve similar to that shown in <U+FB01>g. 1 (p. 193).
  (The values of the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of Fleming’s wire are
  reduced, for the sake of comparison, to the value R: 10,000
  at 0° 0.) This curve agrees very closely with that of Morris
  and other observers between 0° and 200° 0. The peculiarities
  of the curve beyond this range are not due to errors in the
  data, but to the unsuitable nature of the formula.     A similar
  result would be obtained in the case of iron by employing
  any other suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate data. It will be observed that
 the formula leads to a maximum value of the temperature
  t=33~1°, and makes the resistance vanish at —197°. Below
 334° there are two values of the resistance for each value of
 the temperature, and the value of dR/dt at 331° is in<U+FB01>nite,
  both of which conditions are at present unknown in the ease
 of any metal, and are certainly not true in the case of
 iron. if, instead of taking the value observed at + 196°‘1 0.,
 we take the value obtained at the O.B.P. to calculate the
 formula, we should <U+FB01>nd a better agreement with observation
 at low temperatures, but the disagreement at higher tempe
 ratures would be greater.
    If, on the other hand, we take the same obscrrations, namely,
 c='00625, and R/R°=2'372 when t=196°'], and calculate a
 difference-formula of the type (2) corresponding to (3), we
 <U+FB01>nd d=—-12'5, a=°005~167, b='000,007825. The points
 marked 63 in <U+FB01>g. 1 are calculated from this formula, and are
 seen to be in practical agreement with the observations of
 Morris up to 800°. As this formula stands the test of extra
 polation so much better than that of Holborn and Wien or
 Dickson, we are justi<U+FB01>ed in regarding it as being probably
 more representative of the connexion between resistance and
temperature.
    Advantages of the Diference-Formula.—Mr. Dickson’s ob
jections to the platinum scale and to the difference-formula
appear to result from want of familiarity with the practical
use of the instrument. But as his remarks on this subject
are calculated to mislead others, it may be well to explain
brie<U+FB02>y the advantages of the method, which was originally
devised with the object of saving the labour of reduction
involved in the use of ordinary empirical formulae, and of
rendering the results of observations with different instruments
directly and simply comparable.
    (1) In the <U+FB01>rst place, a properly constructed and adjusted
platinum thermometer reads directly in degrees of temperature

       Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.       207
on the platinum scale, just like a mercury thermometer, or
any other instrument intended for practical use. The quantity
directly observed is not the resistance in ohms, but the tem
perature on the platinum scale, either pt, or pt+pt°. The
advantage of this method is that the indications of different
instruments become directly comparable, and that the values
of pt for different wires agree very closely. If this method
is not adopted, the resistances in ohms of different instruments
at different temperatures form a series of meaningless <U+FB01>gures,
which cannot be interpreted without troublesome reductions.
    (2) The second advantage of the difference-formula lies in
the fact that the difference is small, more especially at mode
 rate temperatures, and can be at once obtained from a curve
 or a table, or calculated on a small slide-rule, without the
 necessity of minute accuracy of interpolation or calculation.
 In many cases, owing to the smallness of the difference
 between the scales, the results of a series of observations
 can be worked out entirely in terms of the platinum scale,
 and no reduction need be made until the end of the series.
 For instance, in an elaborate series of experiments on the
 variation of the speci<U+FB01>c heat of water between 0" and 100° C.,
 on which I have been recently engaged, by a metth de
 scribed in the Brit. Assoc. Report, 1897, all the observations
 are worked out in terms of the platinum scale, and the re
 duction to the air-scale can be performed by the aid of the
difference-formula in half an hour at the end of the whole
 series. As all the readings of temperature have to be taken
 and corrected to the ten-thousandth part of a degree, and as
 the whole series comprises about 100,000 observations, it is
clear that the labour involved in Mr. Dickson’s method of
 reduction would have been quite prohibitive. It is only by
the general introduction of the method of small corrections
 that such work becomes practicable.
    On the illethod of Least Squares.—-There appears to be a
 widespread tendency among non-mathematical observers to
 regard with almost superstitious reverence the value of results
 obtained by the method of least squares. This reverence in
  many cases is entirely misplaced, and the method itself, as
 commonly applied, very often leads to erroneous results. For
 instance, in a series of observations extending over a con
 siderable range of temperature, it would be incorrect to attach
 equal weight to all the results, because all the sources of
 error increase considerably as we depart further from the
 <U+FB01>xed points of the scale.      In a series of air-thermometer
 observations, the <U+FB01>xed points themselves stand in quite a
 different category to the remainder of the observations. The

 208     Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
 temperature is accurately known by de<U+FB01>nition, and is not.
 dependent on uncertain errors of the instrument. It is a
  mistake, therefore, in reducing a series of observations of this
 kind, to put all the observations, including the <U+FB01>xed points,
 on the same footing, and then apply the method of least
 squares, as Mr. Dickson has applied it in his reduction of the
 results of various observers with platinum thermometers. For
 instance, in order to make his formula <U+FB01>t my observations at
  higher temperatures, he is compelled to admit an error of no
 less than UO‘b‘l) on the fundanu-ntal interval itself, which is
 quite out of the question, the probable error of observation on
 this interval being of the order of 0°‘01 only. The correct
 way of treating the observations would be to calculate the
 values at the <U+FB01>xed points separately, and to use the remainder
 of the observations for calculating the di<U+FB01>'erence-coe<U+FB01>icient.
 Even here the graphic method is preferable to that of least
 squares, because it is not easy to decide on the appropriate
 weights to be attached to the ditferent observations. Cor
 recting the method of calculation in this manner, we should
 find a series of ditfcrences between my observations and
 Dickson’s formula, of the order shown in Table I. It would
 be at once obvious that the deviations from           were of a
 systematic type, and that it did not represent the results of
 this series ofobservations so well as that which I proposed.
 The deviations shown in Dickson’s own table are of a syste
 matic character; but they would have been larger if he had
 treated the <U+FB01>xed points correctly.
    Limitations of the Dij/‘krence-Formula.——The observations
of Messrs. Heycock and Neville at high temperatures may be
taken as showing that the simple parabolic difference-formula,
in which the value of d is determined by means of the S.B.P.
method, gives very satisfactory results, in spite of the severe
extrapolation to which it is thus subjected, provided that the
wire employed is of pure and uniform quality. If, however,
the S.B.P. method of reduction is applied in the case of impure
wires at high temperatures, it may lead to differences which
are larger than the original differences in the values of pt
before reduction. For instance, I made a number of pyro
meters some years ago with a sample of wire having the
coef<U+FB01>cients 0:003:20, d”=l'75. My observations on the
freezing—points of silver and gold (Phil. Mag., Feb. 1892)
were made with some of these pyrometers.       All these instru- ,
mcnts gave very consistent results, but they could not be
brought into exact agreement with those constructed of purer
wire b ' the simple S.B.P. method of reduction, employ
ing eit er difference-formula (2) or          This is not at all

      Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.           209
surprising when we consider the very large difference in the
fundamental coef<U+FB01>cient 0, which is approximately '00390 in
the case of the purest obtainable wire. The remarkable fact
is that, as stated in my original paper (see above, p. 195), the
values of pt for such different specimens of wire should show
so close an agreement through so wide a range. The differ
ence in the fundamental coef<U+FB01>cients in this extreme ca se i sabout
20 per cent.; but the values ofpt for the two wires differ by only
4° at the S.B.P., and this difference, instead of increasing in
proportion to the square of the temperature, remains of the
same order, or nearly so, at the freezing-points of silver and
gold. Thus the wire c='00320 gave pt=830° at the
Ag. F.P., but I shortly afterwards obtained with a specimen
of very pure wire (c='003897), the value pt=835° for the
same point. Messrs. Heycock and Neville, using the same
pure wire, have con<U+FB01>rmed this value. They also <U+FB01>nd for the
F.P. of gold, with different instruments, constructed of the ‘
same wire, the average value pt=905°'8. I did not test this
point with the pure wire, but the value found by Messrs.
Heycock and Neville may be compared with the value
pt=902°'3 (Phil. Mag, Feb. 1892), which I found at the
Mint with one of the old instruments.
    From these and other comparisons of the platinum scales vof
 different wires, it appears likely that the deviation of the
 impure wire from the parabolic curve is generally of this
 nature. As shown by the comparison curves in my original
 paper, the deviation follows approximately the parabolic law
 up to 400°, beyond that point the curves tend to become
 parallel, and at higher temperatures they often show a
 tendency to approach each other again. The application of
 the S.B.P. method of reduction to impure wires at high
 temperatures will therefore give results which are too high,
 because the value of d is calculated from the S.B.P., where
 the difference between the wires is nearly a maximum. Thus,
 taking the values of d from the S.B.P. for the two specimens
 of wire above quoted, we <U+FB01>nd, calculating the values of t for
the Ag.F.P., and Au.F.P. from the data,
    Impure wire, c='00320, d= 1'751 ;
         Ag. F.P., t=981'6; Au. F.P., t=1092'0.
    Pure wire, c='00390, d=1'520 ;
         Ag. F.P., t=960°7 ; Au. F.P., t==1060'7.
 The results for the impure wire obtained by the S.B.P. method
of reduction are not so high as those found by Barns with a
 Pt-Ptlr thermo-element, which he compared with an air
 thermometer up to 1050°. - There can be little doubt,

210      Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
however, that they are too high, and that the results'given
by the pure wire are the more probable. The latter are
approximately a mean between the values of Violle 954°, and
Holborn and Wien 971°, and may be taken, in the pre
sent state of the science of high-tem erature measurement,
to be at least as probable as an 0t er values, in spite of
the extrapolation from 445°, by which they are obtained.
   The extrapolation is not really so unreasonable as many
observers seem to think. The parabolic formula for resistance
variation has been veri<U+FB01>ed for a great variety of cases, through
a very wide range, and with much greater accuracy than in
the case of many so-called laws of nature. For instance, a
 similar formula, proposed by Tait and Avernarius, is often
regarded as the law of the thermocouple, but the deviations
of thermocouples from this law are far wider than those of the
most impure platinum thermometer. If we take a Pt-PtRh
thermocouple, and apply the S.B.P. method of reduction in
the same manner as in the case of a platinum thermometer,
taking the data, i=100°, e=650 microvolts; t=445°, e:
 3630 mv. ; we should <U+FB01>nd d: —7'4.            At t= 1000°O., e: 9550
mv., the temperature on the scale of the thermocouple is
et:1470°.         The temperature calculated by the parabolic
formula is t=801°. Whence it will be seen that the devia
tion from the formula is about ten times as great as in the
case of a very impure platinum wire.             A cubic formula was
employed by Holborn and Wien to represent their observations
at high temperatures with this thermocouple, but even this
formula differs by more than 20° from their observations at
150° C. It is, moreover, so unsatisfactory for extrapolation
that they preferred to adopt a rectilinear formula for deducing
temperatures above 12000 C.
    There are, however, more serious objections to the adoption
 of the thermocouple, except to a limited extent, as a secondary
 standard :—(1) The scale of the thermocouple is seriously
 affected, as shown by the observations of Holborn and Wien
 and Barns at high temperatures, and of Fleming at low
 temperatures, by variations in the quality of the platinum
 wire and in the composition of the alloy.                (2) The sen
 sitiveness of the Pt—PtBh thermocouple at moderate
 temperatures is too small to permit of the attainment of
 the order of accuracy generally required in standard work.
 (3) No satisfactory method has yet been devised in the case
 of the thermocouple for eliminating residual thermal etfects
 in other parts of the circuit, which materially limit* the
   as My present assistants, Prof. A. W. Porter, B.Sc., and Mr. N. Eumor
 fopoulcs, B.Sc., whose work on Emissivit and Thermal Conductivity has
 already in part been published in th1s    ournal, employed this thermo

         Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermonwtry.                211
   attainable accuracy. In the case of the platinum thermo
   meter these etfects are relatively much smaller, owing to the
   large change of resistance with temperature, and can be
   completely eliminated in a very simple manner.
      Ag. F.P. life<U+FB02>zod of Reduction for Impure Wires—The
   simplest method of reduction for such wires at high tempera
   tures, would be to take the Ag. F.P. as a secondary <U+FB01>xed
   point instead of the S.B.P. for the determination of the
   difference-coef<U+FB01>cient d. This would in general lead to a very
   close agreement at temperatures between 800° and 1200°C.,
   but would leave residual errors of 3° or 4° at temperatures in
- the neighbourhood of the S.B.P. To obtain a continuous
   formula giving results consistent to within less than 1°
   throughout the range, it would be necessary to adopt the
   method which I suggested in my last communication (Phil.
   Mag, Feb. 1892), assuming d to be a linear function of the
   temperature of the form a+bt, and calculating the values of
   a and b to make the instrument agree with the pure wire at
   both the S.B.P. and the Ag. F.P., taking the latter as 960°‘7.
   We should <U+FB01>nd for the Wire (c=‘00320) above quoted, d=
   1‘580 at the Ag. F.P. Ifwe apply this value at the Au. F.P.,
   we should <U+FB01>nd t=1063°'0. But if we employ the second
   method, and calculate a linear formula for d to make the
   results agree throughout the scale, taking at: 1'751 at the
   S.B.P., we obtain d=a+bt=1'898—-'000531t.                       Hence
   the appropriate value of d to use at the Au. F.P. would be
  d=l'547, giving for the Au. F.P. t=1060°'0, which is in
   closer agreement with the value 1060°'7 given by the pure
  wire.      This method has also the advantage that it gives
  practically perfect agreement at the S.B.P., and at all points
  between 0° and 10000. In the case of the mercury thermo
  meter, or the thermocouple, a similar cubic formula is required
  to give an equally good agreement between 0° and 200° C.
     In the original paper in which the suggestion was made, I
 couple very extensively in their investigations. They inform me that
 they were compelled to abandon the method shortly before my appoint
 ment, because in spite of every precaution which their experience could
 suggest they found it impossible, owing to these residual thermal effects,
  to effect a suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate calibration of the Pt—PtRh thermo
 couple at temperatures between 0° and 100° C.        The substitution of
 baser metals such as iron and german-silver at low temperatures would
 no doubt partly meet this dif<U+FB01>culty, but would involve the abandonment
 of the wide range and constancy and uniformity of scale characteristic of
 the platinum metals, which are quali<U+FB01>cations so essential for a standard.
 We conclude on these grounds that the application of this thermo
 couple is limited to high temperatures, and that the contention that it is
   referable to the platinum thermometer as a secondary standard cannot
   e maintained.

 2122     Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
 assumed tentatively a much lower value t=945° for the Ag.
 F.P., giving a result i=1037° for the Au. F.P., which
 naturally does not agree with the results of subsequent work.
 These results have since been misquoted in a manner which
 has the etl'eet ot' suggesting that the platinum thermometer
 gives very capricious results at high temperatures. Holborn
 and Wien, for instance, quote my value 981°‘6 for the Ag.
 F.P., obtained with the impure wire by the S.B.P. method
 of reduction, and at the same time quote the value 1037°
 for the Au. F.P., which was obtained by assuming the value
 945° for the Ag. RP. Comparing these with the values
 obtained by Heycoek and Neville with the pure wire, one
 might naturally conclude, in the absence of information as to
 the manner in which the two results were calculated, that
 (litterent wires gave very inconsistent results. The truth is, on
 the contrary, that very ditt'erent wires agree with remarkable
 uniformity in giving approximately the same platinum-scale,
 and that they also give consistent values of t provided that the
 reduction is effected in a consistent manner. But, although
 it is evident that this method may be- made to give consistent
 results in the case of impure wires, it is in all cases preferable
 to use pure wire of unit'orm quality. If, for instance, apyro
 meter gives a value of 0 less than '0035, or a value of d
 greater than 1'70, it would be safer to reject it, although it
may possibly give very consistent results. Values of d greater
than 2'00 at the S.B.P. sometimes occur, but may generally
be taken as implying that the wire is contaminated. Such
instruments as a rule deteriorate rapidly, and do not give
consistent results at high temperatures.                     '
    The Difference- Formula at Low Temperatures—The suita
bility of the Platinum thermometer as an instrument for low
temperature research is shown by the work of Dewar and
Fleming, and Olszcwski. It has also been adopted by Holborn
and Wien, in spite of their original prejudice against the
instrument. The <U+FB01>rst veri<U+FB01>cation of the platinum scale at
very low temperatures was given by Dewar and Fleming,
whose researches by this method are the most extensive and
important. They found that two di<U+FB02>'erent specimens of wire
with fundamental eoe<U+FB02>ieients c='00353,                and c='OO367
respectively, agreed very closely in giving the same values of
the platinum temperature down to —220°. The values of
the ditlerence-eoet’ticients for these wires, calculated by
assuming t= — 182o'5 for the boiling-point of liquid oxygen,
are d=2'75 * and d=2'72, respectively. The <U+FB01>rst of these
refers to the particular wire which Dewar and Fleming
selected as their standard.

the third column. The fourth column contains the correspond

the method of di<U+FB02>'erences. The <U+FB01>fth column contains the

   The above table affords a good illustration of the point
already mentioned, that the results obtained from the two
di<U+FB02>'erence-formulw (D) and (D’) agree so closely over a limited
range, as in the present case, that it is often quite immaterial
which of the two is used for purposes of reduction. The
largest di<U+FB02>'erence over the experimental range in the present
instance is only 0°‘3, which is less than many of the errors of
observation, except at the <U+FB01>xed points and under the most
favourable conditions. In comparing the two formulae the
following expression for the difference between them is
occasionally useful :—
   D—D’=t—t'=dD(2pt+D— 100)/10,000+ (d/d'- 1)D’.

      Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.           215
It is generally suf<U+FB01>cient to put D=D' on the right-hand side
of this formula, so that if either is known the difference
between them maybe determined with considerable accuracy.
   It will be observed that the table of reduction given by
Dickson agrees very closely with either of the difference
formulae. But, on the whole, most closely with                   If
Dickson had calculated his formula from the same data it
would have given results identical-with (D'). By giving
equal weight, however, to all the observations, without regard
to steadiness of temperature or probable accuracy, he is com
pelled, as in the previous instance, to admit an error of 00'35
in the fundamental interval itself, which is quite impossible.
Except at these points the probable error of his reduction is
not of vital importance ; on the contrary, the general agree
ment with (D) is so close that it is dif<U+FB01>cult to see on what
grounds he can regard the latter as being either incorrect or
inadequate.
   For practical purposes a 'table of this kind is not convenient
owing to the continual necessity for interpolation. A graphic
chart in which t is plotted directly against pt is objectionable,
because it does not admit of suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy unless it is
plotted on an unwieldy scale. The difference-curve avoids
this dif<U+FB01>culty, and is much to be preferred for laboratory work.
But for occasional reduction it is so easy to calculate the
difference directly from the formula that it is not worth while
to take the trouble to plot a curve.
   Reduction of Olszewslcz"s Observations—The observations
of Olszewski on the critical pressure and temperature and
boiling-point of hydrogen, described in the Phil. Mag. for
Jul 1895, were made with a platinum thermometer of '00].
inc wire wound on a mica frame in the usual manner. He
graduated this thermometer by direct comparison with a
constant-volume hydrogen thermometer at the lowest tem
peratures which he could obtain by means of liquid oxygen
boiling under diminished pressure. The lower temperatures,
 observed with the thermometer immersed in temporarily
lique<U+FB01>ed hydrogen, were deduced from the observed resist—
ances by rectilinear extrapolation, assuming that the resistance
 of the platinum thermometer continued to decrease, as the
temperature fell, at the same rate as over the lowest tempe
 rature interval, —182'5 t0 —208'5, included in the range of
 the comparison with the hydrogen thermometer.           It is pos
 sible that, at these low temperatures, the resistance of platinum
 does not continue to follow the usual formula, but it may be
 interesting to give a reduction of his observations by the
 di<U+FB02>‘erence method for the sake of uniformity of expression.

216      Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
   We select for this purpose the following data :—
              Thermometer in Melting Ice,
                    R/R°= 1'000,        t=O° C.
              Thermometer in solid CO, at 760 mm.,
                    R/R°='800,         t= —78'2° C.
              Thermometer in Liquid 0, at 760 mm.,
                    R/R°=-523,          t= —182°-5 c.
 From these we deduce the following values of the coef<U+FB01>cients :—
   a='002515, b= --000,000,53, c='002462, at: 2-13,
                              pt°=406°'2.
 As a veri<U+FB01>cation we have the observation R/R°='453, at
 t: —208°'5 C. This gives pt= —222'2, D=l3°'7_. which
 agrees with the value given by the difference-formula calcu
 lated from the three higher points.
    The following Table gives the reduction of the observations
 taken with this thermometer in partially liquid hydrogen.

     The effect of this change in the method of reduction is to
  make the temperature of the boiling-point of hydrogen nearly
  one degree higher than the value given by'Olszewski. If we
  em loy instead the difference-formula in terms of pt, we should
  <U+FB01>n c'=‘002472,pt°=404°'5, (l’=1'85. This formula leads
  to tlllle values given in the column headed t', which are a little
  hi er.
       he value found by Dewar for liquid hydrogen (Proc. R. S.
  Dec. 16, 1898) is much higher, namely =—238°'8 at one
  atmo, and ~2390'6" at 1/30th atmo. The difference may
  possibly be due to the superheating of the liquid, or, more
  probably, to some singularity in the behaviour of his thermo
  meter at this point (see below, p. 218).

       Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.             217
hydrogen and platinum thermometers, adopting my method
of enclosing the spiral inside the bulb of the air-thermometer.
The majority of their observations were taken while the tem
perature of the instrument was slowly rising. This method
of procedure is very simple, but it is open to the objection
that the mean temperature of the spiral is not necessarily
the same as that of the gas enclosed, especially when, as in
their apparatus, the spiral is asymmetrically situated in an
asymmetrical bulb. If we take their observations in melting
ice, in solid CO2, and in liquid air, which are probably in this
respect the most reliable, and calculate a difference-formula
in terms of pt, we shall <U+FB01>nd c'='003621, d'=1'69.              Calcu
lating the values of t' by this formula, we <U+FB01>nd that all the
rest of their observations make the temperature of the plati
num spiral on the average 1° higher than that of the gas.
This might be expected, as the temperature was not steady,
and the warmer gas would settle at the top of the bulb, the
spiral itself being also a source of heat.
    If we take their own formula, and calculate the equivalent
difference-formula, we <U+FB01>nd 0' = '003610, d’= 1'79. This agrees
fairly well with the values found above, as they appear also
to have attached greater weight to the observations in CO,
and liquid air. But, if we take the formula calculated by
Dickson (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1897), who attaches equal weight
to all their observations, we <U+FB01>nd c'='003527, d'=2'43. The
excessive difference in the values of the coef<U+FB01>cients deduced
by this assumption is an index of the inconsistency of the
observations themselves‘.
   Behaviour of Pure Wire at Low Temperatures.—In the
case of ordinary platinum wire, with a coef<U+FB01>cient c='0035 or
less, the effect of the curvature at low temperatures of the
t, R, curve, as represented by the positive value of the dif
ference-coef<U+FB01>cient d, is to make the resistance diminish more
rapidly as the temperature falls, and tend to vanish at a point
nearer to the absolute zero than the fundamental zero of
the wire itself. When, however, the value of pt° is numeri
cally less than 273°, the effect of this curvature would be to
make the resistance vanish at some temperature higher than
the absolute zero. If, therefore, we may assume that the
resistance ought not to vanish before the absolute zero, we
should expect to <U+FB01>nd a singular point, or a change in sign of
the di<U+FB02>'erence-coeflicient, at low temperatures. If this were
the case, it would seriously invalidate the difference-formula
method of reduction, at least at low temperatures, and as
   * Contrast the close agreement of Dickson’s reduction in the case of
Fleming’s observations.

218     Prof. H. L. Callendar on Platinum Thermometry.
applied to wires for which pt° was numerically less than
273°. ‘thn, therefore, I succeeded in obtaining in 1892 a
very pure specimen of wire, with the coef<U+FB01>cient c='00389,
pt°=257°, I quite expected to <U+FB01>nd it behave like iron and
tin, with the opposite curvature to the im ure platinum, and
a negative value for the coef<U+FB01>cient d. 8n testing it at the
S.B.P. and also at the Ag.F.P. I found, on the contrary, that
it gave a value (l=+1'50, and that its scale agreed very
closely with that of all the other platinum wires I had tested,
at least at temperatures above 0° C.         I sent a specimen to
Prof. Fleming shortly afterwards and he used it as the
“ working thermometer P, ” in his researches on the thermo
electric properties of metals at low temperatures. The test
of this wire is given by Fleming in the Phil. Mag. July
1895, p. 101, from which the following details are extracted:—
       c='003885,pt°=257°'4. 002 B.P.,pt= —81°'3.
                        O.B.P., pt= —193°'3.
Assuming t=—182°'5 at the O.B.P., we have d=+2'10,
which gives t=—78"'4 for the temperature of solid 00;.
The value of the difference-coef<U+FB01>cient, so far from vanishing
or changing sign, appears to be actually greater at very low
temperatures. According to this formula, the resistance of
the wire tends to vanish at a temperature t°= -—240°'2, cor
 responding to pt°= ——257°'4. It seems not unlikely, however,
according to the observations of Dewar, that the resistance,
instead of completely vanishing at this temperature, which is
 close to the boiling-point of hydrogen, ceases to diminish
 rapidly just before reachiu this point, and remains at a small
 but nearly constant value, aiout 2 per cent. of its value at 0° 0.
    Application of the Daference-Formula t0 the case of other
 Metals.—The application of the difference-formula is not
 limited to the case of platinum.      It affords a very convenient
 method of reduction of observations on the resistance-varia
 tion of other metals. I employed it for this purpose in the
 comparison of platinum and iron wires *, as a means of veri
 fying the suitability of the parabolic formula for the expres
 sion of variation of resistance with temperature.      Thus, if the
 symbol ft stands for the temperature by an iron-wire thermo
  meter, de<U+FB01>ned by formula (l), in exactly the same manner
  as the platinum temperature, and if d and d’ stand for the
  difference-coef<U+FB01>cients of platinum and iron respectively, as
  suming that both wires are at the same temperature t, we
  have clearly the relation
                      ft "Pt= (d-d’) MW)

    As an illustration of the convenience of this method of re
duction a table is appended giving the values of the constants
at low temperatures for the specimens tested by Dewar and
Fleming.       The data assumed in each case are (1) the value
of the fundamental coef<U+FB01>cient a given in the <U+FB01>rst column, and
(2) the value of the temperature of the O.B.P. on the scale
of each particular metal, calculated from the observed re
sistance by formula (1), and given in the third column. The
value of the difference-coef<U+FB01>cient d° for each metal as deduced
from the O.B.P. is found at once by the relation
                       d°=(—pt—182'5)/5'16.
The sign of this coef<U+FB01>cient indicates the direction of the cur
vature of the temperature-resistance curve, and its magnitude
is approximately proportional to the average relative curvature
over the experimental range.
    The values of the coef<U+FB01>cients a and b, given in the last two
columns, are readily calculated from those of c and d by
means of the relations already given (p. 199). These co
ef<U+FB01>cients refer to the equivalent resistance - formula (3),
and are useful for calculating the speci<U+FB01>c resistance at any
temperature.
    In comparing the values of (1°, given in this table, with
those deduced from observations'at higher temperatures, it
 will be noticed that they are in most cases algebraically
 greater, the difference amounting to nearly 30 per cent. in
man cases between the values deduced from the O.B.P. and
 the g.B.P. respectively.       It is possible that this indicates a
 general departure from the exact parabola requiring further
experiments for its elucidation. It would be unsafe, however,
 to infer from the results of the present investigation that this
 is always the case, because, owing to the construction of the
 coils with silk and ebonite insulation, it was impossible to
 test the wires directly in sulphur, and they could not be
 annealed after winding at a higher temperature than 200°.
 It is well known that annealing produces a marked effect on
 the form of the curve and on the value of d *. It is also stated
 in the paper that trouble was experienced from thermoelectric
 disturbances, owing to the use of thick copper leads 4 mm.
 in diameter. Such effects cannot be satisfactorily eliminated
except by the employment of a special method of compensa
    * With reference to this point it is interesting to remark that Messrs.
 Heycock and Neville with one of their gerfectly annealed pyrometers of
 pure Wire, for wind.) c='00387, d=1'4 7, found the value pt: —80°'3,
 t= —78°'2 0., for the 002 BR This would perhaps indicate that the
 larger values of d were due to imperfect annealing.

The general result of any residual thermal effects which may
be present is to produce a change in the apparent value of (1,
since the thermo-E.M.F. follows approximately a parabolic
formula. It is possible, for this reason, to obtain consistent
and accurate measurements of temperature with a platinum
thermometer in spite of large thermal effects, but the value of
d would be very considerably affected.
    On the “ Vanishing Temperature.”—There a pears to be a
very general consensus of opinion, based chie y on the par
ticular series of experiments which are under discussion, that
the resistance of all pure metals on ht to vanish, and does
tend to vanish at a temperature which is no other than the
absolute zero.    If, however, there is any virtue in the para
bolic method of reduction, it is quite obvious, on reference to
the column headed “ Vanishing Temperature” in the above
 table, that the resistance “tends to vanish” in the case of
 most of the common metals at a much higher temperature.
 The vanishing temperature t° is the value of t deduced from
 the fundamental zero pt° in each case by means of the
 difference-formula, employing the value of 613° given in the
 table. The most remarkable metals in this respect are pure
 copper and iron, which tend to become perfect conductors at
 a temperature of —223° approximately, a point which is now
 well within the experimental range. These are followed at a
 very short interval by aluminium, nickel, and magnesium.
 In the case of copper and iron special experiments were made
 at a temperature as low as —206° 0., at which point the
 rate of decrease of resistance showed little, if any, sign of
 diminution.     The exact value of the vanishing temperature
 in each case is necessarily somewhat uncertain owing to the
 necessity of extrapolation, and also on account of possible
  uncertainties in the data; but there can be no doubt that the
  conclusion derived from the formula represents, at least a -
  proximately, a genuine physical fact. Whether or no t e
  resistance does actually vanish at some such temperature may
  well be open to doubt. It would require very accurate ob
  servations to determine such a point satisfactorily, as the ex
  perimental dif<U+FB01>culties are considerable in measuring so small
  a resistance under such conditions. It is more probable that
  there is a singular point on the curve, similar to that occur
  ring in the case of iron at the critical temperature, at which
  it ceases to be magnetic. It is also likely that the change
  would not be sudden, but gradual, and that indications of the
  approaching singularity would be obtained a few degrees
  above the point in question. Below this point it is even pos

222        Messrs. Rosa and Smith on a Calorimetric
sible that the resistance might not tend to vanish, but, as in
the case apparently of bismuth, might increase with further
fall of temperature. It has been suggested that at very low
temperatures all metals might become magnetic. It is very
probable that the change of electrical structure here indicated
would be accompanied by remarkable changes in the magnetic
pro erties. These are some of the points which experiment
wil probably decide in the near future. The only experi
mental veri<U+FB01>cation at present available is the observation of
Dewar in the case of platinum No. 3 when immersed in
boiling hydrogen at —240° C., that the resistance after at
taining a very low value ap arently refused to diminish
further, in spite of a considera le lowering of the pressure.
It would be extremely interesting to repeat this observation
with specially constructed thermometers of copper or iron,
which ought to show the effect in a more striking manner
and at a higher temperature.

 XIV. A Calorimetric Determination of Energy Dissipated in
 Condensers. By EDWARD B. Ross and ARTHUR W. SMITH*.
 IN a former paper (supra, p. 19) we gave the results of mea
     surements by means of a wattmeter of the energy dissipated
in condensers when they were subjected to an alternating
electromotive force. The results were such that we desired
to con<U+FB01>rm them by a totally independent method: and, in
addition, to measure the energy dissipated in some paraf<U+FB01>ned
paper condensers which showed so small a loss that with the
coils at our disposal the Resonance Method, employed success
 fully on beeswax and rosin condensers, would not give
suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate values. We therefore constructed a
 special calorimeter for the purpose of measuring the total
quantity of heat produced in the condensers, which represents
the total energy dissipated.
    Fig. 1 gives an external view of the calorimeter, and <U+FB01>g. 2
 a vertical section. The calorimeter proper, A, is the inner of
three concentric boxes, and is 33 cm. long, 30 cm. deep, and
 10 cm. in breadth. It has a copper lining, a, and a copper
jacket, b, and is protected by the two exterior boxes from
 <U+FB02>uctuations of temperature without.        The general principle
 of the calorimeter is (l) to prevent any loss or gain of heat

This, of course, will reduce the How of' heat through the inter

correction ” small, if not zero.

     1. To Eliminate the Cooling and Capacity Corrections.
   In order to ascertain any difference of temperature between
 the copper walls a and Z), a differential air-thermometer is
 used. Each air-chamber of this differential thermometer
 consists of a copper pipe about 4 metres long and 4 millim.
 internal diameter, one coiled about and soldered to the lining,

and the other coiled about and soldered to the jacket.    One
end of each pipe is closed and the other connected to one end
of the U-tube, G, shown on the outside of the calorimeter in
<U+FB01>g. 1. The U-tube, which we call the gauge, contains kero
sene oil, and serves to indicate any difference of temperature
between the two copper walls. The zero-mark is <U+FB01>xed after

maintaining the whole calorimeter at a constant temperature
for some hours. In order to keep the gauge reading sensibly
zero, and thus keep the two copper walls very closely at the
same temperature, a coil of wire through which an electric
current of any desired strength can be passed is wound about
the jacket in the space B. And in order to make the regulation
more perfect a second coil is wound about the second box in

     Determination of Energy Dissipated in Condensers.      225
the space 0, so as to maintain the temperature of this space
nearly constant. The temperature of the chamber A is
usually kept a little higher than the external temperature, so
that no cooling is required; and by varying the currents in
the two heating-coils the temperature in B can be made to
follow that in A so closely that the gauge-readings are always
small, and their algebraic sum during any experiment zero.
This eliminates all correction for radiation. In rare cases
when the temperature of the room has risen considerably, we
have found it necessary to hang a wet cloth about the box to
prevent the temperature of C rising above that of B and A.
We intend to coil a small copper pipe in C so that a stream of
cool water may be sent through it, and then no difficulty will
be encountered in the hottest weather.
    In addition to the gauge four thermometers (<U+FB01>g. 1) indicate
the temperatures of A, a, b, and C: that is, A’ shows the tem
 perature of the air in the calorimeter chamber A; a’ has its
bulb in a pocket of the lining a, and hence indicates the tem—
perature of the wall a; b’ similarly extends down into a
pocket of the copper jacket I), and shows its temperature.
 Finally, 0’ gives the temperature of the outer air-space C.
 A’ is an accurate thermometer reading from 20° to 25° (1.,
 graduated to 0°'Ol and read to 0°'001 C.      If A’ shows the
 temperature to be constant during the whole period of an
 experiment, or the same for a considerable time near the end
 of an experiment that it was at- the beginning, then there will
 be no correction for heat absorbed or given up by the appa
 ratus. With both the “cooling correction ” and the capacity
 correction eliminated, it remains to carry away and measure
 the entire heat generated by a condenser in A, or by any other
 source of heat within the calorimeter.
           2. Carrying away and Measuring the Heat.
     In order to carry away the heat generated a stream of
 water, which enters at 1 (<U+FB01>gs. 1 and 3), is made to <U+FB02>ow
 through a coiled copper pipe (<U+FB01>g. 3), where it absorbs heat,
 and then leaves the calorimeter at O. In order to increase its
 absorbing capacity the pipe is soldered to a sheet of copper,
  L L, both pipe and copper being painted black. Three such
  sheets, each with 4 metres of pipe attached, are joined
 together and placed side by side in the chamber A, the con
 densers being slipped in between them. The rate of absorption
 of heat depends upon the difference of temperature between
 the absorbers and the air surrounding them.         If a large

226        Messrs. Rosa and Smith on a Calorimetrio
amount of heat is to be brought away, the water is made to
enter at a low temperature and to <U+FB02>ow rapidly through the
absorbers.    If a smaller quantity of heat is to be absorbed
and carried away, the entering water will be warmer, and its
gain in temperature correspondingly less. By varying the
temperature of the water and its rate of <U+FB02>ow, the rate of
absorption can be varied between wide limits, and kept very
                             Fig. 3.
                                                         %%
nicely at any desired point. In practice the thermometer A’
is the guide in regulating the temperature of the entering
water. If the temperature of A begins to rise (A’, as already
stated, can be read to one-thousandth of a degree), the entering
water is slightly cooled; if to fall, it is slightly warmed; the
rate of flow of water, after being once adjusted for a given
experiment, is maintained constant.
   In order to measure the quantity of heat thus carried
away, the thermometers E and F are inserted in two small
reservoirs, M and N, which stand in the wooden wall of the
calorimeter between the two copper surfaces. The thermo
meter E indicates the tem erature of the water just as it
enters the chamber A, and t e thermometer F gives its tem
perature as it leaves. The difference of temperature multiplied

     Determination of Energy Dissipated in Condensers.       227
by the mass of water per second gives the rate of absorption
and removal of heat. The thermometers are accurately gra
duated and read to hundredths of a degree. The gain in
temperature is several degrees, and may be ten or twenty
degrees by increasing the quantity of heat generated or
reducing the rate of <U+FB02>ow of water.       Hence the accuracy of
the determination of the quantity of heat absorbed is suf<U+FB01>cient
for most purposes. The chief error is ordinarily due to
changes in the temperature of the apparatus itself and its
contents. By running the experiment several hours, however,
and keeping it as nearly as possible at a constant temperature,
this uncertainty is greatly reduced and the error made
negligibly small.
    The water <U+FB02>ows into the calorimeter from a reservoir about
a metre above, this height furnishing the necessary pressure.
The temperature of the entering water is regulated by adding
warm or cold water to the reservoir, and the rate of <U+FB02>ow of
the water is regulated by an adjustable valve. The water is
collected in a litre <U+FB02>ask, the time of each litre being recorded.
                   3. Test of the Calorimeter.
    Table I. shows the result of one of the tests made upon the
calorimeter.    A current of electricity passed through a coil
of wire within the chamber A, the electromotive force being
measured by a carefully calibrated Weston voltmeter, and
the current by a Kelvin balance.      The experiment continued
for a little more than four hours, while nine litres of water
  assed through the caterimeter. The rate of absorption of
heat was nearly, but not quite, constant, the temperature as
indicated by A’ having varied slightly. The <U+FB01>nal tempe
 rature was practically the same as that at the beginning, being
slightly higher if anything. The average for the nine litres
 is 1237 watts absorbed and carried away by the water, while
the electrical measurements give 1234 watts. By continuing
 the experiment longer and introducing greater re<U+FB01>nements in
 the measurement of the current and electromotive force, a
 greater degree of accuracy could undoubtedly be attained.
 But this and other tests showed clearly that for our present
 purposes the calorimeter was abundantly accurate, and we
 proceeded to put some condensers into it and measure the heat
 evolved.

        Table II. (p. 230) gives the results of six experiments with
    the same beeswax and resin condensers which were employed
    in our work by the resonance method. In each experiment a
    preliminary run, not included in the table, allows the condensers
    and calorimeter to come to a constant temperature.                             Column
    ((1) gives the numbers of the condensers in each case, they all
    being joined in parallel to the same electromotive force.
    Column (1)) gives the time of the beginning of each litre of
    water; column (0) the duration of each litre or 1000 grammes
    of water; column (d) the average temperature of the ingoing
    water as found from readings of the thermometer E, taken
    regularly every <U+FB01>ve minutes, and column (6) the same for the
    outgoing water; (f) then shows the increase of temperature.
    Column (g) gives the number of calories of heat carried away
    by each 1000 grammes of water, and column (h), which is the
    number in (g) divided by the corresponding number of seconds
    gives

This is the value derived from Rowland’s and Grif<U+FB01>ths’s work.
assumin the speci<U+FB01>c heat of water at an average temperature
 of 20° . to be unity. Column (j) gives the frequency.
 Sometimes this was estimated from the average frequency of
the dynamo supplying the lines of the Middletown lighting
circuits at the time; and in other cases it was determined by
measuring the speed of a small synchronous motor. The
electromotive force (It) was measured with an electrometer, the
current (I) with a Siemens dynamometer. Column             gives
the values of cos ¢ of the expression power=EI cos 4). Care
 was taken in every instance to avoid the presence of upper
harmonics, in some cases using a resonance-coil to quench the
harmonics as well as increase the voltage on the condenser.
Column (0) gives the per cent. less, 100w cot qb, and column
(p) the net ef<U+FB01>ciency. This relative loss, 7r cot d>, has been
proved* to be the ratio of w to W, where w is the energy
dissipated per half-period, and W is the energy stored in the
condenser at each charge. 1—1r cot qb, the net ef<U+FB01>ciency, is

               5. Beeswax and Rosin Condensers.
   The <U+FB01>rst experiment, with condensers Nos. 3, 4, and 7,
showed a. net ef<U+FB01>ciency of 93°39 per cent., or a loss of 6'61
per cent. The temperature of the condensers was not deter
mined; but from the fact that the dielectric was softened and
the quantity of heat generated was more than in any sue
ceeding experiment, we feel sure that it was considerably
above 40° C. Six condensers were then placed in the calori
meter, joined in three pairs. Nos. 1 and 5 gave no sound
when joined to an alternating E.M.F. of 1000 or more volts,
and we called it the “ best pair.” In Nos. 3 and 4 vibrations
were distinctly felt when the <U+FB01>ngers were placed in contact
with them, while the condensers gave a clear musical note
and on the higher voltages a hissing sound; this we called
the “ poorest pair.” Nos. 8 and 9 were intermediate.
   These six condensers were <U+FB01>rst of all joined in parallel and
connected to a low-frequency circuit of 1520 volts and 26
periods per second.     Care was taken to exclude upper har
monics. The experiment continued over three hours after
the temperature of calorimeter and condensers had become

232          Messrs. Rosa and Smith on a Calorimelric
constant by a preliminary run of several hours. The tem
perature of the calorimeter as indicated by the thermometer
A’ rose gradually for an hour, and hence the heat absorbed
was less than the average. During the last hour the tempe
rature was reduced by quickening the rate of <U+FB02>ow and cooling
the entering water, so that the temperature was substantially
the same at the end as at the beginning. The per cent. of
loss is 4'84 at an average temperature of the condensers of
30° C. The voltage employed on this low-frequency test was
much higher than for any other experiment, and yet there
was no evidence of brush-discharge or appreciable leakage
current.
   In the third experiment the same condensers were subjected
to a high-frequency electromotive force at 30° (1., and the loss
found to be 5'06 per cent., that is, slightly greater than before.
Hence for a given voltage the energy dissipated per period
would be slightly greater, and the energy dissipated per second
more than <U+FB01>ve times as much as for the low frequency.
   In the fourth experiment only the “best pair” of con
densers was used, and with a slightly higher volts 0 the
temperature of the condensers rose to 40° C. Here t 0 loss
was found to be 837 per cent., nearly as much as the maximum
value found by the resonance method.
   The <U+FB01>fth experiment, with the “ best pair,” was made
some days later at 30° (3., and the percentage loss came out
6'35 per cent., that is greater than the average of the six. This
was unexpected, as well as the last result, which showed a loss
for condensers 3 and 4, the “ poorest pair,” of 4'82 per cent.,
which was less than the average. These results were then
con<U+FB01>rmed by an independent method, showing conclusively
that the so-called “poorest pair ” had the smallest loss; not,
of course, because it emitted a distinct sound and hissed on
high voltages, but in spite of that. The chief loss is doubtless
due to some cause quite independent of the singing and
hissing, and happens to be smaller where it would naturally
be expected to be larger.
   Thus we have con<U+FB01>rmed by these calorimetric measure
ments the large values of the losses which we found by the
resonance method in beeswax and rosin condensers, and also
the existence of a well-marked maximum as the temperature
rises, beyond which the loss decreases considerably. It is an
interesting fact that the residual charges of these condensers
are very large, that they increase with the temperature up to
40° 0., and then decrease as the temperature is carried
higher. That is, the maximum point for the residual charge is
the same as for the energy loss.

     Deternu'nation of Energy dissipated in Condensers.    233
                6. Parq<U+FB01>ned-Paper Condensers.
  The second lot of condensers used were commercial paraffined
paper condensers made by the Stanley Electric Co. A <U+FB01>nished
condenser is a solid slab about 25 x 30 cm. and 2 cm. thick,
thus having a volume of 1500 c. 0., and is enclosed in a tight
tin case, the lead-wires coming out through ebonite bushings.
Nos. 1 to 4 of our condensers have a capacity of about
1'7 microfarad each; Nos. 5 to 10, which were purchased
about a year later, have a capacity of about 3'2 microt'arads
each. The condensers of the second lot are made of paper
about '0038 cm. thick, two sheets being placed together in
each stratum. This we learned by dissecting some which we
had broken down. It ought to be stated, however, that
while the condensers are guaranteed by the makers to stand
500 volts alternating electromotive force, we have repeatedly
subjected them to 1000 to 2000 volts, and in some cases for
several hours at a time. Nos. 9 and 10 were upon one
occasion maintained at 2250 (effective) volts, at a frequency
of 130, for over an hour, and showed no signs of being over
taxed. We have, however, broken several at voltages between
1000 and 2000. The paper of the <U+FB01>rst lot of condensers is
thicker, but as we have never broken one of this lot we
cannot state its thickness. From the fact that the capacity
of each of these is about 60 per cent. as great as that of the
others, while their volumes are substantially the same, we
conclude that the thickness of the paper is about '0048 cm.,
supposing there are, as in the other, two sheets together in
every stratum of the condensers.
   In Table III. are given the results of seven separate expe
riments with Stanley condensers, which were made at intervals
during the past three months. The frequency in every case
except experiment 4 was estimated from the average frequency
of the two dynamos of the Middletown lighting circuits.
Experiments 1 and 3 were made when the faster dynamo was
supplying the lines, the others were with the s10wer dynamo.
All but No. 4, however, were with a relatively high frequency.
No. 4 was made using a two-pole rotary transformer, sup
plying it with direct current, and running it at a speed of
1600 per minute. The percentage losses (0) vary more among
the different condensers at the same frequency than one would
 ex ect.
   The percentage loss at the frequency 28 (Experiment 4) is
 '78 per cent., whereas at a frequency <U+FB01>ve times as great it is
 (Experiment       1'00 per cent. At 120 it is, as would be ex
pected, nearly as great as at 140; that is, it is '96 per cent.

 236          Prof. K. Pearson On certain Properties
 (Experiment 2).        Condenser No. 1, of the same lot, shows a.
loss of 1'45 per cent. at frequency 140, which is 45 per cent.
 greater loss than Nos. 3 and 4 give. Of the second lot, No. 6
 gives a large loss (Experiment 5), and other experiments
which one of us has made by other methods show that all the
other condensers of this lot have losses nearly the same as N0. 6,
excepting No. 10, which gives the smallest loss of any, '74 per
cent. in one case and '7 8 per cent. in another (Experiments 6
and 7).      Condenser No. 2 shows by other methods the same
 loss as 3 and 4.         Hence we have the following singular
 results :——All of the <U+FB01>rst lot except one have a loss of 10 per
 cent. on high frequencies, and the exceptional condenser has a
 loss of 1'45 per cent. All the condensers of the second lot have
 substantially the same losses, about 1'5 er cent., and the excep
 tional one is scarcely more than one half' as much as the others;
 the exceptional one of thc<U+FB01>rst lot having the same loss as all but
 one of the second. There is no possibility of a confusion of
numbers, for they were plainly stamped when purchased, and
the capacities of the <U+FB01>rst and second lots are very di<U+FB02>'erent, as
already stated.       Our experiments do not indicate the reason
for these large differences; but the existence of such differ
ences is fully con<U+FB01>rmed by measurements made by wholly
independent methods, and which will shortly be published.

 we see that our series is a hypergeometrical series of the type
 F(a, B, 'y, 1), or, as we shall denote it F1(u, 13,17), multiplied
 by a factor, which we may write A.
    If the successive terms of a hypergeometrical series be
 plotted up as ordinates at intervals 0, and the tops of these
 ordinates be joined, we obtain a great variety of polygons,
 which approximate to the interesting series of generalized
 probability-curves with which I have already dealt. The
 advantage of the hypergeometrical polygons over the curves
 consists in the knowledge as to the nature of the chance
 distribution indicated by the discovery of the actual values
 of p, g, n, and r. The curves, however, possess continuity
 and are easier of calculation. Clearly a knowledge of a, B,
 7, since 7 —-a—B—l=n, gives n, and hence g, r, and I).
    We shall <U+FB01>nd it convenient to write

     It is not, however, only in the question of distribution of
 frequency that hypergeometrical series may be of service ;
 it seems extremely probable that the three constants a, B, (y
 of F1 (on, B, y) may be of service in indicating close empirical
 approximations to physical laws, owing to the great variety
  of forms that the hypergeometrical polygon can take.
     Before we proceed to the <U+FB01>tting of hypergeometrical
 polygons to given data, we require to demonstrate one or two
  general propositions with regard to such <U+FB01>gures.
     2. On the moments qf F1(a, B, y).——Let A: the area
  of the polygon, thus if the ordinates are plotted at distance
 0, we have A=c >< F1. Let MA be the sth moment of
 the polygon about its centroid-vertical, the elements of area of
 the polygon being concentrated along the ordinates. Let v,A
 be the sth moment of the ordinates about a vertical parallel
 and at a distance a from the <U+FB01>rst ordinate, Le.

    Now let a new series of functions x0, 70, x,, &c. be
formed, so that

given on p. 77 of my memoir (Phil. Trans. vol. clxxxv.).
    Thus the determination of the successive moments of the
hypergeomctrical series F1 is thrown back on the discovery
of the X’s from the value F.
    3. To <U+FB01>nd the successive x’s.—The hypergeometrical series
is known to satisfy the differential equation                I

   The deviations are four positive and four negative, and
four above and four below their respective probable errors.
Thus the experimental results are in good accordance with
theory.
   Notwithstanding this, n has a large deviation from its
theoretical value when determined by moments. It is clearly
a quantity, when thus determined, liable to very large probable
error. Thus, while the problem is theoretically fully solved—
and it is dif<U+FB01>cult to believe that any other solution can have
less probable error—yet we meet, unless we take an immense
number of trials, with large variations in our estimate of the
number from which the drawing is made. I have tested this

one which is hardly likely to be of much service unless in the
case to which it is applied a very large amount of data is
available.

IF p denote the probability of an event, then the probability

   “Now it is known from Algebra that if m and n vary

value of the above term is when m/n is as nearly as possible
equal to p/q, so that m and n are as nearly as possible equal
to pp and pr] respectively. We say as nearlg as possible,
because ,up is not necessarily an integer, while 122 is. We
may denote the value of m by ap+z, where z is some proper

   vibrations.      If ,u. vibrations are combined, each of the same
   phase but of amplitudes which are at random either + 1 or — l,
   (5) represents the probability of %,u.+r of them being positive
   vibrations, and accordingly sa-r being negative. In this
   case, and in this case only, is the resultant + 2r. Hence if:
   represent the resultant, the chance of m, which is necessarily
   an eren integer, is

     The next greater resultant is (.v+2); so that when a: is
   great the above expression may be supposed to correspond to
   a range for .2: equal to 2. If we represent the range by dx,
   the chance of a resultant lying between .0 and .z‘ + da: is given by

 It depends upon a transition from an equation in <U+FB01>nite ditl'er
 enccs to the well-known equation for the conduction of heat
 and the use of one of Fourier’s solutions of the latter. Let
_/'(,u.,r) denote the chance that the number of events occurring
 (in the special application positire vibrations) is §p+r, so
 that the excess is 1‘. Suppose that each random combination
 of )1. receives two more random contributions—two in order that
 the whole number may remain even,—and inquire into the
 chance of a subsequent excess r, denoted b_vf(;i+2, r). The
 excess after the addition can only be r if previously it were
 r—l, r, or r+ 1. In the <U+FB01>rst case the excess becomes r by
 the occurrence of both of the two new events, of which the
 chance is 21. In the second case the excess remains r in
 consequence of one event happening and the other failing,
 of which the chance is A}; and in the third case the excess
 becomes 1' in consequence of the -t'ailure of both the new
 events, of which the chance is         Thus

     This is the well-known equation for the conduction of heat,
and the solution developed by Fourier is at once applicable.
The symbol ,u. corresponds to time and r to a linear co;
ordinate. The special condition is that initially—that is when
p. is relatively small—f must vanish for all values of 'r that are
not small. We take therefore

   In the general case when p and g are not limited to the
values g», it is more dif<U+FB01>cult to exhibit the argument in a
satisfactory form, because the most probable numbers of
occurrences and failures are no longer de<U+FB01>nite, or at any rate
simple, fractions of a.        But the general idea is substantially
the same. The excess of occurrences over the most probable
number is still denoted by r, and its probability by f(,u,, r).
We regard 'r as continuous, and we then suppose that a
increases by unity. If the event occurs, of which the chance
is p, the total number of occurrences is increased by unity.
But since the most probable number of occurrences is increased
by p, r undergoes only an increase measured by l—p or g.
In like manner if the event fails, 'r undergoes a decrease
measured by 10.       Accordingly

    G ENTLEMEN,
 IN your September number Dr. Lodge comments on my objection
          to the conclusiveness of the Michelson-Morley tether experi
ment, and I should like to point out that his remarks are founded
on a strange misconception of the nature of my objection. He
conjectures that I attribute the negative result of the Michelson
and Morley experiment “ to the possible second-order in<U+FB02>uence of
a hitherto neglected <U+FB01>rst-order tilting or shifting of the wave-fronts
brought about by the undiscovered drift of the aether past the
earth.” But in my communication 1 pointed out that my objection
was not of this nature, but related to the assumption made as to
the optical sensitiveness of the system of interference—fringes
relied on by the experimenters to enable them to measure the
minute length in question in their experiments. My contention
was simply that the system of fringes used in the experiment had
probably a more complex character than was supposed, and that
therefore its capability of measuring the small length accurately
was over-rated to an unknown extent. Evidently Dr. Lodge has
pondered so deeply on aberration problems that in reading my
paper his thought has got into so ne old groove which he has
unconsciously taken to be the direction of my argument.

    Postscript by Prof. LODGE.~I was not very clear about Mr.
Sutherland’s precise line of argument, nor am I new; but there
was an imaginary loophole which others might attempt to get
through, though Mr. Sutherland, as it now appears, did not; and
I took the opporlul'iity (not specially opportune as it turns out) of
indicating that it was closed.

XIX. On the Theory of the Conduction of Electricity through
   Gases by Charged Ions. By J. J. THOMSON, llLA., F.R.S.,
   Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics, Cambridge*.
Vl‘HE electrical conductivity possessed by gases under cer
      tain circumstances—as for example when Rontgen or
uranium rays pass through the gas, or when the gas is in a
vacuum-tube or in the neighbourhood of a piece of metal
heated to redness, or near a <U+FB02>ame or an are or spark-discharge,
or to a piece of metal illuminated by ultra-violet light—can be
regarded as due to the presence in the gas of charged ions,
the motions of these ions in the electric <U+FB01>eld constituting the
current.
   To investigate the distribution of the electric force through
the gas we have to take into account (1) the production of
the ions; this may either take place throughout the gas, or
else be con<U+FB01>ned to particular regions; (2) the recombina
tion of the ions, the positively charged ions combining with
the negatively charged ones to form an electrically neutral
system; (3) the merement of the ions under the electric
forces. We shall suppose in the subsequent investigations
that the velocity of an ion is proportional to the electric
intensity acting upon it. The velocity acquired by an ion
under a iven potential gradient has been measured at the
Cavendish Laboratory by several observers—in the case of
gases exposed to the Rontgen rays by Rutherford and
by Zeleny; for gases exposed to uranium radiation or to
                  *\‘ Communicated by the Author.

254        Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Theory of Conduction of
 ultra-violet light by Rutherford; for the ions in <U+FB02>ames by
 McClelland and H. A. Wilson; and for the ions in gases
near to incandescent metals or to the arc discharge by
 McClelland. ‘ The velocities in the different cases vary very
 much; the velocity of an ion in the same gas is much the
 same whether the conductivity is due to Rontgen rays,
 uranium rays, or ultra-violet light; it is much smaller when
 the conductivity is produced by an are or by incandescent
 metal. Thus the mean velocity of the positive and negative
 ions under a volt per centimetre in air exposed to Rtintgen
  rays was found by Rutherford to be about 1'6 cm./sec., while
  for gas drawn from the neighbourhood of an arc-discharge
  in carbonic acid the mean velocity of the positive and negative
  ions was found by McClelland to be only '0035 cm./sec.
     This di<U+FB01>'erence is caused by the ions acting as nuclei about
  which condensation, whether of the gas around them or of
  water-vapour present in the gas, takes place. The power
  of these ions to act as nuclei for the condensation of water
  vapour is strikingly shown by C. T. R. VVilson’s' experi
  ments on the effects of Bontgen and uranium radiation on
  the formation of clouds, and also by R. v. Helmholtz’sl’
  experiments on the effects produced by ions on a steam jet.
  If the size of the aggregation which forms round the ion
  depends on the circumstances under which the ion is liberated
  and the substances by which it is surrounded, the velocity
  which the ion acquires under a given potential gradient will
  also depend on these circumstances, the larger the mass of
  the aggregation the smaller will be this velocity. A remark
  able result of the determination of the velocities acquired by
  the ions under the electric <U+FB01>eld is that the velocity acquired by
  the negative ion under a given potential gradient is greater
   than (except in a few exceptional cases when it is equal to')
   the velocity acquired by the positive ion. Greatly as the
   velocities of the ions produced in different ways differ from
   each other, yet they all show this peculiarity. The relative
   velocities of the negative and positive ions differ very much
   in the different cases of conduction through gases; thus in
   the case of imperfectly dried hydrogen traversed by the
   Bontgen rays, Zeleny found that the speed of the negative
   ions was about 25 per cent. greater than that of the positive,
   while in the case of conduction through hot <U+FB02>ames H. A.
    \Vilson found that the velocity of the negative ion was 17 Or
    18 times that of the positive. In the case of the discharge
   through vacuum-tubes, the measurements which I made of

 the ratio of the charge to the mass for the particles con
 stituting the cathode rays and those of W. Wien* for the
 ions carrying the positive charge indicate that the ratio of
 the velocity of the negative ion to that of the positive one
 under the same potential gradient would be very lar o.
 This fact is, I think, suf<U+FB01>cient to account for most of t e
differences between the appearances at the. positive and nega
 tive electrodes in a vacuum-tube. Schuster (Proc. Roy. Soc.
 vol. xlvii. p. 526, 1890), from observations on the rates at which
 positively and negatively electri<U+FB01>ed bodies lost their charges
 in a vacuum-tube, came to the conclusion that the narrative
 ions di<U+FB01>'used more rapidly than the positive; other p eno-.
 mena connected with the discharge led me later (Phil. Mag.
 vol. xl. p. 51]., 1895) independently to the same result.
    We shall now proceed to <U+FB01>nd equations satis<U+FB01>ed by the
electric intensity in a gas containing charged ions. To simplify
 the analysis we shall suppose that the electric force is every
 where parallel to the axis of .z', and that if X is the value of
the electric intensity at a point, the velocity of the positive ion
at that point is le, and that of the negative ion in the
opposite direction k5X; we shall suppose that at this point the
number of positive ions per unit volume is ml, the number of
negative ions n, ; let 9 be the number of positive or negative
ions produced at this point in unit volume in unit time : the
number of collisions per unit time between the positive and
negative ions is proportional to nlnz. We shall suppose that
in a certain fraction of these collisions recombination between
the positive and negative ions takes place, so that a number
0mm, of positive and negative ions disappear in unit time
from unit volume in consequence of the recombination of the
ions. If e is the charge carried by each ion, the volume
density of the electri<U+FB01>cation is (111—112) e, hence we have

    It follows from this equation that Xl/Xo is greater than
 unity, and that the value of this ratio increases from unity to
 in<U+FB01>nity as B increases from zero to in<U+FB01>nity. We see that )3
 does not involve either q or 4.. So that, to take a particular
 case, when the gas between two plates is exposed to Rontgen
 rays, the ratio of the electric intensity at the plates to that
 midway between them is independent of the intenSIty of the
 radiation and of the current through the gas. The curves

258      Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Theory of Conduction of
giving the connexion between the electric intensity and the
distance between the plates are found by experiment to be
somewhat as represented in <U+FB01>g. 1. The variation in X (<U+FB01>g. 1) I

occurs only in two layers near the plates and X is approximately
constant in the rest of the <U+FB01>eld. As the current through the
gas increases the layers of inconstant X expand until they
touch, and then there is no longer a region in which X is
constant. We can easily <U+FB01>nd an inferior limit to the value
of 7t the thickness of' one of these layers when we are given
the value of the current. For suppose P (<U+FB01>g. 1) is at the
boundary of the layer next the positive electrode, then at P,
since X becomes constant, half the current must be carried
by the positive and half by the negative ions; if t is the
current and e the charge carried by an ion, then i/2e positive
ions must cross unit area of a plane through P in unit time,
so that at least that number must be produced in unit time in
the region between P and the positive plate. Now if 7t is
the thickness of the layer, qk is the number of positive ions
produced in unit time; the number that-cross the plane in
unit time cannot then be greater than q)», and will only be as
great as this if no recombination of the ions takes place;
hence

Thus i/2eg is an inferior limit to 7t. It will not,- however, I
think be very far from the true value, for we can show that
but little recombination will take place in the time taken by
the positive ions to traverse a layer of this thickness. For
the rate of combination of the positive ions is given by

   ceases to be an approximation to the truth when the two

   limiting value lge, and there is no loss of ions by recom
   bination ; we may therefore neglect the recombination and
   proceed as follows.

equation will give us the ratio of the velocities of the positive

    We see that a positive ion starting from the positive

reach this point simultaneously.
    If X0 is the minimum value of X, and E the distance of a

   A very convenient method of determining the velocities of
the ions, and one which can be employed in nearly every case
of conduction through gases, is to produce the ions in one
region and measure the electric intensity at two points in a
region where there is no production of ions, but to which ions
of one sign only can penetrate under the action of the
electric <U+FB01>eld. Thus let A, B represent two parallel plates
immersed in a as, and let us suppose that in the layer
between A and t e plane LM we produce a supply of ions,
whether by Rontgen rays, incandescent metals, ultra-violet
light, or by other means, and suppose that the gas between
LM and B is screened off from the action of the ionizer.
Then if A and B are connected to the poles of a battery a
current will pass through the gas, and this current in the
region between LM and B will be carried by ions of one
sign. These will be positive if A is the positive pole, nega
tive if it is the negative pole. Let us <U+FB01>nd the distribution
of electric intensity in the region between LM and B. Let
us suppose A is the positive plate, then all the ions in this
region are positive and we have, using the same notation as
before,

                         klnIXe = L,
where L is the current through unit area ; from these equations
we have

Hence if we measure the values of X at two points in
the region between LM and B, and also the value of i,
we can, from this equation, deduce the value of 1:1, and
hence the velocity of the positive ion in a known electric
<U+FB01>eld. To determine the velocity of the negative ion we
have only to perform a similar experiment with the plate A
negative.

sented by fig. 3, where A is the positive and B the negative
plate, and the velocity of the negative ion is supposed to be
much greater than that of the positive.
   The investigation of the distribution of electric intensity
given on p. 262 shows that when the velocity of the negative
ion is much greater than that of the positive, the distribution
of the intensity has many features in common with that
associated with the passage of electricity through a vacuum
tube, especially the great increase in electric intensity close
to the negative electrode. Thus this feature of the discharge
through vacuum-tubes can be explained by the greater
velocity of the negative ion than of the positive, a property
which seems to hold in all cases of discharge of electricity
through gases. And as the most important of the differences
between the phenomena at the two poles of a vacuum-tube
are direct consequences of the electric intensity at the cathode
far exceedin that at the anode, I think the most striking
features of t e discharge through vacuum-tubes are conse
quences of the di<U+FB01>erence in velocity between the positive and
negative ions. 111 the case discussed on p. 261 we assumed
q constant. i. e. that the ionization along the path of the
discharge was constant ; in the case of the discharge throu h
vacuum-tubes, where the ionization is due primarily to t e
electric <U+FB01>eld itself, it is unlikely that the ionization will be
constant when the <U+FB01>eld is so variable. We can derive
information as to the distribution of the ionization by a study
of the very valuable curves giving the distribution of electric
intensity in a vacuum-tube which we owe to the researches
of Graham (Wied. Ann. lxiv. p. 49, 1898).

sharp curvature with the curvature in the direction denoting
ionization, one, the most powerful one, just outside the
negative dark space, the other near the anode, While in the
positive light the curvature indicates recombination. It

ionization near the anode, in travelling towards the cathode,
met with the negative ions coming from the centre of
ionization near the cathode, that these positive ions combine
with the negative until their number is exhausted, and on
combining give out light, the region of recombination con
stituting the positive light. In the dark space between the
positive light and the negative glow these positive ions from
the centre of ionization near the anode are exhausted, so that
there are none of them left for the negative ions coming from
the centre near the cathode to combine with.
   The nick in the curve denoting the centre of ionization
near the cathode is present in all the curves given by
Graham; the centre near the anode is not nearly so per
sistent. In several of the curves given by Graham there is
no nick near the anode, though the one near the cathode is
well marked, and in these tubes there is no well-developed
positive light. The distribution of potential which accom
panies the luminous discharge requires a de<U+FB01>nite distribution
of electri<U+FB01>cation in the tube, this requires ionization and a
movement of the ions in the tube before the luminous dis
charge takes place. There must, therefore, be a kind of
quasi-discharge to prepare the way for the luminous one.
 Warburg (Wied. Ann. lxii. p. 385) has, in some cases, detected
a dark discharge before the luminous one passes. It seems
probable that such a discharge is not limited to the cases in
which it has already been detected, but is an invariable
preliminary to the luminous discharge.
   Besides the “ nicks ” or places of specially sharp curvature
<U+FB01>g. 4 shows that there is a small curvature in the direction
indicating an excess of ionization over recombination all
through the considerable space that intervenes between the
positive light and the negative glow; as this region is one far
away from places of great electric intensity it seems probable
that in producing ionization the electric intensity at any
point is helped by other agencies. The case of the cathode
rays shows that the motion of charged ions tends to ionize
the surrounding gas. E. Wiedemann, too, has shown that
the discharge generates a peculiar radiation, called by him
“ Entladungstrahlen”; it is possible that these may possess
the power of ionizing a gas through which they pass.

                   By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND '.
r ‘O explain the results of his experiments on cathode rays,
       and to account for the Hertz-Lenard apparent passage
of cathode rays through solid bodies according to Lenard’s
wonderfully simple law, J. J. Thomson (Phil. Mag. [5]
xliv., Oct. 1897) proposes the hypothesis, that the matter in
the cathode stream consists of atoms resolved into particles
of that primitive substance out of which atoms have been
supposed to be composed.             Before a theory of such
momentous importance should be entertained, it is necessary
to examine whether the facts to be explained by it are not
better accounted for by the logical development of established
or widely accepted principles of electrical science.
    The chief facts which Thomson arrives at from his experi
ments are :—That the cathode rays travel at the same speed
in diEerent gases such as hydrogen, air, and carbonic dioxide;
and that m/e, the ratio of the mass of the particles to their
charge, is the same for the cathode streams in all gases, and
 is about 10"“ of the ratio of the mass of the hydrogen atom
to its charge in ordinary electrolysis. These seeming facts
 have also been brought out with great distinctness in the
 ex eriments of Kaufmann (Wied. Ann. lxi. and lxii.).
 W atever proves to be the right theory of the nature of the
 cathode rays, the quantitative results which these experi
 menters have obtained (as did also Lenard), in a region,
 where, amid a bewildering wealth of qualitative work, the
 quantitative appeared as if unattainable, must constitute a
 <U+FB01>rm stretch of the roadway to the truth.
    Let us brie<U+FB02>y consider the theories used by J. J. Thomson
 and by Kaufmann to interpret their experiments. Forinstance,
 Thomson considers N particles projected from the cathode,
 each of mass m, to strike a thermopile, to which they give up
 their kinetic energy éva” measured as W. Each of the
   articles carries its charge of electricity e, the whole quantity
 <U+FB01>le being measured as Q. Thus we have
                           wm/FW/Q. . . . . . . (1)
 But again, the particles, after being projected through a slit
 in the anode with velocity v, are subjected to a <U+FB01>eld H of
 magnetic force at right angles to the direction of motion, so
 that the actual force tending to de<U+FB02>ect each particle is Hev
 at right angles to H and v. The result is that each particle
 describes a circular path of radius p with the centrifugal

force mv’/p equal to Hev, and therefore our second equation
is
                          vm/e=Hp. . . . . . . . (2)
By measuring W/Q and Hp, Thomson is able to deduce
values of v and m/e from (1) and (2), and these are the values.
which lead to his remarkable conclusions already given.
    Thomson and Kaufmann control the results of this method
by a second method of experimenting, in which de<U+FB02>exion of
cathode rays was produced by electrostatic force, as well as
 by magnetic, the forces in Thomson’s experiments being
adjusted so that the de<U+FB01>exions in both cases were the same,
 and therefore, if F is the electric force,
                          Fe=Hev.        . . .       . . . (3)
Thus an independent measure of v is taken, and as it con<U+FB01>rms
 those made by the other method, the experimental evidence
 for the simplicity of the laws of cathode motion is greatly
 strengthened. But in the theory of these experiments there
 is one suppressed premiss, namely, that a charge e must be
 associated with some mass m. Now in following up the
 ionic hypothesis as far as it will go, it is our duty to use this
 promise as one of the links in the chain of reasoning; but
 when it leads us to a conclusion subversive of the ionic
 hypothesis, namel , that atoms are split up into particles
 having different 0 arges from the atomic charge in electro
 lysis, then we are no longer bound by the ionic hypothesis.
  It may therefore be that free electrons can appear in the
 aether, and that in the cathode stream the greater part of the
 electricity travels as free electrons.
     A systematic statement of the reasons ‘for contemplating
 the possibility of the motion of free electrons through the
 aether will be given below ; but in the present connexion it
 is of most importance to consider whether such electrons could
 give up to the thermopile the kinetic energy measured by
  Thomson. From the writings of Thomson, Heaviside, Searle,
  and Morton (Phil. Mag. [5] xi., xxvii., xxviii., xli., xliv.)
  we can form an idea as to what takes place when an electron
  is set in motion. These writings relate to electric charges
  on conducting spheres and ellipsoids, the charges being
  caused to move by the motion of the conductors; but in the
  case of the free electron we cannot say that its charge is on
 anything, unless a modi<U+FB01>ed portion of the aether. Our
 simplest plan is to regard the electron as a spherical shell of
  electricity of total amount e, the radius being a.
     The main effect of setting such an electron in motion by
  means of some source of energy, is that electric and magnetic

 V, so that w en the electron has velocity u the total amount
 of such electric and magnetic energy is (Searle, Phil. Mag.

 and taking account only of the part of this energy due to
 motion, we have Heaviside’s result :—
                    eguz/ifiKaVe or ,ue’u’/3a.
    Now if the process, by which some of our store of energy
 was converted into electric and magnetic forms on setting
 the electron in motion, is a reversible one, then on stopping
 the electron in a suitable manner the electric and magnetic
 energy ought to <U+FB02>ow back to our source or to the stopping
 body, and if there are no arrangements at the stopping body
 suitable for storing this as ordinary kinetic or potential
energy, it will appear as heat amongst the particles which
 take part in the stoppage. Thus, then, certain actions of a
 moving electron take place as if it had a localized inertia,
 just as in the theory of electric currents a large part of their
 behaviour is such as it would be if the moving electricity
 had localized inertia. According to Searle’s expression, the
 inertia or effective mass of the electron becomes a function of
 its velocity, if we de<U+FB01>ne it as the quantity which is to be multi
 plied by half the square of the velocity to give the kinetic
 energy. With Heaviside’s expression for smaller velocities,
 we should have the inertia equal to 2pe2/3a. But apart-from
 these details, we have only to assume that the ener y
 imparted to an electron when it is set in motion (or t e
 greater part of it) is given up as heat to the material particles
 which arrest its motion, and is equal to half the square of
 the velocity multiplied by a certain quantity characteristic
 of the electron and appearing by the symbol m in the equations
 of Thomson and Kaufmann. Then the experimental results are
 at once explained ; for as the negative electrons are the same
 in all the experiments, m/e has the same value for cathode
 streams in all gases : the gas facilitates the electric discharge,
 but does not control it; as a steam-engine can give the
 same results with several lubricants, so the cathode stream
 can give the same stream of electric energy by means of its

272                 -Mr. W. Sutherland on
moving free electrons, whatever may be the gas used to
facilitate its <U+FB02>owing.
   We can use Thomson’s and Kaufmann’s value of m/e,
namely, about 10'7 when 0 is measured in electromagnetic
units, to calculate the order of magnitude of a the radius of
the electron. With the relation m/e=2,u.e/3a and n=1 and
e=10"21 in the electromagnetic system of units, we then
have a=10"M nearly, while the radii of molecules are of the
order 10"8 cm., so that the linear dimensions of an electron
are about the millionth part of those of molecules. We
must therefore concede to the electron great freedom of
motion in the interstices between the molecules even of solid
bodies.
                                                                  ,\\_
    A very remarkable fact about the equations of motion of
the cathode stream used by Thomson is that, although the
velocity attained is about one-third that of light, there is no
sign of any necessity to take account of appreciable frictional
 resistance. The electrons stream through the aether with
 nearly the velocity of light and yet provoke no noticeable
resistance. What wonder, then, that any aethereal resistance
to lanetary motion has remained beyond our ken l
     he importance of the quantitative results in these experi
ments has necessitated their being discussed out of their
historical and logical order in a train of thought on cathode
and allied rays, which order we will now attempt to follow
brie<U+FB01> .
    Stdhey’s interpretation of Faraday’s law of Electrolysis to
mean that electricit exists in separate natural units, the
electrons, as de<U+FB01>nitein as matter in atoms, is now generally
accepted, after Helmholtz’s independent advocacy of it in
his Faraday lecture.
   Many workers have investigated the general dynamics of
electrons, but mostly on the supposition that the electron
must be associated with an atom, so that they form in con
junction an ion. But if electric action in matter is to be
explained only by the participation of electrons, it naturally
follows that we should contemplate the existence of electrons
in the‘aether to enable it to play its part in electrical action.
   And next we have to take account of the hypothesis
advanced by Helmholtz in his Faraday lecture (Chem. Soc.
Trans. xxxix. 1881) to explain Contact Electromotive Force,
namely, that different atoms attract electrons with different
amounts of force. This hypothesis may not be generally
accepted yet, but we propose to follow out its logical con
sequences. If two things attract one another they must be
entities of somewhat the same sort, and therefore the electron is

              Cathode, Lenard, and Ro'ntgen Rays.             273
of essentially the same nature as an atom. But further, if two
things attract one another, we must conceive the possibility
of their being drawn apart, so that the ion can be split into
an uncharged atom and an electron free of attachment to
matter. Maxwell’s ascription of inertia to electricity, in
his theory of induced currents, bears out our conclusion that
the atom and the electron are things of the same sort in many
respects. If the electrons are distributed through the aether,
we must suppose that in aether showing no electric charge
each negative electron is united with a positive electron to
form the analogue of a material molecule, which might con
veniently be called a neutron. Of the existence of neutrons
in the aether we have powerful evidence in Trowbridge’s
wonderful experiments (“The Electrical Conductivity of the
JEther,” Phil. Mag. [5] xliii., May 1897). He opens his
account of them with a mention of Edlund’s old contention
that the aether is a conductor and J. J. Thomson’s refutation
of it, and closes it with the statement, “ My experiments lead
me to conclude that under very high electrical stress the
aether breaks down and becomes a cod conductor.” Thus both
Edlund’s contention and J. J. T omson’s are happily recou
ciled; the aether is a perfect insulator until it is broken down,
after which it is a conductor. According to the present
theory, Trowbridge’s result would be worded thus :—The
tether insulates until the electric force at some point is
su<U+FB02>icient to decompose the neutrons into electrons, where
upon it becomes a conductor of the same type as electrolytes.
This principle should help practical electricians to construct
a consistent theory of the hitherto rather intractable electric
are.
   But to return to the cathode rays. The volume of experi
mental and theoretical work on the ionization of gases, which
has been turned out from the Cavendish Laboratory, leaves no
doubt as to the existence of ions in rare gases through which
a current of electricity is passing: hence in the cathode stream
there must be a certain number of ions <U+FB02>ying along side by
side with the electrons; but the experiments of Thomson and
Kaufmann, according to our interpretation, prove that the
stream of ions is of quite subsidiary importance to the stream
of electrons. This is not always necessarily the casein the
electric discharge through gases, and it seems to me that, for
a satisfactory theory of the varied phenomena of electric
conduction through gases, we must take account of the fact
that we have two conducting media participating in the action
namely, varying numbers of ions and also of free electrons.
 . Our theory of the cathode stream has the advantage that it

274                 Mr. \V. Sutherland on
leads in a most natural manner to a theory of the Lenard rays.
The cathode stream of electrons, moving with a velocity
nearly that of li ht, possessing inertia, and yet of a size that
is small compared to the molecular interspaces in solids, must
be able to penetrate a solid that is thin enough, and to emerge
on the other side, differing from the original cathode stream
only in that the small trace of moving ions has been <U+FB01>ltered
out. Practically then Lenard rays are cathode rays. This
is what experiment has abundantly proved. All the main
  roperties of the cathode rays have been re-ohserved in the
Tienard rays: thus Perrin proves that the cathode stream
 carries negative electricity, M‘Clelland proves the same for
 the Lenard rays: Riintgen discovers that where the cathode
stream strikes a solid it emits Rontgen rays; Des Coudres
proves that where the Lenard rays strike a solid they also
emit Rentgen rays: Goldstein discovered that the cathode
stream colours salts, especially haloid salts of the alkalis, in a
 remarkable way; Des Coudres proves the same for the
 Lenard stream: and so on with such properties as magnetic and
electric de<U+FB02>ectability, power of exciting luminescence, and
 the like. The cathode and Lenard streams are the simplest
 forms of electric current known to us. Such a power as that
 of causing certain substances to emit light is only another form
 of our fundamental principle, that an electron in having its
 motion arrested imparts energy to the arresting molecules,
 and of course to their associated electrons. The colouring of
 salts discovered by Goldstein would be accounted for b the
 supposition that some of the negative electrons attach t em
 selves to the electronegative atoms, thereby converting them
 into free ions, and liberating uncharged atoms of the metal,
 which cause the coloration. The experiments which have
 been made, with negative results, to detect the metal or the
 ion chemically do not decide anything, because of course the
 amounts produced are too small for ordinary methods of
 analysis to detect. The fatigue, which some substances show
 after <U+FB02>uorescing for a while under the in<U+FB02>uence of the cathode
 stream, may be accounted for in a similar manner by the
 lodgement of free electrons, which produce an opposing
 electromotive force and diminish the intensity of the cathode
 stream, while at the same time producing an analogous change
 to the change of colour in the salts studied by Goldstein,
 except that the change does not appear as visible colour, but
 as a lowering of <U+FB02>uorescent power. Fluorescence is known
 to be very sensitive to the presence of small traces of sub
 stances.
    ’We do not know enough of the relations of atoms and

               Cathode, Lenard, and R<U+FB01>ntgen Rays.              275
 electrons to formulate a priori what ought to be the law of
 the resistance of bodies to the passage of a stream of electrons
 through them; but fortunately we have the comprehensive
 investigations of Lenard on the subject and can give a
 reasonable explanation of his results. He found (Wied. Ann.
 lvi.) that for a great variety of substances of densities varying
 from that of hydrogen at 3 mm. of mercury pressure ('06368)
 to that of gold (19'3), the resistance to the passage of Lenard
 rays depended almost solely on density, the coe<U+FB01>icient of
 absorption being proportional to the density. Now we should
 expect our electron being so small compared to atoms, and
 moving with high velocities, to deform locally any atom
 which it strikes, and to rebound before the deformation had
 travelled far into the substance of the atom, so that after the
 electron had departed the atom would be left with an increase
 of vibrational energy, but no direct appreciable increase of
 translatory energy; then, if the velocity of propagation of a
 disturbance in all atoms is the same, and also the time of an
 encounter between atom and electron constant, the energy
 given up by an electron in an encounter with an atom will
 be proportional to the density of the substance of the atom.
 Now in the case of a solid, as an electron threads its way
 through the molecular interspaces, the number of its encounters
will be proportional to the length of path, and therefore to
the thickness of the solid, and therefore the coef<U+FB01>cient of
absorption, which will relate to unit thickness of all substances,
will be proportional to the density of the substance of the
atom, which is nearly the same as the densit of the sub~
stance; thus for solids we interpret Lenards law of the
absorption of cathode rays.
   In the case of gases an interesting di<U+FB01>'erence presents
itself. The electron is not now threading its way through
narrow passages, but has far more clear space than obstacle
ahead of it.    As the electron is very small itself, we may say
that in passing through a gas the number of times it en
counters a molecule is proportional to the mean sectional area,
and therefore to the square of the radius R of the molecule
regarded as a sphere, and also to the number of molecules
per unit volume (n); and if m is the mass of the molecule the
density of its substance is proportional to m/Ra, and thus the
coe<U+FB01>icient of absorption for a gas is proportional to nRBm/Rs
or nm/R; but am is the density p, so that the coef<U+FB01>cient of
absorption of a gas is proportional to the density, but also
inversely proportional to the molecular radius. Now this
theoretical conclusion corresponds partly with one of Lenard’s
eXperimental results, namely, that although the coef<U+FB01>cient of

276                  -    Mr. W. Sutherland an
absorption for a large number of uses appeared to' be pro—
portional to the density within t e limits of experimental
error, the coef<U+FB01>cient for hydrogen was exceptional to an
extent decidedly beyond possible experimental error. In his
experiments, Lenard showed that if J0 is the intensity of a
 Lenard stream at its source, J that at a distance r from the
source in a substance whose coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption is A,
                                  J=J,e—~/.~2,
 and determined A for various gases at a pressure of one atmo.
 As the densities of these gases are as their molecular weights,
 with that of hydrogen=2, he shows the relation of A to the
 density of di<U+FB02>'erent gases by tabulating values of A/m; while
 according to our reasoning RA/m would be expected to
 be constant. The following table contains Lenard’s values
 of 103A/m, and relative values of R as given in my paper on
 the “Attraction of Unlike Molecules—The Diffusion of Gases,”
  Phil. Mag. [5] xxxviii., being half the cube-root of the
 limiting space occupied by a gramme-molecule of the sub
  stance and controlled by comparison with molecular dimen
  sions as given by experiments on the viscosity of gases; the
  last row contains the product lO’BA/m :—

  Thus while Lenard’s approximate constant ranges from 102
  to 237, the one to which we have been led ranges from 157 to
   243, which is an improvement. The really striking point
   about Lenard’s discovery, however, is that when A is divided
   by density, the range in value is from 2070 for paper to 5610
   for hydrogen at one atmo; the results for many substances
   such as gold and hydrogen at 1/228 atmo falling between
   these extremes. The fact that the value of A/p for a rare
     as is almost the same as for a dense solid, would seem to
   indicate that it is only when an electron strikes an atom
   almost in the direction of a normal that the most important
   part of the absorption of energy occurs; for if this is so,
   the chance of an electron’s encountering an atom in a solid
   being
   normally,the same        if it cou d its

   it does not meet normally, the absorption of energy from an
    electron by a number of atoms should be the same whether
    they are as close as in a solid or as wide apart as in a rare<U+FB01>ed
    gas. Thus probably the coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption for a solid

               Cathode, Lenard, and Rb'ntyen Rays.            277
depends on its molecular radius, but the data hardly permit
of an examination into this point.        It should be remarked
that, as the electron 'can- probably pass easily between the
atoms in a molecule, the absorption due to a compound mole
cule ought to be analysed into the parts due to its atoms ;
for instance, in Lenard’s table of values for A in such gases
as 0H,, 00,, 02H,” the part due to the carbon, the hydrogen,
and the oxygen, ought to be separated out, and then each
part ought to be proportional to the atomic mass and inversely
proportional to the atomic radius. If this is so, then the
agreement in the values of RA/m in our table could not be
 expected to be perfect.
     A very characteristic property of the Lenard rays follows
from our theory, for when the cathode rays fall on an alu
 minium window, such as Lenard used, they have a direction
 normal to it, whereas the Lenard rays issuing on the other
 side of the window are uniformly radiated in all directions;
 and this is exactly how our stream of small electrons would
 behave, because after they have threaded their way through
 the molecular interstices, they will issue with directions
 uniformly distributed in space, for it is to be presumed that
 the <U+FB01>nal directions of the intermolecular passages will be
 distributed at random.
     As the cathode and Lenard streams are currents of electrons,
 and therefore form pure electric currents, we might expect
 (‘1 priom' that the coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption of substances for
 them would show some decided relation to the electrical
 resistance of the substances; but Lenard’s law proves that
  such an expectation would be futile, for the absorption of
 conductor and insulator alike depends almost entirely on
  density. This fact throws considerable li ht on the nature
  of metallic conduction. It would seem as i?in the conduction
  of electricity in metals, both the positive and negative elec
  trons, distributed through the metals, take part in the process
  of conduction, probably in the method of the Grothuss chain;
  by a process of exchange of partners both kinds of electron
  get passed along in opposite directions without anything of
  the nature of a great rush of one kind of electron at one time
  and place. When such a rush occurs in a cathode stream,
  the internal appliances of the best conducting metal can no
   more facilitate its passage, than can the obstructing appliances
   of the best insulator hinder it. In metallic conduction we
   have to do with a property of the metallic atom, whereby,
   with the aid of electromotive force, the local dissociation of
   the neutron into electrons is greatly facilitated ; whereas in
   insulators the reverse is the case. This important <U+FB01>eld of the

  278                 Mr. W. Sutherland on
 relations of electrons and atoms must be nearly ready for
 important developments.
      wo more of Lenard’s facts are of special importance,
 namely, that cathode rays, when passed through a window
 from the vacuum-tube in which they are generated, travel as
 Lenard rays through gas of such a density as would prevent
 the formation of the cathode rays, if it prevailed in the tube,
 whether that density is great, as in the ordinary atmosphere,
 or very small, as in a vacuum so high as to insulate under the
 electric forces in the tube.     These facts are explained by our
 theory : the properly exhausted tube furnishes a requisite
 facility for splitting up the neutrons and getting a supply of
 electrons to be set swiftly in motion ; once that is accomplished,
 nothing will stop them until it offers enough resistance to
 destroy the momentum of the electrons, and ordinary lengths
 of dense or rare air in Lenard’s experiments failed to do this.
 The action of the tube in generating the cathode rays may be
 likened in this connexion to a Gifford’s Steam Injector.
    In the logical development of the present line of thought,
 an attempt at an explanation of the cause of the R<U+FB01>ntgen
 rays must <U+FB01>nd a place. Already J. J. Thomson, in his paper
 on a Connexion between Cathode and Rontgen Rays (Phil.
 Mag. [5] xlv., Feb. 1898), has worked out in some detail the
 electromagnetic e<U+FB01>'ect of suddenly stopping ions moving with
high velocity, the main result being that thin electromagnetic
pulses radiate from the ion.        He believes that these pulses
constitute the Rontgen rays, in agreement with a surmise of
 Stokes.    Thomson’s reasoning would apply to our free
 electrons just as to his ions, but there would be this important
distinction, that while Thomson’s hypothesis involves the
condition that the greater part of the energy of the cathode
stream consists of the kinetic energy of the atoms, in our
hypothesis the energy belongs almost entirely to the moving
electrons, and when these are sto ped the energy appears as
heat at the place of stoppage. T us Thomson’s electromag
netic pulses appear only as subsidiary phenomena in con
nexion with the conversion of the kinetic energy of the
electrons into heat ; indeed, we cannot be sure that they
exist, because their existence has been suggested only in
accordance with the particular assumptions in Thomson’s
hypothesis which correspond to only a limited portion of the
complete electrodynamics of such an action as is contemplated
in this paper, causing the conversion of all or almost all the
kinetic energy of an electron into heat. Moreover, in tracing
the relation of Lenard rays to cathode ra s we have been he
to picture the stoppage of the moving e ectrons as nothing

             Cat/lode, Lenard, and Rontgen Rays.             279
like so sudden as that which Thomson has to contemplate for
his charges: this of course only makes a difference in the
degree of intensity of the phenomena resulting from the
stoppage. There has as yet been no systematic proof that
the properties of a train of impulses would be the same as
those of the Rontgen rays in the matter of the absence of
refraction and re<U+FB02>exion.     Again, it is recognized that the
Rontgen rays and the Becquerel rays from uranium are very
similar, but it would be hard to imagine the Becquerel rays
to be due to thin impulses. On these grounds it seems to
me that Thomson’s suggestion as to the cause of the Rentgeu
rays, although exciting one’s admiration by its clear con
sistency, does not lead to the desired end; and therefore I
will try to follow out the premisses of this paper to such
conclusions as may relate to phenomena like those of the
B'ontgen rays.
   To the electrons we have assigned inertia and size, and we
must therefore ascribe to them shape; but a general con
ception of shape involves also the notion of deformability,
which, therefore, we must consider as a possible property of
the electron.     The electron is therefore to be supposed
capable of emitting vibrations due to the relative motions of
its parts; as light is supposed to be due to the motion of
electrons as wholes, we see that the internal vibrations
of electrons will have this much in common with light, that
they are transmitted by the same aether, but they need have
nothing else in common.       \Ve propose, then, to identify the
Rent-gen rays with these internal vibrations of our electrons.
It might be expected that the electron, in executing the
motions which cause light, would get strained and thrown
into internal vibration, so that Rontgen rays would accom
pany ordinary light ; but the fact that Rontgen rays cannot
be detected in association with light shows that the motion
of the electron occurs either so that it is very free from shock
and strain, or so that atoms promptly damp any internal
vibrations of adjacent electrons. The way in which matter
absorbs the energy of Rontgen rays shows that we may rely
on atoms to suppress any small amount of Rontgen radiation
that might tend to accompany ordinary light as emitted by
electrons. Thus, then, appreciable Rentgen radiation is to be
looked for only when free electrons are thrown into vigorous
internal vibration. Now the encounter of an electron with
an atom, in which it gives up a part of its kinetic energy to
the atom as heat, is precisely the sort of action by which we
should expect the electron to be thrown into internal vibration.
Internal vibrations should originate where cathode or Lenard.

280                 Mr. W. Sutherland on
rays are absorbed, and most powerfully where the absorption
is most powerful: this corresponds with all the facts as to
the place of origin of Routgen rays.
   As to what must be the order of magnitude of the length
of the waves in the aether produced by the internal vibrations
of the electrons, we can form no (i priori estimate, but under
the circumstances we are at liberty to assume that, like the
size of the electron, it is small compared to that of atoms, and
small also compared to molecular interspaces.           We shall
then have to do with systems of waves, which, when they
fall on a body, can travel freely in the molecular interspaces,
but are liable to absorption near the surfaces of molecules.
The propagation of such a system of waves would take place
almost entirely in the aether of the interspaces, as sound travels
through a loose pile of stones mostly by the air-s aces ; the
molecules cause absorption, but do not act as if they loaded
the aether. Therefore when our system of waves enters a
body it experiences no refraction. As to re<U+FB02>exion at the <U+FB01>rst
layer of molecules which it encounters, we must remember
that our wave-length is small compared to the radius of a
molecule or atom, and that therefore in studying re<U+FB02>exion it
suf<U+FB01>ces to study that from a single molecule ; whereas, with
ordinary light, where the wave-length is large compared to
atomic radius, we have to take the effect of a large number
of contiguous molecules, if we are to reason out results com—
parable with these observed in ordinary re<U+FB02>exion. Now the
re<U+FB02>exion of our small waves from a single molecule will be of
the same nature as re<U+FB02>exion from a sphere, and will be similar
to diffuse scattering, a good deal of the scattering being
towards the neighbouring interstices. Thus the attempt to
re<U+FB02>ect these waves from a material plane surface will be
similar to that of attempting to re<U+FB02>ect ordinary light from a
large number of smooth spheres whose centres lie in a plane.
]f we take the average effect of a large number of molecules
whose centres are by no means in a plane, as must be the
case with our best re<U+FB02>ecting surfaces, we see that a diffuse
scattering of our small waves must take the place of re
<U+FB02>exion, and this is the experimental result with the Rontgen
ra s.                                               »
   {any polarization that our system of waves might possess
could not be detected by the ordinary optical appliances,
because these depend on actions exercised by the molecules
on the vibrations of light, whereas, as our small waves travel
by the interstices between the molecules, their character is
not controlled to any appreciable extent by the molecular
structure. This result also agrees with the experimental one

              Cathode, Lenard, and R<U+FB01>ntgen Rays.            281.1.
that polarization of the Rdntgen rays cannot be detected by
ordinary optical apparatus for the purpose.
   These negative properties have been explained chie<U+FB02>y by
the assumed smallness of the wave-length, and have, there
fore, little direct connexion with our theory of the Rontgen
rays beyond indicating the probability of a small wave-length
for the B<U+FB01>ntgen ra s for similar reasons to those usually
urged. We must, t erefore, proceed to properties that our
short waves must possess by virtue of their origin in vibrating
electrons. In the <U+FB01>rst place, we should expect the electrons
forming the neutrons in the aather to be set vibrating by our
waves ; but if they produce no dissipation of the energy they
will not cause an absorption, but will simply participate in the
general aatherea operations of propagating the waves. But
when the waves get amongst the electrons associated with
atoms, and set them vibrating internally, there is called forth
that resistance to the vibration which constitutes the damping
action already spoken of. One of the probable results of such
an action would be the setting of the acting and reacting
atom and electron into relative motion, so causing the ab
sorbed Rentgen energy to appear as some form of radiant
energy congenial to the atom and electron.      In this way our
waves could give rise to <U+FB02>uorescent and photographic effects
in the manner of the Rontgen rays. If an electron absorbs
enough of the energy of our small waves, it may be set into
such vigorous motion as to escape from the atom with which
it is acting and reacting, and appear as a free electron, or it
may associate itself with an electron“ to form an ion. At
the foundation of our theory we suppose our small waves to
be produced by the deformation of an electron during a
vigorous transfer of energy from electron to atom ; and now
we suppose this to be a reversible action, so that an electron
set vibrating near to an atom can convert enough of its
vibrational energy into translational kinetic energy to escape
from the atom. With this legitimate dynamic assumption of
reversibility, we can deduce from our hypothesis the produc
tion of free electrons or ions in a dielectric traversed by our
small waves, which is in agreement with the remarkable pro
 perty possessed by the Rontgen rays of making gases con
 duct electricity well. The presence of scattered ions in a
 solid dielectric does not necessarily make it conduct. An.
 experimental method of testing our theoretical conclusion,
 that Rontgen rays ought to have the same e<U+FB01>'ect on solid
 dielectrics as on gases, would be to heat one till it gave de
 cided signs of electrolytic conduction, and then test as to
                             * [Atom P]

282                    Mr. W. Sutherland on
whether conductivity is increased by radiation with Rontgen
rays. Experiments on liquid dielectrics should be easy enough.
One of R<U+FB01>ntgen’s observations is of special importance. He
found that air, through which Riintgen rays are passing,
emits Rbntgen rays; and this is exactly what our theory
would indicate, because, as we saw in discussing re<U+FB02>exion,
each atom scatters our small waves as a re<U+FB02>ecting sphere dis
tributes ordinary light.
   The remaining important positive facts concerning Rontgen
rays relate to their absorption in passing through different
substances. Our short waves in passing through a unit cube
of substance in a direction parallel to one of the edges, while
passing along the molecular interspaces, will be falling at
intervals directly on opposing surfaces of atoms; and if n be
the number of atoms per unit volume, and R the radius of
each, the quantity of surface encountered by unit area of
wave-front will be proportional to MR“, and the number
of encounters in passing unit distance will be proportional to
n}, so that as regards amount of encounter of wave-front with
atoms the energy absorbed by the atoms will be proportional
to 11R”. But if the effectiveness of a collision in causing ab
sorption from a given area of ware-front in a given time is
also proportional to the density of the matter in the atom,
that is to m/R3, as we had to suppose in discussing the col
lisions of electrons and atoms, then the absorption of energy
from our short waves in passage through unit length of
different substances will be proportional to nm/R, that is to
the density and inversely to atomic radius as with Lenard
rays. The fact that Riintgen rays produce powerful <U+FB02>uores
cence in certain substances shows that there are special re
sonance phenomena that must be expected to produce decided
variations in absorption from the simple form just discussed ;
but the fact remains, as discovered by Bontgen, that by far
the most important factor in the absorption of Rontgen rays
is density.    Benoist (Compt. Rend. cxxiv.) has found that
the absorption of Rontgen rays by certain gases is propor
tional to the density, the factor of proportionality being
nearly the same as for solids such as mica, phosphorus, and
aluminium, though rising to a value six times as great in the
case of platinum and palladium; density is the prevailing,
but not the only, property which determines the absorption
of the Rontgen rays. But under di<U+FB02>'erent circumstances
Rbntgen-ray apparatus gives out rays of very different absorb
ability, or, as it is usually expressed, of different penetrative
power. Thomson’s theory of the Rontgen rays, as thin elec
tromagnetic pulses, does not seem to offer any feasible ex

              Cat/rode, Lenard, and Rdntgen Rays.             283
planation of this fundamental fact. The theor of vibrating
electrons requires that, in addition to the fundamental mode
of vibration, we must contemplate a number of harmonics
associated with it ; various combinations of fundamental and
harmonies will be associated with different conditions of
generation of the vibrations, and these will correspond to the
   ontgen rays of different penetrative power.
   An interesting observation of Swinton’s, that two collidin
cathode streams do not give rise to Rontgen rays, is explained
by our hypothesis, because the electrons are so small and so
far apart that an appreciable number of collisions between
the electrons of two colliding streams cannot occur.
    Some consequences of our line of reasoning, to which as
yet no corresponding experimental results have been obtained,
may now be indicated.       The difference between cathode and
anode is due to the fact that the attraction of metallic atoms
for positive electrons is stronger than for negative ones, so
that under a iven electrical stress negative electrons break
away as a cat ode stream more easily than positive ones as
an anode stream. But still, under strong enough electric
stress at the anode, it ought to be possible to get an anode
 stream or anode rays similar to the cathode rays, but carry
ing positive electricity. These on encountering atoms, espe
 cially the atoms of a solid body, should cause the emission of
 rays similar to the Rontgen, but possibly very different in
 detailed properties, such as wave-length. It is possible that
 the Beequerel rays may be examples of what we may call
 positive Bontgen rays, because, while we have seen that, in
 the majority of cases, electrons move relatively to atoms in
 the production of light, in such a manner that they do not
 experience shocks throwing them into internal vibration, the
 uranium atom may be so formed that it periodically collides
 with its satellite electron or electrons, in which case the atoms
 of uranium would be a source of radiation analogous to the
 Hontgen.
    According to our theory the velocity of the cathode stream
 is not a physical constant like the velocity of light through
 the aether, but ought to vary greatly according to the history
 of the stream, which starts with zero velocity and ends with
 the same. The velocity of the Rontgen rays should be of
 the order of that of light : we cannot assert that it should be
 exactly equal to that of light, because to waves of so short a
 length the neutrons may act as if they loaded the aether, so
 that R<U+FB01>ntgen rays may suffer a refraction in wther in com
 parison with light. The fact that the experimental velocities
 found for the cathode rays are of the order of the velocity of

284                   Dr. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
light is a striking one, to be compared with the fact that in
the vena contracta of a as escaping from an ori<U+FB01>ce the
maximum velocity attainable is nearly that of the agitation
of the average molecule in the containing vessel or of sound
in the gas.
 ‘ It appears as though a complete theory of electricity would
be a kinetic theory, in which the place of the atoms or mole
cules of the kinetic theory of matter is taken by the electrons.
The ion appears as a sort of molecule formed by the union of
an atom or radical to an electron. But such large questions
can hardly be opened up in the present connexion. We may
summarize the contentions of the preceding pages in the two
pro ositions :—
        he cathode and Lenard rays are streams, not of ions, but
of free negative electrons.
    The Rontgen rays are caused by the internal vibrations of
free electrons.

 XXI. Properties of Liquid JVlizvtures.—Part III)“ Partially
           Miscible Liquids. By R. A. LEHFELDT, D.Sc.1'
  THE phenomena of complete mixture between two liquids,
          about which so little s stematic knowledge is yet in
  existence, are connected wit the phenomena of ordinary
  solution by an intermediate stage, that in which two liquids
  dissolve one another to a limited extent only. The study of
  such couples seems a promising <U+FB01>eld of investigation, on
  account of the intermediate position they occupy; it seems
  to o<U+FB02>’er the chance of extending some of the laws arrived at
  with regard to simple solution to the more complicated cases;
  I have therefore attempted to get some information on the
  equilibrium between incomplete mixtures and the vapour
  over them, and especially at the “critical point,” i. e., the
  point at which incomplete miscibility passes over into com
  plete. A recent short paper by Ostwaldi draws attention
  to the importance of that point in the theory of mixtures.
                             Choice of Liquids.
      The <U+FB01>rst point is to obtain suitable pairs of liquids for
  experiment. In order to study the properties of the critical
  point with ordinary vapour-pressure apparatus, it is necessary

  that the pressure at the critical point should be below one
  atmosphere, and that limits very much the choice of liquids.
  As a rule, two liquids either mix completely cold, or if they
  do not do that, raising to the boiling-point does not suf<U+FB01>ce to
  make them mix ; two or three cases are all that I have been
 able to <U+FB01>nd in which the point of complete mixture can be
 arrived at by boiling, and consequently corresponds to a
 vapour-pressure below the atmospheric. Many other pairs
  of incompletely miscible liquids have been studied by
 Alexejew and others, but to arrive at their critical points it
  was necessary to raise them to a high temperature in sealed
 tubes. A recent paper by Victor Rothmund * contains new
 observations on the relation between concentration and tem
 perature, including the concentration and temperature of
 the critical point, made by Alex'cjew’s method. That paper
 contains along account of previous work on the subject,
 which makes it the less necessary for me to go over the same
 ground. I will therefore mention only what has been done
 on vapour-pressures, as Rothmund does not touch on that
 side of the subject, merely adding two remarks to his paper.
 First, it does not seem to have been noticed that normal
 organic liquids always mix completely: I hoped to have
 found a normal pair to study <U+FB01>rst, in order to avoid the com
 plication due to the abnormality supposed to be molecular
 aggregation in the liquid ; I have not succeeded in <U+FB01>nding
 such a pair. All the'incompletely miscible pairs of liquids
 so far noted include water, methyl alcohol, or a low fatty
 acid as one member. To those with accessible critical
 points mentioned by Rothmund, I have only one pair to add,
 viz., ethylene dibromide and formic acid ; these mix on
 boiling and separate into two layers when cold.            I have not
 yet gone further with this couple ; the vapour-pressure
 observations below refer to the well-known cases of phenol
 and water, aniline and water.
    An account of previous experiments on the vapour-pressure
of incompletely miscible liquids will indeed not take up much
space, since, so far as I know, there is only one to record,
viz., Konowalow’s‘l' measurements on isobutyl alcohol-water
mixtures.      His observations (made by a static method) give
some points on the vapour-pressure curve up to 100° for
 (1) pure isobutyl alcohol (100 O/,,) ; (2) mixtures containing
94'05 0/0 and 6'17 °/0, both clear; (3) an undetermined mixture
which separated into two layers. He unfortunately did not
measure the solubility of the alcohol in water, or water in

  286                 Dr. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
  the alcohol, at any of the temperatures for which vapour
  pressure observations are recorded, so those data have to be
  supplied from Alexejew’s results *.         Konowalow, in the
  second part 1’ of his paper, proceeds to show that the possible
  forms of curve showing vapour-pressure against concentration
   (temperature constant) are two: (i.) the <U+FB02>at part of the
  curve bounded by a rising portion at one end and a falling
  portion at the other ; (ii.) the <U+FB02>at part bounded by a falling
  portion at each end. Isohutyl alcohol-water mixtures give a
  curve of the latter kind.
      Isobutyl alcohol and water, however, possess a critical
  point at about 130°, 1'. e., much above the boiling-point of
  either.   I therefore decided to study <U+FB01>rst mixtures of phenol
  and water, which become homogeneous in any proportions
- below 70°.
      The phenol was a commercial “ pure ” specimen ; to purify
  it further, it was placed in a distillation-<U+FB02>ask and melted;
  then air was drawn through it for about half an hour, whilst
   its temperature was kept at about 160° to 170°, in order to
   dry it. it was then distilled, and by far the larger part came
   over between 178° and 180°. The fraction collected between
   179°‘5 and 180° (about half the mass) was used in the
   experiments. To make up mixtures, the process always
   adopted was to warm the stoppered bottle containing the
   phenol to just above the melting-point, and pour the required
   amount into a weighing-<U+FB02>ask. It was found that the moisture
   absorbed from the air during the process was quite inappre
   ciable.   The phenol, kept day after day at 40° to 50° ready
   for use, slowly turned pink, showing the presence of rosolic
   acid ; but a comparative colour-observation showed that the
   amount of impurity was probably not more than 1/10,000.
   When it was necessary to estimate phenol in a mixture, that
   was done by the method of Koppesohaar, tribromphenol
   being formed and the excess of' bromine replaced by iodine
   and titrated with thiosulphate. The method gave quite
   satisfactory results.
                      Experimental lifet/wds used.
      The measurements on phenol-mixtures gave results con
   trary to my expectations, so that I became suspicious of the
   experimental methods. In the end I made use of four
   different kinds of apparatus, but found that they gave results
   in practical agreement, so that it became chie<U+FB02>y a question of
   convenience to decide between them.

                 Properties of Liquid Mixtures.              287
   The <U+FB01>rst method tried was the “ dynamic,” carried out
with the same apparatus as described in Part II.     It required
no modi<U+FB01>cation, except the use of a new thermometer, since
the old one did not go above 60°. The new thermometer was
a longer one, graduated in % from 0° to 100° (by C. E.
Miiller, N0. 8). Its corrections were obtained in two ways :
<U+FB01>rst by comparison with a standard (Reichsanstalt, 7347) at
certain <U+FB01>xed temperatures, viz., the boiling-points of methyl
acetate (57°), methyl alcohol (65°), and ethyl alcohol (78°);
secondly, by measurements of the vapour-pressures of water
under the same conditions as in the actual experiments ; in
these conditions part of the stem was exposed.
   To use the apparatus the required mixture was weighed out
from melted phenol and distilled water, then warmed up in
the weighing-bottle until it became homogeneous, and poured
into the tube of the vapour-pressure apparatus. The apparatus
works satisfactorily except for mixtures on a very steep part
of the curve of vapour-pressure (11) over concentration (2);
when dp/dz is great, the change of composition of the liquid,
due to the evaporation, becomes disproportionately important,
and the static method is to be preferred ; in the case of phenol
mixtures, however, that only affects a small part of the range
——mixtures with 90 per cent. or more of phenol.
   The anomalous result that made me at <U+FB01>rst doubtful of the
accuracy of the method was that up to 60 or 70 per cent. of
phenol added to water made practically no di<U+FB02>'erence to the
vapour-pressure of the water. To check this, I made one or
two experiments by the static method, in a barometer tube
surrounded by an alcohol-vapour jacket of the usual pattern.
They were not carried out with any attempt at accuracy, but
suf<U+FB01>ced to show that the previous observations could not be
far wrong. The problem then was to determine the small
difference in pressure between water and the phenol-water
mixtures, and as for that purpose a differential gauge is
obviously more appropriate, I set about designing and making
the apparatus described below. Its design is based on a point
of technique that does not seem to be much known, and to
which, therefore, I should like to draw attention. If a glass
tube be drawn out <U+FB01>ne, sealed at one end, and evacuated, the
sealed end may be broken under the surface of a liquid,
which then <U+FB02>ows in at any desired rate according to the
diameter of the tube, and the tube may at any moment be
fused off in the middle by a mouth blowpipe, without any
inconvenience whatever. This process of <U+FB01>lling with a liquid
will I think be found advantageous in many cases. The only
trouble about it is to get thXe capillary of the right bore;

288                 Dr. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
since the rate of <U+FB02>ow depends on the fourth power of the
radius it is easy to make the tube too wide or too narrow.
Of course I made a good many failures at <U+FB01>rst, but after
some practice could rely on getting the required condition.
I used tubing of about 1 millim. internal diameter, and
4 millim. external, and drew it out till the internal diameter
was about one sixth of a millimetre; a few centimetres of
such a bore gives a convenient rate of <U+FB02>ow for liquids of the
Viscosity of water.

   The apparatus for vapour-pressure measurements is shown
in <U+FB01>g. 1.' It consists Of a U-tube, A, to serve as a gauge,
carrying a branch, B, below, drawn out for <U+FB01>lling as mentioned
above. The top of the gauge-tube is bent round each side to
the bulbs C, C, which are also provided with <U+FB01>lling-tubes

   D, D’. The whole is shown <U+FB02>at in the diagram ; but as a
   matter of fact the side tubes C D and C’ D’ were bent round
   till the bulbs nearly touched, to ensure their being of the same
   temperature. The apparatus was cleaned out with chromio
   acid, washed, and dried ; the capillaries were then drawn out
  and two of them sealed up, the third being left with the bit
   of wider tubing beyond the capillary untouched. By means
   of this it was attached to a mercury-pump, exhausted, and
  the capillary fused. The point B was then opened under
  mercury and fused off when the gauge contained suf<U+FB01>cient :
  in the same way one of the bulbs was half <U+FB01>lled with the
  mixture through D, and then the other with water (which
  must, of course, be freed from air) through D’. The apparatus,
  all of glass and hermetically sealed, is then ready for use : a
  glass millimetre scale is fastened with rubber bands to the
  gauge-tube, and it was immersed in a large glass jar of water.
  The scale was usually read by the telescope of a cathetometer
  and sometimes the screw micrometer of the telescope used
  to subdivide the graduation. The differential method avoids
  the necessity for any very great care in maintaining or mea
 suring the temperature of the apparatus. It was found quite
  suf<U+FB01>cient to heat the water-bath by leading a current of
  steam into it, and when the required temperature was
 reached, stop the steam for a moment and read the differ
 ence of level. When the highest temperature (90°) was
 reached, some of the water was siphoned off, replaced by
 cold, the whole mass well stirred, and a reading taken. There
 was no noticeable lag in the indications of the gauge, the
 readings at the same temperature, rising and falling, being
 in good agreement.
     The fourth apparatus used was the Beckmann boiling-point
 apparatus, in its usual (second) form : with that observations
at 100° were obtained of a kind to con<U+FB01>rm the measurements
made at somewhat lower temperatures with the vapour
pressure apparatus.
                  Observations of Vapour-pressure.
     The following observations were obtained with the differ,
ential pressure-gauge: t is the temperature centigrade, p
the vapour-pressure of the mixture, 1 that of water, w—p
is therefore the difference observed with the gauge, and
(ar—p)/1r represents the relative lowering of the vapour
pressure of water by the addition of the quantity of phenol
mentioned.

     A mixture containing 7'74 per cent. of phenol gave no
 certain indication of a difference of; pressure between the
 mixture and pure water. On this;_ point, however, more
 reliable information is to be obtained with the Beckmann
 apparatus. It will be noticed from the preceding <U+FB01>gures
  that the in<U+FB02>uence of the dissolved phenol becomes steadily
  greater as the temperature rises, e. g. 82 per cent. of phenol
  produces nearly twice as great a change of vapour-pressure
  proportionally at 90° as it does at 50°.                      In agreement with
  this the rise of vapour-pressures in dilute solutions of phenol
  is more marked at 100° than at the 10wer temperatures at
  which the vapour-pressure apparatus is available. The result
  of an experiment on the boiling-point is as follows :—

for alcohol-toluene mixtures (see <U+FB01>g. 2 in the preceding
memoir), only that the <U+FB02>atness extending over a great part of
the range of concentrations is exaggerated in the phenol-water
mixtures. The curve for 75°—still above the critical point—
is still <U+FB02>atter; indeed it is imposible to say whether it rises or
falls. Probably, therefore, below the critical point (where
the vapour-pressure of phenol is inconveniently small for
measurement) the isothermal, instead of consisting of a hori
zontal line bounded by two curves, would consist of a hori
zontal passing through the point representing pure water,
bounded at the other end only by a descending curve. Such

292                           Dr. R. A. Lehfeldt on the
an isothermal—that of 50°—is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2.                        The hori—
zontal part ends at the point A (63 per cent.), beyond which
the mixtures are homogeneous: the curve beyond A may
theoretically meet the horizontal line at a <U+FB01>nite angle, but
that is certainly not distinguishable on the diagram. The
curve is in fact exactly similar, so far as the experiments
show, to that for 75°, and the pressure of the critical point, C
on the diagram, which lies between them (at 68°‘4) appears to
make no difference whatever in this case—a case of great
disparity in the vapour-pressures of the two components.
   For comparison, a few experiments were made with aniline
 (not specially puri<U+FB01>ed) and water. A mixture which consisted
of two layers, even at the highest temperature used in the

   The second column gives the observed fall in temperature
on adding aniline to the water,- the third column the rise of
pressure corresponding, at the rate of 26'8 millim. per degree.
 Water at 1000 is saturated by the addition of 6'5 per cent.
of aniline, and it will be seen that the vapour-pressure rises
no further after that. The relative rise of vapour-pressure on
saturation is 0'0324 at 100°, in satisfactory agreement with
the numbers obtained by the di<U+FB01>'erential gauge (0'0290,
00515, 00307), a tendency to increase with temperature
being distinguishable here, as with phenol. Now suppose
the vapour-pressure of a saturated mixture to be obtained in
in this way: let the partial pressure of the water-vapour be
that of pure water reduced by the normal amount (Raonlt’s
law) due to the solution in it of the maximum quantity of
aniline : and let the partial pressure of aniline-vapour be that
of pure aniline reduced by the normal amount due to the

                 Properties of Liquid .lfiwtures.                 293
solution in it of the maximum quantity of water.               We get
the following results at 100° :—
     Vapour-pressure of water = 760 millim.
     Solubility of aniline = 6'5 per cent. = 1'32 molecular
        per cent.
     Partial pressure of water = 9868 per cent. of 760
         = 7499 millim.
      Vapour-pressure of aniline = 46 millim.‘
      Solubility of water in aniline = 8'7 per cent. = 33 mole
         cular per cent. (Alexejew).
      Partial pressure of aniline = 308.
     Total pressure = 749'9 + 30'8 = 7807.
      Observed pressure = 784'6 millim.
   The vapour-pressure of the saturated mixture is therefore
given fairly well by the above rule. The rule cannot be
applied to phenol mixtures, as below the critical point the
vapour-pressure of phenol is too low to determine with
accuracy. Konowalow’s measurements of the vapour-pressure
of isobutyl alcohol-water mixtures, combined with Alexejew’s
measurements of solubility, give the following results. At
90° :—
      Vapour-pressure of water = 525 millim.
      Solubility of isobutyl alcohol = 7 per cent. = 1'8 mole
         cular per cent.
      Partial pressure of water-vapour = 982 per cent. of
         525 = 5155.
      Vapour-pressure of isobutyl alcohol = 378 millim.
      Solubility of water = 25 per cent. = 57'8 molecular per
         cent.
      Partial pressure of isobutyl alcohol = 1595.
      Sum                                       = 675'1.
      Observed pressure                         = 767.
   In this case the alcohol saturated with water contains more

that the normal depression of the vapour~pressure should
hold over so wide a range as 57'8 per cent. The numbers
in fact show that the partial pressure of isobutyl alcohol
must be very much greater—about 250 millim. The curve
of partial pressures is therefore comparable with that for
 ethyl alcohol in benzene and toluene (see Part II. tables
p. 53).                                                      '

of the freezing-point; it accordingly starts with a slo e of
O°'2 for one per cent. of phenol. The initial slope of N is
given by a similar equation, and is 4°15 for one per cent. of
water; a direct observation gave as a point of the curve

 that it is actually attainable: its existence was shown by
 making a solution containing 5'25 per cent. of phenol, and
 cooling it in a bath of ice and salt: it began to freeze with
 out previous separation into two layers, and the temperature
 remained constant at —O°'9. About half of it was frozen, the
 beaker removed from the freezing-mixture, and some of the
 liquid remaining poured off for analysis; it was found to

XXII. ()n the Propagation of Damped Electrical Oscillations
       along Parallel Wires.      By W. B. MORTON, M.A.'l'
IN a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for
       September 1898 Dr. E. H. Barton has compared the
attenuation of electrical waves in their passage along parallel
wires, as experimentally determined by him, with the formula
given by Mr. Heaviside in his theory of long waves. The
results show a large discrepancy between the theory and the
experiments, the observed value of the attenuation constant
being about twice too large.         Dr. Barton discusses several
possible causes of error and <U+FB01>nds them inadequate, and
suggests that the reason of the difference may lie either in
(l) the nearness of the wires to one another, or (2) in the
damping of the wave-train propagated by the oscillator. To
these may be added (3) the consideration that the formulae
used were deduced by Mr. Heaviside from the discussion of
his “ distortionless circuit,” in which the matter is simpli<U+FB01>ed
     ‘ L. c. p. 452.
     t Communicated by the Physical Society; read Nov. 11, 1898.

   Damped Electrical Oscillations along Parallel Wires.       297
by supposing sufficient leakage to counteract the distortion
produced by the resistance of the leads, whereas in Dr. Barton’s
circuit the leakage was negligible.
   It is probable that the nearness of the wires has an appre
ciable effect on the phenomenon. The discrepancy would be
diminished if the actual resistance of the wires was greater
than that calculated by Dr. Barton from Lord Rayleigh’s
high-frequency formula. Now the effect of the neighbourhood
of two wires carrying rapidly oscillating currents in opposite
directions is to make the currents concentrate towards the
inner sides of the wires"; and this would cause an increase
in the effective resistance.
   I have examined the effects of (2) and (3), viz. of the
damping and the Want of balance in the constants of the
circuit. The investigation is perhaps of some interest owing
to the fact that these elements are always present in the
ordinary experimental conditions ; although, as will be seen,
we are led to the conclusion that in all actual cases their in
fluence on the phenomena is of quite negligible order. The
method is the same as that used by Mr. Heaviside.
    General Tlzeory.-—Let the inductance of the circuit be L, its
capacity S, its resistance (of double wires) R, and its leakage
conductance K, all per unit length. An important part is
played by the ratios % and 1% ; we shall call these p and 0'.
When p and 0' are equal we have the “ distortionless " circuit
above referred to.
   Now if V be the difference of potential between the wires
and C the current in the positive wire, we have the equations

   It' the circuit be distortionless and R’=Lv, then, as
Mr. Heaviside showed, the absorption of the waves by the
terminal resistance will be complete. We may regard this
as the critical resistance for the circuit, and we shall express
R’ in terms of it by putting R’ =.2:Lv.      We then have

 XXIII. Application of Sellmez'er’s Dynamical Theory to the

               Sellmeier’s theory, imagine for each molecule of
 sodium-vapour a spherical hollow in ether, lined with a thin
 rigid spherical shell, of mass equal to the mass of homo

of the hollow we shall call the sheath of the molecule, or brie<U+FB02>y
the sheath.      Within this put two rigid spherical shells, one
inside the other, each movable and each repelled from the
sheath with forces, or distribution of force, such that the
centre of each is attracted towards the centre of the hollow
with a force varying directl ' as the distance. These suppo
sitions merely put two of éellmeier's single-atom vibrators
into one sheath.
   § 2. Imagine now a vast number of these diatomic molecules,
equal and similar in every respect, to be distributed homo
geneously through all the ether which we have to consider as
containing sodium-vapour. In the <U+FB01>rst place, let the density
of the vapour be so small that the distance between nearest
centres is great in comparison with the diameter of each
molecule. And in the <U+FB01>rst place also, let us consider light
whose wave-length is very large in comparison with the
distance from centre to centre of nearest molecules. Subject
to these conditions we have (Sellmeier’s formula)

     §3. For sodium-vapour, according to the measurements
 of Rowland and Bell*, published in 1887 and 1888 (probably
 the most aCcurate hitherto made), the periods of light corre
 sponding to the exceedingly <U+FB01>ne dark lines 1);, 2 of' the
 solar spectrum are '589618 and '589022 of a michron T. The
 mean of these is so nearly one thousand times their difference
 that we may take

  and we have as yet no experimental knowledge to show that
  either is greater than the other. I have therefore assumed
  them equal in the calculations and numerical illustrations
  described below.

  pleasure to receive from Professor Henri Beequerel, enclosed
  with a letter of date Dec. 31, 1898, two photographs of ano

 Theory to Darla Lines D1, 1), produced by Sodium- Vapour. 305
malous dis ersion by prisms of sodium-vapour *, by which 1
was astonished and delighted to see not merely a beautiful and
perfect demonstration of the “anomalous dispersion ” towards
in<U+FB01>nity on each side of the zero of refractivity, but also an
illustration of the characteristic nullity of absorption and
<U+FB01>nite breadth of dark lines, originally shown in Sellmeier’s
formula‘l' of 1872 and now, after 27 years, <U+FB01>rst actually
seen. Each photograph showed dark spaces on the high sides
of the D1, D2 lines, very narrow on one of the photographs;
on the other much broader, and the one beside the D2 line
decidedly broader than the one beside the DI line; just as it
should be according to Sellmeier’s formula, according to
which also the density of the vapour in the prism must have
been greater in the latter case than in the former. Guessing
from the ratio of the breadths of the dark bands to the space
between their D], 1),, borders, and from a slightly greater
breadth of the one beside D2, I judged that m must in this
case have been not very different from '0002 ; and I calculated
accordingly from (6) the accompanying graphical represen

   § 7. According to Sellmeier’s formula the light transmitted
through a layer of sodium-vapour (or any transparent sub
stance to which the formula is applicable) is the same whatever
be the thickness of the layer (provided of course that the
thickness is at least several wave-lengths, and that the ordinary
theory of the transmission of light through thin plates is
taken into account when necessary). Thus the D1, D2 lines
of the s ectrum of solar light, which has travelled from the
source t rou h a hundred kilometres of sodium-vapour in the
sun’s atmosphere, must be identical in breadth and penumbras
with those seen in a laboratory experiment in the spectrum of

light transmitted through half a centimetre or a few centi
metres of sodium-vapour, of the same density as the densest
part of the sodium-vapour in the portion of the solar atmo
sphere traversed by the light analysed in any particular
observation. The question of temperature cannot occur except
in so far as the density of the vapour, and the clustering 1n
groups of atoms, or non-clustering (mist or vapour of sodium),
are concerned.
    § 8. A grand inference from the experimental foundation
of Stokes’ and Kirchho<U+FB01>’s original idea is that the periods
of molecular vibration are the same to an exceedingly minute
degree of accuracy through the great differences of range of
vibration presented in the radiant molecules of an electric
spark, electric are, or <U+FB02>ame, and in the molecules of a com
paratively cool vapour or gas giving dark lines in the spectrum
 of light transmitted through it.
    § 9. It is much to be desired that laboratory experiments he
 made, notwithstanding their extreme dif<U+FB01>culty, to determine
the density and pressure of sodium-vapour through a wide
range of temperature, and the relation between density,
pressure, and temperature of gaseous sodium.

 ACCORDING to Laplace’s theory of the propagation of
         Sound the expansions (and contractions) of the air
 are supposed to take place without transfer of heat. Many
 years ago Sir G. Stokes T discussed the question of the
 in<U+FB02>uence of radiation from the heated air upon the propagation
of sound. He showed that such small radiating power as is
 admissible would tell rather upon the intensity than upon the
 velocity. If a: be measured in the direction of propagation,

Would be propagated for (seven) minutes, or travel over about

shall presently return to the consideration of the probable
value of g.
     Besides radiation there is also to be considered the in<U+FB02>uence
of conductivity in causing transfer of heat, and further there
are the e<U+FB01>'ects of viscosity.            The problems thus sug ested

310      Lord Rayleigh on the Cooling of Air by Radiation
atmospheric refraction and re<U+FB01>exion, and they are sometimes
 very surprising.      But the question remains whether in a
 uniform condition of the atmosphere the attenuation is sensibly
 more rapid than can be accounted for by the law of inverse
squares. Some interesting experiments towards the elucida
tion of this matter have been published by Mr. Wilmer Du<U+FB02>' *,
who compared the distances ot'audibility of sounds proceeding
respectively from two and from eight similar whistles. On an
average the eight whistles were audible only about one-fourth
further than a pair of whistles ; whereas, if the sphericity of
the waves had been the only cause of attenuation, the dis
tances would have been as 2 to 1. Mr. Dutt' considers that in
 the circumstances of his experiments there was little oppor
 tunity for atmospheric irregularities, and he attributes the
greater uart ot' the falling off to radiation. Calculating from
 (1) he educes a radiating power such that a mass of air at
any given excess of temperature above its surroundings will
 (if its volume remain constant) fall by radiation to one-half
of that excess in about one-twelfth of a second.                   .
    In this paper I propose to discuss further the question of the
radiating power of air, and I shall contend that on various
grounds it is necessary to restrict it to a value hundreds
of times smaller than that above mentioned. On this view
Mr. Duff’s results remain unex lained. For myself I should
still be disposed to attribute them to atmospheric refraction.
If further experiment should establish a rate of attenuation of
the order in question as applicable in uniform air, it will I
think be necessary to look for a cause not hitherto taken into
account.     We might imagine a delay in the equalization of
the different sorts of energy in a gas undergoing compression,
not wholly insensible in comparison with the time of vibra
tion of the sound. If in the dynamical theor we assimilate
the molecules of a gas to hard smooth bodies which are nearly
but not absolutely spherical, and trace the effect of a rapid
compression, we see that at the <U+FB01>rst moment the increment
of energy is wholly translational and thus produces a maxi
mum effect in op osing the compression. A little later a due
proportion of t e excess of energy will have passed into
rotational forms which do not in<U+FB02>uence the pressure, and this
will accordingly fall off. Any effect of the kind must give
rise to dissipation, and the amount of it will increase with the
time required for the transformations, 1'. e. in the above men
tioned illustration with the degree of approximation to the
spherical form. In the case of absolute spheres no transforma
tion of translatory into rotatory energy, or .vice versa, would

occur in a <U+FB01>nite time. There appears to be nothing in the
behaviour of gases, as revealed to us by experiment, which
forbids the supposition of a delay capable of in<U+FB02>uencing the
propagation of sound.
   Returning now to the question of the radiating power of air,
we may establish a sort of superior limit by an argument based
upon the theory of exchanges, itself <U+FB01>rmly established by the
researches of B. Stewart. Consider a s herical mass of radius
r, slightly and uniformly heated.              hatever may be the
radiation proceeding from a unit of surface, it must be less
than the radiation from an ideal black surface under the same
conditions. Let us, however, suppose that the radiation is the
same in both cases and inquire what would then be the rate
of cooling. According to Bottomley‘ the emissivity of a
blackened surface moderately heated is ‘0001. This is the
amount of heat reckoned in water-gram-degree units emitted
in one second from a square centimetre of surface heated 1° C.
If the excess of temperature be 0, the whole emission is
                          0 x 4'rr-r2 x '0001.
On the other hand, the capacity for heat is
                        %'rrr3 X ‘0013 X '24,
the <U+FB01>rst factor being the volume, the second the density, and
the third the specific heat of air referred as usual to water.

 in the ratio of e : 1 is thus represented numerically by r

      hen r is very great, the suppositions on which (5) is
 calculated will be approximately correct, and that equation
 will then represent the actual law of cooling of the sphere of
 air, supposed to be maintained uniform by mixing if neces
 sary. But ordinary experience, and more especially the
 observations of Tyndall upon the diathermancy of air, would
 lead us to suppose that this condition of things would not be
 approached until r reached 1000 or erhaps 10,000 centims.
  For values of r comparable with t e half wave-length of
  ordinary sounds, 0.9. 30 centim., it would seem that the real
 time of cooling must be a large multiple of that given by (5).

 312      Lord Rayleigh on the Cooling of Air by Radiation
 At this rate the time of cooling of a mass of air must exceed,
 and probably largely exceed, 60 seconds. To suppose that
 this time is one-twelfth of a second would require a sphere of
 air 2 millim. in diameter to radiate as much heat as if it were
 of blackened copper at the same temperature.                    '
    Although, if the above argument is correct, there seems
 little likelihood of the cooling of moderate masses of air being
 sensibly in<U+FB02>uenced by radiation, I thought it would be of
 interest to inquire whether the observed cooling (or heating)
 in an experiment on the lines of Clement and Desormes
 could be adequately explained by the conduction of heat from
 the walls of the vessel in accordance with the known con
 ductivity of air. A nearly spherical vessel of glass of about
 35 centim. diameter, well encased,was <U+FB01>tted, air-tight, with two
 tubes. One of these led to a manometer charged with water or
 sulphuric acid ; the other was provided with a stopcock and
 connected with an air-pump. In making an experiment the
 stopcock was closed and a vacuum established in a limited
 volume upon the further side.         A rapid opening and re
 closing of the cock allowed a-certain quantity of air to
 escape suddenly, and thus gave rise 'to a nearly uniform
cooling of that remaining behind in the vessel. At the same
moment the liquid rose in the manometer, and the obser
vation consisted in notin the times (given by a metronome
beating seconds) at whic the liquid in its descent passed
the divisions of a scale, as the air recovered the temperature
of the containing vessel. The <U+FB01>rst record would usually be
at the third or fourth second from the turning of the cock,
and the last after perhaps 120 seconds. In this way data
are obtained for a plot of the curve of pressure; and the
part actually observed has to be supplemented by extra
polation, so as to go back to the zero of time (the moment of
turning the tap) and to allow for the drop which might occur
subsequent to the last observation. .An estimate, which
cannot be much in error, is thus obtained of the whole rise in
pressure during the recovery of temperature, and for the
time, reckoned from the commencement, at which the rise
is equal to one-half of the total.
    In some of the earlier experiments the whole rise of
pressure (fall in the manometer) during the recovery of
temperature was about 20 millim. of water, and the time of
half recovery was 15 seconds. I was desirous of working
with the minimum range, since only in this way could it be
hoped to eliminate the effect of gravity, whereby the interior
and still cool parts of the included air would be made to
fall and so come into closer proximity to the walls, and thus

       and Conduction, and on the Propagation of Sound.              313
accelerate the mean cooling.          In order to diminish the dis
turbance due to capillarity, the bore of the manometer-tube,
which stood ,in a large open cistern, was increased to about
18millim.*, and suitable optical arrangements were intro
duced to render small movements easily visible. By degrees
the range was diminished, with a prolongation of the time of
half recovery to 18, 22, 24, and <U+FB01>nally to about 26 seconds.
The minimum range attained was represented by 3 or 4
millim. of water, and at this stage there did not appear to be
 much further prolongation of cooling in progress.                There
 seemed to be no appreciable difference whether the air was
 arti<U+FB01>cially dried or not, but in no case was the moisture
 suf<U+FB01>cient to develop fog under the very small expansions
 employed. The result of the experiments may be taken to be
 that when the in<U+FB02>uence of gravity was, as far as practicable,
 eliminated, the time of half recovery of temperature was
 about 26 seconds.
    It may perha s be well to give an example of an actual
 experiment. Thus in one trial on Nov. 1, the recorded times
 of passage across the divisions of the scale were 3, 6, 11, 18,
 26, 35, 47, 67, 114 seconds.       The divisions themselves were
 millimetres, but the actual movements of the meniscus were
 less in the proportion of about 2%:1. A plot of these
 numbers shows that one division must be added to represent
 the movement between 05 and 3s, and about as much
 for the movement to be expected between 1148 and 00.
 The whole range is thus 10 divisions (corresponding to
 4 millim. at the meniscus), and the mid point occurs at
 26 5. On each occasion 3 or 4 sets of readings were taken
 under given conditions with fairly accordant results.
     It now remains to compare with the time of heating
 derived from theory.           The calculation is complicated by
 the consideration that when during the process any part
 becomes heated, it expands and compresses all the other
 parts, thereby developing heat in them. From the investi
 gation which t'ollows‘l', we see that the time of half recovery t
 is given by the formula

view that the transfer of heat is due to conduction, and that
the part played by radiation is insensible. From a com
parison of the experimental and calculated curves, however,
it seems probable that the effect of gravity was not wholly
eliminated, and that the later stages of the phenomenon, at
any rate, may still have been a little in<U+FB02>uenced by a downward
movement of the central parts.
XXV. 0n the Coruluctl n of [feat in a Spherical Mass of Air
   con<U+FB01>ned by Walls at a Constant Temperature. By Lord
   RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.*
IT is proposed to investigate the subsidence to thermal
     equilibrium of a gas slightly disturbed therefrom and
included in a solid vessel whose walls retain a constant
temperature. The problem differs from those considered by
Fourier in consequence of the mobility of the gas, which
may give rise to two kinds of complication. In the <U+FB01>rst
place gravity, taking advantage of the different densities
prevailing in various parts, tends to produce circulation. In
many cases the subsidence to equilibrium must be greatly
modi<U+FB01>ed thereby. But this effect diminishes with the amount
of the temperature disturbance, and for in<U+FB01>nitesimal dis
turbances the in<U+FB02>uence of gravity disappears. On the other
hand, the second complication remains, even though we limit
ourselves to in<U+FB01>nitesimal disturbances. When one part of
the gas expands in consequence of reception of heat by

radiation or conduction, it compresses the remaining parts,
and these in their turn become heated in accordance with the
laws of gases. To take account of this effect a special
investigation is necessary.
    But although the <U+FB01>xity of the boundary does not su<U+FB01>ice to
prevent local expansions and contractions and consequent
motions of the gas, we may nevertheless neglect the inertia of
these motions since they are very slow in comparison with
the free oscillations of the mass regarded as a resonator.
Accordingly the pressure, although variable with time, may
be treated as uniform at any one moment throughout the mass.

 An Elementary Course in the Integral Calculus. By Dr. I). A.
    MURRAY, Cornell University. Longmans, 1898. Pp. x + 288.
      R. MURRAY states his object to be to present “ the subject
         matter, which is of an elementary character, in a simple
 manner.” This he has succeeded in doing, and the work is well
 arranged and the explanations given are exceedingly clear. In
 Chapter I. he treats Integration as a process of summation, and in_
 Chapter II. as the inverse of (li<U+FB01>’erentiation. The author’s object
 herein is to give the student a clear idea of What the Integral Calculi s’
 is, andvot' the uses to which it- may be applied. The <U+FB01>rst ten chapters
 are devoted to a treatment of the matters handled in such works as'
 Williamson’s, Edwards’s, and other Well—known treatises. Chap-p
 ter XI. treats of approximate integration, and the application of;
 the Calculus t0 the measurement of areas. Here we have clear
 statements and proofs of the trapezoidal rule, Simpson’s one
 third rule, and Durand's rule. To this latter gentleman the,
 author is indebted for valuable suggestions of use to engineering
 students. ProF. Durand has also put at Dr. Murray’s disposal
 his article on “ Integral Curves ” (in the ‘ Sibley Journal of

   326                        Geological Society :—-¥
  Engineering,’ vol. xi. no. 4*), and his account of the ‘Fundamental
  Theory of the Planimeter ’+. Chapter XIII. is devoted to ordinary
  di<U+FB01>erential equations. The Appendix (some 50 pages) discusses
  some of the matters in the text at greater length than is required
' by the elementary student, and also contains a large collection of
  the <U+FB01>gures of the curves which are referred to in the exercises.
  Answers are given to these exercises, and further there is a full
  Index, and numerous brief historical notes which add to the
  utility of an excellent text-book. Dr. Murray suitably acknow
  ledges his great indebtedness to his predecessors in the same <U+FB01>eld.
  The book is very neatly and correctly printed, and is of handy size.

      In this paper the author describes the occurrence of a con

  movement, not only on the included pebbles, but also on the
  surface of one of the deposits. The rocks are coloured as basement
  Carboniferous rocks on the Geological Survey map. The Skiddaw
  Slates are succeeded by about 30 feet of a roughly strati<U+FB01>ed con
  glomerate, followed by 20 to 30 feet of rock with small pebbles, and
  that by a second coarse conglomerate. The pebbles possess the
  outward form of glacial boulders, but many of them are slicken
  sided, fractured, faulted, and indented.            The striaa are    oft-en
  curved, parallel, and covered by mineral deposit; the grains of
  the matrix are embedded in the grooves, while slickensiding often
  'occurs beneath the surface of the pebbles and the striae are seen
  to begin or end at a fault-plane. The surface of rock beneath

               In this paper the portion of the line, 10 miles in length, from
            Catesby to Rugby is described ; as the ground falls while the strata
            rise in this direction, quite low beds in the Lower Lias are met
           with near Rugby. The lowest zone exposed is that of Ammonitee
           semicostatus, in the lower part of which, and in Boulder Clay derived
           from it, A. Turneri has been found. The next succeeding zone, that
           of A. obtusus, although for the most part barren, yielded the charac
           teristic fossils at its base. The oxynotus-zone is well developed and
           well displayed, besides being richly fossiliferous. The zone of
           A. raricostatus merges into that of A. oxynotus below and that of
           A. armatus above, and is not more than 3 or 4 feet thick. The
           armatus-zone, beds between that and the Jamesoni-zone, and the
           Jamesoni-zone itself follow; the middle beds of the latter being
           rich in Rhynchonella and A. pettus, the name of this ammonite is
           attached to the zone bearing them. The Ibox-zone occurs east of
           Flecknoe, covered by rocks yielding A. Henleyi; and the highest
           beds of this cutting appear to belong to the capricomus-zone.
           Lists of the characteristic fossils of each zone are given, followed
           by a complete list of all those found in the Lower and Middle Lies
           of the cuttings, with a statement of their distribution.

           M.A., D.Sc., F.G.S.
              The Raggedstone and Midsummer Hills, consisting essentially of
           massive gneissic and sehistose rocks, are traversed by a curved
           depression which marks a line of profound dislocation, probably of
           the nature of a thrust-plane. This appears to dip towards the east,
           though with a relatively small hade. Along this depression occur
           strips of Cambrian and Silurian strata embedded in the Archaean
           massif, and indicating the presence of a deep and narrow dis
           located synclinal fold. In places, the foliation of the schists

   328                       Geological Society.
    shows a marked relation to the direction of this line, indicating
    in all probability a production of schists from the old material in
    post-Lower Palaeozoic times.
       The western boundary of the Archman massif is everywhere a
    fault, apparently a thrust-plane, but with a small hade. The
   direction of this plane is in close relation with the axis of the over
   fold into which the Cambrian rocks are thrown to the west of these
   hills.
       The western boundary of Chase End Hill is likewise a fault,
   which is probably a thrust-plane with a. tolerably low dip towards
   the eastern side. The thrust here also appears to have been
   accompanied by a secondary production of schists from the old
   gneissic series; and the Cambrian strata are overthrown in the
   vicinity of the fault.
       There is no evidence for the overlap of the Cambrian Series sup
   posed by Holl, the circumstance that the various zones of the
   Cambrian Series strike up against the Archaean axis being due to
  faulting.
       The Cambrian is represented by the following series :—

      Fossils are abundant in certain zones of each of the four sub
  divisions of the series.
      The Grey Shales rest conformany on the Black Shales, but the
  mutual relations of the remaining subdivisions can be decided only
  by inference, the junctions being apparently everywhere faults.
  The junction betWecn the Cambrian and Archaean is likewise a
 fault.
      All four divisions of the Cambrian Series are invaded by small
  igneous bosses, laccolites, and intercalated sheets of diabase and
  andesitic basalt. These igneous rocks do not penetrate the May
 Hill Series.                                '                        v p
     The May Hill Beds seem to rest with apparent conformity upon
 the Grey Shales, and do not transgress across the various Cambrian
'zones on to the ATOlJtB<U+FB02>Il in the manner hitherto supposed, the
 presumed outliers being small patches faulted into the Cambrian.
     The structure of the district is to be explained on the supposition
 that we are dealing with the western margin of an old mountain
 chain overfolded towards the west; the eastern portion of this
 range lies faulted down and buried beneath the Permian and
 Mesozoic of the Vale of Gloucester. All the characteristics of a
folded chain are present, namely, the profound folds, overfolds,
 thrust-planes, and transverse faults; and a typical Austonungs
 zone is seen to the west.

      BY TITO MARTINI *.
 IN my second paper presented, last April, at the R. Istituto
         Veneto, I dealt with the calori<U+FB01>c phenomena observed in
 moistening' pulverized bodies. The method of experiments has
 already been describedi"; that is to say, of an arrangement whereby
 the liquid ascended to the powder, thoroughly dried, placed in a
 glass tube separated from it by a piece of light linen cloth. In
 this second series of experiments some modi<U+FB01>cations were intro—
 duced in order to keep the powder as dry as possible till the be
 ginning of the experiment. The thermometer-bulb was placed in
  contact with the upper stratum of powder, it having been noticed that
 the increase of temperature was more marked from layer to layer.
      In the following tables are indicated some of the principal
 results obtained with pure charcoal and pure silica ($0,).

water; at one time he would use a quantity of water equal in
weight to the powder, at another time a quantity double, and at

quantity of liquid which I found would be absorbed, by capillarity,

              EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BRUSH DISCHARGE.
               To the Editors of the Philos0phical Magazine.
    GENTLEMEN,
    I have read with considerable interest the paper by Dr. Cook
 on the “ Brush Discharge ” in the January number of your
 Magazine. May I be allowed to call attention to some experiments
 made by Lord Blythswood about two years ago, which are of a very

    I This phenomenon is generally known by the name of “unipolar”
 induction; “ autopolar" induction (induction antopolaire, Gleichpolin
 duction), it seems to me, would be better; and therefore 1 propose this
 term.    Then, in contradistinction, “heteropolar” induction (induction
 hétéro olaire, Wechselpoliuduction) can be used for signifying induction
 by hot the oles alternately (dynamo &c.).                          >

similar character. In this case, however, it was the negative glow
which was the source of radiation. The machine used was of the
Wimshurst- type, having 160 3-t't. plates each carrying 16 sectors.
   The experiments were made to determine the effect of the rays
from the negative glow on a photographic plate.
   Small metallic objects were “radiographed,” being placed in
front of, but not touching, a sensitized plate. The whole was then
enclosed in a zinc box (with a small hole cut in the side facing the
source of radiation), which was carefully earthed in order to
prevent any charge on the metallic object affecting the plate. A
piece of 1 mil. aluminium-foil was then placed between the source
of radiation and the plate, thus completing the metallic sheath.
The arrangement is shown below.

   When these precautions were not observed, brush discharges
took place from the points of the metallic object (generally a
small wheel) which strongly a<U+FB01>ected the plate.
   Distinct shadows of the small wheel were obtained after 5
minutes’ exposure in a darkened room. It was at <U+FB01>rst thought that
these photographs were produced by rays similar to the :v-rays,
which had traversed the aluminium-foil; but it appeared afterwards
that the whole eifect was apparently due to minute holes in the
aluminium-foil, since, when the apparatus was wrapped in black
velvet, no effects were produced on the plate. That such e<U+FB02>ects were
obtained, however, seems to show that the negative glow possesses
strong actinic power, as shown so conclusively by Dr. Cook.
   A possible explanation of the diminished e<U+FB01>’ect observed by
Dr. Cook on an Electroscope placed at a distance from a point at
which a Brush discharge is taking place, when an induction-coil was
used in place of the Wimshurst machine, seems to be that the
electri<U+FB01>cation produced would depend on the R.M.S. potential
(liliterence rather than on the maximum value, as indicated by the
spark-length.      Similarly for the mechanical force produced by the
wind from the points.

334                Dr. C. Chree on Longitudinal
“ obtained as a second approximation by Lord Rayleigh.” I
further said, “We do not think, however, that his proof affords
any means of judging of the degree of accuracy of the result,
as it is founded on a more or less probable hypothesis and
does not profess to be rigid.” I subsequently learned that
Lord Rayleigh did not admit any want of rigidity in his
proof, and it appears without modi<U+FB01>cation in the second
edition of his Treatise on ‘ Sound.’ I much regret having to
differ from so eminent an authority, but I have not altered
my original opinion.
    In (B) I reached the more general result
                       k=p<E/pr<1—sp2re>.- - - - - (3)
where x is the radius of gyration of the cross section of the
rod about its axis. This was established by a strict elastic
solid method for an elliptic section, and in a somewhat less
rigid way for a rectangular section. (A) and (B) were con
 <U+FB01>ned, like the investigations of Lord Rayleigh and Professor
 Pochhammer, to isotropic materials.
    In (C) I considered the more general case of an aeolotropic
 bar whose long axis was an axis of material symmetr , and
 found by strict elastic solid methods that (2) still held for
 a circular section, if E denoted Young’s modulus for stress
 along the length of the bar, and 'r) Poisson’s ratio for the
 consequent perpendicular contractions. Further, applying
 LordRayleigh’s method, modi<U+FB01>ed in a way I deem necessary,
 I obtained (3) for any form of cross section.
     § 3. Since the publication of (( 3) Mr. Love has discussed the
 subject in vol. ii. of his ‘ Treatise on Elasticity.’ On his p. 119 *
 he refers to (2) as “<U+FB01>rst given by Prof. Pochhammer. . .
 and afterwards apparently independently by Mr. Chree.”
 Again, in the new edition of his ‘Sound’ Lord Rayleigh,
  after deducing (2), says “A more complete solution. . . has
  been given by Pochhammer . . . A similar investigation has
  also been published by Chree.”
     In view of these remarks, I take this opportunity of stating
 explicitly :—
     1. That Pochhammer’s work was wholly unknown to me
  until the appearance of Love’s ‘Elasticity.’
     2. That my method of solution in (A) is essentially different
  from Pochhammer’s, while the methods in (B) and (C) are
  absolutely different from his. The method of (A) agrees
  with Pochhammer’s in employing the equations of elasticity
  in cylindrical coordinates. After obtaining, however,—as is
       The preface, p. 13, describes the result as “ obtained independently ”
  by “me;

              Vibrations in Solid and Hollow Cylimlers.        335
  customary in most elastic problems—the differential equation
 for the dilatation, Pochhammer obtains a differential equation
  for the quantity
                 ~           1 du       (1w
_                            2 (dz _ d1“ ’
  u and w being the displacements parallel to the radius r and
  the axis 2‘, and uses this quantity as a stepping-stone to the
  values of u and w. On the other hand, I succeeded in
  separating u and w so as to obtain at once two differential
  equations, in one of which u appeared alone with the dilatation,
  while the other contained only 10 and the dilatation (see (28)
 and (29) later).
     §4. There are two other points in Mr. Love’s Treatise to
  which I should like to refer. In his art. 263 he substitutes
  the term extensional for longitudinal, adding in explanation,
  “The vibrations here considered are the ‘ longitudinal’ vibra
  tions of Lord Rayleigh’s Theory of Sound. We have
  described them as ‘ extensional,’ to avoid the suggestion that
  there is no lateral motion of the parts of the rod.”
     I am altogether in sympathy with the object which Mr.
  Love has in view (1 expressed myself somewhat strongly on
  the point in (A) p. 296, and (U) pp. 351—2), but I doubt the
   wisdom of attempting to displace a term so generally adopted
  as longitudinal.
      In the second matter I regret to <U+FB01>nd myself at variance
  with Mr. Love.     Referring to transverse vibrations in a rod,
  he says on p. 124 of his vol. ii., “ the boundary conditions at
  free ends cannot be satis<U+FB01>ed exactly . . . as they can in the . . .
  extensional (longitudinal) modes.” In reality, however, the
   boundary equations at a free end are not exactly satis<U+FB01>ed in
  the case of longitudinal vibrations either by Pochhammer’s
  solution or my own. The slip may be a purely verbal one on
   Mr. Love’s part, but his readers might be led to accept the
   statement as accurate owing to a slight error in the expression
   for the shearing stress z'r near the top of Mr. Love’s p. 120.
  We <U+FB01>nd there

 Owing to the omission of L in the expression on p. 120 it

    § 5. In the Camb. Phil. Soc. Trans. vol. xv. pp. 313-337
I showed how the mean values of the strains and stresses
might be obtained in any elastic solid problem independently
 of a complete solution. For isotropic materials I obtained
(l. c. p. 318) three formulas of the type
  Ef<U+FB02>ng dy dz=                {Zz-q(Xm + Yy) } dx dy dz
                               +f {Hz—n(F.z*+ Ga) }ds, . (4)
where a, ,8, 'y are com onents of displacement, X, Y, Z 0f
bodily forces, and F, , H of surface forces. The volume
integrals extend throughout the entire volume, and the surface
integrals over the entire surface of the solid. As was explicitly
stated in proving the results (l. c. p. 315), X, Y, Z may include
‘reversed effective forces ’                            ’

   In the present application there are no real bodily forces ;
we may also leave surface forces out of account, if we suppose
thatowhen one end of a rod is held, that end lies in the plane

   Supposing the rod to vibrate with frequency k/21r, we have

  alone applies to longitudinal vibrations, at and ,8 are odd and

  where e is a constant depending on the position of the origin
  of coordinates and the terminal conditions. It is obvious
  from various considerations that the same 6 occurs in the
 values of a, ,8, 7. Certain relations must subsist between the
 constants A, B, C in the above expressions, in virtue of the
 bod -stress equations, but we do not require to take any heed
 of t ese for our present purpose.
      § 6. As the validity of solutions in series has been a subject
 of contention in other elastic solid problems, some doubt may
 be entertained as to the results            I would be the last to
 deny the reasonableness of this, because I do not myself
 regard (6) as universally applicable.
      According to     my investigations, quantities such as
 (Aawa/Alz') are of the order (greatest diameter/nodal length) 2,
 and the series become less rapidly convergent as (greatest
 diameter/nodal length) increases. In other words, increase
 either in (greatest diameter/rod length) or in the order of the
 “ harmonic ” ot' the fundamental note reduces the rapidity of
convergence. The proper interpretation, however, to put on
 this is not that (6) is a wrong formula for longitudinal
vibrations, but simply that under the conditions speci<U+FB01>ed the
vibrations tend to depart too widely from the longitudinal
 type. If we apply this solution the results deduced from it
themselves tend to show the degree of rapidity of the con
vergence, and what we have to do is to keep our eye on the
results and accept them only so long as they are consistent
with rapid convergency.
     Perhaps the following résumé of my views on this point
may be useful :—
     1. 1n obtaining (6) originally I employed the complete
elastic solid equations for isotropic materials. In other cases
where dif<U+FB01>culties haVe arisen over expansion in series, they
seem mainly due to the fact that the elastic solid equations have
been whittled down in the <U+FB01>rst instance for purposes of

338                Dr. C. Uhree on Longitudinal
sim licity. When one omits terms in a differential equation for
dip omatic reasons, the results may be perfectly satisfactory
under certain limitations. Owing, however, to the mutilation
of the differential equations, the resulting solutions are unlikely
to contain within themselves any satisfactory indication of the
limits to their usefulness. It is very much a case of running
 a steam-engine without a safety-valve.
     2. When the bar is of circular section and isotropic, the
 series occurring in (6) are Bessel’s functions of a well-known
 type, whose rapidity of convergence appears well ascertained
 under the normal conditions of the problem. When the
 section is circular, and the material not isotropic but sym
 metrical round the axis, the series, whose mathematical law of
 development I have obtained, converge to all appearance quite
 as rapidly as in the case of isotropy. The other cases of
 isotropic material—sections elliptical or rectangular—which
  I have considered present similar features ; the only difference
 being that the rate of convergence diminishes with increase
 in any one dimension of the cross section.
      3. If we suppose k=0, or the vibrations to be of in<U+FB01>nite
  period, the solution must reduce to that for the equilibrium of
  a rod under uniform longitudinal traction. Now, in the case
  of equilibrium ry/z reduces to a constant, while a and B are
  linear in a: and y for allforms of cross section. The commencing
  terms in series (6) are thus of the proper form under all
  conditions, and the form of the di<U+FB02>'erential equations shows
  that it' a, for instance, contains a term in .2' it must contain
  terms in $3, .zyg, and other integral powers of .z' and y. ,
      4. The general type of the differential equations is the
   same for all kinds of elastic material, isotropic or aeolotropic, '
   and the surface conditions are identical in all' cases; thus the
   type of solution must always be the same. The results may
   become enormously lengthy for complicated kinds of aeolo
   tropy, but by putting a variety of the elastic constants equal
   to one another we must reduce the most complicated of these
   expressions to coincidence with the corresponding results for
   isotropy. Of course it does not follow that the convergence
   will be equally rapid for all materials. A large value of a
   Poisson’s ratio in conjunction with an elongated dimension
   of the cross section may reduce the convergency so much as
   to throw the higher “ harmonics” outside the pale of longi
   tudinal vibrations.
       5. The more the section departs from the circular form
    the less rapid in general is the convergence, and the larger
    the correction supplied by the second approximation. In
    fact the size of the correction is probably the best criterion

            Vibrations in Solid and Hollow Cylinders.               339
by which to judge of the limitations of our results. If the
correction is large even for the fundamental note, it is pretty
safe to conclude that the section is not one adapted for the
ordinary type of longitudinal vibrations. If a section, for
instance, were of an acutely stellate character, with a lot of
rays absent and the centroid external to the material, I for
one should be extremely chary of applying to it the ordinary
formula.
   §7. For de<U+FB01>niteness let us consider the <U+FB01>xed-free vib'ra
tions, taking the origin of coordinates at the centroid of the
<U+FB01>xed end. Our terminal conditions are

These conditions give at once

based on ordinary elastic solid methods I should hesitate to
maintain. Unless one knew beforehand a good deal about
the problem there would, I fear, be considerable risk of mis
adventure.
    §8. In illustrating the method in detail I have selected
the case of isotropic material simply because I did not wish
to frighten my readers. The assumption of isotropy almost
invariably shortens the mathematical expressions, and gene
rally also simpli<U+FB01>es the character of the mathematical opera_
tions; and isotropic solids thus <U+FB02>ourish in the text-books to a
much greater degree than they do in nature.           When, how-'
ever, the mathematical difficulties are trifling, as in the
present case, it seems worth while considering some less
specialized material. I shall thus brie<U+FB02>y indicate the appli
cation of' the method to the case of material symmetrical with
 respect to the three rectangular planes of w, y, 2, taken as in
the previous example. In this case the stress-strain relations
 involve, on the usual hypothesis, nine elastic constants.
 Such quantities as Young’s modulus or Poisson’s ratio must
 be de<U+FB01>ned by reference to directions. Thus let E1, E2, E3
denote the three principal Young’s moduli, the directions 1, 2, 3
 being taken along the axes of a', y, 2 respectively. There
 are six corresponding Poisson’s ratios, each being de<U+FB01>ned by
 two suf<U+FB01>xes, the <U+FB01>rst indicating the direction of the longitu
 dinal pull, the second that of the contraction.      For instance,
 1],, applies in the case of the contraction parallel to the
 y-axis due to pull parallel to the .z-axis. The order of the
 suffixes is not immaterial, but there exist the following
 relations :—

 From the nature of the elastic solid equations the expres
 sions for the displacements must be of the same general form
as for isotropy, so that we may still apply the formulae (6)
 for a, B, 7. Doing so, and following exactly the same pro
 cedure as in the case of isotropy, we obtain from (16), for
any shape of section,

   The fact that (43) is merely a special case of (3) or (22)
may seem to indicate that our separate treatment of the
hollow cylinder, or tube, is quite unnecessary. I can onl
say that having regard to the methods by which (3) and (22)

desirability of an independent investigation.

further remarks to the form of the longitudinal displacement

seen that A’/A and U/U are both of the order (p2ab)2. Thus,
 to the present degree of approximation, we may leave the A’

 in my earlier papers for solid cylinders; the '1" term repre
 senting one of the additions I deem it necessary to make to
 Lord Rayleigh’s assumed type of vibration.
     The paraboloidal form of cross section, met with except at
 nodes or when cos kt vanishes, seems to me an interesting
 feature of the longitudinal type of vibrations. Possibly,
 observations on light re<U+FB02>ected from a polished terminal face
 might lead a skilled experimentalist to interesting conclusions
 as to the value of 17.
     It should, however, be borne in mind that, inasmuch as the
terminal condition zr=0 is not exactly satis<U+FB01>ed by the above
 solution in <U+FB01>xed-free vibrations,there may be a slight de arture
from the theoretical form in the immediate neighbourhood of

paring the results of such an investigation with the theoretical
results here determined, several considerations must, however,
be borne in mind.
     Statical and dynamical elastic moduli are to some extent
different, so that the value of E occurring in (2) or (3) is not
that directly measured by statical experiments *. In other
words the difference between the observed frequency of the
fundamental vibration in a <U+FB01>xed-free bar, and the frequency

if E be determined directly by statical experiments, is not to
be wholly attributed to the defect of the ordinary <U+FB01>rst
approximation formula. Again, it must be remembered that
E varies 1', often to a very considerable extent, in material
nominally the same; so that the difference of pitch observed

  in different rods cannot- without further investigation be safely
  ascribed to differences in the area or shape of their cross
  sections. Further, elastic moduli may alter under mechanical
  treatment, so that it would be unsafe to assume if a hollow
  bar were further hollowed or were altered in shape, that its
   Young’s modulus would remain unaffected.
        If it were possible to measure with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy the
  frequency of the fundamental note and several of its
  “ harmonics ” in a single rod, one would have a more certain
  basis of comparison with the theoretical results. Even in
  this case, however, there is the consideration that in practice
  the rod must be supported in some way, and this is likely to
  introduce some constraint not accurately represented by the
  theoretical conditions. Again, reaction between the vibrating
  rod and the surrounding medium may not be absolutely
  without influence on the pitch *.
       I mention these dif<U+FB01>culties because their recognition may
  prevent a considerable waste of time on the part of anyone
  engaged in experiments on the subject.
       Though somewhat of a side issue, it may be worth remark
  ing that the correction factor l—epenelc' for the frequency in
  isotropic material contains no elastic constant except Poisson’s
  ratio. Thus observations made on rods differing only in
  material might throw some light on the historic question
  whether 17 is or is not the same for all isotropic substances.

 side of the problem has been largely expanded at the suggestion
 of the Society’s referee.

 IN an article published in ‘Nature’ for Nov. 19, 1874,
          Prof. Everett, in discussing the phenomenon of mirage,
 showed that the condition necessary for the formation of sharp
 images in a horizontally strati<U+FB01>ed atmosphere, is a plane of
 maximum refractive index, the optical density decreasing as
 we go above or below this plane in direct proportion to the
 distance.
      A horizontal or nearly horizontal ray will be bent towards
and cross the plane of maximum density, where it changes
its curvature and is again bent towards the plane, which it

350          Mr. It. “I. lVood on some 'E.v))erinwnts
may thus cross again and again, traversing a path which is
approximately a sine curve.
    While showing the curve-trajectory of a ray of light in a
vessel <U+FB01>lled with brine, the density of which increased with
the depth, it occurred to me that by properly regulating the
refractive index of the liquid, the ray might be made to
traverse a sine curve.
    Some attempts in this direction were so successful, and
yielded such beautiful experiments for the lecture-room, that
it seems worth while to publish them, together with some
   hotographs of the trajectories, although, as I have since
lbarned, very similar experiments have already been described
 by Wiener (“ Gekriimmte Lichtstrahlen,” Wied. Annalen,
 xlix. p. 105).
     For the liquid 1 adopted an arrangement very similar to
 the one described by Prof. Everett for obtaining mirage in a
 rectangular tank.
     A trough was <U+FB01>rst made of plate glass, about 50 cms. long,
 10 cms. high, and 2 cms. wide.      This was <U+FB01>lled to the depth
 of 3 cms. with a concentrated solution of alum.      By means of
 a pipette, of the form shown in P1. III. <U+FB01>g. 1, water containing
 about 10 per cent. of alcohol was carefully deposited on the
 alum solution to a depth of 3 ems. The addition of the alcohol
 brings up the refractive index of the water, and is necessary
 for reasons that will be spoken of presently. As a liquid of
 high index, with a speci<U+FB01>c gravity intermediate between that
 of the other two liquids, Iused, instead of sugar and whiskey,
 a mixture of glycerine and 85 per cent. alcohol, the right pro
  portions being easily found by experiment.
     The mixture should <U+FB02>oat on the alum solution and sink in
 the water, and is introduced between the two layers by means
  of the pipette at the end of the trough through which the ray
 is to enter. A layer about 3 ems. in thickness will be found
  about right.
     All three of the solutions should be <U+FB01>rst acidi<U+FB01>ed with a few
  drops of sulphuric acid, and rendered fluorescent with quinine.
     The difference in surface-tension between the two upper
  layers may give some trouble: when the pipette is withdrawn
  it may draw a thread of the glycerine and alcohol mixture up
  through the water, and a complete upsetting of the layers
  occur as a result of the forces of surface-tension.
      This invariably happens when alcohol is not added to the
  water, and can be remedied either by the addition of water to
  the glycerine mixture or of more alcohol to the water. It is
  a good plan in withdrawing the pipette to pull it out slowly
  in avery oblique direction, in order that the heavy liquid may
   be washed off before the tube reaches the surface.

              on Artificial Mraycs and Tornadoes.           351
   The three layers may now be cautiously stirred to hasten
the diffusion, after which they should be allowed to rest a few
minutes until the strize have disappeared.
   If new a beam of light from an arc-lamp, made parallel by
means of a condensing-lens, be thrown obliquely into one end
of the trough, it will be seen to traverse the liquid in the
form of a most beautiful blue wave, the curvature of which
varies with the angle at which the ray enters.         Rays of
light travelling in sine curves are shown in <U+FB01>gs. 2 and 3,
which were photographed directly from the trough.
   Prof. Everett showed in his paper that a parallel or slightly
divergent ray entering a medium of this description would
converge to a linear focus, and then successively diverge
and converge to conjugate foci. This phenomenon is shown
in <U+FB01>g. 4, which is a photograph of the trough with a rather
wide beam of horizontal parallel light entering the end.
This experiment I have never seen described, though Exner
has shown that the eyes of some insects operate in a similar
manner, the visual organ consisting of a transparent cylin
drical body, the axis of which has a high refractive index,
while as we approach the surface the optical density decreases
continuously.
   The beautiful miniature desert-mirages that I have witnessed
on the level city pavements of San Francisco (see letter and
photograph in ‘Nature ’ for Oct. 20, 1898), suggested to me
the idea of reproducing this phenomenon on a small scale in
the class-room.
   Although I have already described very brie<U+FB02>y an expe-'
riment of this nature, I will repeat the description now some
what more in detail. Three or four perfectly <U+FB02>at metal
plates, each one about a metre long and 30 cms. wide, should
be mounted end to end on iron tripods and accurately levelled.
The plates should be thick enough not to buckle when heated,
say 0'5 cm. I have used plaster plates, made by casting
plaster of Paris on plate glass, with some success, though they
are fragile and not very durable.
   Probably plates of slate would serve admirably, since they
will stand a fair amount of heating, and can be obtained very
<U+FB02>at and smooth.
   The plates must be thickly sprinkled with sand to destroy
all traces of re<U+FB02>exion at grazing incidence, and the sand sur
face should appear perfectly level when looked along from a
point just above its plane. On the absolute <U+FB02>atness of the
desert depends the successful working of the experiment;
therefore too much care cannot be given to the adjustment of
the plates. An arti<U+FB01>cial sky must be formed at one end of the
desert. If the experiment is being performed at night, a

sheet of thin writing-paper with an arc-lamp behind it works
very well, but a large mirror set in a window and re<U+FB02>ecting
the sky is better, when daylight is to be had.
   Between the sky and the desert a small range of mountains,
cut out of pasteboard, should be set up. The individual peaks
should be from 1 to 2 cm. high, and the valleys between them
should be only a tri<U+FB02>e above the level of the desert. The general
arrangement is shown in fig. 5.
    The plates are now heated by means of a row of burners,
 which should be moved about from time to time in order to
 prevent overheating any one place.
    If new we look along the desert, holding the eye only a
 tri<U+FB02>e above the level of the sand, we shall see the mountains
 sharply outlined against the sky: as the temperature rises a
 lake begins to form in front of the mountain-chain, and in a
 few moments the inverted images of the peaks appear as if
 re<U+FB02>ected in the water. If the eye be depressed a tri<U+FB02>e, the
 base of the mountain-chain vanishes completely in the illusory
 lake, which now appears as an inundation. These appear
 ances are shown in <U+FB01>g. 6. the photographs having been taken
 of the actual mirage on the arti<U+FB01>cial desert. The <U+FB01>rst of the
 three shows the appearance when the plates are cold, the
 second the apparent lake with the images of the peaks in the
 water, and the third the vanishing of the lower portions of
 the range. Two or three palm-trees, cut out of paper, were
 stuck up to add to the effect. Vertical magni<U+FB01>cation can also
 be shown on-the hot desert: if the mountains are removed
 and a small marble be laid on the sand at the farther end of
 the desert, it will be found that if the eye be brought into
 the right position, the circular outline will change into an
 ellipse, and as the eye is lowered the image will contract to a
 point and eventually disappear. The magni<U+FB01>cation in this
 case is of course due to the running together of the direct
 and refracted images. I have observed similar cases in
 looking across our lake, when the water was warm and the
 air cold, patches of snow on the opposite shore, too small to
 be visible to an eye several metres above the level of the lake,
 coming out very distinctly when one walked down a bank to
 the water’s edge.
    The atmospheric conditions existing when lnirages of this
 description are observed are such as give rise to the dust
 whirls, so often seen on the American desert, and when
 existing on a larger scale, to tornadoes. There seemed no
 reason why these whirlwinds should not be produced on a
 small scale as well as the mirages. One of the metal plates
 was sprinkled with precipitated silica and heated with a few
 burners: in a few minutes most beautiful little whirlwinds

  began to run about over the surface, spinning the <U+FB01>ne powder
  up in funnel-shaped vortices, which lasted sometimes ten or
  <U+FB01>fteen seconds. The silica powder must be made by igniting
  the gelatinous precipitate formed when silicon tetra<U+FB02>uoride is
 Conducted into water. The commercial article is not suf<U+FB01>
 ciently light and mobile.
     Whirls formed in this way cannot be seen by a large
 audience, however, and I accordingly sought some way of
 making them on a larger scale. The plate was well heated
 after removing the silica and then dusted with sal-ammoniac:
 dense clouds of white vapour immediately arose from the hot
 surface, and presently in the centre there mounted to a height
 of about 2 metres a most perfect miniature tornado of dense
 smoke. By placing the plate in the beam of a lantern in a
 dark room, the whirls can be shown to a class in a large
 lecture-room. I <U+FB01>nd that it is best to put on the sal-ammoniac
 <U+FB01>rst and then heat the plate: the vortices then come off the
 plate almost continuously, and often persist for some time.
    Al instantaneous photograph of one of these tornadoes was
 taken in bright sunshine, and is reproduced in <U+FB01>g. 7.
    This method of showing atmospheric vortices seems far
 preferable to the old way of forming them, by means of a
 rapidly whirling-drum with cross partitions, as the whirls are
 produced by the same causes and under the same conditions
that they are in nature.

 XXX]. 0n the Thermal Properties of Normal Pentane.              By
    J. BOSE-INNES, M.A., B.Sc., and SYDNEY YOUNG, D.Sc.,
    F.R.S.*
IN the year 1894 an experimental investigation of the
        relations between the temperatures, pressures, and
volumes of lsopentane, through a very wide range of volume,
was carried out by one of us, and the results were published
in the Proc. Phys. Soc. xiii. pp. 602—65 7. It was there shown
that the relation p=bT—a at constant volume (where a and
b are constants depending on the nature of the substance and
on the volume) holds good with at any rate but small error
from the largest volume (4000 cub. cms. per gram) to the
smallest (1'58 cub. cms. per gram).
    1n the neighbourhood of the critical volume (4'266 cub.
ems), and at large and very small volumes, the observed
deviations were well within the limits of experimental error
  * Communicated by the Physical Society: read December 9, 1898.

354          Mr. J. Rose-Innes and Dr. S. Young on the
but at intermediate volumes they were somewhat greater, and,
as they exhibited considerable regularity, it is a question
whether they could be attributed entirely to errors of experi
ment. In any case, the relation may be accepted as a close
approximation to the truth.
       A quantity of pure normal pentane having been obtained
by the fractional distillation of the light distillate from
American petroleum, it was decided to carry out a similar
 investigation with this substance; but, as it had been found
 that isopentane vapour at the largest volumes behaves
 practically as a normal gas, it was not considered necessary
 to make the determinations through so wide a range of
 volume.
        The method employed for the separation of the normal
 pentane from petroleum has been fully described inthe Trans.
 Chem. Soc. 1897, lxxi. p. 442; and the vapour-pressures,
 speci<U+FB01>c volumes as liquid and saturated vapour, and critical
 constants have been given in the same journal (p. 446).
        The data for the isothermals of normal pentaner' were
  obtained by precisely the same experimental methods as in
  the case of isopentane, and reference need, therefore, only be
  made to the previous paper (100. cit.).
        There were four series of determinations ; and particulars as
  to the mass of pentane, and the data obtained in each series
  are given below :—

         The correction for the vapour-pressure of mercury was
      made in the same way as with isopentane : when liquid was
      present it was assumed that the mercury vapour exerted no
      pressure; in Series 1., above the critical point, one-fourth
      of the maximum vapour-pressure of mercury was subtracted;
      in Series II. one-half ; in Series III. three-fourths ; and in
      Series IV. the full pressure.

     An examination of this table shows that 1' remains fairly
constant for all large volumes down to about vol. 8. The
actual numbers obtained vary a good deal ; but these variations
are sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, and
 there is no steady increase or decrease. It appears, then,
 that all the values of 7 above vol. 8 could be treated as the
 same without introducing any serious error; this occurred
 likewise in the case of isopentane. What is still more note
 worthy is that the same constant value of '1- could be used for
 both normal pentane and isopentane, keeping within the
 limits of experimental error. The mean value of 'r for all
 Volumes above 8 was found to be 8424 for isopentane ; it is
 8385 for normal pentane; and the intermediate value 840
could be used in both cases without introducing any error
 greater than the unavoidable errors of experiment.
     When we pass on to the neighbourhood of the critical
 point, the value of 7- diminishes steadily as the volume
decreases. For the critical volume itself '1' is about 807, and
for vol. 2 it has sunk to 488.
     The most important conclusion arrived at in the case of
isopentane was that the molecular pressure a does not follow
a continuous law, but passes abruptly from one law to
another somewhere about vol. 3'4 (Phil. Mag. xliv. p. 79).
This inference was based 011 the study of a diagram in which
the quantity al—v—Q was plotted against 0'3, and there appeared
to be considerable evidence of discontinuity in the neighbour
hood of the volume already mentioned.            Of course it is
impossible to prove discontinuity of slope by means of a
series of isolated points, but it is suggested very strongly;
and even if there be not discontinuity in the true mathematical
sense of the term, there seems to be such a rapid change of
behaviour as to amount practically to the same thing.
    It was therefore a matter of some interest to discover
whether the diagram obtained by plotting {1%, against o't in
the case of normal pentane would exhibit the same peculiarity.
The diagram is given on p. 363, and it is easily seen that we
have here a similar suggestion of discontinuity in the slope of
  l       .                                        .  .
(IT), ; thls occurs somewhere about vol. 3'4, as W1th 1sopentane.
    In attempting to <U+FB01>nd a formula for the pressure of normal
pentane we are therefore confronted with the possibility that
we may require two distinct algebraic equations. We may
simplify the problem considerably by con<U+FB01>ning our attention

        to volumes lying above 3'4 ; and this limitation still leaves us
        with all those conditions of the substance in which we can
        most usefully compare it with isopentane.
           Looking at the table on p. 362, which gives the series of
        values of all)? and comparing it with the similar table for
        isopentane (Proc. Phys. Soc. xiii. pp. 654, 655), we notice
        that at the same volume the value of 51,—.) is always smaller in
        the former case than in the latter.      The difference is not great,
       but it remains too persistently with the same sign for us to
        disregard it. As we proceed to larger and larger volumes,
       however, the difference diminishes on the whole, and an
       interesting question arises whether we should be justi<U+FB01>ed in
       treating it as ultimately vanishing when 21 is made in<U+FB01>nite.

      To elucidate this point a diagram was drawn in which the
  ' differences of all)? between isopentane and normal pentane
      were plotted against v‘i ; this diagram is reproduced
     above. The diminution in the di<U+FB02>'erences with increase of
     volume is well shown in spite of the “ wobbling” at large

366      Mr. J. Rose-Innes and Dr. S. Young on the
volumes; and a line running through the points might
apparently end at zero difference.     But though this result
might be accepted as consistent with the experimental
evidence if there were independent grounds for believing in
it, it cannot be considered as the most probable judging
solely from the diagram ; we should be rather led to believe
that even at in<U+FB01>nite volumes the value of all), for isopentane
remained larger than that for normal pentane.
   The ab0ve results respecting a and 'r are chie<U+FB02>y interesting
because they seem capable of throwing some light on the
vexed question of the in<U+FB02>uence exerted by difference of
chemical structure on the thermal properties of a substance.
Concerning this matter very little is known at present ; but
it is common knowledge among organic chemists that two
substances may have the same chemical composition and
show practically the same behaviour whilst in the condition
of rare vapour, and yet they may di<U+FB02>'er considerably as to
their thermal properties in the liquid state. The great <U+FB01>eld
of observation in which the substances lie between the con
ditions of a rare vapour and a common liquid has been left
almost entirely unexplored. This gap in our knowledge
makes it impossible to say in what precise manner the differ
ence between two isomeric substances originates ; whether it
arises conjointly with the <U+FB01>rst deviations from Boyle’s law,
or whether the difference remains inappreciable even with
increasing density until we reach the neighbourhood of the
critical point. We may put the problem more precisely as
follows :—If we imagine the pressure given by a series of
ascending powers of the density, what is the lowest power of
the density which has different coef<U+FB01>cients for two isomeric
substances?
   We are now able to answer this question with a fair amount
of exactnessin the case of the two isomers, normal pentane and
isopentane. If, as seems most probable, there is a difference
between the (£5, for normal pentane and the (171,,— for iso
pentane, even at in<U+FB01>nitely large volumes, this shows that the
coef<U+FB01>cients of the second power of the density in the expan
sion of 12 must be different for the two substances.    On the
other hand, if there is no difference between the 5%.; for
normal pentane and the a—lv—2 for isopentane at in<U+FB01>nitely large
volumes, then the coef<U+FB01>cients of the second power of the
density in the expansion for p must be the same, since 7 has

            Thermal Properties of Normal Pentane.           367
already been shown to have the same value for the two sub
stances at in<U+FB01>nite volumes; and the lowest power of the
density which has different coef<U+FB01>cients for the two isomers
must be the third.
   It was thought advisable to test these conclusions by a
different method. In a former paper by one of the authors
(Phil. Mag. xliv. p. 80; see also Phil. Mag. xlv. p. 105) it
was shown that in the case of isopentane we might reproduce
the original observations very closely by putting
             )_ RT { 1 +         e      }        l
            l_ v           v+/c—5w—2 -'v(v+/c)’
where R, a, la, y, and l are constants. If we assume that this
formula holds also for normal pentane, and if it be true that
the difference of pressure between normal pentane and iso
pentane at the same temperature and volume varies ultimately
as the third power of the density, then we should be able to
reproduce the experimental data for normal pentane by
means of the above formula, giving to R, e, and l the values
already found for isopentane. We may accordingly take
1t=863'56, e=7°473, l=5420800, and we still have the
constants k and 9 left at our disposal to meet the requirements
of the normal pentane data. On examinin the observations
given in Series I. of this paper we <U+FB01>nd tiat we can con
veniently put Ic=3'135, g=6'695, and we have to test how
far the formula with these constants reproduces the experi
mental results given in Series 11., 111., and IV. In order to
institute an e<U+FB01>'ective comparison between theory and observa
tion a diagram was made in which pv was plotted against 01;
the calculated isothermals were drawn as continuous lines,
while the experimental values were put in as dots. An
examination of the diagram shows that a fair concordance
between calculation and experiment has been secured; but
the agreement is not so good as could be wished. Deviations
amounting to l per cent. are not uncommon, and in places
they approach 2 per cent. If we have regard to the differ
ences which often occur in inquiries of this kind between the
results of independent observers, we might conclude that the
above deviations are unimportant, and that R, e, and l were
really the same for the two pentanes as supposed. But it
seems more likely that the deviations are too large to be
neglected; hence, the most probable inference is that thel
for normal pentane is not the same as the l for isopentane,
thereby con<U+FB01>rming our former conclusion.

XXXII. An Application of the Difraction- Grating t0 Colour
               Plzolography. By R. W. WOOD*.
    F a di<U+FB01>'raction- rating of moderate dispersion and a lens
      be placed in t e path of a beam of light coming from a
linear source, and the eye be placed in any one of the spectra
formed to the right and left of the central image, the entire
surface of the grating will appear illuminated with light of a
colour depending on the part of the spectrum in which the
eye is placed. If one part of the grating has a different
 spacing from the rest, the spectrum formed by this part will
be displaced relatively to the <U+FB01>rst; and if the eye be placed
in the overlapping part of the two spectra, the corresponding
portions of the grating will appear illuminated in different
colours. This principle I have made use of in the develop
ment of a new method for producing photographs in natural
colour. I have eliminated the use of pigments and coloured
screens entirely in the <U+FB01>nished picture, the photograph being
nothing more nor less than a di<U+FB01>'raction-grating of variable
spacing, the width between the lines in the different parts of
the picture being such as to cause them to appear illuminated
in their proper colours when viewed in the manner described.
   We will take at the start three diffraction-gratings of such
spacing that the deviation of the red of the <U+FB01>rst is the same
as that of the green of the second and the blue of the third
 (the red, green, and blue in question being of the tints of the
primary colours of the Young-Helmholtz theory of colour
vision). If these three gratings be mounted side by side in
front of a lens their spectra will overlap; and an eye placed
in the proper position will see the <U+FB01>rst grating red, the second
green, and the third blue. If the <U+FB01>rst and second be made
to overlap, this portion will send both red and green light to
the eye, and will in consequence appear yellow. If all three
be made to overlap in any place, this place will send red,
green, and blue light to the eye, and will appear white.
   The method that I <U+FB01>rst employed to produce photographs
showing natural colours on this principle is the following:—
Three negatives were taken through red, green, and blue
screens in the usual manner: from these, positives were made
on ordinary lantern-slides (albumen-slides are necessary for
reasons which I will speak of presently). The positives, when
dry, were <U+FB02>owed with bichromated gelatine and dried in
subdued light. The three diffraction-gratings of proper
spacing, ruled or photographed on glass, were placed over
these positives, and exposed to the sun or electric light for
                  * Communicated by the Author.

        Di<U+FB02>'raction-Grating and Coloztr-P/wtoymp/Ly.        369
thirty seconds. 0n washing these plates in warm water,
diffraction-gratings of great brilliancy were formed directly
on the surface of the <U+FB01>lm. Albumen-plates must be used,
since the warm water softens and dissolves a gelatine <U+FB01>lm.
Three sheets of thin glass, sensitized with the bichromated
gelatine, were placed under the three positives, and prints
taken from them. The portions of each plate on which the
light had acted bore the impression of the corresponding
diffraction-grating, strongly or feebly impressed, according to
the density of the different parts of the positives. These three
plates, when superimposed and placed in front of a lens and
illuminated by a narrow source of light, appear as a correctly
coloured picture, when viewed with the eye placed in the
proper position. Perfect registration of the di<U+FB01>'erent parts
of the picture could not be obtained in this way, for obvious
reasons. I worked for awhile with the thin glass from which
covers for microscopical slides are made. This gave much
better results, but was too fragile for practical purposes. It
then occurred to me that if 1 could get the entire grating
system on a single <U+FB01>lm, not only would the di<U+FB01>iculty about
perfect registration vanish, but the pictures could be repro
duced by simple contact-printing on chrom-gelatine plates as
easily as blue prints are made. I was surprised to <U+FB01>nd that
successive exposures of the same plate under the positives,
perfect registration being secured by marks on the plates,
produced the desired result. On washing this plate in warm
water and drying, it becomes the <U+FB01>nished coloured photograph.
Where the reds occur in the original, the spacing of the <U+FB01>rst
grating is present; where the yellows occur the spacings of
both the firstand second are to be found superimposed; where
the blues occur are the lines of the third grating; while in
the white parts of the picture all three spacings are present.
It seems almost incredible that, by exposing the plate in suc
cession under two gratings the spacings, of both should be
impressed—superimposed—in such a manner as to give the
colours of each in equal intensity; but such is the fact.  Thus
far I have had at my disposal but two gratings of only ap
proximately the right spacing, one giving the red, the other
the green: with these I have photographed stained-glass
windows, birds, and butter<U+FB02>ies, and other still-life objects,
the <U+FB01>nished pictures showing reds, yellows, and greens in a
most beautiful manner. By making a separate plate from
the blue positive, using the same spacing as with the green,
and setting this plate behind the other at an angle, 1 have
obtained the blues and whites, the grating-space being dimin
ished by foreshortening, though, of course, perfect regis

370           Mr. R. W. “700d on an Application of
tration of the different portions of the picture could not be
obtained.
    One of the great advantages of this method is the facility
with which duplicates can be made. If we place the <U+FB01>nished
picture in a printing-frame over a glass plate coated with
bichromated gelatine, and expose it to sunlight, on washing
the plate in warm water we obtain. by a single printing
 process, a second colour-photograph, equal to the <U+FB01>rst in every
 respect, and also positive. From this second copy we can
 print others, all being positive.
     The apparatus for viewing the pictures consists of a cheap
 double-convex lens mounted on a little frame, as shown in
 <U+FB01>g. 1, with a perforated screen for bringing the eye into the
  right position. I <U+FB01>nd that, by using a lens of proper focus,
  it is possible to so adjust the apparatus that the picture can be
  seen in its natural colours with both eyes simultaneously,
  since corresponding overlapping spectra are formed on each
  side of the central direct image. A gas'<U+FB01>ame turned edge
  wise, or the <U+FB01>lament of an incandescent light, makes a con—
  venient source of light.      The colours are of great brilliancy
   and purity, almost too brilliant in fact, though dark reds and
   ochres are reproduced with considerable <U+FB01>delity. The pictures
   can be projected by employing a powerful arc-light, placing
   a rather wide slit in the overlapping spectra, and mounting
   the projecting lens beyond this. The pictures that I have
   obtained thus far measure 2'5 in. by 2'5 in., and have been
   thrown up about 3 feet square. The fact that only a small
   percentage of the light is utilized makes great ampli<U+FB01>cation
   dif<U+FB01>cult. Certain experiments that I have made lead me to
   believe that the process can be greatly simplified.
       1 have exposed an ordinary photographic plate in a camera

            the Dg'fractz'on- Grating to Colour-Photography.       371
  under a diffraction-grating placed in front of, and in contact
  with, the <U+FB01>lm. On development, we obtain a negative the
  dark portions of which are broken up into <U+FB01>ne lines, corre
  sponding to the lines of the rating; and on viewing this in
  the apparatus just described,t e blue components of the picture
  are seen, though not so brilliant as with the transparent
  gelatine plate owing to the coarseness of the grain.
      I believe that by the use of a suitable photographic plate to
  be exposed in succession in the camera, under red, green, and
  blue screens, on the surfaces of' which suitable diffraction
  gratings have been photographed, it will be possible to obtain
  the colour-photograph directly. The screens can be swung
  into position in succession by a suitable mechanical arrange
  ment operated outside of the camera. The plate, on deve
  lopment, will be a negative in the ordinary sense of the term,
  though when seen in the viewing-apparatus it will appear as
  a coloured positive, since on the transparent portions which
  correspond to black in the original, no grating~lines have
 been impressed : consequently these portions will appear dark.
 The dark portions, however, where the lines are impressed will
  light up in their appropriate colours. From this plate as
  many copies as are desired can be made by contact-printing
  on bichromated gelatine.                                   .
     Of course it is a question whether superimposed gratings
 can be impressed on a plate in this manner. Judging from
 the experiments I have made, I imagine that the gratings on
 the colour-screens would have to be made with the opaque
 portions broad in proportion to the transparent.
     I have overcome the di<U+FB02>iculty of obtaining large diffraction
 gratings by building up photographic copies in the following
 manner. The original grating ruled on glass was mounted
 against a rectangular aperture in a vertical screen, the lines
 of' the grating being horizontal. Immediately below this was
 placed a long piece of heavy plate-glass, supported on a slab of
 slate to avoid possible <U+FB01>exure. A strip of glass,a little wider
 than the grating, sensitized with bichromated gelatine was
 placed in contact with the lines of the grating, and held in
 position by a brass spring.      The lower edge of' the strip rested
upon the glass plate so that it could be advanced parallel to
 the lines of the grating, and successive impressions taken by
means of light coming through the rectangular aperture. In
this way I secured a long narrow grating; and by mounting
this against a vertical rectangular aperture, and advancing a
second sensitized plate across itin precisely the same manner,
1 obtained a square grating of twenty-<U+FB01>ve times the area of
the original. It was in this manner that I prepared the

372                 Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney on
grating used to print the impressions on the three positives.
So well did they perform, that it seemed as if it might be
possible in this way to build up satisfactory gratings of large
size for spectroscopic work. Starting with a l-inch grating
of 2000 lines, I have built up a grating 8 inches square,
which, when placed over the object-glass of a telescope,
showed the dark bands in the spectrum of Sirius with great
distinctness. No especial precautions, other than the use of
the <U+FB02>at glass plate, were taken to insure absolute parallelism
of the lines, and I have not had time to thoroughly test the
grating. The spectra, however, are ol'extraordinary hrilliancy;
and on the whole the <U+FB01>eld seems promising. This matter will,
however, be deferred to a subsequent paper.

              XXXIlI. Denudation and Deposit-ion.
        By G. Jormsrorvs S'roNEY, M.A., 0.80., F.1{.S.*
IN a lecture to the Royal Geographical Society, of which a
       copious extract is given in ‘ Nature ’ of the 2nd of
February, 1899, Dr. J. W. Gregory discusses many of the
causes which may have led to the existing form of the earth.
But there is one important factor in the problem left unnoticed,
namely, the conspicuous alterations of level which may be
attributed to the earth’s compressibility, and which seem to
have been brought about wherever either denudation or
deposition have continued over wide areas and for a long time.
    Dr. Gregory makes a convenient division of the earth into
three parts :—(1) the unknown internal centrosphere; (2) the
rocky crust or lithosphere ; (3) the oceanic layer, or hydro
sphere. These, with the atmosphere, which may be added as
a fourth part, make up the whole earth.
    If new we imagine a pyramid whose base is a square centi
metre of the surface of the solid part of the earth and whose
vertex is the earth’s centre, it has a volume of about 212
cubic metres, which is the same as 212 millions of cubic centi
metres. This pyramid passes <U+FB01>rst through the lithospheric
shell, or outer crust, and then halfway across the centrosphere
to the centre of the earth. All the materials of which it
consists are compressible. Those which lie within the outer
shell consist mainly of carbonates, silicates, and aluminates,
9. id have probably a coef<U+FB01>cient of compressibility about equal
to that of glass; while the compressibility of the centrosphere
is unknown, and may be either. more or less. The observed
form of the earth’s surface seems to suggest that the average
                     * Communicated by the Author.

                            Demulatiun and Deposition.                   373
     compressibility of the lithosphere and centrosphere taken
     together is not far from that of' the more incompressible kinds
     of glass. Glass of this description yields to compression
     about 2% times more than solid cast iron, but less than
     mercury (which seems to be the only liquid metal that has
     been experimented on) in the ratio of 2 to 3. It is about
     20 times more incompressible than water.
         We shall then, as a provisional hypothesis, assume that the
     earth has the same compressibility as the more resistant kinds
     of glass, which lose about 2% billionths of their volume for
     each pressure of a dyne per square centimetre over their
     surface.       Combining this with the volume of the earth
     pyramid given above, we <U+FB01>nd that our hypothesis leads to the
     conclusion that if the sides of the pyramid were kept from
     yielding, and if' the weight of a cubic centimetre of water
     were placed on its outer end, this would reduce its bulk by
     half a cubic centimetre.           A cubic centimetre of stone, of'
     speci<U+FB01>c gravity 3, would accordingly depress its outer end by
     1% centimetres. It follows from this that if meteors rained
     upon the earth (supposed to be without an ocean) producing
     a deposit over its whole surface a centimetre thick, and of
     material as dense as stone, the result would be that the earth
     after this accession would be smaller ; its surface would sink
     down about half a centimetre. Correspondingly, if' by any
     agency a centimetre of the earth’s crust could be removed over
     the whole earth, the earth’s surface would stand % a centimetre
     higher than before. These are the effects which deposition and
     denudation would respectively produce if they could operate
     over the whole earth. And, if they operate over any extensive
     area of the earth’s surface, they will produce effects ofthe same
     kind, complicated a little by the displacement of the earth’s
     centre of attraction, or rather locus of centres of attraction.
         This may be well seen in the oldest parts of the oldest
     continents—parts of Asia and Africa—to whose present
     elevation denudation *, operating over an extensive area and
     for long ages, has probably chie<U+FB02>y contributed. ' And, corre
     spondingly, there is a deepening of those parts of the ocean
     where the deposition of suf<U+FB01>ciently heavy‘l' material has been
     going on over a great area for an immense time.
        * Underground waters produce the same dynamical effect as surface
     denudation, by reason of the materials they remove in solution.
        1* Where the sub-aqueous deposit is spread over only a small part of
     the surface of the globe (which is the only case we need consider), the
     compression is due, not to the whole weight of the deposit, but only to
     its excess over the weight of an equal bulk of water. Hence to produce

  37-].            On Denudation and Deposition.
     The e.vtent of the area is an essential condition, 2'. e., the
 lateral dimensions of the inverted pyramid which has the area
 for its base and the centre of the earth for its vertex. If the
 area is small or narrow, oblique forces exerted by the parts
 surrounding this pyramid come more into play. They enable
 the part within the pyramid to act like a bridge; and the
 support thus given enables denudation, if limited to a small
 area, to scoop out valleys, and deposition to produce ridges,
 as may be seen in the glaciers and moraines of mountainous
 countries.    On the other hand, if the erosion due to glacial
 action takes effect over a great stretch of country, as it does
 in Greenland, and as it formerly did in Ireland, it causes the
 surface to rise.
     A nearly even balance between the two opposite tendencies
 may be seen in Egypt, where borings exhibit <U+FB01>uviatile de
 posits at great depths below the present surface, although the
 surface is only about _as much raised above the sea now as it
 was when those ancient deposits were laid down by the Nile.
 Each year’s deposit makes the surface go down, but only
 about as much as its own thickness, so that the new surface
 each year is not far from being at the same level as that of
 the preceding year. If the deposit had taken place over a
much greater breadth of country, the whole would have one
down. It would have become a ridge if it had been con<U+FB01>ned
 to a much narrower strip and if the river could have been
kept from diverging.
     A similarly instructive case is that of Brazil, where an
immense plateau is continuously being denuded by the vast
rivers that drain it. But here there is also an equally un
interrupted addition to the solid materials of the earth by the
luxuriant tropical vegetation which everywhere prevails ; and
it is probably because the accessions and withdrawals are
nearly equal to one another, that the level of the surface has
been but little changed.
    Denudation may cause the surface to rise within a space
which is in a‘ considerable degree more circumscribed than
the areas of elevation hitherto considered, if the conditions
are such that the stresses that come into existence round the
boundary of this limited space can produce faults, and pre
vent the material which is outside the pyramid from being in
a position to help to keep down the material which is within.
This seems to have happened in the case of that vast mass of
mountains—the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, and their asso
ciated ranges—where excessive denudation accompanied by
the isolation secured by faults has occasioned a proportionately
great elevation above what was probably a humble beginning;

        0n Transmission of Light through an Atmosphere.                375
where the deposits in the Bay of Bengal are probably the
cause of its great depth; and where earthquakes in the
intervening regions betray when the faults are establishing
themselves which render the rising and the descending areas
independent of one another, and allow the denudation on the
one side and the deposition on the other to produce each its
full effect, without mutual interference.
     Of course all compressions and dilatations must be accom
 panied by other movements within the earth, and at all
 depths ; which may be slow but are no less sure.                 In fact,
 there is no material which can resist yielding to differences
 of pressure, however feeble, if they act for a long time and
 over a large surface; and such pressures, urging in various
 directions, must arise both from the compressions and dilata
tions spoken of above, and from other causes, among which
 movements of heat and the heterogeneous character of the
 materials of which the earth consists are prominent. The
 earth, therefore, is in a state of never-ending change, which
 to become conspicuous to man would only need to be placed
 in some kind of kinematograph arrangement which would
 hurry over millions of years in fractions of a second. These
 effects mix with and complicate those which have been taken
 account of in the present paper.
     It is interesting to note how the agencies we have been
 considering would operate upon other bodies of the universe.
 Events equivalent to denudation and deposition which cause
 excessively slow movements in our small earth, would act with
  increased promptness upon such great planets as Jupiter,
  Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and with violence upon bodies
  that attain the size of the sun and stars. On the other
  hand, on bodies with the dimensions of the moon they are
  relatively feeble, and must be very slow in producing any
  appreciable effect.
  XXXIV. On the Transmission ofLight through an Atmosphere
      containing Small Particles in Suspension, and on the Origin
      of the Blue of the Sky. Bg Lord RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.*
  F ‘HIS subject has been treated in papers published many
          years ago 1“.    I resume it in order to examine more
   closely than hitherto the attenuation undergone by the
   primary light on its passage through a medium containing
   small particles, as dependent upon the number and size of the
   particles. Closely connected with this is the interesting

376       Lord Rayleigh on the Transmission of Liyht through
 question whether the light from the sky can be explained by
diffraction from the molecules of air themselves, or whether it
is necessary to appeal to suspended particles composed of
foreign matter, solid or liquid. It will appear, I think, that
even in the absence of foreign particles we should still have a
blue sky *.
    The calculations of the present paper are not needed in
order to explain the general character of the effects produced.
In the earliest of those above referred to I illustrated by
curves the gradual reddening of the transmitted light by
   1* My attention was specially directed to this question a long while ago
by Maxwell in a letter which I may be pardoned for reproducing here.
 Under date Aug. 28, 1873, he wrote :—
    “ I have left your papers on the light of the sky, &c. at Cambridge,
and it would take me, even if I had them, some time to get them assimi
 lated suf<U+FB01>ciently to answer the following question, which I think will
involve less expense to the energy of the race if you stick the data into
your formula and send me the result. . . . .
   “ Suppose that there are N spheres of density p and diameter 8 in unit
of volume of the medium. Find the index of refraction of the compound
medium and the coe<U+FB02>icient of extinction of light passing through it.
   “ The object of the en uiry is, of course, to obtain data about the size
of the molecules of air.      erhaps it may lead also to data involving the
density of the anther. The following quantities are known, being com
binations of the three unknowns,
         M=mass of molecule of hydrogen ;
         N =number of molecules of any gas in a cubic centimetre at 0° C.
                and 760 B.

   “If you can give us (i.) the quantity of light scattered in a given
direction by a stratum of a certain density and thickness ; (ii) the
quantity cut out of the direct ray ;_ and (iii.) the effect of the molecules
on the index of refraction, which 1 think ought to come out easily, we
might get a little more information about these little bodies.
   “ You will see by ‘ Nature,’ Aug. 14, 1873, that I make the diameter
of molecules about <U+FB01>'<U+FB01> of a wave-length.
   “The enquiry into scattering must begin by accounting for the great
observed transparency of air. I suppose we have no numerical data
about its absorption.
   “But the index of refraction can be numerically determined, though
the observation is of a delicate kind, and a comparison of the result
with the dynamical theory may lead to some new information.”
   Subsequently he wrote, “ Your letter of Nov. 17 quite accounts for the
observed transparency of any gas.” So far as I remember, my argument
was of a general character only.

 an Atmosphere containing Small Particles in Suspension.             37?
which we see the sun a little before sunset. The same
reasoning proved, of course, that the spectrum of even a
vertical sun is modified by the atmosphere in the direction of
favouring the waves of greater length.
     For such a purpose as the present it makes little difference
whether we speak in terms of the electromagnetic theory or
of the elastic solid theory of light; but to facilitate compari
son with former papers on the light from the sky, it will be
convenient to follow the latter course. The small particle of
volume T is supposed to be small in all its dimensions in
comparison with the wave-len th (7t), and to be of optical
density Dl differing from t at (D) of the surrounding
medium. Then, if the incident vibration be taken as unity,
the expression for the vibration scattered from the particle in
a direction making an angle 9 with that of primary vibra

 378     Lord Rayleigh on the Transmission of Light through
     If we had a suf<U+FB01>ciently complete expression for the scattered
  light, we might investigate (5) somewhat more directly by
  considering the resultant of the primary vibration and of
  the secondary vibrations which travel in the same direction.
  If, however, we apply this process to (l), we <U+FB01>nd that it fails
 to lead us to (5), though it furnishes another result of interest.
  The combination of the secondary waves which travel in the
  direction in question have this peculiarity, that the phases
 are no more distributed at random. The intensity of'the
 secondary light is no longer to he arrived at by addition of
 individual intensities, but must be calculated with considera—
 tion of the particular phases involved. If we consider a
 number of particles which all lie upon a primary ray, we see
 that the phases of the secondary vibrations which issue along
 this line are all the same.
     The actual calculation follows a similar course to that by
 which Huygens’ conception of the resolution of a wave into
 components corresponding to the various
 parts of the wave-front is usually veri-             Fig 1

 admitted by its molecular constitution, i. e., in the absence
 of all foreign matter. We may take A=6x 10'5 centim.,

 the same for all gases—can hardly be regarded as known.

                  x: 8'3 X 106 cm.=83 kilometres,
 as the distance through which light must pass through air
 at atmospheric pressure before its intensity is reduced in the
 ratio of 2'7 : 1.
     Although Mount Everest appears fairly bright at 100 miles
  distance as seen from the neighbourhood of Darjeeling, we can
  not suppose that the atmosphere is as transparent as is
  implied in the above numbers; and of course this is not to
  be expected, since there is certainly suspended matter to be
  reckoned with. Perhaps the best data for a comparison are
  those afforded by the varying brightness of stars at various
  altitudes. Bouguer and others estimate about '8 for the
  transmission of light through the entire atmosphere from a
  star in the zenith. This corresponds to 8'3 kilometres of air
  at standard pressure. At this rate the transmission through
  83 kilometres would be ('8)‘°, or '11, instead of l/e or '37.
  It appears then that the actual transmission through 83 kilo
  metres is only about 3 times less than that calculated (with
  the above value of n) from molecular diffraction without any
  allowance for foreign matter at all. And we may conclude
  that the light scattered from the molecules would sutiice to
‘ give us a blue sky, not so very greatly darker than that
  actually enjoyed.

                                          at the conclusion   that n
  cannot be greatly less than was estimated by Maxwell.            A
  lower limit for n, say 7 X 1018 per cubic centimetre, is some
  what sharply indicated. For a still smaller value, or rather
   the increased individual ef<U+FB01>cacy which according to the
   observed refraction would be its accompaniment, must lead to
   a less degree of transparency than is actually found. When
   we take into account the known presence of foreign matter,
   we shall probably see no ground for any reduction of
   Maxwell’s number.
      The results which we have obtained are based upon (14),
   and are as true as the theories from which that equation was
   derived._ In the electromagnetic theory we have treated the
   molecules as spherical continuous bodies differing from the
   rest of the medium merely in the value of their dielectric
   constant.    If we abandon the restriction as to sphericity, the
   results will be modi<U+FB01>ed in a manner that cannot be precisely
   de<U+FB01>ned until the shape is s eci<U+FB01>ed. On the whole, however, it
   does not appear probable t at this consideration would greatly
   affect the calculation as to transparency, since the particles

 an Atmosphere containing Small Particles in Suspension.      383
must be supposed to be oriented in all directions indi<U+FB01>'erently.
But the theoretical conclusion that the light di<U+FB02>'racted in a'
direction perpendicular to the primary rays should be com
pletely polarized may well be seriously disturbed. If the
view, suggested in the present paper, that a large part of the
light from the sky is diffracted from the molecules themselves,
be correct, the observed incomplete polarization at 90° from
the Sun may be partly due to the molecules behaving rather
as elongated bodies with indi<U+FB01>'erent orientation than as spheres
of homogeneous material.
   Again, the suppositions upon which we have proceeded
 give no account of dispersion. That the refraction of gases
increases as the wave-length diminishes is an observed fact ;
and it is probable that the relation between refraction and
transparency expressed in (14) holds good for each wave
length. If so, the falling of? of transparency at the blue end
of the spectrum will be even more marked than according to
 the inverse fourth power of the wave-length.
    An interesting question arises as to whether (14) can be
 applied to highly compressed gases and to liquids or solids.
 Since approximately (a—l) is proportional to n, so also is
h according to (14). We have no reason to suppose that
 the purest water is any more transparent than (14) would
indicate; but it is more than doubtful whether the calcula
 tions are applicable to such a case, where the fundamental
 supposition, that the phases are entirely at random, is violated.
When the volume occupied by the molecules is no longer
very small compared with the whole volume, the fact that
two molecules cannot occupy the same space detracts from
the random character of the distribution. And when, as in
liquids and solids, there is some a proach to a regular spacing,
the scattered light must be much less than upon a theory of
random distribution.
    Hitherto we have considered the case of obstacles small
compared to the wave~length. In conclusion it may not be
inappropriate to make a few remarks upon the opposite
extreme case and to consider brie<U+FB02>y the obstruction presented,
for example, by a shower of rain, where the diameters of the
drops are large multiples of the wave-length of light.
   The full solution of the problem presented by spherical
drops of water would include the theory of the rainbow,
and if practicable at all would be a very complicated matter.
But so far as the direct light is concerned, it would seem to
make little difference whether we have to do with a spherical
refracting drop, or with an opaque disk of the same diameter.
                              2D2

384      On Transmission of Light through an Atmosphere.
Let us suppose then that a large number of small disks are
distributed at random over a plane parallel to a wave-front,
and let us consider their effect upon the direct light at a
great distance behind. The plane of the disks may be divided
into a system of Fresnel’s zones, each of which will by
hypothesis include a large number of disks.           If a be the area
of each disk, and v the number distributed per unit of area
of the plane, the ef<U+FB01>ciency of each zone is diminished in the
ratio 1:1-—Va, and, so far as the direct wave is concerned,
this is the only effect. The amplitude of the direct wave is
accordingly reduced in the ratio 1 : l—va, or, if we denote the
relative opaque area by m, in the ratio 1: l—-m*. A second
operation of the same kind will reduce the amplitude to
 (l—m)2, and so on. After .2 passages the amplitude is
 (1—m)’, which if m be very small may be equated to e-"u‘.
Here ma: denotes the whole opaque area passed, reckoned
per unit area of wave-front; and it would seem that the result
is applicable to any suf<U+FB01>ciently sparse random distribution of
obstacles.
    It may be of interest to give a numerical example. If the
unit of length be the centimetre and .7,- the distance travelled,
777 will denote the projected area of the drops situated in one
cubic centimetre. Suppose now that a is the radius of a
drop, and n the number of drops per cubic centimetre, then
m=mra9. The distance required to reduce the amplitude in
the ratio 6 : 1 is given by
                               a: = 1/n7ra2.
 Suppose that a=§15 centim., then the above-named reduction
 will occur in a distance of one kilometre (2:105) when n is
about 10*3, i. 6. when there is about one drop of one milli
metre diametcr per litre.
    It should be noticed that according to this theory a distant
point of light seen through a shower of rain ultimately becomes
invisible, not by failure of de<U+FB01>nition, but by loss of intensity
either absolutely or relatively to the scattered light.
   * The intensity of the direct wave is 1 —2m, and that of the scattered
light m, making altogether l—m.

    XXXV. On Opacity.         By Professor OLIVER LODGE, D.Sc.,
         LL.D., F.R.S., President of the Physical Society *.
   MY attention has recently been called to the subject of the
           transmission of electromagnetic waves by conducting
   dielectrics—in other words, to the opacity of imperfectly
   conducting material to light. The question arose when an
  attempt was being made to signal inductively through a
  stratum of earth or sea, how far the intervening layers of
  moderately conducting material were able to act as a screen;
  the question also arises in the transmission of Hertz waves
  through partial conductors, and again in the transparency of
  gold-leaf and other homogeneous substances to light.
      The earliest treatment of such subjects is due of course to
  Clerk Maxwell thirty-four years ago, when, with unexampled
  genius, he laid down the fundamental laws for the propagation
  of electric waves in simple dielectrics, in crystalline media, and
  in conducting media. He also realised there was some strong
  analogy between the transmission of such waves through space
  and the transmission of pulses of current along a telegraph
  wire. But naturally at that early date not ever detail of the
  investigation Was equally satisfactory and compiete.
      Since that time, and using Maxwell as a basis, several
  mathematicians have developed the theory further, and no
  one with more comprehensive thoroughness than Mr. Oliver
  Heaviside, who, as I have said before, has gone into these
 matters with extraordinarily clear and far vision.            I may
 take the opportunity of calling or recalling to the notice of
 the Society, as well as of myself, some of the simpler develop
  ments of Mr. Heaviside’s theory and manner of unifying
 phenomena and processes at <U+FB01>rst sight apparently ' different;
 but <U+FB01>rst I will deal with the better-known aspects of the
 subject.
     Maxwell deals with the relation between conductivity and
 opacity in his Art. 798 and on practically to the end of that
 famous chapter xx. (‘ Electromagnetic Theory of Light’). He
 discriminates, though not very explicitly or obtrusively, be~
 tween the two extreme cases, (1) when inductive capacity or
 electric inductivity is the dominant feature of the medium—
when, for instance, it is a slightly conducting dielectric, and
 (2) the other extreme case, when conductivity is the pre
dominant feature.

place of 47r/t/a, that is, of electric conductivity; otherwise the
heat solution is the same as (2). The 4w has come in from
an unfortunate convention, but it is remarkable that the con
ductivity term is inverted. The reason of the inversion of
this constant is that, whereas the substance conveys the heat
waves, and by its conductivity aids their advance, the nether
conveys the electric waves, and the substance only screens
and opposes, re<U+FB02>ects, or dissipates them.
   This is the case applied to sea~water and low frequency by
Mr. \Vhitehead in a paper which he gave to this Society in
June 1897, being rompted thereto by the dif<U+FB01>culty which
Mr. Evershed and t e Post Of<U+FB01>ce had found in some trials of
induction signalling at the Goodwin Sands between a coil
round a ship at the surface and another coil submerged at a
depth of 10 or 12 fathoms. It was suspected that the con
ductivity of the water mopped up a considerable proportion
of the induced currents, and Mr. Whitehead’s calculation
tended, or was held to tend, to support that conclusion.
   To the discussion Mr. Heaviside communicated what was
apparently, as reported, a brief statement; but I learn that in
reality it was a carefully written note of three pages, which
recently he has been good enough to lend me a copy of. In
that note he calls attention to a theory of the whole subject
which in 1887 he had worked out and printed in his collected
‘ Electrical Papers,’ but which has very likely been over
looked. It seems to me a pity that a note by Mr. Heaviside
should have been so abridged in the reported discussion as
to be practically useless; and I am permitted to quote it here
as an appendix (p. 413).
   Meanwhile, taking the di<U+FB02>usion case as applicable to sea
water with moderately low acoustic frequency, we see that the
induction effect decreases geometrically with the thickness of
the oceanic layer, and that the logarithmic decrement of the
amplitude of the oscillation is “(@y where a- is the
speci<U+FB01>c resistance of sea-water and p/21r is the frequency.
   Mr. Evershed has measured a- and found it 2 x 1010 G.G.s.,
that is to say 2 x 1010 ,u, square centim. per second ; so putting
in this value and taking a frequency of 16 per second, the
amplitude is reduced to l/eth of what its value would have
been at the same distance in a perfect insulator, by a depth

   Four or <U+FB01>ve times this thickness of intervening sea would

388                  Dr. Oliver Lodge on Opacity.
reduce the result at the 16 frequency to insi ni<U+FB01>cance (each
55-metre-layer reducing the energy to 1} of w at entered it) ;
but if the frequency were, say, 400 per second instead of 16
it would be <U+FB01>ve times more damped, and the damping thick
ness (the depth reducing the amplitude in the ratio e: 1)
would in that case be only eleven metres.
   It is clear that in a sea 10 fathoms (or say 20 metres)
deep the failure to inductively operate a “call” responding to
a frequency of 16 per second was not due to the screening effect
of sea-water *.
   Maxwell, however, is more interested in the propagation
of actual light, that is to say, in waves whose frequency is
about 5X 1014 per second; and for that he evidently does
not consider that the simple diffusion theor is suitable. It
certainly is not applicable to light passing t rough so feeble
a conductor as salt water. He attends mainly therefore to
the other and more interesting case, where electric inductive
eapacity predominates over the damping effect of conduc
tivity, and where true waves therefore advance with an
approximately de<U+FB01>nite velocity

though it is to be noted that the slight sorting out of waves
 of different frequency, called dispersion, is an approximation
to the case of pure diffusion where the speed is as the square
root of the frequency, and is accompanied, moreover, as it
ought to he, by a certain amount of differential or selective
absorption.
   To treat the case of waves in a conductor, the same damping
 term as before has to be added to the ordinary wave equation,

 explanation of the failure, since a closed secondary existed close to both

does not happen to extract the square root of this quantity,
but, assuming the answer to be of the form (for a simply

city of wave propagation, except as a <U+FB01>rst approximation, in
an absorbing medium, yet practically this velocity p/ or 7t/T
is independent of the frequency except in strongly agsorbent
substances where there are dispersional complications; and.
so the damping is, in simple cases, practically independent
 of the frequency too.
    With this simple velocity in mind Maxwell proceeds to
 apply his theory numerically to gold-leaf, calculating its
 theoretical transparency, and <U+FB01>nding, as every one knows,
 that it comes out discordant with experiment, being out of
 all comparison * smaller than what experiment gives.
    But then it is somewhat surprising to <U+FB01>nd gold treated as
 a substance in which conductivity does not predominate over
 speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity.
    The differential equation is quite general and applies to
 any substance, and since the solution given is a true solu
 tion, it too must apply to any substance when properly
 interpreted ; but writing it in the form just given does not
 suggest the full and complete solution. It seems to apply
 only to slightly damped waves, and indeed, Maxwell seems to
 consider it desirable to rewrite the original equation with omis
 sion of K, for the purpose of dealing with good conductors.
    By a slip, however, he treats gold for the moment as if it
 belonged to the category of poor conductors, and as if ab
 sorption in a thickness such as gold-leaf could be treated as
 a moderate damping of otherwise progressive waves.

 a wave thick has two thousand digits in its denominator: see below.

390              Dr. Oliver Lodge on Opacity.
   The slip was naturally due to a consideration of the
extreme frequency of light vibrations; but attention to the
more complete expression for the solution of the same differ
ential equation, given in 1887 by Mr. Heaviside and quoted
in the note to this Society above referred to, puts the matter
in a proper position. Referring to his ‘Electrical Papers,’
vol. ii. p. 422, he writes down the general value of the
coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption as follows (translating into our
notation)

without regard to whether the conductivity of the medium is
large or small; where v is the undamped or true velocity of
wave propagation in the medium (MIG—i.
  Of course Maxwell could have got this expression in an instant
by extracting the square root of the quantity Q, the coef<U+FB01>cient
ot'F in equation (3’) written above. I do not suppose that
there is anything of the slightest interest from the mathe
matician’s point of view, the interest lies in the physical
application; but as this is not a mathematical Society it is

   This expresses the transmission of light through imperfect
insulators, and is the case specially applied by Maxwell to cal
culations of opacity. Its form serves likewise for telegraphic
signals or Hertz waves transmitted by a highly-conducting
aerial wire ; the damping, if any, is independentof frequency
and there is true undistorted wave-propagation at velocity
v: 1/ MITS ; the constants belonging to unit length of the wire.
The current (or potential) at any time and place is
                   C=Coe*iii cosp(t—a: Vie). . . . (9)
   The other extreme case, that of diffusion, represented by
equation (2), is analogous to the well-known transmission of
slow signals by Atlantic cables, that is by long cables where
resistance and capacity are predominant, giving the so-called
KR law (only that I-will Write it RS),
         C = 00 e'm‘ms<U+FB01>cos {pt— v’(%pRS).z'}; . . (10)
wherefore the damping distance in a cable is
                          =\/(a2-s)
   Thus, in comparing the cable case with the penetration of
waves into a conductor and with the case of thermal con
duction, the following quantities correspond :
                               4MP            PCP

cp is the heat-capacity per unit volume, S is the electric
capacity per unit length; k is the thermal conductivity per
unit volume, 1 /R is the electric conductance per unit length.
So these agree exactly ; but in the middle case, that of waves
entering a conductor, there is a notable inversion, representing
a real physical fact. 47”» may be called the density and may
be compared with p or with l/S, that is with elasticity-+0”;
but a- is the resistance per unit volume instead of the con
ductance. The reason of course is that whereas good con—
ductivity helps the cable-signals or the heat along, it by no
means helps the waves into the conductor. Conductivity aids

their slipping along the boundary of a conductor, but it
retards their passing across the boundary and entering a
conductor. As regards waves entering a conductor, the
effect of conductivity is a screening effect, not a trans
mitting effect, and it is the bad conductor which alone has
a chance of being a transparent medium.
    It may be convenient to telegraphists, accustomed to
think in terms of the “KR-law” and comparing equa
tions (2) and (10), to note that the quantity 41r/t/a—that
is, practically, the speci<U+FB01>c conductivity in electromagnetic
measure (multiplied by a meaningless 41r because of an
unfortunate initial convention)—takes the place of KR (i. e. of
RS), but that otherwise the damping-out of the waves as
they enter a good conductor is exactly like the damping-out 0f
the signals as they progress through a cable; or again as elec
trification travels along a cotton thread, or as a temperature
pulse makes its way through a slab; and yet another case,
though it is different in many respects, yet has some simi
larities, viz. the ultimate distance the melting-point of wax
travels along a bar in Ingenhousz’s conductivity apparatus,—
the same law of inverse square of distance for effective reach
of signal holding in each case.
   Now it is pointed out by Mr. Heaviside in several places
in his writings that, whereas the transmission of high
frequency waves by a nearly transparent substance corre
sponds by analogy to the conveyance of Hertz waves along
aerial wires (or along cables for that matter, if suf<U+FB01>ciently con
ducting), and whereas the absorption of low-frequency waves
by a conducting substance corresponds, also by analogy, to the
diffusion of pulses along a telegraph-cable whose self-induction
is neglected—its resistance and capacity being prominent,—
the intermediate case of waves of moderate frequency in a
conductor of intermediate opacity corresponds to the more
general cable case where self-induction becomes important and
where leakage also must be taken into account; because it is
leakage conductance that is the conductance of the dielectric
concerned in plane waves. This last is therefore a real, and
not only an analogic, correspondence.
    Writing R1 S1 L1 Q, for the resistance, the capacity (“ per
mittance”), the inductance, and the leakage-conductance
 (“ leakance ”) respectively, per unit length, the general
equations to cable-signalling are given in Mr. Heaviside’s

          There are several interesting special cases :—
          The old cable theory of Lord Kelvin is obtained by omitting
       both Q and L; thus getting equation (2).
          The transmission of Hertz waves along a perfectly-con
       ducting insulated wire is obtained by omitting Q and R ; the
       speed of such transmission being 1/4/ (L181). Resistance
       in the wire brings it to the form (9), where the dampin
       depends on the ratio of the capacity constant RS to the self
       induction constant L/S ; because the index R/2Lv equals half
       the square root of this ratio; but it must be remembered
       that R has the throttled value due to merely super<U+FB01>cial
       penetration. The case is approximated to in telephony
       sometimes.
          A remarkable case of undistorted (though attenuated)
       transmission through a cable (discovered by Mr. Heaviside,
       but not yet practically applied) is obtained by taking
                                         = Ql/s = 9';

       and a true Velocity of transmission makes its reappearance.
       This is what he calls his “ distortionless circuit,” which may
       yet play an important part in practice.
           And lastly, the two cases which for brevity may be
       treated together, the case of perfect insulation, Q=.0, on
       the one hand, and the ease of erfect wire conduction, R=O,

    Instead of attending to special cases, if we attend to the
general cable equation (11) as it stands, we see that it is
more general than the corresponding equation (3) to waves
in space, because it contains the extra possibility R of wire
 resistance, which does not exist in free space.
    Mr. Heaviside, however, prefers to unify the whole by the
 introduction of a hypothetical and as yet undiscovered dissipa
 tion-possibility in space, or in material bodies occupying
 space, which he calls magnetic conductance, and which,
 though supposed to be non-existent, may perhaps conceivably
 represent the reciprocal of some kind of hysteresis, either the
 electric or the magnetic variety. Calling this g, (gH2 is to
 be the dissipation term corresponding with R02), the equation
 to waves in space becomes
                   V2F= (9+;P,i)(4?"+;1>1<) F, . . . (13)
 just like the general cable case.        And a curious kind of
 transparency, attenuation without distortion, would belong to
 a medium in which both conductivities coexisted in such
 proportion that g za=47rk :K ; for 9 would destroy H just
 as k destroys E.                           '
     In the cable, F ma      be either current or potential, and
 LSv’=l. In s ace, FY may be either electric or magnetic
  intensity, and ,u. v2=l ; but observe that 9 takes the place
  not of Q but of R, while it is 47r/a that takes the place of Q.
  Resistance in the wire and electric conductivity in space
  do not produce similar effects.        If there is any analogue
  in space to wire resistance it is magnetic not electric con
  ductivity.
     The important thing is of course that the wire does not
  convey the energy but dissipates it, so that the dissipation by
  wire-resistance and the dissipation by space-hysteresis to

396                 Dr. Oliver Lodge on Opacity.
that extent correspond. The screening effect of space
conductivity involves the very same dielectric property as that
which causes leakage or imperfect insulation of the cable
core.
   Returning to the imaginary magnetic conductivity, let
us trace what its effects would be if it existed, and try to
grasp it. It effect would be to kill out the magnetism of
permanent magnets in time, and generally to waste away the
energy of a static magnetic <U+FB01>eld, just as resistance in wires
wastes the energy of an unmaintained current and so kills
out the magnetism of its <U+FB01>eld. I spoke above as if it were
conceivable that such magnetic conductivity could actually
in some degree exist, likening it to a kind of hysteresis ; but
hysteresis—the enclosure of a loop between a to and fro path
—isa phenomenon essentially associated with <U+FB02>uctuations, and
cannot exist in a steady <U+FB01>eld with everything stationary.
Admitted : but then the molecules are not stationary, and the
behaviour of molecules in the Zeeman and Righi phenomena,
or still more strikingly in the gratuitous radiations discovered
by Edmond Becquerel, and more widely recognized by others,
especially by Monsieur et Madame Curie, (not really gratuitous
but e<U+FB02>'ected probabl by conversion into high-pitched radiation
of energy supplie from low-pitched sources) ,—the way
molecules of absorbent substances behave, seems to render
possible, or at least conceivable, something like a minute
magnetic conductivity in radiative or absorptive substances.
Mr. Heaviside, however, never introduced it as a physical
fact for which there was any experimental evidence, but as a
physical possibility and especially as a mathematical auxiliary
and uni<U+FB01>er of treatment, and that is all that we need here
consider it to be ; but we may trace in rather more detail its
effect it' it did exist.
   Supposethe magnetism of a magnet decayed, what would
happen to its lines of force? They would gradually shrink
into smaller loops and ultimately into molecular ones. The
generation of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld is always the opening out of
previously existing molecular magnetic loops; there is no
such thing as the creation of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, except in the
sense of moving it into a fresh place or expanding it over a
wider region *. So also the destruction of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld
merely means the shrinkage of its lines of force (or lines of
induction, 1 am not here discriminating between them).
Now consider an electric current in a wire :—-a cylindrical
magnetic <U+FB01>eld surrounds it, and if the current gradually de
creases in strength the magnetic energy gradually sinks into
                      * This may be disagreed with.

                    Dr. Oliver Lodge on Opacity.                        397
the wire as its lines slowly collapse. But observe that the
electric ener y of the <U+FB01>eld remains unchanged by this
process: if t e wire were electrostatically charged it would
remain charged, its average potential can remain constant.
Let the wire for instance be perfectly conducting, then the
current needs no maintenance, the potential might be
uniform (though in general there would be waves running to
and fro), and both the electric and magnetic <U+FB01>elds continue
for ever, unless there is some dissipative property in space.
    Two kinds of dissipative property may be imagined in
matter <U+FB01>lling space : <U+FB01>rst, and most ordinary, an electric con
ductivity or simple leakage, the result of which will be to
equalize the potential throughout space and destroy the electric
<U+FB01>eld, without necessarily affecting the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and so
without stopping the steady circulation of the current mani
fested by that <U+FB01>eld. The other dissipative property in space
that could be imagined would be magnetic conductivity ; the
result of which would be to shrink all the circular lines of
magnetic force slowly upon the wire, thus destroying the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and with it (by the circuital relation) the
current; but leaving the electrostatic potential and the electric
<U+FB01>eld unchanged. And this imaginary effect of the medium
in surrounding space is exactly the real effect caused by what
is called electric resistance in the wire *.
   Now for a simply progressive undistorted wave, 1'. e. one
with no character of diffusion about it, but all frequencies
travelling at the same quite de<U+FB01>nite speed 1/~/,u,K,it is essential
that the electric and magnetic energies shall be equal.                   If
both are weakened in the same proportion, the wave-energy
is diminished, and the pulse is said to be “ attenuated,” but it
continues otherwise uninjured and arrives “undistorted,” that
is, with all its features intact and at the same speed as before,

it would not at once mean Atlantic telephony, would mean
greatly improved signalling, and probably telephony through
shorter cables. In a cable the length of the Atlantic the

the dielectric leakage; but, unless excessive, simple attenua

in the imaginary case the lines would still shrink, by reason of molecular
loops being pinched off them.

tion does no serious harm. Articulation depends on the
features of the wave, and the preservation of the features
demands, by Fourier’s analysis, the transmission of every
frequency at the same rate.
    But now suppose any cause diminishes one of the two
<U+FB01>elds without diminishing the other: for instance, let the
electric <U+FB01>eld be weakened by leakage alone, or let the mag
netic <U+FB01>eld be weakened by wire-resistance alone, then what
happens? The preservation of E and the diminution of H,
to take the latter—the ordinary—case, may be regarded as
a superposition on the advancing wave of a gradually growing
reverse <U+FB01>eld of intensity 8H ; and, by the relation E=uvH,
this reversed <U+FB01>eld, for whatever it is worth, must mean a
gradually growing wave travelling in the reverse direction.
    The ordinary wave is now no longer left alone and un
injured, it has superposed upon itself a more or less strong
re<U+FB02>ected wave, a re<U+FB02>ected wave which constantly increases
in intensity as the distance along the cable, or the penetration
of the wave into a conducting medium, increases; all the
elementary reflected waves get mixed up by re-re<U+FB02>exion in
the rear, constituting what Mr. Heaviside calls a diffusive
"' tail ”; and this accumulation of reflected waves it is which
constitutes what is known as “distortion” in cables, and
what is known as “opacity” inside conducting dielectrics.
    There is another kind of o acity, a kind due to hetero
gcneousness, not connected wit conductivity but due merely
to a change in the constants K and pa—properly a kind of
transluceucy, a scattering but not a dissipation of energy,—
like the opacity of foam or ground glass.
    This kind of opacity is an affair of boundaries and not of
the medium itself, but after all, as we now see, it has features
by no means altogether dissimilar to the truer kind of opacity.
Conducting opacity is due to reflexion, translucent opacity is
due to retiexion,—to irregular re<U+FB01>exion as it is called, but of
course there is nothing irregular about the re<U+FB02>exion, it is
only the distribution of boundaries which is complicated, the
re<U+FB01>exion is as simple as ever ;—except, indeed, to some
extent when the size of the scattering particles has to be
taken into account and the blue of the sky emerges.          But
my point is that this kind of opacity also is after all of the
re<U+FB02>exion kind, and the gradual destruction of the advancing
wave—whether it be by dust in the air or, as Lord Rayleigh
now suggests, perhaps by the discrete molecules themselves,
by the same molecular property as causes refraction and dis
persion—must result in a minute distortion and a mode of
 wave propagation not wholly different from cable-signalling

or from the transmission of light through conductors. So that
the red of the sunset sky and the green of gold-leaf may not be
after all very different; nor is the arrival-curve of atelegraph
signal a wholl distinct phenomenon.
    There is a t ird kind of opacity, that of lampblack, where
the molecules appear to take up the energy direct, converting
it into their own motion, that is into heat, and where there
appears to be little or nothing of the nature of re<U+FB02>exion. I
am not prepared to discuss that kind at present.
    It is interesting to note that in the most resisting and
capacious cable that ever was made, where all the features of
every wave arrive as obliterated as if one were trying to
signal by heat-pulses through a slab, that even there the head
of every wave travels undistorted, with the velocity of light,
and suffers nothing but attenuation ; for the superposed re
versed <U+FB01>eld is only called out by the arrival of the direct pulse,
and never absolutely reaches the strength of the direct <U+FB01>eld.
The attenuation may be excessive, but the signal is there
in its right time if only we have a sensitive enough instru
ment to detect it; though it would be practically useless as a
signal in so extreme a case, being practically all tail.
    Nothing at all reaches the distant end till the light-speed
time has elapsed ; and the light-speed-time in a cable depends
on the ,u. and K of its insulating sheath, depends, if that is
not simply cylindrical, on the product of its self-inductance and
capacity per unit length ; but at the expiration of the light
 speed-time the head of the signalling pulse arrives, and
 neither wire-resistance nor insulation-leakage, no, nor mag
 netic-conductivity, can do anything either to retard it or to
injure its sharpness : they can only eufeeble its strength, but
 the can do that very effectually.
    The transmitter of the pulse is self-induction in conjunction
 with capacity : the chief practical enfeebler of the pulse
is wire-resistance in conjunction with capacity ; and before
Atlantic telephony is ossible (unless a really distortionless
 cable is forthcoming) t e copper core of an ordinary cable
 will have to be made much larger. Nothing more is wanted
 in order that telephony to America may be achieved. There
 may be practical dif<U+FB01>culties connected with the mechanical
 stiffness of a stout core and the worrying of its guttapercha
 sheath, and these dif<U+FB01>culties may have to be lessened by aiming
 at distortionless conditions—it is well known also that for
 high frequencies a stout core must be composed of insulated
 strands unless it is hollow—but when such telephony is accom
 plished, I hofpe it will be recollected that the full and complete
 principles 0 it and of a great deal else connected with tele

graph    have been elaborately and thoroughly laid down by
Mr. Hleaviside.
   There is a paragraph in Maxwell, concerning the way
a current rises in a conductor and affects the surrounding
space, which is by no means satisfactory: it is Art. 804.
He takes the current as starting all along the wire, setting up
a sheath of opposition induced currents in the surrounding
imperfectl insulating dielectric, which gradually diffuse out
wards an die away, leaving at last the full inductive effect
of the core-current to be felt at a distance. Thus there is
supposed to be a diffusion of energ outwards from the wire,
which he likens to the diffusion of eat.
   But, as Mr. Heaviside has shown, the true phenomenon is
the transmission of a wave in the space surrounding the
wire—a plane ane if the wire is perfectly conducting,
a slightly coned wave if it resists,—a wave-front perpendicular
to the wire and travelling along it,—a sort of beam of dark
light with the wire as its core.
   Telegraphic signalling and optical signalling are similar;
but whereas the beam of the heliograph is abandoned to
space and must go straight except for re<U+FB02>exion and refraction,
the telegraphic beam can follow the sinuosities of the wire and
be guided to its destination.
   If the medium conducts slightly it will be dissipated
in situ; but if the wire conducts imperfectly, a minute trickle
of energy is constantly directed inwards radially towards the
wire core, there to be dissipated as heat.      Parallel to the
wire flows the main energy stream, but there is a small
amount of tangential grazing and inward <U+FB02>ow.         The initial
phenomenon does not occur in the wire, gradually to spread
outwards, but it occurs in the surrounding medium, and a
fraction of it gradually converges inwards. The advancing
waves are not cylindrical but plane waves, and though the
diffusing waves are cylindrical they advance inwards, not
outwards.
   I will quote from a letter of Mr. Heaviside’s:—“ The easiest
way to make people understand is, perhaps, to start with a
conducting dielectric with plane waves in it without wire-s,
 [thus getting] one kind of attenuation and distortion.    Then
introduce wires of no resistance ; there is no difference except
in the way the lines of force distribute [enabling the wires to
guide the plane waves].          Then introduce magnetic con
ductivity in the medium, [thereby getting] the other kind of
attenuation and distortion. Transfer it to the wires, makinv
it electrical resistance.   Then abolish the <U+FB01>rst electric con:
ductivity, and you have the usual electric telegraph.”

                        OPACITY or GOLD-LEAF.
    Now returning to the general solution (5) let us apply it
 to calculate the opacity of gold-leaf to light.
    Take          0:: 2000 p. square centim. per sec.,
                  p=21rX 5 x 10“ per sec.;
 then the critical quantity 47r/paK or (7) is

                   5 x 101‘x 2000 K/Ko " K/Ko'
    This number is probably considerably bigger than unity
 (unless, indeed, the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity K/Ku of gold
 is immensely large, which may indeed be the case—refractive
 index 40, for instance,—only it becomes rather dif<U+FB01>cult to
 de<U+FB01>ne) ; so that, approximately,

 or the damping distance is
              310 X 10_5 centim.: é microcentimetre,
 whereas the wave-length in air is
             6 x 10‘5 centim. = 60 microcentimetres.
    The damping distance is therefore getting nearer to the
 right order of magnitude, but the opacity is still excessive.
    A common thickness for gold-leaf is stated to be half a
 wave-length of light; that is to say, 90 times the damping
 distance. Hence the amplitude of the light which gets
 through a half-wave thickness of gold is e‘W of that which
 enters ; and that is sheer opacity.
    [Maxwell’s calculation in Art. 798, carried out numerically,
 makes the damping

                        w I, = exp. (—-108.z') for gold,
 see equation (8) above; or, for a thickness of half a wave
 length, 10-1000, which is billions of billions of billions (indeed
a number with 960 digits) times greater opacity than what
 we have here calculated, and is certainly wrong]
    It must, however, be granted, I think, that the green light
that emerges from gold-leaf is not properly transmitted ; it
is light re-emitted by the gold *. The incident light, say the
   " This would be <U+FB02>uorescence, of course; and Dr. Larmor argues in
favour of a simple ordinary exPoneutial coef<U+FB01>cient of absorption even in
metals.  See Phil. Trans. 1894, p. 738, §27.

red, is all stopped by a thickness less than half a wave-length.
The green light may conceivably be due to atoms vibrating
fairly in concordance, and not calling out the conducting
opacity of the metal. If the calculated opacity, notwith
standing this, is still too great, it is no use assuming a higher
conductivity at higher frequency, for that would act the
wrong way. What must be assumed is either some special
 molecular dispersion theory, or else greater speci<U+FB01>c resistance
 for oscillations of the frequency which get through ; nor
must the imaginative suggestion made immediately below
equation (13) be altogether lost sight of.
    There is, however, the possibility mentioned above that the
 relative speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity of gold, K/Ko, if a
meaning can be attached to it, may be very large, perhaps
(though very iinprobably, see Drude, Wied. Ann. vol. xxxix.
p. 481) comparable with 1800. Suppose for a moment that
it is equal to 1800 ; then the value of the critical quantity (7)

which reduces the calculated opacity considerably, though
still not enou h.

    So far nothing has been said about the limitation of the
medium in space, or the effect of a boundary, but quite
recently Mr. Heaviside has called my attention to a- special

theory, a Sort of Fresnel-like theory, which he has given
for in<U+FB01>nitely thin <U+FB01>lms of <U+FB01>nite conductance ; itis of remark
able simplicity, and may give results more in accordance
with experiment than the theory of the universal opaque
medium without boundary, hitherto treated: a medium in
which really the source is immersed.
    Let a <U+FB01>lm, not so thick as gold-leaf, but as thin as the
black spot of a soap-bubble, be interposed perpendicularly
between source and receiver. I will quote from ‘Electrical
Papers,’ vol. ii. p. 385 :—“ Let a plane wave E1=va1
moving in a nonconducting dielectric strike <U+FB02>ush an ex
ceedingly thin sheet of metal [so thin as to escape the need
for attending to internal re<U+FB01>exions, or the double boundary,
or the behaviour inside] ; letE2= va2 be the transmitted wave
out in the dielectric on the other side, and E3: —/.wH3 be the
re<U+FB02>ected wave *.
   * General Princi lea—It may be convenient to explain here the
principles on whic Mr. Heaviside arrives at his remarkably neat
expression for a wave-front in an insulating medium,
                                  E = va,
or as it may be more fully and vectorially written,
                                V(”E) = FUR;
where E is a vector representing the electric intensity (proportional to
the electric displacement), H is the magnetic intensity, and u is unit
normal to the wave-front. E and H are erpendicular vectors in the
same plane, i. e. in the same phase, and E £11 are all at right angles to
each other.                     .
   The general electromagnetic equations in an insulating medium are
perhaps suf<U+FB01>ciently well known to be, on M r. Heaviside’s system,
                   curl H = KE      and    —curlE = ,uH'I,
where “ curl ” is the vector part of the operator v, and where Maxwell’s
vector-potential and other complexities have been dispensed with.
   [In case these equations are not familiar to students I interpolate a.
parenthetical explanation which may be utilised or skipped at pleasure.
   The orthodox de<U+FB01>nition of Maxwell’s name “curl” is that b is called
the curl of a. when the surface-integral of b through an area is equal to the
line-integral of a, round its boundary, a, being a vector or a component
of avector agreeing everywhere with the boundary in direction, and b
being a vector or component of vector everywhere normal to the area.
Thus it is an operator appropriate to a pair of looped or interlocked
circuits, such as the electric and the magnetic circuits always are. The
<U+FB01>rst of the above fundamental equations represents the fact of electro
magnetism, specially as caused by displacement currents in an insulator,
the second represents the fact of magneto-electricity, Faraday’s magneto
electric induction, in any medium. Taking the second <U+FB01>rst, it states the
fundamental law that the induced EMF in a boundary equals the rate of
change in the lines of force passing through it; since the Ehllf‘ or step
of potential all round a contour is the line-integral of the electric intensity
E round it, so that                 dw

wherefore —pH equals the curl of E. (The statement of this second
circuital law is entirely due to Mr. Heaviside ; it is now largely adopted
and greatly simpli<U+FB01>es Maxwell’s treatment, abolishing the need for
vector potential.)
   The <U+FB01>rst of the above two fundamental equations, on the other hand,
depends on the fact that a current round a contour excites lines of mag
netic force through the area bounded by it, and states the law that the
total magnetomotive force, or line-integral of the magnetic intensity
round the boundary, is equal to 41:- times the total current through it;
the total current being the “ ampere-turns ” of the practical Engineer.
   Expressing this law in terms of current density 0, we write

                                 cycle               ‘.
so always current-density represents the curl of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld due
to it, or curl H=47r0.                                       _
   Now in a conductor r=kE, but in an insulator c: D, the rate of change

     [I must here interpolate a remark to 516 e<U+FB02>'ect that though
it can hardly be doubted that the above boundary conditions

in general we cannot avoid some form of aether-theory
    Whenever m is zero it follows that R has no circulation but is
the derivative of an ordinary single-valued potential function, whose

so, ignoring any superposed constant <U+FB01>elds of no radiation interest, E and
H are vectors in the same phase at right angles to each other, and their
tensors are given by E = ,uvH.
    Similarly of course the other equation furnishes H=KvE; thus giving
the ordinary K‘uv2=l, and likewise the fact that the electric and mag—
netic energies per unit volume are equal, %KE2=~;~;‘H2.
    A wave travelling in the opposite direction will be indicated by
E: —/.¢vH; hence, as is well known, if either the electric or the
magnetic disturbance is reversed in sign the direction of advance is
reversed too.
    (The readiest way to justify the equation E=,uvH, [a posteriori, is to
 assume the two well-known facts obtained above, viz. that the electric
and magnetic energies are equal in a true advancing wave, and that
 v=1/ JFK ; then it follows at once.)

H, is not equal to the intensity H1+H3 on the near side, but is less by

    Some measurements made by W. Wien at Berlin in 1888
 (Wied. Ann. vol. xxxr.), with a bunsen-burner as source of
radiation, give as the actual proportion of the transmitted
to the long-wave incident light, for gold whose thickness is
 10—5 centim., '0033 or 1/300 ; while for gold one quarter as
 thick the proportion was 0'4 (see Appendix II. page 414).
    He tried also two intermediate thicknesses, and though
 approximately the opacity increases with the square of the
 thickness, it really seems to increase more rapidly: as no
 doubt it ought, as the boundaries separate. However, for
 a thickness 7t/25 I suppose we may assume that about 1/3rd
 of the light would be transmitted, whereas the <U+FB01>lm-theory

 how rapidly the two fundamental electromagnetic equations, in Mr. Heavi
 side’s form, lead to the electromagnetic theory of light, if we attend
 specially to the direction normal to the plane of the two perpendicular
 vectors E and H, to the direction along say a", so that V = zd/da' and
 v2 = —d'-'/d;v2.
    In an insulating medium the equations are
                    curlH = KE        and      —curlE=pH ;
now curl=Vv=v, since Sv=0 in this case, so

    If this is not rigorous, there is no di<U+FB01>iculty in <U+FB01>nding it done properly
 in other places. I believe it to be desirable to realize things simply as
 well.
    In a conducting medium the fundamental equations are, one of them,

   Speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity has not been taken into account
in the metal, but if it is it does not improve matters. It
does not make much difference, unless very large, but what
difference it does make is in the direction of increasing
opacity. In a letter to me Mr. Heaviside gives for the

   An ordinary piece of gold-leaf, however, cannot properly
be treated as an infinitely thin <U+FB01>lm ; it must be treated as a
slab, and reflexions at its boundaries must be attended to.

   It is not a simple expression, because of course p signi<U+FB01>es

   The effect of the <U+FB01>rst boundary alone, p1, is 2+3]; or say
1/18, and this is a greater reduction eti'ect than that reckoned
above for the two boundaries together.
   Thus the obstructive ett'ect of the two boundaries together
comes out less than that of the <U+FB01>rst boundary alone—an
apparently paradoxical result. About one-eighteenth of the
light-amplitude gets through the <U+FB01>rst boundary, but. about
one-ninth gets through the whole slab (ignoring the geo
metrically progressive decrease due to the thickness, that is
ignoring e““‘, and attending to the effect of the boundaries
alone ; which, however, cannot physically be done). At
<U+FB01>rst sight this was a preposterous and ludicrous result. The
second or outgoing boundary ejects from the medium nearly
double the amplitude falling upon it from inside the con
ductor l But on writing this, in substance, to Mr. Heaviside
he sent all the needf'ul answer by next post. “ The incident
disturbance inside is not the whole disturbance inside.”

                  Dr. Oliver Lodge on Opacity.       '       411
   That explains the whole paradox—there is the re<U+FB02>ected
beam to be considered too. At the entering boundary the
incident and re<U+FB02>ected amplitudes are in opposite phase, and
nearly equal, and their algebraic sum, which is transmitted,
is small. At the emerging boundary the incident and re
<U+FB02>ected amplitudes are in the same phase, and nearly equal,
and their algebraic sum, which is transmitted, is large—is
nearly double either of them. But it is a curious action :—
either more light is pushed out from the limiting boundary
of a conductor than reaches it inside, or else, I suppose,
the velocity of light inside the metal must be greater
than it is outside, a result not contradicted by Kundt’s
refraction experiments, and suggested by most optical
theories. It is worth writing out the slab theory a little
more fully, to make sure there is no mistake, though the
 whole truth of the behaviour of bodies to light can hardly be
 reached withouta comprehensive molecular dispersion theory.
 I do not think Mr. Heaviside has published his slab theory
anywhere yet. A slab theory is worked out by Prof. J. J.
Thomson in Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xlv., but it has partly
for its object the discrimination between Maxwell’s and other
 rival theories, so it is not very simple. Lord Kelvin’s Balti
 more lectures probably contain a treatment of the matter.
 All that I am doing, or think it necessary to do in an
 Address, is to put in palatable form matter already to a few
 leaders likely to be more or less known: in some cases
 perhaps both known and objected to.
    The optical fractions of Sir George Stokes, commonly
 written I) c e f, are defined, as everyone knows, as follows.
A. ray falling upon a denser body with
 incident amplitude 1 yields a re<U+FB02>ected           |     6

 ray falling upon the boundary of a
 rare body with incident amplitude 1

 ciples of reversibility show that
 b+e=0, and that bg+cf=l in a trans-                    .7"
 parent medium.
    Now in our present case we are attending to perpendicular
 incidence only, and we are treating ot' a conducting slab;
 indeed, we propose to consider the obstructive power of the
 material of the slab so great that we need not suppose that
 any appreciable fraction of light re<U+FB02>ected at the second surface
 returns to complicate matters at the <U+FB01>rst surface. This limita
 tion by no means holds in Mr. Heaviside’s complete theory, of
 course, but I am taking a simple case.

     “To <U+FB01>nd the attenuation suffered by electrical waves through
 the conductance of sea-water, the first thing is to ascertain
 whether, at the frequency proposed, the conductance is paramount,
 or the permittance, or whether both must be counted.
     “It is not- nccessary to investigate the problem for any particular
 form of circuit from which the waves proceed. The attenuating
 factor for plane waves, due to Maxwell, is sntiicient. If its validity
 be questioned for circuits in general, then it is enough to take the
 case of a simply—periodic point source in a conducting dielectric
 (‘ Electrical Papers,’ vol. ii. p. 422, § 29). The attenuating constant
 is the same, viz. (equation (199) 100 051.):—
                           c [Meir-1r
where 'n/21r is the frequency, k the conductivity, 0 the permittivity,
and v=(;ic)-t, F being the inductivity.
     “ The attenuator is then e-"i’" at distance r from the source, as
in plane waves, disregarding variations due to natural spreading.
It is thus proved for any circuit of moderate size compared with
 the wave-length, from which simply periodic waves spread.
    “ The formula must be used in general, with the best values of k
and c procurnble. But with long waves it is pretty certain that the
conductance is suf<U+FB01>cient to make 41rlv/cn large. Say with common
salt-solution k=(3011)_1, then

reduce nl to

as in a pure conductor.
    “ This is practically true perhaps even with Hertzian waves, of
which the attenuation has been measured in common-salt-solution

    “ Therefore 50 metres is the distance in which the attenuation
due to conductivity is in the ratio 2718 to 1, and there is no reason
why the conductivity of sea-water should interfere, if the value is
like that assumed above.
    “ These formulae and results were communicated by me to
Prof. Ayrton at the beginning of last year, he having enquired
 regarding the matter, on behalf of Mr. EVershed I believe.
    “ The doubtful point was the conductivity. 1 had no data, but
 took the above k from a paper which had just reached me from
 Mr. Zeeman. Now Mr. Whitehead uses k—1=2010 , which is no
 less than 15 times as great. I presume there is good authority for
 this datum *. None is given. Using it we obtain n1=<U+FB01>1,—7;.
     “ Thus 50 metres is reduced to 13-16 metres. But a considerably
 greater conductivity is required before it can be accepted that the
 statements which have appeared in the press, that the failure of
 the experiments endeavouring to establish telegraphic communica
 tion with a light-ship from the sea-bottom was due to the cou
 ductance of the sea, are correct.           It seems unlikely theoretically,
 and Mr. Stevenson has contradicted it (in ‘ Nature’) from the
 practical point of view. So far as I know, no account has been
 published of these experiments, therefore there is no means of
 <U+FB01>nding the cause of the failure.”

XXXVI. Note on Mr. Sutherland’s Paper on the Cathode Rays.
            To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
    GENTLEMEN,
 IN the March number of the Philosophical Magazine
  _    Mr. Sutherland considers a theory of the cathode rays
which I published in this Journal in October 1897, and in
which the carriers of the charges were supposed to be the
small corpuscles of which the atoms of the elementary bodies
could, on an extension of Prout’s hypothesis, be supposed to
be built up. Mr. Sutherland takes the view that in the
cathode rays we have disembodied electric charges, charges
without matter—electrons—their apparent mass being due to
the energy due to the magnetic force in the <U+FB01>eld around them
I may say
varying        thatsquare
           as the    the view
                          of thethat
                                 velocity
                                     in the    Phil. Mag.

                                                       raysx1.the
stancy of the mass arose from the charge being torn away
from the atom, so that we had only the effective mass due to
charge, occurred to me early in my experiments, but except
in the form (which I gather Mr. Sutherland does not adopt),
and which only differs verbally from the view I took, that the
atoms are themselves a collection of electrons, that is, consti
tute an assemblage of particles the individuals of which are
the same as the carriers in the cathode rays ; this conception
seemed to me to be wanting in clearness and precision, and
beset with dif<U+FB01>culties from which the other was free. In,
the theory which . I gather Mr. Sutherland holds of the
cathode rays, we have atoms which are comparatively large
systems; these'can be charged with electricity, of which in '
electrons and neutrons we have what correspond to atoms
and molecules, the radius of an electron being about 10"“ cm.
What conception must we form of the connexion between the

416        Prof. J. J. Thomson on tlw Cat/rode Rays.
above and the electron when the atom is charged? The charged
atom cannot behave as if the charge were spread over its
surface ; for if it did it would require a potential fall of about
a million volts to separate the electron from the atom. Again,
the value of m/e as determined by the Zeeman e<U+FB02>'ect is of the
same order as that deduced from the de<U+FB02>exion of the cathode
rays,so that the charge must move independently of the body
charged. The electron thus appears to act as a satellite to
the atom.
    A dif<U+FB01>culty in the way of supposing that mass is entirely
an electrical effect, and that in the impact of cathode rays we
have electrons striking against much larger masses, is the
large proportion of the energy converted into heat when the
cathode rays strike against a solid. When an electron is
 stopped, theory shows that the energ travels o<U+FB02>' in a pulse of
electromagnetic disturbance, and t is energy would only
 appear as heat at the place struck if the waves were absorbed
 by the target close to the point of impact; if these targets
 were made of a substance like aluminium, which is trans
 parent to these waves, we should expect much of the energy
 to escape in the pulse. As far as I can see the only ad
 vantage ot' the electron view is that it avoids the necessity of
 supposing the atoms to be split up : it has the disadvantage
 that to explain any property of the cathode rays such as
 Lenard’s law of absorption, which follows directly from the
 other view, hypothesis after hypothesis has to be made: it
 supposes that a charge of electricity can exist apart from
 matter, of which there is as little direct evidence as of the
 divisibility of the atom; and it leads to the view that cathode
 rays can be produced without the interposition of matter at
 all by splittingh up neutrons into electrons : it has no ad
  vantage over t e other view in explaining the penetration of
  solids by the rays, this on both views is due to the smallness
  of the particles. Until we know something about the vibra
  tions of electrons, it does not seem to throw much light on
  Rontgen rays to say that these are vibrations of the electrons.
     The direct experimental investigation of the chemical
 nature (so to speak) of the cathode rays is very dif<U+FB01>cult, and
 though I have for some time past been engaged on experi
 ments with this object, they have not so far given any decisive
 result.

   2. ‘The Permian Conglomerates 0f the Lower Severn Basin.’
By W. Wickham King, Esq., F.G.S.
   The rocks thus described are the calcareous conglomerates in
cluded in the Middle Permian of the Shropshire type, and exposed
north of the Abberley and Lickey Hills. Three calcareous horizons
occur, interstrati<U+FB01>ed in sandstones or marls and surmounted by
the Permian breccia. It was the opinion of Ramsay and others
that the materials of the calcareous horizons and of the Permian
breccia had been brought from the Welsh border; but Buckland and

 418                      Geological Society :—
 Jukes, among others, claimed a. southern derivation for those of the
 Permian breccia, from local hill-ranges to the south. The latter
 view accords with the fact that the pebbles composing these
 calcareous horizons, and also the broken fragments constituting the
 Permian breccias north of the Abberley and Lickey Hills, are coarser
 in the south-easterly direction, and gradually become <U+FB01>ner to the
 north-west.
    The fragments embedded in the Middle Permian calcareous bands
 near the Lickey are chie<U+FB02>y of Archzean rocks, but in all the other
 districts described there are very few rock-fragments older than
 Woolhope Limestone. 0n the other hand, pebbles of dolomitic Wen
lock and Carboniferous Limestones are abundant, while Aymestry
 Limestone, Old Red, Carboniferous, and Lower Permian sandstones
occur in greater or less abundance ; and all these rocks, except the
Carboniferous Limestone, may be seen in ailu near at hand to the
south. A summary of work done in the Halesowen Coal-Measure
conglomerates and in the Permian breccia north of the Abberley
and Lickey Hills is given, to bring out one of the lines of argument
adopted.                       I
    (1) Ridges near the Lickey were denuded down to the Archasan
rocks in Upper Carboniferous time; therefore, as might have been
expected, both the adjacent Upper Carboniferous conglomerate and
the Middle Permian calcareous cornstones are composed of such
fragments of Archiean rocks as are to be found in situ. there, or at
Nuneaton ; and the Upper Carboniferous conglomerate is also largely
composed of ’ulmozoic rocks identical with those in situ on the
<U+FB02>anks of the Lickey.
   (2) The Middle Permian calcareous conglomerates of the other
districts described are for the most part made up of fragments not
older than the Woolhope Limestone, which were presumably derived
by denudation from ridges which had become more extensive.
   (3) The Lickey ridges having been denuded to the Archaean rocks
and the more extended area to the Woolhope Limestone, the later
Permian breccias are composed of Archman fragments near the
Lickey, but of rocks not newer than the Woolhope Limestone in the
other districts north of the Abberley and Lickey Hills.
   The author has for several years called the ancient ridges from
which these materials were derived the ‘ Meroian Highlands,’ and
claims that the Palaeozoic and Archwan rocks composing the stumps
of these highlands lie almost entirely buried under the Trias of
the Midlands south and east of the SE. Shropshire and South
Sta<U+FB01>'ordshire regions.                 ‘

   2. ‘ The Torsion-Structure of the Dolomites.’ By Maria M.
Ogilvie, D.Sc. [Mrs Gordon].
   The paper opens with a general account of the work of Richthofen,
Mojsisovics, Rothpletz, Salomon, Brb'gger, the author, and others
on the Dolomitic area of Southern Tyrol. It then gives the results of a
detailed survey recently made by the author of the complicated strati
graphy of the rocks of the Groden Pass, the Buchenstein Valley, and
the massives of Sella and Sett Sass ; together with the author’s inter
pretation of these results, and her application of that interpretation
to the explanation of the Dolomite region in general. The author
concludes that overthrusts and faults of all types are far more common
in the Dolomites than has hitherto been supposed. The arrangement
of these faults is typically a torsion-phenomenon, the result of the
superposition of a later upon an earlier strike. This later crust
movement was of Middle Tertiary age, and one with the movement
which gave origin to the well-known Judicarian-Asta phenomena.
The youngest dykes (and also the granite-masses) are of Middle
Tertiary age, while the geographical position of both is the natural
effect of the crust-torsion itself. This crust-torsion also fully
explains the peculiar stratigraphical phenomena in the Dolomite
region, such as the present isolation of the mountain-massives of
dolomitie rock.
   The Groden Pass area, <U+FB01>rst selected for description by the author,
is a distorted anticlinal form running approximately N.N.E. and
S.S.W., and including all the formations ranging from the Bellerophon
Limestone, through the Alpine Muschelkalk and Buchenstein Beds,
to the top of the \Vengen Series. “'hcn studied in section, the strata
of the Pass are found to be arranged in a complex fold form, showing
 a central anticlinal with lateral wings, limited on opposite sides by
 faults and tlexures. Strongly marked overthrusting to 8.8.13. in
 the northern wing is responded to by return overthrusts to N.N.W.
 in the southern wing.     The strata in the middle limb of the anti
 clinal wings bend steeply downwards into knee-bond <U+FB01>exurcs.
 Through these run series of normal and reversed faults, into which
 has been injected a network of igneous rocks, giving rise to ‘ shear
 and-contaet ’ breccias, which have previously been grouped as
.Buchenstein tutf and agglomerates, and referred to the Triassic
p eriod.
    The area of movement of the Groden Pass system is an ellipsoid in I
form. Two foci occur within it, where the effects of shear and strain
have culminated. The forces of compression acted not in parallel
lines, but round the area, thus causing torsion of the earth-crust.
Two main faults occur (with a general east-and-west trend) whose
 actual lines of direction intersect at a point about midway between
the foci of the torsion-ellipsoid. These are the chief s trike torsion
faults ; many minor ones pass out easterly and westerly from the foci,
forming longitudinal or strike torsion-bundles. The strike
system of faults is cut by a series of diagonal or transverse
 curved branching faults, with a more or less north-easterly or north
 westerly direction. These diagonal faults may out each other, or

 420                       Geological Society.
 may combine to form characteristic tor sion- curves. The author
 regards the longitudinal and diagonal faults as constituting one
 system. Each port ion on one side of the anticlinal form of the
 system has its reciprocal on the other side. The Spitz Kotl syncline
  on the north is the reciprocal of that of Sella on the south, the
 Langko<U+FB02> 0n the south-west of that of Sass Songe on the north-east,
 and so on.
     The anticlinal area of the Buchcnstein Valley is next described.
 Here we have a torsion-system similar to that of the Griiden Pass,
 and made up of similar elements; but the western portion of the
 anticlinal is much compressed and displaced. Opposing areas of
 depression are also found here, that of Sella and Sett Sass on the
 north being reciprocated by that of the Marmolata on the south, and
 so on. The porphyrite-sills have here been mainly injected into the
 knee-bends of the northern wing of the anticlinal form, but igneous
 injections and contact-phenomena are also met with in some of the
 transverse faults.
    A full description is given of the sequence and stratigraphy in the
 Sella massive—once regarded by some authorities as a Triassic
 coral-reef. This is an ellipsoidal synclinal area with N .N.E. and
 S.S.W. axes twisted to north-east and south-west. Peripheral over
thrusts have taken place outward from the massive, in such a way
 as to buckle up the rocks like a broad-topped fan-structure, and these
 overthrusts are traced by the author completely round the massive.
 A central infold of Jurassic strata occurs on the plateau, where the
 Upper Trias has been overthrust inwards on three sides of the infold.
 The author next passes in review the results obtained in the area
 of Sett Sass, etc. and shows how they all present corresponding
 tectonic phenomena.                                         ,
    The district thus studied in detail by the author forms a typical
 unit in the structural features of the Dolomite region. It is cutoff
to the eastward by the limiting fault (north-and-south‘ of Sasso
de Stria, and to the westward by the parallel fault of Sella Joch.
These are de<U+FB01>nite con<U+FB01>nes, which limit a four-sided area, in<U+FB02>uenced
by the Gro'den Pass torsion-system on the north and the Buchenstein
Valley system on the south. The limits of this four-sided <U+FB01>gure
include a compound area of depression (formed by the Sella and Sett
Sass synclinals) traversed by the diagonal Oampolungo buckle.
‘ The area displays in a marked degree the phenomena of interference
cross-faults cutting a series of peripheral overthrusts round the
synclines, and parallel <U+FB02>exure-faults between the anticlinal buckles
and the synclinal axes.’
    In conclusion, the author applies her results to the interpretation
of the complexities of the Judicarian-Asta region of the Dolomites
in general, and also to the explanation of the characteristic
structural forms of the Alpine system as a whole.

 XXXIX. The Efects of Temperature and of Circular Mag
    netization on Longitudinally Magnetized [ran Wire. By
    F. H. PITCHER, MA.SC., Demonstrator in Physics, McGill
    University, Montreal *.
                     OIg'ects of the Investigation.
 1N commencing these experiments in October 1894, the
       original intention was to investigate only the e<U+FB01>'ect of
temperature on the magnetization of iron. With this object
 the specimen was heated in a platinum tube, maintained at a
steady temperature by means of an electric current. The
temperature was inferred from the resistance of the platinum
tube, which was very uniformly heated and extended for some
distance beyond the ends of the iron wire. This proved to be
a very perfect method of heating, as the temperature could
be easily varied and accurately regulated and measured. The
current in the platinum tube was also without magnetic effect
on the specimen or the magnetometer, and the specimen was
necessarily at the same mean temperature as the enclosing
tube. A concentric brass tube formed the return lead.
   Unfortunately there was some dif<U+FB01>culty at the outset in'
procuring suitable platinum tubes, and the attempt to make
tubes in the laboratory by rolling up strips of platinum foil
did not prove entirely satisfactory owing to the inferior
quality of the foil.    The tubes invariably cracked and became
useless before a complete series of observations had been
      ~ ' Communicated by Prof. H. L. Callendar, M.A., F.R.S.

422 Mr. F. H. Pitcher on E<U+FB01>'ects of Temperature and
obtained. The incomplete series of tests obtained in this
manner were, however, of interest as a veri<U+FB01>cation of the
method subsequently adopted.
   In the meantime, while awaiting the production of suitable
tubes, it was thought that interesting results might be ob—
tained by heating the iron wire with an electric current
passed through the wire itself, and deducing its mean tem
perature from its resistance, with the aid of the formula
veri<U+FB01>ed by Prof. Oallendar (Phil. Trans, A. 1887, p. 225) by
the direct comparison of platinum and iron wires. The
objection to this method of heating is that the wire is cir
cularly magnetized by the heating current, and that it is
necessary to disentangle the effects of the temperature change
and of the circular magnetization on the longitudinal mag
netization of the specimen. The effect of the circular <U+FB01>eld
itself, however, is not without interest.
   In order to disentangle these effects, three separate series of
observations were taken for the same range of current or circu
lar <U+FB01>eld,     in a very high vacuum ; (2) in air at atmospheric
pressure; (3) in a current of water. In case (1) a current
of 16 amperes suf<U+FB01>ced to heat the wire above its critical
temperature; in case (2) the highest temperature was
400° (1; in case (3) the heating effect was practically
negligible.
               Methods of ltleasurement Adopted.
   The iron wire specimen was magnetizedzby means of a
specially constructed solenoid, and the intensity of mag_
netization I at any time was observed by means of the
de<U+FB01>exion of a magnetometer, the direct effect of the solenoid
being very carefully compensated by means of a balancing
coil in the usual manner. The broadside-on position was
adopted for the test in preference to the vertical or the end
on position, as it had been found by reliminary tests that,
if the distance of the specimen from t e magnetometer were
suitably adjusted, the broadside-0n method agreed much
more closely with ballistic tests of the same specimen than
either of the more usual positions. The value of the Earth’s
<U+FB01>eld H was repeatedly determined by the aid ofa Kohlrausch
variometer.                                   j _ .- '
   The deflexion of the magnetometer was observed by means
of a telescope and a metre-scale of milk-glass'very accurately
divided. The magnetometer was also provided with suitable
galvanometer-coils, so that readings of current and resistance,
could be taken on the same scale.          The scalle the gal
vanometer was carefully calibrated throughout, and all the

      Circular Magnetization on Magnetized Iron Wire.      423
 observations were reduced by means of the correction curve
obtained. The heating and magnetizing currents were
passed through suitable manganin resistances immersed in
oil, so that by observing the de<U+FB02>exion of the     alvanometer
when connected successively to the terminals oft e manganin
resistances and the specimen itself, the two currents and the
resistance of the specimen could be quickly determined at any
time with an accuracy of at least 1 part in 1000. By varying
the resistance in series with the galvanometer it was possible
to obtain accurately readable de<U+FB02>exions through a very wide
range of current and resistance.
    The Magnetizz'ng Solenoid.—The solenoid was wound on a
thin brass tube about 70 centim. long, with an external
diameter of 2'23 centim. The insulation resistance was very
high, special pains having been taken to insulate each layer
with paraf<U+FB01>n and paper.      The winding was tested for uni
formity by measuring each <U+FB01>fty turns during the process.
The length of the winding was 60'25 centim., containing
4079 turns of No. 24 B & S double silk-covered wire in four
layers, and having a resistance of 28 ohms at 15°C. This
gave a magnetizing <U+FB01>eld of over 300 G.G.S. with 100 volts
on the terminals. In order to dissipate the heat due to the
magnetizing current at high <U+FB01>elds, an internal water circula
tion was provided through an annular space formed by a
second concentric brass tube. '
    The Mounting for the Iron Wire Specimen—As the specimen
was enclosed in a vacuum-tube, and its resistance at each
temperature determined, a special form of mounting was
necessary.                                   '
   The iron-wire specimen was 0127 centim. diameter and 261
centim. long, or a little over 200 diameters. Its ends were
fused to copper wires '040 centim. diameter and 10 centim.
long ; the diameter of the copper wire being chosen by trial
to ive a uniform temperature throughout the whole length
of t e iron wire when the heating current was passed through
the circuit.
   The ends of these copper wires were tin-soldered and
riveted to stout copper conductors which were brought out
through spiral c0pper springs to the ends of the containing
tube. The two copper springs, whose function was to take
up the slack of the heated specimen, had each exactly the
same number of turns, and were wound oppositely so that the
direct effect (on the magnetometer) of the current circulating
through them would be compensated. The whole was centered
and kept in place by brass washers which <U+FB01>tted the thin glass
Containing tube. The glass gibe just <U+FB01>tted the inner brass
                             2 2

424      Mr. F. H. Pitcher on Efecta of Temperature and
tube, and was made suf<U+FB01>ciently long to extend at both ends
beyond the brass tube.
   Very <U+FB01>ne platinum wires (0'003 centim. diameter) were
attached at 15 centim. apart to the iron wire specimen. They
served as potential leads, and were brought out beyond one
end of the glass containing tube, through sealed capillary
tubes.
   The glass tube was made tight at both ends by <U+FB01>tting
brass cups over and <U+FB01>lling with fusible alloy, one end of the
tube having been drawn down so that when capped it could
he slipped into the solenoid tube. A copper tube was intro
duced through and soldered in the larger brass cap, to serve
for exhausting. The vacuum was maintained by a <U+FB01>ve-fall
 Sprengel pump, assisted in the early stages by a water pump.
   The remaining apparatus consisted mainly of resistance—
boxes, rheostats, special arrangements of mercury-cup con
tacts, switches, storage-batteries, &c.
                       Preliminary Tests.
    The specimen was of commercial so-called soft iron wire,
and was carefully annealed and polished before mounting.
The vacuum-tube containing it was connected to the Sprengel
  amp and a high vacuum maintained while the wire was
being heated by the current. It was observed by the eye
that the heating was very uniform, the whole becoming
an even red right up to the ends, at a high vacuum. The
zero-point or resistance at 0° C. of the specimen was now
obtained. It was then placed in the solenoid and the
 equivalent magnetic length determined. This was found to '
 be a little over 20 centim., and the magnetometer distance
 was arranged so that slight changes of the length had a
 minimum effect on the magnetometer readings.            A pre
 liminary test for the magnetic quality of the iron at ordinary
 temperatures was <U+FB01>rst made. It was found before further
annealing to be fairly hard, having a hysteresis loss for
 B: 17,000, of 16,000 ergs per cub. centim., and apermeability
 at that induction of 500.
    After annealing several times in a vacuum, the loss at
nearly the same induction had fallen to 6000 ergs, and <U+FB01>nally,
 after successive annealings, arrived at the extraordinarily low
value of 557 ergs for B=3500 at ordinary temperatures.
This, in spite of the fact that the specimen was only com
mercial wire, is almost as ood as the best specimen of
transformer iron tested by <U+FB01>wing.       By this time the wire
had settled down to a very steady magnetic state, as shown

      Circular [Magnetization on Magnetized Iron Wire.       425
by successive tests before and after heating. Before pro
ceeding further the zero-point of the specimen was again
tested, and was found to agree to within 1/ 10 of one per cent.
with the previous determination. There was no trace of
oxidation.
                        The Observations.
    The method of taking the observations was as follows :—
First, the containing tube was exhausted.     The magnetometer
de<U+FB01>exions were observed at longitudinal <U+FB01>elds ranging from
1 to 30, with currents in the wire varying from O to 16 amp.
It was previously observed that the wire was practically
demagnetized at 16 amps, which corresponds to a temperature
of 750° C.
    The current in the solenoid was reversed several times
before each reading of the magnetometer de<U+FB02>exion, thus
ensuring a reversal curve. The current in the wire was kept
constant for each reversal curve. Its value with that of the
corresponding resistance of the wire was observed at intervals
along the curve.     The effect of residual thermal currents in
the heating circuit was eliminated by reversal of the current
in the wire.
    The Sprengel pump was kept running during the whole
 set of observations in order that the gases given off from
the heated iron and copper, as well as air which might leak
in owin to imperfect sealing, might not affect the vacuum.
 Under t ese conditions the vacuum was kept very high and
 constant, and the iron wire remained bright throughout the
 whole series of tests.
    On the completion of this set of observations the vacuum
 was let down, the containing tube disconnected from the
 pump, and a similar set taken in air. All the conditions
 remained the same as before, except that the wire was tested
 in air instead of in a high vacuum, and was therefore at a
 necessarily lower temperature for the same heat-ing current.
     As soon as possible afterwards, two similar series of obser
 vations were taken at much higher <U+FB01>elds, varying from 50 to
 300. The conditions were exactl the same in this case as in
 the lower <U+FB01>elds, except that t e controlling <U+FB01>eld of the
 magnetometer had to be strengthened, and that the vacuum
 at which the higher temperature observations were taken was
 slightly less perfect.
     At this stage the zero-point of the specimen was again
 tested and was found to agree with the two previous deter
 minations, within the limits of accuracy of the method. ‘ It is
  interesting to observe that the electrical resistance was

426      Mr. F. H. Pitcher on Efects of Temperature and
practicall una<U+FB01>'ected by magnetization, and that the reduc
tion of t e hysteresis loss to one-third of its original value
was unaccompanied by any measurable change of conductivity.
   Specimen tables of the reduced observations in vacuum and
in air are here exhibited.

 428     Mr. F. H. Pitcher on Efects of Temperature and
    The Curves of <U+FB01>g. 1.—The magnetic observations were
 taken at thirteen different <U+FB01>elds, curves for seven of which
 have been plotted in <U+FB01>g. 1. The longitudinal <U+FB01>eld of the
 solenoid is indicated for each air of curves. Each pair is
 drawn for the same <U+FB01>eld. szcissae represent current in
 the wire and ordinates longitudinal intensity of magnetization.
 The curves drawn in full lines are for the observations taken
 in a vacuum and ata higher temperature than those in dotted
 lines, which are for the observations taken in air. Where the
 curves coincide, showing no effect of temperature, full lines
 are drawn.
    The curves shown in <U+FB01>g. '2 are the corresponding tempe
 rature-curves plotted to current in the wire. The lower of
 these curves is that for the specimen in air. The points
vmarked with a cross belong to the observations in <U+FB01>elds above
 30 0.6.5. The middle curve is the temperature-curve in
 vacuum for the higher <U+FB01>elds; while the top curve is that for
 lower <U+FB01>elds in vacuum, from 30 down. The temperature
 di<U+FB01>'erence between the dotted and full-line curves for any
 current in the wire can at once be found by consulting the
 corresponding temperature-curves in <U+FB01>g. 2 on the same
ordinate.
    Considering the tables and the curves of <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2, it
 will be noticed that the known behaviour of soft iron at constant
 <U+FB01>elds, as temperature advances, is well displayed.
    In high <U+FB01>elds the dotted and full-line curves of each pair
separate almost from the start, and do not meet in any part
 of their course, showing a continual decrease in intensity of
 magnetization from the beginning as temperature increases.
    At a <U+FB01>eld of 10 0.6.5. there appears to be no change in
the intensity of magnetization for a temperature-di<U+FB02>'erence of
 350° 0., as shown by the fourth curve (<U+FB01>g. 1) from the top,
together with the top and bottom curves (<U+FB01>g. 2).
    At still lower <U+FB01>elds the intensity begins to increase for a
comparatively small temperature-di<U+FB01>'erence, as shown by the
two lower pairs of curves, <U+FB01>g. 1. The effect of the circular
 <U+FB01>eld on the longitudinal component is here very marked. If
the dotted curves, where the temperature is less in evidence,
 he considered, it will be seen that, in high longitudinal <U+FB01>elds,
 as the circular <U+FB01>eld increases there is but little change in the
longitudinal intensity. Somewhere between a longitudinal
<U+FB01>eld of 30 and 10 a point of in<U+FB02>ection occurs, and the curves
below are changed in form entirely. At fairly low <U+FB01>elds
 (from 3'5 downwards) the drop with small increments of
circular <U+FB01>eld is at first very great, but soon reaches a limit;
and the curves become very <U+FB02>at.
    The explanation of these effects is that for high longitudinal

       Circular Magnetization on Magnetized Iron Wire.                429
<U+FB01>elds the permeability is very small.           Therefore the circular
<U+FB01>eld would have at <U+FB01>rst only a slight effect in diminishing the
longitudinal intensity. On the other hand, in lower <U+FB01>elds
the permeability is many times greater, and hence the effect
of the circular <U+FB01>eld is much more marked, until the direction
of the resultant <U+FB01>eld swings around nearer to the direction of
the circular
intensity      <U+FB01>eld, when
            becomes           the rate of change in the longitudinali
                       very slow.
    Temperature- Curves, <U+FB01>g. 2.— The curious wave which occurs
at the upper end of each high-temperature curve (in vacuo)
may be partly due to the sudden change in the temperature
coe<U+FB02>icient of iron at high temperatures ‘, and partly also, in this
particular case, to the effect on the vacuum of gas given off
from the wire. The pump may not have been able to exhaust
at a suf<U+FB01>ciently high rate.
    Hopkinson (Phil. Trans. vol. clxxx.) investigated the resist
ance-temperature curves of soft iron and steel at high tempe
ratures up to 900° C. The temperature was inferred from
the resistance of a copper wire enclosed with his specimens,
apparently on the assumption of a constant temperature
coef<U+FB01>cient for copper. He found a sudden drop in the tem
 perature-coef<U+FB01>cient for soft iron and steel between 800° and
 9000 0. beyond the critical point. It seems desirable that
 this should be tested up to higher temperatures by comparison
 with a platinum pyrometer.
    Method of Distinguishing t/ze Efects of Temperature and
                      of Circular Magnetization.
    By treating the ordinates of the curves in <U+FB01>g. 1 as one
 component of the resultant intensity the temperature-variation
 of the magnetization of iron at high <U+FB01>elds can be worked out
 to a fairly accurate result.
    The <U+FB01>rst step in the reduction was to obtain a family of
 curves (a) of average resultant I and H at di<U+FB01>'erent tem
 peratures. These were compared with a similar set (1)) from
 which temperature-effect had been eliminated. Then by
 treating the drop between corresponding curves of the <U+FB01>rst
 and second set—at the same resultant <U+FB01>elds—as due to tem
 perature, the temperature-effect on the resultant intensity
 was obtained.
     The average circular <U+FB01>eld in the wire was taken equal to
 two thirds of the <U+FB01>eld at the periphery. This was compounded
 with the longitudinal <U+FB01>eld to give the avera e resultant <U+FB01>eld
 due to the two magnetizing forces. The longitudinal <U+FB01>eld
 previous to compounding was corrected for the effect of the
    ' A_ rapid increase of a similar character was observed by Callendar to
 occur Just below the critical point.

                   Efect of Circular Magnetization (<U+FB01>g. 3).
    Before obtainin the second set (b) of average resultant I
 and H curves wit which the above were compared, it was
 necessary to eliminate the effect of temperature. This was
 done by taking the drop between any two points on the dotted
 and full-line curves (<U+FB01>g. 1) which are at the same tempe
 rature as due to circular magnetization, an assumption which
 is very nearly correct, especially in the higher <U+FB01>elds.
    In this way the family of curves in <U+FB01>g. 3 was obtained.

432      Efects of Temperature on Magnetized Iron Wire.
              Veri<U+FB01>cation and Discussion of Results.
   It is interesting to notice in <U+FB01>g. 3 the limiting e<U+FB02>'ect of the
circular magnetization in high <U+FB01>elds.         The curves up to
12 amps. in the wire almost coincide at a longitudinal <U+FB01>eld
of 150 c.c.s.
   To test how far the results in <U+FB01>g. 3 were reliable, the wire
was mounted in a glass tube and a water circulation allowed
to <U+FB02>ow through the tube in contact with the wire. Thus the
temperature of the wire was kept practically constant for all
values of the current. The results of these tests agreed very
closely indeed with those shown in <U+FB01>g. 3, even down to a <U+FB01>eld
of 10 0.e.s.
   Klemencic (Wied Ann. vol. lvi. p. 574) investigated the
circular magnetization of iron wires together with the axial
magnetization by a different method. By including the wire
as an arm of a Wheatstone’s bridge and using a ballistic
  alvanometer, the circular magnetization was deduced from
t 0 observed value of the self-induction for diiferent currents
in the wire. Here the change of temperature of wire intro
duces dif<U+FB01>culties. lt seems that the magnetometer method,
when the wire is kept at a. constant temperature, is much
simpler and less troublesome.
   The results shown in <U+FB01>g. 4 were found to agree closely with
the tests obtained for soft iron by the platinum-tube method.
The point of demagnetization was obtained a tri<U+FB02>e lower by
the latter method, and the initial slope of the curve at a <U+FB01>eld
of 290 0.6 S. was a little less. It will be noted that the point
of demagnetization is not absolutely sharp ; the curves suddenly
change their direction and I decreases more slowly. This
was also investigated in special tests made by the platinum
tube method. The value of I at 750° C. was observed to be
about 7 c.e.s.
   These results are found to agree very well with those for
soft iron in high <U+FB01>elds obtained by Curie (Comptes Rendus,
vol. cxviii. p. 859). He heated his specimen in a platinum
heating-coil and measured the temperature inside the coil by
a thermo-couple. The point of demagnetization which he
obtained is rather higher than that obtained by the platinum
tube or current-in-the-wire methods, but not so high as that
given by Hopkinson (loo. cit.) who used a copper wire for
his temperature measurements. More recently a paper has
appeared by Morris (Phil. Mag. vol. xliv. Sept. 1897), who
employed the same method of heating as Curie, but measured
the temperature with a platinum wire. It will be seen that
the method of heating with a coil is less perfect than with

       Resistance and Inductance of a Wire to a Discharge.          433
a platinum tube, and less simple than the current in the

   The results of the foregoing experiments were communicated
to Section Gof the British Association at Toronto, and a brief
abstract appears in the B. A. Report for 1897, but the curves
were not reproduced.
   In conclusion, I should like to thank Professor Callendar
for kind suggestions and other assistance.

XL. The Equivalent Resistance and Inductance of a Wire
    to an Oscillatory Discharge. By EDWIN H. BARTON,
    D.Sc., F.R.S.E., Senior Lecturer in Physics, University
     College, lVotting/zam '.
 IN an article in the Philosophical Magazine for May
        1886 1‘, Lord Rayleigh, whilst greatly extending Max
well’s treatment of the self-induction of cylindrical con
ductors, con<U+FB01>ned the discussion of alternating currents to
those which followed the harmonic law with constant ampli
tude. The object of the present note is to slightly modify
the analysis so as to include also the decaying periodic
currents obtained in discharging a condenser and the case of
the damped trains of high-frequency waves generated by a
Hertzian oscillator and now so often dealt with experi
mentally. In fact, it was while recently working with the
latter that the necessity of attacking this problem occurred
to me.
    Résumé of previous T/ieories.—To make this paper in
telligible without repeated references to both Maxwell and
Rayleigh, it may be well to explain again the notation used
and sketch the line of argument followed.
    The conducting wire is supposed to be a straight cylinder
of radius a, the return wire being at a considerable distance.
The vector potential, H, the density of the current, w, and
the “electromotive force at any point” may thus be con
sidered as functions of two variables only, viz., the time, t,
and the distance, r, from the axis of the wire. The total
current, C, through the section of the wire, and the total
 electromotive force, E, acting round the circuit, are the
 variables whose relation is to be found. It is assumed that

  where S, T0, T], &c., are functions of the time. A relation
  between the T’s is next established so that the subscripts are
  replaced by coef<U+FB01>cients. The value of H at the surface of the
  wire is equated to AC, where A is a constant. This leads to
  Maxwell’s equation (13) of art. 690. The magnetic permea
  bility, a, of the wire, which Maxwell had treated as unity, is
  now introduced by Lord Rayleigh, who thus obtains in place
  of Maxwell’s (14) and (15) the following equations :—

      apply equations (5), (6), and (7) to the case of logarithmically
      damped alternating currents where all the functions are
      proportional to e(‘-")P‘.
         The value of E so obtained must then be separated into
      real and imaginary parts as in (8), and then, together with
      the imaginary quantities, must be collected a proportionate
      part of the real ones so as to exhibit the result in the form
                           E=R”C+(i—k)pL”O.               . . . . (11)
         The quantities denoted by R” and L” in this equation will
      then represent what may be called the equivalent resistance
      and inductance of length l of the wire to the damped periodic
      currents under discussion. For, the operand being now
      e“"‘>P‘, the time differentiator produces (i—k)p, and not ip
      simply as in equation (8) for the sustained harmonic currents.

    Referring again to equations (23) and (24), we see that
for a given value of p, if It varies from O to co , the factor
involving 8 increases without limit while that involving 0
increases to unity. Hence, with increasing damping, it
appears that R” and L” each increase also, while ever the
equations remain applicable. Now an in<U+FB01>nite value of k
involves zero frequency 1'. And a certain large, though
<U+FB01>llilite},1value of k would prevent the frequency being classed as

deal with K a function of It only, rather than with R”/R

442      Mr. L. N. G. Filon on certain Difraction Fringe:
    Light from a distant source is allowed to pass through two
thin parallel slits. The rays are then focussed on a. screen
 (or the retina of the eye) and interference—fringes are seen.
If the distant source be really double, or extended, the fringes
will disa pear for certain values of the distance between the
slits. T is distance depends on the angle subtended by the
two components of the double source or the diameter of the
extended source.
    Mr. Michelson, however, in obtaining his results treated
the breadth of the slits as small compared with the wave
length of light and their length as in<U+FB01>nite. This seems un
justifiable 2. priori.     The present investigation takes the
dimensions of the slits into account.
     2. Suppose we have an aperture or diaphragm of any
shape in a screen placed just in front of the object-glass of a
telescope (<U+FB01>g. 1).
                               Fig. 1.
       P
    Let the axis of the telescope be the axis of 2'. Let the
axes of a“ and y be taken in the plane of the diaphragm 0Q
   erpendicular to and in the plane of the paper res ectively.
Let S be a source of light whose coordinates are ll, V, W.
 Let Q be any point in the diaphragm whose coordinates are
 (.v, y). Let AP be a screen perpendicular to the axis of the
telescope, and let (p, y) be the coordinates of any point P on
 this screen.    Let A'P be the conjugate image of the screen
 AP in the object-glass.
     Let b =distance of centre 0 of lens from screen AP.
         6':       ,,       ,,    ,,   ,,   image of screen AP.
         f =distance of diaphragm OQ from plane A'P'.
     Then if, as is usual, we break up a wave of light coming

             as applied to Micrometric Observations.         443
from S at the diaphragm, the secondary wave due to the
disturbance at Q would have to travel along a path QRTP in
order to reach a point P on the screen, being regularly
refracted.
    But since P' is the geometrical image of P, all rays which
converge to P (i. e. ass through P) after refraction, must
have passed through E” before refraction, to the order of our
ap roximation.
P, ence the ray through Q which is to reach P must be
   Q.
   Moreover, P and P' being conjugate images the change of
phase of a wave travelling from P’ to P is constant to the <U+FB01>rst
ap roximation and independent of the position of Q.
      ow the disturbance at P due to an element da: dg of the
diaphragm at Q is of the form

where 7t is the wave-length, 'r is the period, A is a constant,
a is the index of refraction of the material of the lens, and b
is put instead of QP outside the trigonometrical term, because
the distance of the lens from the diaphragm and the inclination
of the rays are supposed small.
   But        P’Q + QR + pRT + TP =constant for P.

l/W, and the term in .a.-’+yg may be comparable with the

we see that appearances out of focus will introduce expres
sions of the same kind as those which occur when no lenses
are used.
   We will, however, only consider the case where the screen
is in focus. Let —u and —v be the coordinates of the geome

                    u/b=U/W,          v/b=V/W.

Hence the intensity becomes very small outside a rectangle
whose centre is the geometrical image and whose vertical
and horizontal sides are bA/k and bk/h respectively.

the source.

   The successive maximum and minimum intensities do not
vary with 0. Hence, what Mr. Michelson calls the measure
of visibility of the fringes, namely the quantity

where II, I, are successive maximum and minimum intensities,
does not vary with the distance between the slits. The only
effect of varying the latter is to make the frin es close up or
open out. Hence for a point-source of lig t the fringes
cannot be made to practically disappear.
   3. Consider now two point-sources of light whose geo
metrical images are J1, J,, and draw their visible rectangles

   To get the resultant intensit we have to add the in
tensities at every point due to eac source separately.
   Then it may be easil seen that the following are the
phenomena observed in t 0 three cases shown in <U+FB01>g. 3:—
   (l) The two sets of fringes distinct. Consequently no
motion of the slits can destroy the fringes. In this case,
however, the eye can at once distinguish between the two
sources and Michelson’s method is unnecessary.
   (2) Partial superposition : the greatest effect is round the
point K, where the intensities due to the two sources are
very nearly equal. If v’ —-v be the distance between J1 and
J2 measured perpendicularly to the slits, so that (v'—v)/b is
the difference of altitude of the two stars when the slits are
horizontal, then over the common area the fringe system is
(a) intensi<U+FB01>ed if v'—v be an even multiple of bA/4a, (b)
weakened, or even destroyed, if v'--v be an odd multiple of
bX/éa. For in case (a) the maxima of one system are super
posed upon the maxima of the other, while in case (b) the
maxima of the one are superposed upon the minima of the
other. This common area, however, will contain only com
paratively faint fringes, the more distinct ones round the

             as applied to Micrometric Observations.          447
centres remaining unaffected. We may suppose case (2) to
occur whenever the centre of either rectangle lies outside the
other, i. e. whenever v’—v>b)»/2k, u’ —u>b7t/2h, u’ —u being
the horizontal distance between J1 and J2.
    (3) Almost complete superposition of the visible rectangles.
The frin es of high intensity are now affected. These are
destroye or weakened whenever a is an odd multiple of _
bA/4(v’—v), provided that the intensity of one source be not
small compared with that of the other.
    Case (3) may be taken to occur when c’-v<b)t/2k and
u.’ —u < lik/2h.
    The smallest value of a for which the fringes disappear is
bX/4(v'—v).
    If v’—v be very small, this may give a large value of a.
    Now a double star ceases to be resolved by a telescope of
aperture 2r if (v’—v)/bi7t/2r, and when this relation holds
the smallest value of a for which the fringes disappear is not
less than r/2, which is the greatest separation of the slits
which can conveniently be used. Hence the method ceaSes
to be available precisely at the moment when it is most
needed.
    (4) Mr. Michelson, in the paper quoted above, noticed this
dif<U+FB01>culty, and described an apparatus by means of which the
effective aperture of the telescope could be inde<U+FB01>nitely
increased. He has not shown, however, that the expression
for the disturbance remains of the same form, to the order of
approximation taken, and he has made no attempt to work
out the results when the slit is taken of <U+FB01>nite width, as it
should be.
    In his paper Mr. Michelson describes two kinds of appa
ratus. I shall con<U+FB01>ne my attention to the second one, as
being somewhat more symmetrical.
    So far as I can gather from Mr. Michelson’s description,
 the instrument consists primarily of a system of three mirrors
a, b, c and two strips of glass e,d (<U+FB01>g. 4). The mirrors a and
b are parallel, and c, d, e are parallel. Light from a point P
in one slit is reflected at Q and R by the mirrors a and b, is
 refracted through the strip e, and <U+FB01>nally emerges parallel to
its original direction as T U. Light from a point P’ in the
other slit is refracted through the strip d, and re<U+FB02>ected at S’
and T' by the strips 0 and c.
    I may notice in passing that the strip e should be half
 silvered, but not at the back, for if the ray S’ T’ is allowed to
 penetrate inside the strip and emerge after two refractions
 and one re<U+FB02>exion, not only is a. change of phase introduced,
 owing to the path in the glass, which complicates the analysis,

448       Mr. L. N. G. Filon on certain Dij'raction Fringes
 but the conditions of re<U+FB02>exion, which should be the same for
all four mirrors, are altered, and this chan es the intensities
of the two streams. We shall see afterwards that this silver
ing can be done without impeding the passage of the trans
mitted stream, as it will turn out that the two streams must
be kept separate.

    Suppose then that a plane wave of light whose front is
M M’ is incident upon the diaphragm.                Let us break the wave
up, as is usual, in the plane of the diaphragm. Let- Z be a
point on the screen whose cordinates are (p, g) at which the
intensity of light is required.
    Then if C be the centre of the object-glass, the direction in
which rays T U, T’ U’ must proceed in order to converge to
Z after refraction is parallel to C Z.
    Hence PQ, RS, TU, P’Q’, R’S’, T’U' are all parallel to CZ,
and the direction-cosines of OZ are

plate and are of equal thickness. This will sensibly simplify
the analysis, though, as I think, it Would not materially in<U+FB02>u
ence the appearances if the strips were unequal.
    If, however, we suppose them equal, we may neglect the
presence of strips, as far as refraction is concerned, since
clearly the retardation introduced is the same for all parallel
ra s.

   Produce PQ, P’Q’ to meet it in V and V’ and let N, N' be
the feet of the perpendiculars from R and S' on PQ, T'U'

   One further oint should be noticed : if a be very nearly
equal to B sin 0 +1 sin 0 the fringes become too broad to be
observed, whatever the source may be.
                               Fig. 6.
           11' 6"
    To see the physical meaning of this condition, and also of
 the condition Boos 9’ =a cos 0, we notice that a point source
 of light P at the centre of one of the slits appears after re
 <U+FB02>exion at the two mirrors a, b, to be atp, where Pp ise ual to
 twice the distance between the mirrors and is perpen icular
 to their plane (<U+FB01>g. 5). Hence the double re<U+FB01>exion removes the
 image of the slit a distance 2a cos 9 behind the diaphragm and
 2a. sin 6 closer to the centre. In the same way the image of
 the other slit is brought 28 cos 0' behind the diaphragm and
 2B sin 9' nearer the centre.
    Our condition )3 cos 6'=a cos 0 therefore means that the
 images of the two slits must be in the same plane parallel to
 the plane of the diaphragm itself, and our second condition
 shows that they must be some distance apart.
    To <U+FB01>nd the minimum of this distance, remember that the
 fringes will be invisible if the distance between successive
 maxima exceeds the vertical dimension of the visible rect
 angle : in other words, if
                 bX/2(a— (B sin 6’ + a sin 0)) > bX/k,
                    or distance in question <lc,
 which means that the centre of the image of either slit must

      452      Mr. L. N. G. Filon on certain Difractz'on Fn'nges
      be outside the other. These two points must be carefully
      borne in mind in adjusting the instruments.
         When this, however, is done, we see that Michelson’s                   \v-_,
      assertions are con<U+FB01>rmed, and that when we increase the
      aperture of the telescope in this way, the results obtained are
      of the same character as when the slits are placed directly in
      front of the object-glass.
         5. Let us now proceed to consider an extended source,
      which we shall suppose for simplicity to be of uniform
      intensity.

                    compared with 7t/h.
            (b) When the angular dimensions of the source are small

            (c) When the angular dimensions of the source are
                    neither large nor small compared with A/h.
         Let us begin with case (a). Then, if we consider a point
      inside the geometrical image, the two limits for u will be very
      large, except where the vertical through the point cuts the
      image ; the quantity

   This form agrees exactly with the formula given by
Mr. Michelson for a uniformly illuminated segment of a
straight line perpendicular to the slits. We see, however,
that, provided the conditions stated be ful<U+FB01>lled, it is applicable
to a source of any shape.                   -
    The most general form of the fringes is given by
                       q—l- 5(111 + v,)=const.,
and therefore consists of lines parallel to the locus of middle
points of chords at right angles to- the slits.       These will be
straight lines in the case of a rectangular, circular, or elli tic
source. Here, however, a new dif<U+FB01>culty presents itself. - or
the rectangular source til—r, will be constant, whatever chord
perpendicular to the slits we may select. Fringes will there
fore appear and disappear as a whole.                                   -
    But for a circular or elliptic source, 121—2), varies as we
pass from chord to chord. Thus the maxima will be invisible
 for some chords when they are most visible for others and
 conversely. Hence, whatever he the distance between the
 slits, it appears at <U+FB01>rst as if we might always expect a mottled
 appearance.
    But in the case of a circular or elliptic source the length of
 the chord varies extremely slowly near the centre and there
 fringes will be visible, the length of the chord being practic
ally constant. The mottled appearance, on the other hand,
will predominate as we approach the sides.                 -    Q -

 any circular source. We see that it onlv holds provided
 The dimensions of the source do not exceed a certain

 altered by any sliding of the image parallel to the direction

 one having its princi al axis parallel and perpendicular to the

    In either of these cases, if we rotate the slits about the axis
of the telescope, without altering a, then if the source is
elliptic, p and w will vary, and the visibility of the fringes
will vary.
    Now suppose for a given position of the slits we vary a
until the visibility=0 for that position, and then rotate the
slits and note the di<U+FB01>brent inclinations for which it vanishes.
    It will certainly vanish once again before a complete halt
turn has been made, namely, when the slits make an angle
 with the direction of either axis of the ellipse equal to that
 which they made at <U+FB01>rst, but on the other side of the axis.
    It may vanish more than once, but since the inclinations
 for which it vanishes are symmetrical with regard to the
 axes of the ellipse, there will usually be no dif<U+FB01>culty in deter
 mining the directions of the axes.
    Their lengths can then be determined by two observations
 of the disappearance of the fringes, one for each of the two
 positions of the slits which are perpendicular to an axis.
    It must, however, be noticed that the accuracy of this
 method for measuring ellipticity decreases with the size of
 the source, inasmuch as the quantity which causes the altera
tion in the fringes is the di<U+FB01>rence, not the ratio of the semi
axes.
    To get some idea of the sensitiveness of the method, let us
estimate roughly the amount of ellipticity which could be
detected in a disk of angular semi-diameter 10", taking the
mean wave-length of light '5 X 10“4 cms.

   (1) It is possible by the observation of Michelson’s interfer
ence-fringes to separate a double point-source, or detect
breadth and ellipticity in a slightly extended source.
   (2) But the distance between the two points, or the dimen
sions of the extended source, must lie within certain limits
depending on the length and breadth of the slits *.
   (3) The dimensions of the slits also considerably affect the
general theory, the formulae obtained not being identical with
Michelson’s. The law of appearance and disappearance of
the fringes depends very largely on the distance between
the points or the dimensions of the extended source.
XLII. The Absorption of Water in [fat Glass. Second Paper.
                            By CARL BARUS 1-.
1. AFTER <U+FB01>nishing my accounti of the action of hot
            water on glass, observed in <U+FB01>ne-bore capillary
tubes, it seemed to me that the experiments made several
years ago (1891) left questions of considerable interest out
standing. I refer in particular to a further examination of
the contents of the capillary tubes. Certain evidence was to
 be obtained as to the occurrence of syrupy glass at 185°,
solidifying to a <U+FB01>rm glass when cold, the composition
 remaining unchanged except as to the water absorbed.
 Again, as it was improbable that volume-contraction would
 continue at the same rate inde<U+FB01>nitely, the conditions of sub
 sidence were to be determined, together with the effect of the
 elastic and viscous constants of the tube itself on the apparent
 volume contractions and compressibilities observed. Ques
 tions relative to the acceleration of the reaction at higher
 temperatures were to be held in view.
    Finally, if the inferences drawn from data for capillary
 tubes are correct, it should be possible to obtain the fusible
 glass on a larger scale. Experiments in progress in this
 direction have proved quite successful, and will be described
 in a later paper. The present remarks are restricted to the
 experiences with capillary tubes.
     2. The apparatus used was the same as that heretofore
   ** Since the above was read, a. paper has appeared in the Comptes
 Rendus de l’Académie des Sciences for Nov. 28, 1898, dealing with the
 modi<U+FB01>cations in Michelson’s formulae when we take into account the
 breadth of the slits. The author, M. Hamy, follows Michelson in not
 considering variations of intensity parallel to the slits. This, I think,
 accounts for his results not quite agreeing with mine.

462            Dr. Carl Barus on the Absmption of
described (I. 0.), a clear thread of water being enclosed in a
stout capillary tube between terminal threads of mercury, the
upper of which was sealed in place, while the lower trans
mitted the pressure of a force-pump. The motion of each
meniscus was observed in the lapse of time through a clear
boiling tube (vapour-bath, 185 to 210°) with the catheto
meter.
   The progress of the experiments may be described, as a
wholc, as follows :—During the <U+FB01>rst surges of heating the
clear thread of water expands, inasmuch as the constant
temperature in question is being approached.      After this an
initially rapid contraction of the thread is manifest, which
must have begun much before the period of constant tem
perature was reached, so that the full thread-length for 210"
is never quite attained. During the early and most marked
period* of contraction (and some time before) the tube
appears white and opaque, and the observer can only with
dif<U+FB01>culty follow the rise of the lower mercury meniscus. The
top meniscus remains in place. Compressibility is a rapidly
increasing quantity. During the later stagesT of heating
the tube becomes transparent again, the mercury-threads
stand out brilliantly, and the whitish opaque matter gradually
vanishes in the axis of the tube. Contraction becomes less
marked and <U+FB01>nally ceases ; and with it the accentuated com
pressibility of the aqueous silicate, now so thickly viscid as to
retain cavities, also disappears. During this second stage,
threads of mercury invariably break off if there is change of
pressure. Nevertheless, measurement by means of these
indices is not impossible, and in the telescope the observer
notices a slow advance of the viscous mass, moving as a whole
continually towards the upper end of the tube and carrying
the little mercury globules along like debris in a common
current.
   To measure compressibility at this stage is to face a
dilemma : on increasing pressure from below, there is marked
increase in the upward motion of the viscous current. It is
dif<U+FB01>cult to state when this accentuated motion ceases. On
removing pressure the mercury does not retreat proportion
ately, if at all. However, when pressure is reduced too far,
the mercury may retreat several centimetres, quite out of the
<U+FB01>eld of view, as a whole, leaving well rounded or ovoid
cavities behind.    Thus it is impossible to make measurements

for compressibility in triplets, and the data are given below
with this reservation. These data accentuate the absence of
effective volume elasticity under the conditions stated.
   When the viscous thread has appreciably ceased to contract
(1—2 hours), and the tube is allowed to cool very carefully,
bubbles make their appearance very much resembling those
in a Prince Rupert drop, and probably due to a similar
cause *. They begin to form in the axis, and are usually
connected by a <U+FB01>ne channel. They may grow to a. diameter
of over g the width of the bore. The formation of these
bubbles on cooling is proof that the aqueous silicate is still
liquid at the temperature of the vapour-bath (1850—210°),
however viscous and incompressible it may have become.
The solidifying core of water-glass contracts from the centre
outward, and must contract more rapidly than the igneous
glass envelope.     It is this last stage (contents cleared again
to a pellucid jelly) which I failed to fully observe in my
earlier experiments, believing that solidi<U+FB01>cation had set in
when the mercury-threads broke off.
   After the tube has passed the <U+FB01>nal stage with subsidence of
contraction, it invariably breaks throughout its length when
cold, in such a way as at <U+FB01>rst sight to suggest expansion on
solidi<U+FB01>cation of the aqueous silicate within. It makes no
difference how carefully the cooling is performed. If a thread
of fusible metal is allowed to solidify in a capillary tube, the
latter breaks sooner or later in the same way.         I do not by
any means imply that the aqueous silicate does actually
expand on solidifying, for there are other and better ways in
which the breakage can be explained. The appearance of
bubbles, for instance, is evidence of contraction, and the
breakage is rather due to an excessively shrinking core.
   When the cold tube is cut across, the core of water-glass
practically <U+FB01>lls the tube, and to all appearances is as hard,
clear, and <U+FB01>rm as the igneous glass surrounding it. There is
a difference of refraction between the two glasses suf<U+FB01>cient to
make the aqueous core apparent under favourable illumination;
but for this and the bubbles, the tube would be undistin
guishable from a glass rod.
   If, however, the end of the glass tube is slightly heated
above a candle-<U+FB02>ame or a small bunsen-fiame, the core soon
begins to melt, to swell up enormously in bulk as the result
of the frothing which accompanies the escape of steam. The
  * It is to be remembered, however, that whereas the Rupert drop is
cooled down from above 1000° 0., the present high temperature is only
about 200°.

     There is good reason to suppose that the aqueous silicate
  remains homogeneous from the time of incipient solution to
  the eventual occurrence of a viscous glassy coagulate, liquid
  enough at 200° to admit of the formation of internal bubbles
  on cooling and contraction, but at the same time viscous
  enough to keep similar bubbles in shape and position without
  cooling.   A thin thread of water ('01. to '04 centim. in diam.)
  is undergoing lateral diffusion into the glass, and concentra
  tion difference is virtually con<U+FB01>ned to the cylindrical surface
  of contact between igneous glass and water-glass, widening
  as the action goes on so slowly, that the much more liquid
  water-glass is free to remain homogeneous. The latter
  should therefore be identical in composition with the original
  glass, but for the incorporated water.
      In a <U+FB01>nal experiment (tube N0. 7) I put a solution of
  cobalt nitrate into the tube, rather with the expectation of
  <U+FB01>nding blue water-glass as the result.         No such action
   occurred; instead of it, the water diffused into the glass as
   usual and the cobaltic nitrate was left as a granular scum in
   the axis. Chemical decomposition and incorporation of the
  cobalt did not therefore occur at 200°.
'     3. Instead of tabulating the large number of observations
  made (in all seven tubes were employed), it will conduce to
  clearness to present the work graphically. In so doing, the
  data for the former tubes may be included, for reference.
   Time is laid off in intervals of 20 minutes (between vertical
   lines) along the abscissas, while the ordinates indicate the
   changes of length of the column of water in intervals of
   l centim. It is not convenient to specify the full length of
   the thread in the chart ; but a datum for the length of the
   cold thread at about 20°C. will be given both in the latter and
   in the tables containing original and <U+FB01>nal bore, and similar
   speci<U+FB01>cations for each capillary tube. These diameters were
   measured with the cathetometer, the tubes being cut across
   and looked at endwise. Slight heating increased the sharp
   ness of de<U+FB01>nition between the original glass and the solid
   core of water-glass within.
      The chart also contains the mean compressibilities ,8, for
   pressure intervals of about 100 atm., no attempt to obtain ,8
   as a function of pressure being made for the reasons stated in
    §2. Since ,8=(v/V)/p, or the decrement of volume per
   unit of volume per atmosphere, or practically decrement of
   length per centim. of column per atmosphere, the abscissas as
   above are successive time-intervals of 10 minutes each, while
   the scale of ordinates is a change of B of '000100. Several

 B-values are usually attached to the compressibility-curves for

    In these cases the tem erature of the vapour-bath was but
 185°, and the corrosion di not outrun the opaque stage. Seen
under the microscope, the solid water-glass nearly <U+FB01>lled the
 here, being an opalescent warty accretion. The chart (p. 470)
 contains the results for decrement of length of thread and of
 compressibility so far as observed, after constant temperature
 had set in. In all these experiments [3 is thoroughly deter
mined* from at least four measurements between 20 and
400 atm., the initial lengths of thread returning on removal
of ressure.
    lh case of No. 1, time was not observed until after nearly
an hour’s boiling. The short curves thus refer to the end of
the experiments. The general conclusions are stated in the
preceding paper.
   4. The <U+FB01>rst of the new tubes to be heated was No. 3, with
the following constants :—

   The observations with this tube were not satisfactory;
possibly the temperature of the vapour-bath was insuf<U+FB01>ciently
constant ; possibly the clear stage of reaction is not reached
at 185° (cf. §12).               The tube turned opaque and so remained.
The fouled meniscus was frequently lost, or could not be

recognized with certainty. No observations were possible
until after 30 minutes’ boiling.
   In the absence of systematic data, however, certain inci
dental results of interest were obtained with this tube, by
observing at high and low temperatures alternately.                  Thus,
after about an hour’s boiling, B fell off from 120/106 at 185°
to about 40/106 at ordinary temperatures. After about
21} hours’ boiling, B fell 05' from about 230/106 at 185° to
90/106 at ordinary temperatures. After about four hours’
boiling the hot compressibilities reached 400/106; but the
tube broke before the corresponding cold compressibilities
were measured.
   Opportunity was also afforded for roughly measuring the
coef<U+FB01>cients of expansion of water-glass. After two and a
half hours’ boiling the mean coef<U+FB01>cient per degree was
about '002, between 25° and 185° C. The corresponding
mean coef<U+FB01>cient for pure water, according to Mendeléef *, is
 “0008 to '0009.
   Thus it appears that even the relative contraction of water
glass is over twice as large as the normal value for water
under like conditions. After four hours’ boiling another
measurement of the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion of water-glass
gave nearly the same result as before.              This coef<U+FB01>cient did
not, therefore, keep pace with the increase of B ; but, as only
a small part of the thermal contraction on cooling lies in the
region of high temperature to which B refers, the two
coe<U+FB01>icients should not keep pace.
   Finally, a comparison between B and volume-contraction
in the lapse of time sh0wed a change of B of about 18/106
for each per cent. of volume-contraction relative to the cold
volume at 20° C. This mean rate is more rapid than the
rate observed for tubes 1 and 2, or the following tubes.
   5. The next tube examined was No. 4, with the following
constants :—

468             Dr. Carl Barus on the Absorption of
water on glass to an actual period of subsidence, should this
be possible. The aqueous silicate obtained was a clear hard
core, plainly demarcated from the igneous glass envelope by
difference of refraction, but otherwise not readily distin
guishable from it. The bubbles contained no water. They
were probably partial vacua with traces of steam. A <U+FB01>ne
axial canal, less than {0 millim. in diameter, ran apparently
through the water-glass core, threading the bubbles.                 The
column of water shortened at 210° to its original length in
the cold tube, after about 20 minutes of exposure. The
transparent stage was reached in this tube earlier than usual,
even at 210°. Indeed, the solvent action was energetic
throughout, as is evidenced by the rapid volume-contraction.
The chart gives the successive values of volume and compres
sibility (,8) in the lapse of time. The quantity [3 is an
estimate, since observations in triplets could not be obtained,
increase of pressure corresponding to an increment in the
continued volume-contraction.
   Boiling began at 2h 40m, and constant temperature* was
reached at 211 55m. Pronounced volume—contraction had set
in before this. The lower meniscus was lost as such before
2h 60‘“. On increasing pressure the column ascended in form
of a succession of ovoid drops with constrictions between
them, the mercury diameters being smaller than the bore.
Removal of pressure frequently separated these drops alto
gether, the viscous glass <U+FB02>owing in between them. Indeed
the mercury often retreated in such a way as to leave the cavity
half empty. In <U+FB01>gure 2 (p. 464) I have drawn an interesting
case observed at 3" 3111. The mercury <U+FB01>lls only the top half
of the cavity left on reducing pressure. Very soon after the
metal was seen falling to the bottom in a rain of very small
drops. Since the diameter of the cavity did not exceed g
millim., the extreme <U+FB01>neness of these drops is remarkable even
at 210°. ()n slightly increasing pressure again everything
was seen to move upwards in a regular current, meniscus
 (below), detached mercury drops and threads, and the cavities.
At 3“ 20‘“, the mercury still showed increased advance on
raising the pressure to about 100 atm. ; but on withdrawing
pressure the mercury did not retreat. I measured the large
compressibility ,8='OOO440 for these conditions. Even at
3“ 30m cavities half<U+FB01>lled with mercury were much in evidence.
At 3h 50m the column of aqueous silicate was nearly clear and
 continuous, and the compressibility now measured was found
enormously reduced, perhaps less than the normal compres

 sibility of water at 210°. After this, the action of water on
 the glass seems to have ceased, no further contraction
 occurred even up to 4" 40'“, when the tube burst at 100 atm.
    The chief result obtained from this tube is therefore the
 certain evidence of an eventual subsidence of the reaction of
 the water on the glass under given circumstances. The
 rapidity of reaction, the occurrence of<U+FB02>oating cavities partly
 full of mercury, partly of steam (?), the gradual reabsorption
 of this steam (P) by the glass on increasing pressure, are to be
 noted.    During the continued volume-contraction compres
 sibility B increased rapidly at <U+FB01>rst, reaching a maximum, and
 then fell o<U+FB02>' rapidly to the probable normal value for water at
 210°, with the subsidence of further volume-contraction.
    From my recent experiments on the compressibility of
coagulated colloids *, I infer that the water-glass has now
reached a similar stage. A convex meniscus forced upward
 by pressure changes to a conoid with apex sharpened upward.
Removing pressure restores the convex form.              Hence the
column now possesses de<U+FB01>nite rigidity, and its viscosity
 requires long intervals of time to be put in evidence. Sharp
axial lines, ‘05 millim. in diameter, true canals, together with
bubbles strung on them like beads, were left after cooling.
 The axial lines are present at 210°, and then appear as the last
 vestige of the opaque or granular stage which precedes the
 clear stage. If there is really something granular about the
 former, and if the contraction of volume is a cementation of
 these granules into a homogeneous clear column of aqueous
 colloidal silicate, then the large <U+FB01>nal compressibilities are in
 a measure accounted for ; but the compressibilities for tubes
 1 and 2 are real in so far as all observations were made in
 triplets, and the <U+FB01>ducial zero was regained after high pressures
 (400 atm.). The granular hypothesis is thus quite inad
missible even if the interstices between the granules were
supposed to contain non-saturated steam; for pressures in
creasing to above 400 atm. would soon wipe out the maxi
mum vapour-tensions of 11—12 atm. at 185°, and less than
20 atm. at 210°.
   At the close of the experiment the diameter of the mercury
thread seemed to be somewhat over one half that of the core
of aqueous silicate.     Since the bore increased from '24 to
'71 millim., the mercury thread did not thicken much on
moving up.

   The <U+FB01>nal datum marks the subsidence of the whole phe
nomenon, the B being nearly the normal datum for water
 (the usual case of colloids, which retain the compressibility
 of the solvent), and further volume decrement vanishing.
 During contraction the mean rate of B change is 80 X 10"6 per
linear cm. of contraction. Since the initial cold length was
 15'5 cm., this amounts to about 12 X 10'6 for each per cent.
 of volume decrease relative to the cold volume. This result
 agrees fairly well with the data for tubes 1 and 2.

main a corroboration of the results for tube No. 4. The bore

   The chart shows the march of volume and of compressibility
in the lapse of time. As a whole the reaction is slower than
in § 5 ; the thread is shortened by contraction at 210° to its
length for the cold tube in about 40 minutes, twice as long an
interval as before.                                        . ..
   Boiling began at 10h 25m, and constant temperature was
reached about 15 minutes later. The observations as a whole
are the same as in the preceding case. At 111] l5In the silicate
failed to retreat with the advanced mercury column on
removing pressure. A peculiar result was observed, as the
mercury here ran down several centims., leaving the water
glass full of oval cavities, and afterwards ascended of its own
accord to <U+FB01>ll them again without manual interference at the
force-pump.
   I presume that pressure was reduced below the vapour
pressure of the water absorbed in glass ; that the temperature
of the oil in the force-pump was thermodynamically reduced
by expansion of the oil ; that the latter gradually regained its
temperature, 0, by conduction, increasing the pressure in the
hermetically sealed barrel. Since d9/dp=av9/Jcp, a liquid of
low speci<U+FB01>c heat 0p, low density l/v, and large thermal expan
sion at, contributes to this result.

472           Dr. Carl Barus on the Absorption of
   The continuous, very slow contraction current toward the
top of the tube was a marked feature. At 12h 20m pressure
increment merely produced marked acceleration in the
velocity of this current, removal of pressure leaving the
mercury in place. On reducing pressure below a certain
value, however, the mercury retreated quite out of the cavities,
as above, to re<U+FB01>ll them again in the lapse of time. Figure 3
 (p. 464) gives a view of a partially emptied cavity of this kind.
In <U+FB01>gure 4 a globular empty cavity formed during this process
is shown, which was made to vanish symmetrically to a point
over an advancing mercury meniscus.
    The absorption of water in tube 5 virtually subsided after
about two hours of boiling. In the <U+FB01>ne-bore tube, § 5, like
subsidence set in after but one hour of reaction. Differences
of chemical composition are not excluded.
    On cooling, bubbles appeared in homogeneous parts of the
thread, throughout its length, spontaneously, and expanded
often to over half the diameter of the core of water-glass.
Moreover, ovoid cavities <U+FB01>lled with mercury when hot are
 found partially empty after cooling, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 5,
 due to the contraction outward of the walls. The <U+FB01>nal
breakage of this tube was con<U+FB01>ned to the core, which split
 across axially, allowing the mercury to enter as a thin sheet
 without breaking the envelope of igneous glass.
    The relations of ,8 and (v/V) for this tube may be stated
from the following interpolation :—
Thread-length (cm) at 210° .,         158 15-4 14-8 14'2 13'6  12'8

Compressibility increases at an accelerated rate with con
traction. Leaving out the <U+FB01>nal very large values, the mean
rate is 93 x 10'6 per centim. of contraction. As the cold
 length of thread is about 14 centim., this is a change of B of
 about 13 x 10‘6 for each per cent. of volume-contraction
 referred to the cold volume. The result is thus again of the
 same order as the data from tubes 1, 2, and 5.
   ,1. The tube No. 6 was observed specially for volume-con
traction, its large bore not being adapted for [<U+FB01>t-measurements.
 The tube when cooled down after corrosion showed a <U+FB01>ne,
 empty, axial canal, about '0063 centim. in diameter, left in the
 core of aqueous silicate and forming a channel of communica
 tion between fourteen large axial bubbles, distributed with fair
 uniformity along the length of the core. The constants of
 the tube were (vapour-bath at 210°)

     The march of volume-contraction is given in the chart.
 Boiling began at 9h 50m and the temperature was constant
 5‘“ or 10m later ; but contraction must have setin long before
 this. At 10h 15'“ the thread appeared indistinct and broken,
 marking the opaque period.                  At 10h 30‘“, though the water
 glass was still granular, the mercury column, now about two
 thirds the diameter of the hydrated core, became clearly
 manifest. At 10h 55’” it stood outbrilliantly; the granulations
 had retreated toward the axis, where they shone on illumina
 tion like awhite cloud. In <U+FB01>g. 13 a group of mercury threads
 is given specially measured as to their distance apart. They
 moved bodily across the crosshairs of the telescope, keeping
 their position relatively to each other.                 This seems to be
 positive proof that the whole internal column is moving
 upward in consequence of contraction and is followed by
 the mercury meniscus moving in the direction of constant
 pressure. In so viscous a mass, a current up in the middle
and down at the sides of the bore of about it millim. is out of
 the question.
    The deformation of the top of the column of water-glass in
 this experiment was striking, and is given in successive stages
in <U+FB01>gs. 6 to 12, showing its relation to the <U+FB01>xed (upper)
mercury meniscus. In <U+FB01>g. 6 the water-glass is opaque and
granular; in <U+FB01>g. 7 the granular column is shrinking; in
<U+FB01>g. 8 granulations have vanished except in the axis. In
<U+FB01>g. 9 the clear water-glass at a shows a steam (?) cavity at b,
above the residual water (?) at c. This deformation may be
regarded as an axial opening of the core due to contraction
outward. Figures 10 and 11 show successive gradual changes
of form of b, a in <U+FB01>g. 9, suggesting an upward march of
pressure. Fig. 12 <U+FB01>nally shows the gradual deformation of
<U+FB01>g. 11, as the result of cooling ; but the mercury did not fall
down into the channel of <U+FB01>g. 12, which here terminates in
the upper meniscus. The expansion of the bubble bis the
marked feature. Cooled with great caution, the tube never
theless broke spontaneously; parts of it after twelve hours,
other parts even after months. N0 liquid water was detected in
the cold tube, and the mercury ran freely through the channel
in <U+FB01>g. 12.         The large rate of reaction is an anomalous feature
in view of the large diameter. Cf. curves 4, 5, 6 of chart.

474               Dr. Carl Barus on the Absorption of
nitrate, has already been mentioned. The water-glass was not
coloured blue, but the salt rejected as a scum in the axis of
the tube. Hence the solution appears to be colloidal. In
other respects the preceding phenomena were all reproduced,
all incisions of the mercury column indicating a current
upward in the direction of pressure. Compressibilities were
obtained as high as B=400 x 10"“.

 where 8B is the mean change of compressibility corresponding
 to the change of length 8L, and where L0 is the length of the
 thread when cold (used throughout for want of an available
 datum at the high temperatures). In view of the dif<U+FB01>culty '
 of measuring ,8, and of the later stage of reaction for which
 Nos. 3, 4, 5 apply, the results may be looked upon as of the
 same order and as a corroboration of Nos. 1 and 2.
    Since the values B are apparent compressibilities, the
 association of values of B and volume-contraction may well
 be looked upon with suspicion: for as the capillary tube
 during the progress of the reaction increases continually in
 bore, or in other words is growing less thick-walled, it must
 at a given pressure yield more and more, and at the same
time show continually increasing apparent compressibilities
 of the contents. A plausible explanation of the correlative
 variation of B and v/V is thus suggested. That it does not
hold may be shown as follows:-—~
    To treat the elastic problem <U+FB01>rst, Tait’s equation* for the
volume increment of hollow cylinders per unit of volume is
available for computation.          The true compressibility B0 thus
appears as

where p is the internal pressure, (10 and al the internal and
external radius of the tubes, k the bulk-modulus, and n the
rigidity of the glass.       Thus it suf<U+FB01>ces to <U+FB01>nd the correction
8B for the original and the corroded tube in order to estimate
the value of the elastic discrepancy in question.            The follow

     Thus the mean effect of the enlargement of bore, due to
internal corrosion, is at ordinary temperatures but '000 0001
in the extreme case, or only a few tenths per cent. of the
 value of ,8 for cold water. As an explanation of the changes
 of B obtained, which run as high as 600 per cent., the elastic
 discrepancy is thus out of the question *.
     The effect on the volume-contraction, being 813.71, would
be in like degree negligible.
     Finally, according to Amagat‘l' the increase of compressi
bility of ordinary glass between 0° and 200° C. is about
 5'9 per cent. Hence even at 200° the elastic discrepancy
will be in almost the same degree negligible as at ordinary
temperatures.
    In experiments like the above, tubes which initially with
stood 400 or 500 atmospheres, after prolonged straining will
break even at 100 atm. or less. This result is rather to be
ascribed to the fatigue of elasticity or to molecular strains
imparted during cooling ; for it is not unusual when corrosion
is altogether absent.
     9. The next pomt at issue relates to the viscosity of glass
at 200°. In a tube subject to viscous deformation the current
towards the top may be regarded as the result of viscous
stretching due to internal pressure.                 Increased ,8 then
represents the initially increased viscous yield accompanying
the increased stress, the yield vanishing asymptotically in
the lapse of time.
    Reasons against this assumption are again of a quantitative
kind.      When the elastic deformations are not of serious
consequence, the viscous changes are apt to be less so.
Moreover viscous phenomena would not vanish in one hour
as fully as the curves for tubes 4, 5, and 6 indicate. Finally,
in a very large number of experiments in which hydrocarbons

Add to this the appearance of the tube; 2'. e., the passage
from an opaque corroded interior gradually to a homo
genous limpid jelly at the conclusion of the experiment, In
parallel with the observed volume changes subsiding in aclear
tube, and with the march of compressibility through
enormously accentuated values, terminating in the relatively
small values for hot water.      Finall , after volume-contraction
ceases (saturation) there is no furt er viscous response to any
pressure excess whatever.
    Viscosity is therefore not available to account for the volume
contraction observed. To make quite sure a special experi
ment was made with a thread of paraf<U+FB01>n, 18'19 centim. lon ,
at 210° and about 100 atm. After more than an hours
heating (observvd 65 min.) the thread had gradually increased
in length to 1825 centim., due no doubt to the gradually
rising temperature of the vapour-bath. The data given on
the chart (curve marked paraf<U+FB01>n) show that there is no
relation between the present experiments and the behaviour
of water.
    10. I therefore regard it as established that the observed
volume-contractions are real. The endeavour may now be
 made to compute limits for the density of the water-glass.
 Two ways suggest themselves : (1) By comparing the initial
 volume of igneous glass and water with the <U+FB01>nal volume of
 water-glass within the same bore (limit of corrosion) ; (2) By
 making allowance for the advance of the thread of mercury
 into the column of water-glass.      I made these computations
 for all the tubes; but as the reactions in Nos. 1, 2, 3 are
 incomplete, Nos. 4, 5, 6 only need be given. The <U+FB01>rst method
 in these cases gave 3'4, 3'0, 3'5 respectively as the density
 of solid water-glass. This is obviously a superior limit seeing
 that the thread does not contract as a whole. The density
 of the igneous glass is but 246. The second method gave
 me 240, 2'25, and 235 respectively as the densities of the
  water-glass in the three cases. These data present an inferior
 limit (since the thread of mercury widens in advancing
  through viscous glass and since the full length of contraction
  cannot be observed), just as the preceding data are a superior
  limit. HenCe the density of water-glass cannot differ very
  much from the density of igneous glass (2'46). Though the
  two sets of data differ widely, one may estimate the volume
  contraction from their mean value to be about 20 per cent.
  of the combined volume of igneous glass and water, for com
  plete subsidence of the reaction.

                         Water in Hot Glass.                   477
    I may here refer to the apparent expansion on solidi<U+FB01>ca
tion, and the eventual breakage of tubes spontaneously. In a
general way, this means an effectively different coef<U+FB01>cient
of expansion for the igneous glass without, from that for the
water-glass within. Such a result could be brought about,
for instance, if latent heat is set free by the water-glass on
solidi<U+FB01>cation : for the water-glass is nearly incompressible
when solid, and the case would therefore be far different
from the solidi<U+FB01>cation of such relatively compressible bodies
as paraf<U+FB01>n in capillary tubes.
    The characteristic formation of bubbles is evidence against
expansion on solidi<U+FB01>cation. Indeed I am not sure whether
even an excessive contraction of the core may not start an
internal crack in the water-glass which thereafter spreads into
the igneous glass. Cracked water-glass cores with a sound
envelope ofigneous glass were a frequent occurrence. Finally,
 the congealed water-glass in the cold may tend to resume its
 volume before the volume-contraction was impressed by
 spontaneous decomposition. The de<U+FB01>nite decision can be
 made only when water-glass has been obtained on a larger
 scale.
     12. Tubes 4, 5, 6 show conclusively that the action of
 water on glass ceases after the solution has reached a certain
 degree of concentration ; compared with tubes 1, 2, 3, they
 show that the rate of reaction increases in marked degree with
 rise of temperature. These observations are in favour of the
 occurrence of a de<U+FB01>nite limit of saturation* or even of a
 de<U+FB01>nite chemical compound. Reaction, caet.par., ceases with
 its formation. The marked contraction of bulk as the reaction
 proceeds may be adduced in favour of the chemical view, since
 in colloidal solution the volume phenomena are usually
 secondary.
     It is to be noted that, apart from saturation, a gradual
 subsidence of the rate of reaction would be the result of
  ordinary colloidal solution, if the concentration gradient at
 the surface of contact of the water-glass core within and the
  igneous glass envelope without decreases as more glass enters
  into solution. The retention of the original composition of
  the glass wit-h water added, the bodily rejection of colouring
  material like cobaltic oxide, is further to the point. In how
  far increased compressibility may be expected in a liquid
  undergoing colloidal solution I cannot say, even when such
  solution is accompanied by decreasing volume; but as the
  phenomenon of solution terminates with a datum very near
    5‘ Observing that saturation also occurs in colloids below their
  melting-point in excess of solvent.

478           Dr. Carl Barns on the Absorption of
to the normal compressibilty of water at 200° (so far as
known), I am led on the whole to favour a colloidal hypo
 thesis. In an extensive study of the solution of vulcanized
 indiarubber " in a variety of solvents, the fusion temperature
of the saturated coagulated colloid under pressure to a clear
 solution seemed to be nearly independent of the solvent used.
 Below this temperature there is saturation and swelling, but
 no solution. One may therefore regard the opaque stage of
the reaction of water on glass as the swelling of a coagulated
colloid in presence of its solvent, while the melting-point of
the coagulated colloidal glass (as evidenced by the second
stage of reaction) would lie below 210°, and probably above
 150° C. Another question thus thrusts itself forward :
whether the property of swelling is retained by colloids at
relatively very low temperatures, seeing that glass at ordinary
temperatures does not swell in the presence of water. Finally,
the viscosity or stiffness of the fused colloid, and its readiness
to coagulate, increases as the amount of solvent per unit
of volume decreases.
    l3. Summarizing the above results, it is best to avoid
direct reference to the character of solution, whether colloidal
or chemical. An explanation may then be given in terms of
the compressibility observed along successive isotherms for
the different concentrations of glass solutions at 210°. This
at <U+FB01>rst shows a relatively small value, implying a steep
isotherm in a Olapeyron (pv) diagram. Thereafter com
pressibility passes through a relatively enormous value (over
<U+FB01>ve times the initial result), implying a nearly horizontal
isotherm. The reaction ends with even smaller isothermal
compressibility than the <U+FB01>rst observed, implying steeper
isotherms than the initial curves.            Now, although these
isotherms are all at the same absolute temperature, the water
glass is becoming continually more concentrated. Hence
the corresponding temperatures of the isotherms in van der
\Vaals’ sense are continually decreasing. - It follows that the
reaction considered as a thermodynamic process is a march
through the critical region of certain phases of the water-glass
examined. '
    In the light given by J. W. Gibbs’s investigations, one
may arrive at clear notions by adopting but two phases of
the water-glass for comparison.         Many phases may coexist :
two are selected in the interest of brevity, and called phase
1 and 2 respectively. During the earlier stages of the re
action (dilute water-glass) phase 1 is stable. At the end of
                * Am. Journal, t'3) xlii. P.359 1891 .

                             Water in Hot Glass.                         479
  the reaction (concentrated water-glass, subsidence of volume
  contraction) phase 2 is stable. Both cases correspond to
  steep isotherms. Toward the middle region of the reaction
  (maxima of compressibility) phases 1 and 2 are mutually
  stable in presence of each other. Hence the horizontal iso
  therms corresponding to the critical region are out through
  in a march from greater to smaller corresponding tempe
  ratures.
     That phase 2 is really unstable during the <U+FB01>rst stage of
  reaction is shown by the approximate constancy of the Values
  of compressibility throughout intervals of pressure as high as
  could be applied.        For instance at 185° :
  Pressure interval...    20 to 100,  100 to 200,  200 to 300, 300 to 400 atm.
     106 X B . . . . .. =    146          144         142         146,
  and <U+FB01>fteen minutes later,
     106 X B .... .. =        188         176         201         189.
     Again, during the intermediate stage water—glass is without
  volume elasticity; yielding remarkably to increase of pres
  sure, it refuses to expand when pressure is removed. The
  last stage is again elastic, but relatively incompressible.
     The extreme compressibility, B, of water-glass during the
  intermediate stage stated deserves special comment. Be
  ginning with igneous glass and water with compressibilities
   of (say) B=3x 10‘6 and lOOXIO-6 respectively at 210°,
  values of B are reached which exceed 500 X 10‘“. One may
  even compare this result with so volatile a body as ethylic
- ether * at different temperatures between 100 and 200 atm.,
  as follows :—
        Temp. of ether.......... ..  29°       65°       100°      185°
          B X 106 ....... ..         156       207       305        741.
     Yet the water-glass solidifies in the cold to a hard incom
  pressible colourless body, quite resembling igneous glass.

    §3. In §§ 5—26 Of his paper already referred to, Stokes
 gives a complete solution of the problem of <U+FB01>nding the dis
 placement and velocity at any point of an in<U+FB01>nite solid,
 which must follow from any arbitrarily given displacement
 and velocity at any previous time, if after that, the solid
 is left to itself with no force applied to any part of it. In a
 future communication I hope to apply this solution to the
 diffraction of solitary waves, plane or spherical. Meantime
 I con<U+FB01>ne myself to the subject stated in the title of the

482              Lord Kelvin on the Production of
present communication, regarding which Stokes gives some
important indications in         27—29 of his paper.
   § 4. Poisson in 1819 gave a complete solution of the
equation
                         dzw
                         W=vgv2w         ..                      (8)
in terms of arbitrary functions of .z', y, 2 representing the
                           dw
initial values of wand          ; and showed that for every case
                            iii
in which w depends only on distance (1') from a <U+FB01>xed point,
it takes the form
                  w=,1_{r(t-g) +f(¢+§)}. . . (9),
where F andfdenote arbitrary functions.          In my Baltimore
Lectures of 1884 I pointed out that solutions expressing
spherical waves, whether equivoluminal (in which there is
essentially different range of displacement in different parts
of the spherical surface) or irrotational (for which the displace
ment may or may not be different in different parts of the
spherical surface), can be very conveniently derived from (9)
by differentiations with respect to .z', y, 2. It may indeed be
proved, although I do not know that a formal proof has been
anywhere published, that an absolutely general solution of (8)
is expressed by the formula
    Efztlhitliftl’ltiFit-2W“391};
                 r= V[(w—w’)"+(y—y’)2+(z—z’)2l - (10).
where 2 denotes sums for different integral values of h, i, j,
and for any different values of w', y’, 5'.
   § 5. I propose at present to consider only the simplest of
all the cases in which motion at every point (at, 0, 0) and
(O, y, z) is parallel to X’ X ; and for all values of y and 2', f is
the same for equal positive and negative values of m. For
this purpose we of course take m’=y’=z'=0; and we shall
<U+FB01>nd that no values of h, i, greater than 2 can appear in our
expressions for E, 1], C, because we con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to the
simplest case ful<U+FB01>lling the speci<U+FB01>ed conditions. Our special
subject, under the title of this paper, excludes waves travelling
inwards from distant sources, and therefore annuls f(t+r/v).
   § 6. In §§ 5—8 of his paper, Stokes showed that any motion
whatever of a homogeneous elastic solid may, throughout
every part of it experiencing no applied force, be analysed

other, in one of which the displacement is equivolnminal, and
in the other it is irrotational. Hence if we denote by

   Thus we see that for very distant places, the motion in the
axis is approximately that due to the irrotational wave alone;
and the motion at the equatorial plane is that due to the
equivoluminal wave alone : also that with equal values of F1
and F2 the equivoluminal and the irrotational constituents
contribute to these displacements inversely as the squares of
the propagational velocities of the two waves. On the other
hand, for places very near the centre, (29) shows that
both in the axis and in the equatorial plane the irrotational
and the equivoluminal constituents contribute equally to the
displacements.
    § 11. Equations (25) and (26) give us full speci<U+FB01>cation of
the forcive which must be applied to the boundary of our
spherical hollow to cause the motion to be precisely through
all time that specified by (19), with F1 and F9 any arbitrary
 functions. Thus we may suppose F1 (t—q/u) and F2 (t—q/v)
to he each zero for all negative values of t, and to be zero
again for all values of t exceeding a certain limit 1'. At an
distance r from the centre, the disturbance will last during
the time

On the other hand, at every point of space outside the radius
q+1-/ (l/u— 1 /v) the wave of the greater propagational
velocity passes away outwards before the wave of the smaller
velocity reaches it, and the transit-time of each wave across
it is 'r. The solid is rigorously undisplaced and at rest
throughout all the spaces outside the more rapid wave,
between the two waves, and inside the less rapid of the two.

    § 15. The character of the motion throughout the solid,
 which is fully speci<U+FB01>ed by (19), will be perfectly understood
 after a careful study of the details for the equatorial, conal,
 and axial places, shown clearly by (37) . . . (43) for each
 constituent, the equivoluminal and the irrotational, separately.
 The curve 1% in the diagram of § 12 shows the history of the
 motion that must be given to any point of the surface S, for
 either constituent alone, and therefore for the two together,
 in any case in which q is exceedingly small in comparison
 with the smaller of the two quantities ur, in, which for
 brevity we shall call the wave-lengths.          The curve a shows
 the history of the motion produced by either wave when it is
 passing any point at a distance from the centre very great
 in comparison with its own wave-length.               But the three
 algebraic functions ‘9’, ,97, a all enter into the expression of
 the motion due to either Wave when the faster has advanced
 so far that its rear is clear of the front of the slower, but not so
 far as to make its wave-length (which is the constant thickness
 of the spherical shell containing it) great in comparison with
 its inner radius. Look at the diagram, and notice that in
 the origin at S, a mere motion of each point in one direction
 and back, represented by y, causes in very distant places, a
 motion (a) to a certain displacement d, back through the
 zero to a displacement 1'36 X d in the opposite direction,
 thence back through zero to d in the <U+FB01>rst direction and thence
 back to rest at zero. Remark that the direction of d is radial
 in the irrotational wave and perpendicular to the radius in the
 equivoluminal wave. Remark also that the d for every radial
 line varies inversely as distance from the centre.
    § 16. Draw any line 0 P K in any <U+FB01>xed direction through

r=q and r=q+u(t—'r), when t>'r: these interesting cha
racteristics of the solution of a somewhat intricate dynamical
problem, are secured by the particular character of the
originating forcive at S, which we <U+FB01>nd according to
§§ 8, 9 to be that which will produce them. But all these
characteristics are lost except the <U+FB01>rst (nullity of motion
through all space outside the spherical surface r=q+vt), if
we apply an arbitrary forcive to S ', or such a forcive as to
produce any arbitrary deformation or motion of S. Let for
example S be an ideal rigid spherical lining of our cavity;
and let any in<U+FB01>nitesimal arbitrary motion be given to it.
We need not at present consider in<U+FB01>nitesimal rotation of S :
the spherical waves which this would produce, particularly
simple in their character, were investigated in my Baltimore
Lectures, and described in recent communications to the
 British Association and Philosophical Magazine 1'.                    Neither
 need we consider curvilinear motion of the centre of S,
 because, the motion being in<U+FB01>nitesimal, independent super
 position of w-, y-, z-motions produces any curvilinear motion
whatever.

    GENTLEMEN,
DR. G. Joaxsroxn STONEY’s paper on this subject in
          your April number will, I think, somewhat startle
 practical men, whether geologists or engineers. If I rightly
 understand him, he concludes that to increase the radius of
the earth one has only to remove its surface-layers, and con
versely. The problem which Dr. Stoney considers on p. 373
is simply that of an elastic solid sphere of uniform bulk
modulus (resistance to compression) acted on by a uniform
surface pressure. If         he the pressure, a the radius, and
k the bulk-modulus, tiie surface displacement, as is well
known, is
                           u: -pa/3k ;
and if one puts
                           a: 64 X 107 centim.,
                           10:9,
                           k=423 X 106 ,
i. e., if one supposes a to he the earth’s radius, 9 ‘ gravity ’ at
its surface, p the pressure due to a layer 1 centim. deep of water,
and k the largest value quoted for the bulk-modulus of glass
in Lord Kelvin’s Encyclopwrlia article—one gets in agree
ment with Dr. Stoney
                     a: —0'5 centim. approx.
If, however, Dr. Stoney treats the earth as perfectly elastic
throughout for pressure introduced by the action of its
gravitation on fresh surface material, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to see how
he can avoid treating it as also perfectly elastic so far as con
cerns the gravitational forces between the already existing
material. It may be legitimate enough to hold that the deep
seated material has had its elasticity, so to speak, “killed”
under the enormous pressure to which it is exposed; but
this view does not appear consistent with treating this identical
material as responding like glass to a slight increment of
exactly the same type of pressure stress.       To see the nature
of the results to which we are led by the hypothesis that the
earth as a whole behaves like glass, let us glance for a moment
at the expression for the surface displacement due to the
mutual gravitation of a homogeneous elastic sphere, viz.,
                          u= —-gpa2/l5k,
when we ascribe to a and k the values quoted above, and put

simplicity; one can easily allow for variation in the density
with the radial distance, but this does not affect the order of
magnitude of 11.]
     From the above value of u, under the conditions supposed,
I <U+FB01>nd
                        a: —(7/l3)a approx.
In other words the earth would possess an elastic displace
ment of fully 2000 miles at the surface. My own view,
advocated some years ago in your pages *, with, I have reason
to think, pretty general approval from elasticiansT, is that
results deduced by treating the earth as an elastic solid of the
normal type cannot be taken seriously unless they make the
strains small quantities of the order allowed by the ordinary
mathematical and physical theories.
    The only satisfactory way, so far as I know, of deducing
results consistent with perfect elasticity is to treat the earth as
incompressible, or very nearly incompressible, throughout all
but the surface strata (Dr. Stoney’s ‘lithosphcre’). If we
suppose the lithosphere homogeneous and perfectly elastic, its
thickness d being small compared to the earth’s radius a, and
 suppose the underlying material incompressible, the displace
 ment u’ at the surface, due to uniform surface pressure p, is
approximately given by I
                        u’ = —- Styli/(3k + 4n),
 where k is the bulk-modulus, and n the rigidity, for the
lithosphere.
     If u represent as before the surface displacement on Dr.
.Stoney’s hypothesis of a uniform value k for the bulk-modulus,
 we have
                            I   _‘ (1

                          u /u—$ a 3k + 4n
 Supposing n=3k/5, the relation given by uniconstant iso.
 tropy, which is at least a fair approximation in ordinary
glass, we have
                              u’/u=(5d/3a).
 This makes u’/u about 1/80 when the lithosphere is 30 miles
thick.                                  '
     I do not attach any importance to the numerical estimate

just made, except as giving some idea of the large reduction
 it would be advisable to make in Dr. Stoney’s <U+FB01>gures. The
 lithosphere of course is not homogeneous, and alteration in the
 bulk-modulus with the depth must almost certainly be gradual.
     I would also point out that, whether one treats the earth
 as possessed of uniform elasticit or not, data deduced from
 uniform surface loading are hard y calculated to throw much
 light on what happens when the loaded area is but a small
 fraction of the surface. If the loaded area be only a few
 hundred, or even thousand, square miles, a much better idea
 of the order of magnitude of the elastic effects due to denuda
 tion or deposition would probably be obtained by an application
 of Cerruti and Boussinesq’s results* for a locally loaded
 in<U+FB01>nite plane. As to possible gradual—i. e. nonelastic and
viscous—results, elastic solid theory is but an imperfect guide.

.llatter, Energy, Force, and Work; A Plain Presentation of Fun
   damental Physical Concepts and of the Vortex-Atom and other
    Theories. By SILAS W. HOLMAN, Emeritus Professor of Physics
    in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. New York: The
    Macmillan Company, 1898.
     HE aim of the author in writing this volume has been to present
        the fundamental de<U+FB01>nitions and concepts of physics in a
logical order. Assuming the existence of space, he points out that
certain portions of it are possessed of the power to affect our senses
and other portions of space; in such portions substance exists.
Substance is composed of matter, and its power to produce external
etfects may be attributed to the energy of motion of its matter;
matter of itself having no properties except that it occupies space
and can possess kinetic energy. The concept of energy is thus
made more fundamental than that of force, which is de<U+FB01>ned as the
action of energy in producing a tendency to change of motion of
bodies. This treatment leads to the doctrine of the conservation
of energy and a discussion concerning the nature of the various
forms of energy, and is followed, in the second part of the volume,
by an account of the vortex-atom theory of matter.
   The author appears to us to have introduced an unnecessary
complication into his work by his respect for the term mass as
ordinarily used to indicate quantity of matter. The term has no
meaning until the method of estimating quantities of matter has
been agreed upon; ordinarily, mass is measured by its capacity for
acquiring momentum under given velocity, because force and
momentum are regarded as more fundamental than energy; it is,
   “ See Todhunter 8: Pearson’s ‘History,’ vol. ii. part 2. arts. 1489
et seq., or Love’s‘Elasticity,’ vol. i. chapter 9, also Phil. Mag. March
1897, p. 173.

however, equally legitimate to apply the same term to the capacity
of the body for acquiring energy under given velocity. As kinetic
energy depends on the square of the velocity there is a trouble
some factor g, which must either be got rid of by an equally
vexatious system of units or else it must be left in the equations.
The confusion occasioned by it is exhibited on p. 66, where we read
that the customary unit of kinetic energy “is one-half of that
possessed by one gramme when moving with a velocity of one
centimetre per second. It is called the erg.”
   Readers of the book, whether they agree with the views of the
author or not, cannot fail to have their attention drawn to the
fundamental concepts of mechanics and physics and the evidence
on which they are founded; this must necessarily lead to clearer
views and a greater appreciation of the modern theories sketched
brie<U+FB02>y in the second part of this volume.                       J. L. H.
An Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions.       By J. HARK—
   NESS, M.A., and F. MORLEY, Sc.D.        (London, Macmillan, 1898,
   pp. xvi+336.)
THE previous treatise on the Theory of Functions by the same
 writers was published in 1893. This work. as the authors state
and as is obvious on examination, is not an abridged and element—
ary version of the other, but is almost a totally independent work.
Our last remark is due to the fact that there are fewer references
on account of a fuller list having been given before. Let the
Authors speak for themselves : “ It has been composed with
(litferent ends in mind, deals in many places with distinct orders of
ideas, and presents from an independent point of view such portions
of the subject as are common to both volumes.
   “ Owing to the nonexistence of any English text-book giving a
consecutive and elementary account of the fundamental concepts
and processes employed in the theory of functions, the authors
have sent forth their volume to meet this pressing want.” The rest
of the preface gives an interesting sketch of what they attempt,
and after a perusal of great part of their work, we are convinced
that they will meet with the reward they hope for.
   There are twenty—two chapters in all, an Index, and Contents.
The earlier portion on the Crdinal Number System, Geometric
Representation of Complex Numbers, the Bilinear Transformation
and the Geometric Theory of the Logarithm and the Exponential, we
read with much interest and found them to be very clearly done.
Chapters viii.—xii. discuss the different points of difficulty connected
with Power Series. Then we have (xiii.) the Analytic Theory of the

       1. ‘Gcology of the Ashbourne and Buxton Branch of the
London and North-Western Bailway.—Ashbourne to Crake Low.’
By H. H. Arnold-chrose, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The southern part of the new railway from Ashbourne, through
Tissington and Crake Low, to Buxtou exhibits several sections
in Trias, Boulder Clay, Mountain Limestone, and Yorcdale Beds.
Interstrati<U+FB01>ed with the latter is a. thick bed of volcanic ash, with.
thinner intercalations of tu<U+FB02>'. Within a mile of Tissington ash is
exhibited four times in the cuttings, and according to the view of
the author it is the same bed repeated by basins and domes, one
of the latter of which is faulted. While the rocks succeeding
the ash in some places are limestones, cherts, and shales of Yoredale
type, in one section they resemble more closely the upper beds of the
Mountain Limestone. The limestones are often dolomitized. The
ash-bed is 144 feet thick where fully exposed: it is strati<U+FB01>ed, the
beds varying in texture, and the lapilli in them range from micro
scopic dimensions to 1 inch in diameter. The lapilli are glassy or
palagonitic; but felspar-microlites are rare, and the rock of which
they are made has no counterpart among the lavas of the county.
The ejected blocks in the ash vary from several inches up to
1 foot in diameter, and are similar to the blocks in the vent at
Kniveton. The small lapilli scattered through the limestones are
generally converted into calcite or dolomite with oxide of iron.
The paper is illustrated by microscopic slides, and horizontal and
vertical sections of the cuttings and quarries described; also by
hand-specimens, photographs, and lantern-slides.
   2. ‘ The Oceanic Deposits of Trinidad.’ By Prof. J. B. Harrison,
M.A., F.G.S., and A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
   ‘ The object of this communication is to present some observations
on the succession and geological relations of the beds Which have long
been known in Trinidad as the Naparima Marls. This name
was given by Messrs. Wall & Sawkins in 1860, on account of their
occupying a large part of the Naparima district east and south-east
of San Fernando. The beds so named formed one of the <U+FB01>ve series
which were described by these authors under the head of the Newer
Parian Group.’ In his historical introduction Mr. Jukes—Browne
deals with the writings of Mr. Guppy and Prof. Harrison, and shows
that three de<U+FB01>nite issues are thus raised -.——(1) Are the Nariva Beds
above or below the Naparima Marls ? (2) Do the Gtobigerina-marls

                    Intelligence and llflscellaneous Articles.             499
  occur in the Naparima district, and, if so, are they connected with the
  Radiolarian marls or are they part of a separate formation? (3) What
  is the relation between the San Fernando Beds and the other groups ?
  Mr. Guppy and Prof. Harrison agree in answering the <U+FB01>rst part of
  the second question in the af<U+FB01>rmative, and in stating that the two
  marls are closely connected together.
      In the second part of the paper, Prof. Harrison tabulates the
  following succession in the Naparima district :-
        3. Radiolarian beds resembling those of Barbados.
        2. Grey Globzyerina-marls, the same as those of the    Oceanic Series.

        1. Red and blue clays.                                Nariva Beds.
      Although junctions of the Nariva Beds and the Oceanic Series are
  not seen, at Ste. Madeleine Usine the clays of the former series
  occur 30 feet lower than the Globigerina-marls, and there appears
, to be no transition between the two series. On the other hand, the
  transition between (2) and (3) appears to be complete.           A comparison
  with the corresponding beds at Barbados now becomes possible, and
  this shows that the Globigerina—marls occupy the place of the basal
  chalks of Barbados, but are much thicker, while the radiolarian
  rocks are thinner, and the interbedded volcanic ashes so frequent
  in Barbados are wanting in Trinidad.             Chemical and microscopic
  analyses of the Globigerina and radiolarian beds are given, and,
  compared with similar analyses of the Barbadian deposits, they
  show that more quartz and argillaceous matter occur in Trinidad.
  The radiolarian marls contain iridescent scales due to fragments of
  the frustules of the diatom Ellimodiscus, which is ‘ quite characteristic
  of some of the deepest tropical red clays and radiolarian 002es
  far from land.’ The ‘ argiline’ beds appear to be formed from the
   alteration of the lower Globigerina-marls. The following correlation

     A FIVE-CELL QUADRANT ELECTROMETER.                   BY PROF. H. HAGA.
        ROF. H. HAGA describes a <U+FB01>ve—cell quadrant electrometer
          which has been constructed according to his design in the Phy
    sical Laboratory of the University of Groninghen. A special feature

 500 i         Intelligence and illiscellaneous Articles.
 is the means applied for dumping the oscillations of the combined
 system of <U+FB01>ve needles. This consists of a thin copper cylinder,
 movable in a strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and attached coaxially to the
 aluminium stem carrying the needles, which is continued down
 wards below the quadrants for this purpose. The magnetic <U+FB01>eld
 in which the cylinder moves is formed as follows :—a permanent
 magnet, whose axis forms a nearly complete horizontal circle, is
 fastened close below the sole-plate 0f the instrument, so that the
 axis of suspension of the needles and copper cylinder passes
 through the centre of the space between the poles, which are
 furnished with soft iron pole—pieces in the opposing faces of
 which grooves of semicircular section are out.          A cylindrical
 s ace is thus formed, which is closed on all sides ; above, by the
 sole-plate of the electrometer (except for a hole large enough to
 let the aluminium stem carrying the copper cylinder pass freely);
 below, by a brass plate carrying a short copper tube in which an
 iron core of rather smaller radius than the copper damping cylinder
 <U+FB01>ts closely and can he slid up or down with slight friction; at the
 sides by brass plates closing the air-gaps between the pole-pieces.
 The damping cylinder is thus thoroughly protected from air-cur
rents and moves in the annular space between the hollowed out
 surfaces of the pole—pieces and the iron core just mentioned.
    In order to be able to regulate the damping, the copper cylinder
 is adjusted, by thinning and shortening, until the movement is
just aperiodic when the iron core is pushed right up. Then by
moving the core downward, any required degree of damping can
be obtained.      The total suspended system weighs 20 grammes.
The suspending <U+FB01>bre is 17 cm. long and is attached at the top to
a torsion head. The author has tried a silvered quartz <U+FB01>bre of
55 ,u. diameter, but <U+FB01>nds an annealed platinum wire of 50 p on the
whole the most convenient. With this suspension the half-period
was about 12 seconds, and, as the damping was so regulated that
the needles came to rest after three swings, readings could be
taken at intervals of about 36 seconds. The needles were charged
by being connected with the positive terminal of a set of 300
Leclanché cells, the negative of which was to earth. With a scale—
distance of 2 metres, a Clark cell gave, by reversal, a deviation of
about 600 mm., and the same values could be obtained repeatedly
within 2 or 3 tenths of a millimetre ; in other words, measurements
can be made with the electrometer with an accuracy of fully one
part in 1000.
    The author gives a series of readings illustrating the proportion
ality between potential-difference and de<U+FB02>ection, and also examples
of the use of the instrument for the comparison of electromotive
forces, of current—strengths by the potentiometer method, and of
the constant of a galvanometer.——( Abstract of paper communicated

     XLVIII. Thickness of the Black Spot in Liquid Films.
                    By EDWIN S. JOHONNOTT, Jun.”
                               INTRODUCTION.
 THE principal object of the measurement of the thickness of
         the black spot on certain li uid <U+FB01>lms is to determine the
 radius of molecular attraction, w ich is supposed to be equal
 to half the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm. The <U+FB01>rst determination of
 the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm was made by PlateauT, who gives it
 as 120 x 10‘6 millim. or 120 1141.. The present generally
 accepted value is that given by the experiments of Professors
 Reinold and Riickeri, viz., 12 #41. for the thickness.
   They employed two methods, the <U+FB01>rst consisting in measuring
 the electrical resistance of cylindrical <U+FB01>lms, and the second in
 determining the relative retardation of two beams of light,
 one of which had been transmitted through a larger number
 of <U+FB01>lms than the other.
    P. Drude§, by considering the effect of capillarity on the
re<U+FB02>exion and refraction of light, obtained a value of 17 p}. for
the thickness. He also gives a good historical summary of
the work that has been done on the determination of the
radius of molecular attraction. Lord Rayleigh I] has also
shown that an olive-oil <U+FB01>lm 2 #4:. thick will just quiet the
movements of camphor particles on a water surface.

502          Mr. E. S. Johonnott on the Thickness of
    Two methods, both suggested by Prof. Michelson, were
used in making the measurements here given,
       the <U+FB01>rst, an interferometer method,
       the second, a photometric method.
    In the <U+FB01>rst method continuous readings, for the mean thick
ness of a number of <U+FB01>lms, werermade over a period of several
hours. In the second method the thickness of a single <U+FB01>lm
was determined from the intensity of the light re<U+FB02>ected at a
 series of different angles of incidence. Since it was impossible
to obtain monochromatic lights suf<U+FB01>ciently intense, this method
does not furnish accurate results.
    The liquid used was a solution of either oleate of soda or
 oleate of potash in distilled water, the proportions ranging
 from 1 part of oleate to 100 of water (1 : 100), to 1 part of
 oleate to 40 of water (1 : 40). Tests were made with potassium
 nitrate and also glycerine added to the above solutions.
     The index of refraction of all the solutions was assumed to
 be that of pure water, viz., 1'333. All the measurements
 were made on vertical <U+FB01>lms, formed on rectangular frames
 made of glass <U+FB01>bre. The lower edge of the <U+FB01>lms was on the
 surface of the solution in all cases.                 '    - r7
                              METHOD I.
     Prof. Michelson’s interferometer was used in making the
 measurements by this method.
     Description of Apparatus.—The two re<U+FB02>ectors were placed
  at A and B, on a stone slab 2 feet by 2 feet (<U+FB01>g. 1), and the
  separating surface and compensator at C. The <U+FB01>lms were
  brought into the path, BC, of the interferometer, at F, on
  frames made of glass <U+FB01>bre 0'5 millim. in diameter. In
  mounting the frames, a 13-inch round brass rod 35 centim.
 long was slit lengthwise into halves. 60 grooves, at intervals
  of 5 millim. were ruled on the <U+FB02>at surface of one of the halves.
  A glass <U+FB01>bre 7 centim. long was clamped centrall in each
  groove by means of a lon square rod faced wit chamois
  skin. Upon levelling the pane of the <U+FB01>bres and carrying a
  <U+FB01>ne <U+FB02>ame along the edges of the grooved surface, all of the
  frames were formed in vertical planes. The frames were then
  all brought to a common length by forming beads on the
  lower ends with the <U+FB02>ame. These ends were then lowered
  into molten solder in a trough made from a piece of Al-inch
  brass tubing, slitted longitudinally. After cooling, the clamp
  was removed, leaving 54 frames rigid] mounted and per
  fectly in line at the tops and sides. Each, end of the supports
   of the frames was then attached, by means of small wind

  lasses, to the ends of a zinc trough holding 500 cub. centim.
  of the solution.     This was covered with a glass casing, C
   (<U+FB01>g. 2), made from a tube by removing a longitudinal section.
   Two optically plane parallel pieces of glass covered the ends
   of the case ; while two plane parallels of the same thickness

  were placed at the ends of a similar piece of tubing in the
  other path of the interferometer. Cementing with beeswax
  or para<U+FB02>in prevented any unsteadiness of the fringes, and also
  provided a practically air-tight chamber for the <U+FB01>lms.
     Fig. 2 shows a full-sized cross-sectional view of the <U+FB01>lm
  box.- The frames are shown anchored in the solder at D,
  while the <U+FB01>lm is shown formed at H. The temperature
 readings were taken with a thermometer, T, inside of the
 case, and held away from the walls by rubber rings.
     Methods of Observation.—By turning the windlasses, the
  <U+FB01>lms could be brought into the path of the interferometer and
  so adjusted that the displaced fringes appeared contiguous
  with those from the light notgoing through the <U+FB01>lms. Using

 below the surface of the solution ; (b) when the <U+FB01>lms are <U+FB01>rst
 formed. The fringes, of course, do not show within the
 image of the frames, and only the broad horizontal bands of
 the coloured <U+FB01>lms are seen. As soon as the black <U+FB01>lm forms
 at the tops of all the frames the vertical fringes are seen
 displaced within the frames, and take successively the appeal.“

      The number of fringes displacement is determined by that
   of the central black fringe in the white-light fringes, which
   is shown in the <U+FB01>gures broader than the adjacent coloured
   fringes. The fringes continue vertical within the image of
   the frames until they reach the boundary between the black
  and coloured <U+FB01>lms, and then slant off at a continuously
   increasing slope as the black <U+FB01>lms extend lower. When the
   black <U+FB01>lms cover the <U+FB01>eld, which usually occurs within
  <U+FB01>ve minutes after the frames are raised, the appearance is
   shown in (0).
      When the atmosphere about the <U+FB01>lms has been enclosed a
  day or more, the tops of the coloured <U+FB01>lms may occur on the
  same level, preventing at <U+FB01>rst the appearance of the sloping
  portion of the fringes. This would indicate a considerable
  discontinuity in the thickness at the junction of the black and
  coloured <U+FB01>lms. A bodily shift of the sloping portion (a) was
  often noticed.
     Methods of Measurement.—One 0f the advantages of this
 method is that there can be no great difference in the optical
 path inside and outside of the frames at their tops, except that
 due to the <U+FB01>lms; and the fact that the fringes usually con
 tinue vertical within the image of the frames indicates that
 there is practically none.     Another advantage is that the
 de<U+FB02>exion is the same as that which would be due to a single
 transmission through twice the number of <U+FB01>lms.
     The measurements were all taken at the tops of the frames
 when the fringes were vertical. The calculations were made
 by using the wave-length of sodium light in the formula,
 although the white-light fringes were as often used in taking
 the readings, which were always eye-estimates of the displace
 ment of the fringes.

       D the mean thickness of the <U+FB01>lms.
    The Two Black Films.—-With all solutions a very rapid
fall in the thickness occurs when the black <U+FB01>lms have just
been formed, and continues with greater or less rapidity
according as the atmosphere about the <U+FB01>lms is more or less

  exposed to heat or to the atmosphere of the room.                   (The
  <U+FB01>lms will be said to be “ exposed ” when the casing is unsealed
  and the atmosphere about the <U+FB01>lms is exposed to that of the
  room at crevices alon the casing M (<U+FB01>g.                    Solutions of
  oleate of soda or potash, without any salt or glycerine added,
  show the greatest and most sudden changes in thickness. It
  was observed that these sudden changes were always accom
  panied b the formation of a second black <U+FB01>lm within the
  <U+FB01>rst.      hen the case was open or only partially sealed, this
   second black was seen to form <U+FB01>rst on the more exposed <U+FB01>lms
   in the case, and on the side of the frames toward a distant
   source of heat. A group of round spots would appear, at
   least two millimetres from the frames, and would expand and
   multiply until the whole upper part of the <U+FB01>lms was covered
   with the second black.         This was also the case with <U+FB01>lms
   tightly sealed if the casing was warmed with a <U+FB02>ame. With
   exposed or heated <U+FB01>lms the second black would soon appear on
   all the frames, after it had formed on the fnost exposed.
   Many times it would form by the expansion of a single spot,
   appearing as though the spot were a region of slightly
  .smaller surface-tension in the <U+FB01>rst black <U+FB01>lm.
      The slightest occurrence of the second black <U+FB01>lm was dis
   tinctly seen by arranging a gas-jet at L (<U+FB01>g. 1), and observing
   the re<U+FB02>ected light. The spots would occur <U+FB01>rst on the upper
   corner nearest the light, unless the side of the case opposite
   the light was unsealed, while that toward it was sealed ; then
   they would form <U+FB01>rst on the more exposed side.               Oftentimes
   a thick silvery <U+FB01>lm would form on the frames, as a boundary
   to the second black <U+FB01>lm.                           7
      This could usually be produced by warming an exposed
   <U+FB01>lm.
      The second black on a liquid <U+FB01>lm was <U+FB01>rst observed by
   Newton *.     Reinold and Riicker'l' on one occasion Succeeded
   in getting the two black <U+FB01>lms successively between their
    needles. The resistance of the two <U+FB01>lms indicated thicknesses
    of 200 pp. and 110,144. respectively. These numbers are evi
    dently much too large, the error being due, as their experi
    ments show, to a difference in the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the
    <U+FB01>lm and that of the solution.
       Again, the second black <U+FB01>lm will not appear when the
    <U+FB01>lms have been sealed in for any length of time, and the <U+FB01>rst
    black <U+FB01>lm may remain at a high thickness, particularly if
    the temperature is low and not increasing. In all cases,

                 the Black Spot in Liquid Films.              507
 breaking into the second, is about twice the thickness of the
 second.    From this it might be inferred that the thickness of
 the second black <U+FB01>lm is possibly once the radius of molecular
 attraction, or some multiple, while the limiting thickness of
 the <U+FB01>rst is twice as great.
    It is generally considered that the <U+FB01>lm whose thickness is
 once the radius of molecular attraction has a smaller tension
 than one twice as thick, and would thus be unstable. Max
 well *, however, has shown, on the assumption that the density
 is uniform in a region within the distance equal to the radius
 of molecular attraction from the surface of a liquid, and equal
 to the density of the liquid in mass, that a <U+FB01>lm whose thick
 ness is once the radius of molecular attraction would have the
 same surface-tension as one twice as thick. That is, a <U+FB01>lm
 whosa thickness is once the radius would be stable.
    Statement of Results.—A curve illustrating the eifect of
temperature changes on the thickness of the sealed black <U+FB01>lm
is <U+FB01>rst given.
    Fig. 4 (p. 508).—This curve was taken May 6th, with a 1 : 7O
oleate of soda solution that had been sealed 24 hours. 38 of
the original 54 <U+FB01>lms remained to the end of 40 hours. The
abscissae represent the age of the <U+FB01>lm in hours, and the
ordinates, on the left, the mean thickness in 1141.; on the right
the ordinates represent the temperature in degrees centigrade.
No attempt was made to in<U+FB02>uence changes in the temperature.
The whole apparatus was enclosed in a thick wooden box and
the room carefully guarded against air-currents. No observa
tion was made for the second black <U+FB01>lm as this was taken
before its existence had been noticed. Apparently the in
<U+FB02>exious of the thickness-curve follow, inversely, those of the
temperature-curve, indicating an increase in thickness with a
fall in temperature. Owing to the small de<U+FB02>exion and fewer
<U+FB01>lms, the readings became more uncertain towards the end ;
hence, there the thickness-curve is not drawn as indicated by
the points.     \Vhen there are 54 <U+FB01>lms a de<U+FB01>exion of one
fringe corresponds to a mean thickness of 16 Mt.
   Hygrometric Condition.—This curve, taken with the fact
that exposure tends to thin the <U+FB01>lms, would indicate that the
thickness depends on the hygrometric condition of the atmo
sphere about the <U+FB01>lms. An unsatisfactory attempt was made
to measure the relative humidity with a wet and dry bulb
hygrometer. Even with as great an exposure as was used
in any observation, the difference in the readings of the ther
mometers was less than 0°‘2, which at 23° C. would indicate
a relative humidity greater than '995.

solutions similarly prepared, and even for di<U+FB01>‘erent sets of
<U+FB01>lms from the same solution. This is shown in the following
tables, and may be partially due to irregularities in tempera
ture and rate of thinning, but more probably to the difference
in exposure and surface conditions of the solution.
   The thinning of the sealed <U+FB01>lm because of a rise in tem
  erature has an interesting bearing on a demonstration by
   arburg‘, that the thickness of a very thin <U+FB01>lm must

diminish with an increase in the pressure of its surrounding
saturated vapour. It was assumed, in accordance with Lord
Kelvin’s‘ surface-energy principle, that the thickness was so
small that the surface-tension diminished with the thickness.
As the pressure of the saturated vapour of a liquid increases
with the temperature, it would be expected, from this principle,
that the <U+FB01>lm would thin with an increase in the temperature.
Whether the thinning is due to this cause or to a loss of water
by evaporation from the surface of the <U+FB01>lms, such as Reinold
and Riicker'i' have shown takes place at the surface of coloured
<U+FB01>lms, seems to be an open question.
   The remaining results are given in the following tables.
The numbers in the <U+FB01>rst column indicate the age of the <U+FB01>lms
in hours and minutes ; the second, the number of <U+FB01>lms ; the
third, the mean thickness in pp ; the fourth, the de<U+FB02>exion in
fringes of sodium or white light; the <U+FB01>fth, the temperature
inside of the casing ; while the character of the <U+FB01>lms is given
in the last column.     The black <U+FB01>lm <U+FB01>rst formed is designated
by b, and the next by 12,.
    Table I.—This was taken September 9th with a 1 : 40 oleate
of soda solution that had been sealed two hours. The <U+FB01>lms
 were all thinned to the b2 <U+FB01>lms twice by warming a brass
 plate P (<U+FB01>g. 2), placed above the casing. From inspection of
 the table it may be seen that the thickness fell in 1 hour to
 15,1144. So long as the temperature was 24°‘6 it remained
 constant, and no 62 <U+FB01>lms formed. The plate P was then
 gently warmed, and as a result the I), <U+FB01>lms formed suddenly
 on all the frames, while the mean thickness dropped to 6'3 p44.
 The plate was then removed, and the <U+FB01>lms all returned to the
 <U+FB01>rst black within 10 minutes.         The operation was repeated
 two hours later with the same results.            It may be observed
 that the mean thickness, just before all had begun to thin to
 b2 and just as all had returned to bl <U+FB01>lms, was about 15 pp,
 while the thickness of the 1),, <U+FB01>lms was about 6'5 an.
    Table 11.—This was taken September 15th, with a 1:70
 solution of oleate of soda that had been sealed 24 hours.
 The de<U+FB01>exion began at slightly over two fringes, corresponding
 to a thickness of 33 an, fell to 20,1141. in 3 hours, and to 15p,“
 in 20 days. The room was left undisturbed for two weeks.
 The reading was then (412th hour), as usual, taken before
 the number of broken <U+FB01>lms was counted, and gave practically
 the same mean thickness. Two days later the brass plate was
 warmed, causing the <U+FB01>rst 62 <U+FB01>lms to appear.               The resulting

510            Mr. E. S. Johonnott on tlw Thickness of
thicknesses correspond closely to those in Table I. The
limitin thickness of the b1 <U+FB01>lms appears here as in Table I.
to be :1 out 12 #44,.
   Table IlI.—This was taken October 13th with a 1 : 7O oleate
of soda solution to which 10 per cent. glycerine had been
added. The casing had been sealed 24 hours.                         The most
noteworthy feature is the                  reat thickness and its slight
increase at the beginning.                  his increase at the beginning
has often been noticed with other solutions. The thickness
fell to 28'6p41. at the end of the 6th hour. The brass plate
was then continuously heated for an hour while close to the
casing, and the thickness fell to 11'5. No further thinning
could be produced, even by heating the casin                    directly with
the burner. The plate was then removed, and t e temperature
fell from 33°‘4 U. to 25°, while the <U+FB01>lms came back to a mean
thickness of 35 up. Something similar to the b, <U+FB01>lms
appeared on a few of the frames, but was never distinct as
with the pure oleate solutions.

Only part of a few of the observations are given, the object
being to illustrate the effect of exposure and change of tem
perature on the thickness of the <U+FB01>lms.
   Observation I.—These readings were taken soon after the
solution was prepared, and as soon as it had cooled down to the
tem erature of the room. The <U+FB01>lms were freely exposed.
Wit in three minutes the b2 <U+FB01>lms had formed on all of the
frames.
   Observation II.-—At the end of Obs. I. the casing was
partially sealed and II. taken three hours later. The mean
thickness was greater and did not fall so rapidly, though the
same might have been the case (judging from other obser
vations) had there been no sealing.
   Observation III.—This was taken Oct. 19th, 24 hours later,
with the same sealing, and shows about the same thicknesses
as in II.
   Observation IV.—This was taken Oct 20th, the solution
having been <U+FB01>rmly sealed 10 minutes when the frames were
raised. The second reading gives 11'7 as the limiting thick
nesses of the b1 <U+FB01>lms. At the end of four hours not all had

514          Mr. E. S. Johonnott on the Thickness of
 become b2 <U+FB01>lms, which shows the effect of sealing on the
 character of the <U+FB01>lms.     But on slightly warming the casing
 all suddenly became be <U+FB01>lms at a thickness of 6 ,up.
    Observation V.—-This was taken Oct. 22nd, with the same
 sealing as in IV. The greater thickness is evidently due to
 the atmosphere of the <U+FB01>lms having been sealed for two days.
    Observation VI.——This was taken Oct. 24th, two days later,
 with the same sealing, but at a temperature several degrees
lower, and gives practically the same thicknesses.          .
    Observation VIL—This was taken Oct. 25th at a tempe
 rature about 10° higher. The fall in thickness may have
been partially due to a leaking-in of the air. However, this
is a fair example of all observations on pure oleate solutions
at high temperature.
    Observation VIII.——This was taken Oct. 27th, with’a low
and falling temperature, and shows a great thickness for over
 six hours.   The thicknesses are about the same as in VI.
    Observation IX.—This was taken Oct. 28th after one side
 of the casing had been unsealed for 16 hours. The fall in
 thickness even at this low temperature corresponds closely
 with that of Obs. II., at a higher temperature, taken ten‘days
 previously under similar conditions. All the <U+FB01>lms broke
 readily into the 122 <U+FB01>lms as soon as the lights L and S (<U+FB01>g. 1)
 were  left burning.
    Observation   Ila—This was taken some time later after
 20 per cent. glycerine had been added to the solution, and.
even with the most exposed atmosphere shows a great
thickness. N0 b9 <U+FB01>lms appeared. The casing was then
sealed, but the solution had become so contaminated that the
<U+FB01>lms broke too readily to permit of any trustworthy readings,
being made.
    Solutions of Diferent Compositions.—No difference could
be observed between the pure oleate-of- soda and oleate-of
potash solutions. The second black <U+FB01>lm formed under the
 same conditions, and with the same characteristics, with both
 solutions. However, with the addition of either glycerine
or potassium nitrate the character of the black <U+FB01>lm was com
pletely changed. When freely exposed or heated, both would
show slowly moving eddies of darker regions. When potassium
nitrate was added these eddies broke up into tiny <U+FB02>ecks moving
rapidly about in the <U+FB01>lm ; but never formed in clusters on the
frames, as was the case with the pure oleate solutions. While
the effect of the glycerine was to increase the thickness of the
black <U+FB01>lm, that of the potassium nitrate was to diminish the
range. With an oleate-of-soda solution to which 5 per cent.
potassium nitrate had been added, the maximum mean thick

                 the Black Spot in Liquid Films.             515
ness observed was 13'8 p44, while for the most freely exposed
the minimum was 7‘5 #41,.
    Efect of an Atmosphere of Carbon Dioxide.—The effect of
introducing an atmosphere of carbon dioxide while the black
<U+FB01>lms were formed was remarkable. The <U+FB01>lms all suddenly
became coloured, and did not again thin to the black <U+FB01>lm. A
thick white precipitate formed on the solution at the bottom of
the <U+FB01>lms and gradually covered the surface. A similar pre
cipitate was often noticed at the bottom of the <U+FB01>lms, even when
the case had been scaled, thus indicating that possibly the
atmosphere of the <U+FB01>lms always contained carbon dioxide.
       Conclusions drawn from Results of the First Method.
    Considering the observations here given and many others
that were made, these conclusions are :—
    (1) That the thickness of the black <U+FB01>lm is independent of
 the proportions of oleate and water. The truth of this may
be seen in comparing the readings in Table 1., taken with a
 1:40 solution, with those of Tables II. and IV., taken with a
 1:70 solution. The same is borne out by many other obser
vations on pure oleate solutions varying in proportion from
1:40 to 1:100.
    (2) That the thickness of the black <U+FB01>lm with a sealed atmo
sphere diminishes as the temperature rises. This is illustrated
in the curve of <U+FB01>g. 4 (p. 508) most clearly. But it is also
shown to be true for sudden changes in temperature in the
warming process of all the tables.
    (3) That the thickness of the exposed black <U+FB01>lm is ultimately
that of the second black, which is constant and independent of
the temperature. This is shown by comparison of observations
 1., II., III., and IX. of Table IV. Anumber of observations
indicated that the thickness of the second black <U+FB01>lm was not
constant. However, as the greatest difference in the de<U+FB01>exion
 corresponding to a certain number of <U+FB01>lms was never more
 than a tenth of a fringe, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to say whether this
 corresponds to a real difference in the thickness of the second
 black <U+FB01>lm or not.
                            METHOD II.
    The idea of determining the thickness of the black <U+FB01>lm by
 measuring the intensity of the light re<U+FB02>ected at different
 angles of incidence was suggested by Prof. Michelson. The
 measurements were made by comparing the images of two
 slits at the focus of the telescope of a spectrometer. The
 light from the slit of the collimator entered the telescope after

516         Mr. E. S. Johonnott on the Thickness of
re<U+FB01>exion from the <U+FB01>lm. The other slit was that of a silvered
glass photometer.
   Description of the Apparatus.-—The photometer consisted
of a piece of plate-glass P (<U+FB01>g. 5), lightly silvered on one
side with a wedge-shaped silver <U+FB01>lm and placed behind the
                              Fig. 6.

slit K. The sensitiveness was increased by placing at P’ a
sheet of ground glass which was capable of rotation about a
horizontal axis. A lens, L, rendered the rays from S parallel,
after which they were re<U+FB02>ected through a portion of the
objective of the telescope by means of a pair of mirrors, R.
Two nicols, N and N', were placed in front of the objective,
through which all light reaching the telescope from the colli
mator passed. A small circular aperture, A, was placed in
front of the nicols so as to allow the light to pass through
their central portions only. Precautions were taken in
observations at all angles of incidence to have the re<U+FB02>ected
wave-front completely cover this aperture. Another smaller
aperture, E, helped in properly placing the eye.
   Method of Observation. —-The manner of making an obser
vation was as follows :—Set the two nicols parallel; turn the
collimator to the angle of incidence at which the reading is
wanted; raise the <U+FB01>lm, F, and turn it until the image of the
collimator-slit is close beside that of the photometer. Then,
as soon as the black <U+FB01>lm is formed, adjust the photometer so
that both images have the same intensity. The <U+FB01>lm is then
removed, the collimator turned into line with the telescope,
and the nicol N turned about its axis until the photometer is
again matched.
    Theory of the hlethod.—The intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected light
is given by the equation
                             I=cos90, .    .  . .    .  .  .  (l)
where 0 is the angle through which the nicol N is turned and
I is one half of the light incident on the front nicol N’
(neglecting loss due to re<U+FB02>exion).      By pro erly setting the
front nice], the observation may be made wit      light polarized

   error due to an incorrect setting will be a minimum when the
   light is polarized either in or perpendicular to the plane of
   incidence.

   Statement of Results—The results of some observations at

in all other observations by this method the two sources, S

the observation is given in the <U+FB01>rst column and the intensit

wave-length and in absolute measure, the wave-length being

  Table V.—ln this table the plane of polarization made an
angle of 45° with the plane of incidence. The <U+FB01>rst two
observations were made April 22nd on a 1: 7O oleate-of-soda
solution that had stood in the vessel on the table of the
spectrometer exposed to the air of the room several days.
The last two were taken with a newly prepared solution. The
mean thickness is about 7 #44.
  Table VL—This was taken with a similar solution, but
with the plane of polarization in the plane of incidence. The
mean thickness is about 7 pa.
   Continuous readings were then made with a 1: 70 oleate-of
soda solution at different angles 'of incidence.              The results
are plotted in curves A, B, and C of <U+FB01>gs. 6 and 7. Each
observation of the intensity plotted is calculated from the
mean of ten readings, taken alternately, on opposite sides
of the crossed positions of the nicols. A separate <U+FB01>lm was
used for each point. Readings were taken at intervals of 5°,
with angles of incidence varying from 22°‘5 to 72°‘5.                »7
   Curve A (p. 520) .—This was taken May 11th with a solution
that had stood one night exposed to the atmosphere of the room.
The intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected light corresponds to that from a
<U+FB01>lm whose thickness is about 7 up. The apparent increase in
the thickness at high angles of incidence may have been due
to the dif<U+FB01>culty in matching the more intense images. ' The
temperature of the room was about 25° C.                                '

    520            Mr. E. S. Johonnott on the Thickness of
    apparatus had been taken down and entirely readjusted. This
    may possibly account for the difference in the readings,
    although it may also have been due to a difference in the
    solutions.      Some of the points lie above a smooth curve
    through the others, which may be due to imperfect <U+FB01>lms, as
    some dif<U+FB01>culty was experienced in getting stable <U+FB01>lms. The
    thickness of' the <U+FB01>lms is about 6 ,up. The temperature of the
    room was about 23° C.

    solution as B, that had stood exposed one night. The plane
    of polarization was perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
    The intensity fell until the angle of incidence was 52°25, at
    which the image of the collimator-slit could barely be

       Comparison of the two Mei/rods.—The <U+FB01>rst method offers
   many advantages over the second. The <U+FB01>lms could be seen,
   the temperature of their atmosphere measured, and its hygro
   metric condition more easily controlled in the <U+FB01>rst method.
   But it was not possible to have the <U+FB01>lms thin at the same
   rate; hence the readings represent only mean thicknesses.
   In many cases there was, no doubt, a wide difference in
   thickness, at any elevation, on different <U+FB01>lms, and even on the
   same <U+FB01>lm.                                               .
      The <U+FB01>lm in the second method was 2 cms. by 9 cms., and
   was exposed at two openings each about a square centimetre
   in area, and would thus be an “exposed ” <U+FB01>lm.                  -
      Probably the most striking feature in the comparison 0
   the results of the two methods is the nearness of the thickness
   obtained in the second method to that in the <U+FB01>rst with an
   exposed <U+FB01>lm.
      It may be remarked that the results of the second method
   were all obtained before the second black <U+FB01>lms had been
   noticed. Although it was impossible to see the second black
   <U+FB01>lm in the second method, there can be no doubt but that the
   <U+FB01>rst black broke immediately into the second; for such was
   the case in the <U+FB01>rst method even when the exposure was ever
   so much less.

     Although the results of the second method correspond to
what should be expected from the <U+FB01>rst, they should probably
not be considered to prove more than that the ordinary laws
of re<U+FB02>exion hold at the surfaces of such thin <U+FB01>lms.
     Conclusions.——The conclusions to be drawn from the work,
brie<U+FB02>y stated, are :—                                                <
     (1) That the thickness of the black <U+FB01>lm of a soap-solution
is not constant, and may vary from 6,141. to 40,1141“
     (2) That the <U+FB01>lm of a pure oleate solution may consist of
two black <U+FB01>lms, the thickness of the second being about half
the limiting thickness of the <U+FB01>rst, which is about 12 up.
      (3) That the addition of glycerine or potassium nitrate to
a pure oleate solution prevents the appearance of the second
black <U+FB01>lm. \Vhile in the <U+FB01>rst case the thickness is greater,
in the second the range of the thickness is smaller.
     The observations by the <U+FB01>rst method have been repeated by
Mr. Chamberlain; the mean of his results for the thickness of .
the second black <U+FB01>lm was 6'2 up, and for the limiting thick
ness of the <U+FB01>rst black <U+FB01>lm 11'2 up.
     It is here desired to acknowledge indebtedness for many
ideas in both methods to Prof. Michelson; and also to thank
him for his interest and encouragement in the work, as well
as for giving us an instrument so beautifully adapted to work
of this character. Many suggestions should also be acknow
ledged to Associate Prof. Stratton, particularly in regard to
the apparatus used. Finally, it is desired to thank Dr. Millikan
for suggestions 1n the preparation of the manuscript.

XLIX. Note on the Source of Energy in Difusive Convection.
     By ALBEn'r GRIFFITHS, M80. (Via), A.R.C.S. (Lond.).*
   .    T the conclusion of a paper on “ Di<U+FB02>'usive Convection ” 1‘
           the author, partly in the hope of producing a discussion,
 asked certain questions relating indirectly to the source of
 energy in the apparatus under consideration.
      After the publication of the paper in the Philosophical
 Magazine, Prof. FitzGerald made some remarks on it in
 ‘ Nature,’ and gave a concise account of the actions at work.
 He pointed out, what was already known to the author, that
 there is a tendency towards cooling when diffusion causes the
 rise of the centre of gravity. Stimulated by Prof. FitzGerald’s

   If we make the hypothesis that S1, S2, and S are constants,
then
       Mf—‘m = S(d,l, + 4,1,) t, - as, sea-as, s,:,.
   This equation indicates that (t0— t1), the fall in temperature,
depends in some way on the height through which the dis
solved substance diffuses. The preceding was worked out
long before I published my pa er. In what follows, the
in<U+FB02>uence of Prof. FitzGerald wil perhaps be shown.
   If we wish to study the fall of temperature due to the rise
of matter by diffusion in a theoretical manner, we may assume
that the capacity for heat of the mixture is the sum of the
capacities for heat of the components, and that there is no heat
of combination.
   Let m: total mass of the two liquids.
       s = thermal capacity of unit mass of mixture.
       h = rise of C.G.
       g = acceleration due to gravity.
       f = the fall of temperature.
   Then, since the potential energy gained equals the capacity
of the liquids multiplied by the fall of temperature,
                         mgh=msf.
Hence                      '.   gh
                           j: i;
   It may be pointed out that this e nation indicates a limit
to the height to which diffusion (wit ultimate uniform dis
tribution) can spread. Thus if s be a constant, the above
equation holds whatever the fall in temperature; and if the
temperature be initially 0° 0., fcannot be greater than 273° 0.,
and h cannot be greater than 273 s/y.
   Let s=42,350x y (the capacity of a gram of water), then
h cannot be greater than 273x42,350 cms.; that is 115
kilometres approximately. It may be noted that h is not the
height at which di<U+FB02>iusion occurs, but the rise in the centre of
gravity. In a given casethe height at which di<U+FB01>'usion occurs can
readily be expressed in terms of h.

  In the <U+FB01>gure there is a representation of a vertical tube of
length L.                                                   .

   Let v = velocity of liquid up the tube.

   With certain assumptions, it is shown in the paper on
“ Di<U+FB02>'usive Convection” that the difference of pressure between
the bottom and the top of the tube equals

    The work performed per second consists of two parts—
    (1) A quantity of water of volume 0A is raised a height L.
    (2) A quantity of dissolved substance (see “ Diti'usive Con

    Before tackling the problem, it will be well perhaps to make
some preliminary remarks with regard to what occurs in the
upper and lower compartments. The dissolved substance is
being continually carried to the top of L1, for example, and
falling from there to the bottom of the upper compartment.
The heat generated by the fall equals the product of the weight
transmitted into the fall.
    On the other hand, when the dissolved substance is ab
stracted from the bottom, the weakened solution rises to the
top of the lower compartment.           Diffusion into the weakened
solution, whilst it is rising, will doubtless occur, but the action

528             Mr. A. Grif<U+FB01>ths on the Source of
can be made negligible by taking g very large, in which case
the weakened solution rises very rapidly.
   If d: 1 +t (where d=density and t=concentration), it can
readily be shown that the heat generated equals the weight
transmitted into the bottom of the tube by difusion multiplied
by the rise of the weakened solution.
   The apparatus sketched in the preceding section will now
be studied.

 this way when we consider the two tubes equals

    General Explanation of the Loss of fleat when Wor]: is

   For simplicity let the thickness of the diaphragm be zero.
   Transmission of dissolved substance along the tubes is
accompanied by a fall of substance in the upper compartment,
and a rise of weakened solution in the lower compartment,
both of which actions produce heat. The rate of production
of heat depends on the rate of <U+FB02>ow of the liquid.
   The greater the rate at which work is done by the appa
ratus, the less the rate of production of heat.
   The rate of absorption of heat due to transmission of dis
solved substance through the tubes is independent of the
<U+FB02>ow, and need not be considered in this general explanation.

    ALBERT Gmrrrrns, M.Sc.(Vic.), A.R.C.S.(Lond.)*.
                           SECTION I.
 FOR some time the author has been engaged in some
        experiments with the object of determining the coef<U+FB01>
 cient of diffusion of bodies dissolved in water. It may be
 some years before experimental results of any decided value
 are obtained; and perhaps he will be allowed to give an
account of the calculations involved, and of the methods he
has adopted in obtaining an idea of the probable order of
magnitude of the errors to which the apparatus is liable.
              _                  The apparatus consists of a
            Flg- 1-           vessel V, divided into two com

                              of which two only are shown in
                         a    the <U+FB01>gure. Two tubes, A, B,
                              provided with stop-cocks, pass
                              into U.     One, A, just enters U ;
                              the other passes down to the
                              bottom. Similarly two tubes 0
                              and D pass into L ; C just enters,
                              and D reaches to the top.           The

    It will be assumed that the upper extremities of the tubes

in contact with a solution of constant strength.
    Let 'y = quantity of dissolved substance which enters the
                 upper compartment in unit time, when the
                 combined sectional area of the tubes equals
                 unit .
          h = coefficient of diffusion (C.G.S. system), assumed
                 to be a constant.
         L = length of tubes in centims.
         T = quantity of substance per 0. c. in the lower com

    For simplicity, two tubes only will be considered whose
lengths and sectional areas are the same. The expansion of the
material of the tubes will be neglected. To make the problem
 amenable to mathematical treatment, it will be assumed that
 the density of water equals (l—atl), where 9 is the tempera
 ture, and a is approximawa equal to an ideal coef<U+FB01>cient of
expansion. It will also be assumed that
                  d = (l — a6 + t) ,
where              d = the density of the solution,
                   t = the concentration.
    Let 0|=the temperature of one tube.
          rl=the velocity of the li uid up the tube.

    SECTION IV.—-Errora due to Changes of Temperature of
                       Apparatus as a whole.
    A art from the effects of any differences of temperature
 which may exist between the tubes themselves, there will in
 general be a flow set up along them one way or the other
when the apparatus as a whole is heated.
    If the upper and lower compartments were of equal volume
and the coefficients of expansion and the compressibilities of
 water and solution were the same, there would be no move
 ment along the tubes; the liquid would simply be compressed
 slightly. The actual motion could only be calculated from a
 knowledge of the various coef<U+FB01>cients of expansion and the
 compressibilities. The author has not the data for an accurate
 calculation, but to give an idea of the order of magnitude of
 the error, the case will be considered in which the taps of the
 up or compartment are open.

and k=3x 10'“. Then VLa9/2A/c equals 0033; and the
error due to the flow produced by the expansion is more than
3 per cent.
   It may be mentioned that if a bubble of air is present in
the lower compartment, it increases the <U+FB02>ow, and the corres
ponding error, considerably.
   Even if the upper taps are not left continuously open,
there is an error corresponding to the above; for opening

the top taps will allow a sudden rush to take place up the
tubes.
   It is obvious that a diminution of temperature produces an
error in the opposite direction ; and the error produced by a
 <U+FB02>uctuating temperature will probably not be considerable in
 the long run.
 SECTION V.—Err0rs due to Changes in Volume produced by
        the Weakening of the Solution through Di<U+FB02>'usion.
   In general, when a solution loses some of the dissolved sub
stance by dili‘usion it diminishes in volume. The diminution
depends on the nature of the dissolved substance and varies
with the concentration. The diminution for any given loss
can be calculated from a table of densities. For example, an
aqueous solution of copper sulphate at a temperature of 23°‘3
containing 80 grams to the litre has a density of 1080,
whereas a solution containing 160 grams to the litre has a
density of 1154. It can be readily shown that the addition
of ] gram of anhydrous copper sulphate, between the given
limits, on the average increases the volume by 0075 0.0.
approx.
   As in Section IV. it will be assumed that the upper com
partment is open to the atmosphere.
   Since the diminution of volume of the lower compartment
equals the quantity of copper sulphate transmitted multiplied
by 0075, with the aid of See. I. “ Diffusive Convection,” it
can readily be seen that
                             —(l-()75 x T x v
                          =<U+FB01> '
                                 1—e 7
   Hence, neglecting the second and higher powers of iii—J,
                         "TL = 0075 x T.
Let             T=0'l2,     then %=O‘009.
   The fractional diminution in the quantity transmitted equals
'vL/Zk, i.e. 0'0045. Thus the motion alon the tubes causes
a diminution in the quantity transmitted iy about one half
per cent.
   With salts whose solutions experience greater changes in
volume, the error may be very appreciable.
   Thus, between the limits of density 1'081 and 1'159, the
addition of 1 gram of sodium chloride causes an average

    of the Rate of Difuaion of Solids dissolved in Liquids.    537
  increase in volume of 0'35 c.c. ; and with T=O‘12, the error
  would be 2-1 per cent.
     It may be noted that when a small quantity of copper
  sulphate is added to water, the resultant volume is about the
  same as the original volume of the water. Hence if the lower
  compartment were left open to the atmosphere instead of the
  upper one, there would be no error from the cause under
 consideration.
    As before errors are produced when the taps are opened
 intermittently.
 SECTION VL—Errors due to Circulations produced when the
   Liquids of the Upper and Lower Compartments are renewed.
    When the water in the upper compartment is renewed the
 pressure at the inlet is greater than the pressures at the outlet,
 and in consequence the pressures at the upper extremities of
 the tubes are not constant. Hence <U+FB02>ows take place up certain
 tubes and down others.
    Let there be n tubes ; and let 191, p2, &e. be the respective
excesses of the pressures at the tops of the tubes above the
average pressure. Assuming the attainment of the steady
 state, and making the usual approximations, it can readily be
shown that the correcting factor equals
                             12
                      l + g’T2L2( p,’+.n . .12.?) '
Let p,- be the greatest of the p’s ; then the fractional error is
less than 12 p<U+FB01>/g’T’L’. Neglecting inertia effects, the value
of 11, must be less than the difference of pressure between
the inlet and outlet, an estimate of which could be made
practically. The author has not made any practical measure
ments, but has made a guess as to the order of magnitude of
the difference of pressure by making a crude analogy between
the upper compartment and a cylindrical tube. Thus, if
100 0.0. of water pass along a tube 3 cm. in diameter in an
hour, the difference of pressure (assuming the formula for a
capillary to hold) between two points on the axis 3 centim.
apart, if we take the coef<U+FB01>cient of viscosity equal to 0'01, is
0004 dyne. Let Pr=0'01, T=O'l, L=4, then the fractional
error equals
            12 x (‘0l)2/g981)2(0'1)2x 42, or 7-8 x 10'”.
It is clear that the error from this cause is appreciable.

   Inequalities in the lengths of the tubes and inaccuracies
in placing them in the diaphragm will, in general, produce
convection-currents. There is no intrinsic dif<U+FB01>culty in calcu
lating <U+FB02>ows of small magnitude, if the tubes are of unequal
length ; but, to simplify the algebra. in the following the tubes
will be taken of equal length and of equal sectional area.

 a range of about 3°C. per week. The lower compartment
 contained a solution of copper sulphate holding 0'0506 of
 copper to the 0.0. At intervals of a week the upper com

 compartment was renewed with fresh solution. The tubes
 were originally full of pure water. The average temperature
 was about 8° C.      By the end of the <U+FB01>rst week 0'0026 gram

     To diminish the variations of temperature, in one experiment
 the whole apparatus was put inside a copper cylinder; but,
 unfortunately, some air-bubbles were accidentally allowed to
 form within the compartments, and the quantities of copper
 sulphate transmitted were irregular and of large value.        At
 present the author is experimenting with the tubes full of
 a weak gelatine jelly, with the intention, ultimately, of
 stopping each tube with a short plug of jelly, and thus pre
 venting circulations of all sorts. The plugs will probably be
 made insoluble with formaldehyde. Mr. Hibbert has helped
 me with the analyses, and the results are hopeful; but, as
 already indicated, progress is inevitably slow.

    to Changes of Temperature and Magnetization; and a
   further Application of the same Method to the Study of the
    Change in Dimensions of Iron and Steel Wires by May

    Trinity College, Cambridge *.
 MUCH work has been done with the object of elucidating
          the relation between temperature and elasticity, and
more remains to be done.
    The problem presents many di<U+FB01>iculties, not a few of which
arise from the fact that it is not easy to maintain ata constant
temperature, more or less high, a suf<U+FB01>cient length of the
material under investigation. Again, very slight di<U+FB02>‘orenees
of temperature between the wire undergoing traction and the
scale on which the alteration of length is measured may easily
lead to erroneous results.
   These di<U+FB02>iculties may be lessened by having the length of
wire small; but this involves the necessity of some means of
measuring accurately very small changes of length; inter
ference supplies such a means. In the present work it has
not been found necessary to go to a higher order of accuracy
than 110 of the distance between successive interference-bands
of sodium light, which represents a length ol'about '000003 cm.,
           " Communicated by Prof. J. J. Thomson, RRS.

  540    Mr. G. A. Shakespear on an Interference-Method for
  though if required there would be little dif<U+FB01>culty in reading to
  '0000003 cm.
     In measuring by interference the relative displacement of
  two points it is necessary that these points should be connected
  each with a plane surface, and that during the displacement
  these two surfaces should remain' parallel to each other and
  sensibly perpendicular to the direction ofdisplacement. Inter
  ference-bands are produced between these two surfaces, and
  any relative tilting would alter the nature of the bands;
  besides, in case of such a tilt the displacement would clearly
  be different for different parts of the surfaces.
     In the earlier experiments the author used a single rod of
  the substance (glass in the <U+FB01>rst place, iron and bronze later),
  and the extension was measured between one point near the
  upper end of the rod and another near the lower end, the rod
  being suspended vertically. To the upper point a clip was
  attached from which depended a rod of the same material as
  that underinvestigation, which supported at its lower extremity
  a right-angled glass prism with one of the equal faces hori
  zontal and parallel to a plane glass plate, which latter was
  borne on levelling-screws on a table carried by a second clip
  at the lower end of the stretched rod. The points of suspension
  of the rod and of the stretching-weight were arranged so as
  to be in the axis of the rod (see <U+FB01>g. 1); but in spite of all
- precautions (though rods were made specially, and        Fig_1_
  as nearly true as possible) it was found that on the
  application of the stretching-force a relative tilt
  was produced between prism and mirror, and the
  centre of the interference-rings was thrown out of
  the <U+FB01>eld.
     The reason seemed to be the existence of a slight
  curvature in the rod which was changed by stretching.
     The following form of apparatus was then de
  vised :—
     Three wires were used, and these were suspended
  from a horizontally <U+FB01>xed disk of gun-metal, and
  their lower ends supported a similar disk. Each
  wire had a T-piece <U+FB01>xed to each end, and these
  T-pieces moved each in a radial slot in one or
  other of the disks, the three slots in each disk being
  at angles of 120° with each other, and by means of radial
  adjusting-screws these T-pieces could be adjusted at any
  desired distance from the centres of the disks. Suppose,
  now (<U+FB01>g. 2), the wires are of equal length and the disks
  parallel; if on application of the stretching-force they are
  displaced from parallelism, it is clear that one of the wires

       the Investigation of Young’s Modulus for Wires.        541
(a, in <U+FB01>g.) has stretched more than the others, i. e. that
that wire has had more than its share of the          Fig, 2_
weight. To remedy this the upper and
lower ends of b and c are moved along their
respective slots towards the centre, and thus
get more of the stretching-force which is
a plied at the centre of the lower disk, while
the upper disk is also suspended centrally.
In this way it is easy to adjust the three wires
so that, on stretching, the two disks move
parallel to each other; and if a rod bearing
the prism be suspended from the top disk
and the mirror on its levelling-screws be set
on the bottom one, the centre of the inter
ference-rings, having been got into the field,
will remain there throughout the extension,
and the number of bands passing any <U+FB01>xed point in the <U+FB01>eld
will give the amount of extension in half-wave-lengths of the
light used.
   In such an arrangement the bending of the disks under the
stress would be superposed on the displacement due to
stretching of the wires, and in addition any slipping of the
wires in the clamps of the T-pieces would affect the observed
extension. To obviate any such “end effects” two thinner
disks of brass, each with three radial slits just wide enough to >
admit free passage of the wire, were supported, one near the
upper end of the wires and the other near the lower end, each
on three clips, which had sharp edges to their hemispherical
heads so that the wires should be clipped at well-de<U+FB01>ned
points. From the upper of these the                 Fig 3'
prism-rod hung centrally, and on the
lower the mirror rested on three pegs          “Agata-<U+FB02>—
attached to springs by means of which                  H
the levellin -screws could give <U+FB01>ne ad
justment.     he coarse adjustment was
made by two screws on the prism-rod
which moved the prism in altitude in
two vertical planes at right angles. The
prism- late and mirror—plate were ad
justed orizontally when the clips were
put on. Fig. 3 shows a diagrammatic
section of the apparatus.
   Stretching-Force.—It was necessary
that the stretching-force should be ap
plied gradually and without vibration.
This end was attained by making a hollow cylinder of tin

 542    Mr. G. A. Sliakcspear on an Interference-Methodfor
 plate with conical ends. At- the upper apex a steel hook
 <U+FB01>tted into a screw-stopper of brass; from the lower apex
 hung a stout brass wire which bore four vanes (<U+FB01>g. 4).
 The whole hung freely in a cylindrical vessel of tin-plate,
 and down one side of this vessel passed a tube which
 opened downwards in the middle of                Fig 4
 the bottom. When the outer vessel                  °' '
 is <U+FB01>lled with water up to the level of
 the suspending hook the weight hanging
 on the wire depends on the amount of
 shot placed in the cylinder (by way of
 adjustable weight). By siphoning out
 through the tube the water from the
 outer vessel until the level falls to the
lower wire (lower dotted line in <U+FB01>g. 4),
a weight equal to that of the water dis
placed by the cylinder is applied gra—
dually without vibrations. The object
of the conical ends is to ensure that the
application or removal of the force is
begun gradually and without jerk, so
that the eye has no ditiiculty in observing
the movement of the fringes from the outset. (The sudden
making or breaking of the surface of the water over a <U+FB02>at
end sets up perilous vibrations. A similar method which
was abandoned in favour of this was the use of a true cylinder
suspended in water contained in another concentric cylinder,
and the weight applied was get by measuring the fall of water
in the outer vessel.)
    The vanes are to damp vibrations when the water is at the
lower level. An indiarubber tube from the outer vessel led
to a tap, whereby the <U+FB02>ow of water could be regulated, and
from the tap another length of tube passed to a bucket into
which the water <U+FB02>owed; by raising this bucket the water
could be siphoned back again and the contraction of the wire
observed.
    Vibrations—These gave much trouble at <U+FB01>rst, and necessi
tated night work. With a view to eliminating this trouble, the
work was done in a cellar at the Cavendish Laboratory, and
from the <U+FB02>oor two piers of masonry were built up ; on these
stood a massive stand of cast iron (weighing about 3 cwt.) on
iudiarubber blocks. On the top of this stand (part of
which can be seen in <U+FB01>g. 5) a thick disk of cast iron was
supported on three levelling-bolts which rested in three V
grooves. From the centre of this disk a one-inch steel rod
passed down through the top of the stand and supported the

 544 Mr. G. A. Shakespear on an Interference-Method for
apparatus, by means of a central bolt. After this the vibra
tions seemed as bad as when the apparatus was suspended
from a wall-bracket, but the addition of two half-hundred
weights to the stand, and supporting the weight~tank on
indiarubber blocks, improved matters, and the further
addition to the lower stretching-disk of three vanes which
dipped into dash-pots of oil practically removed the trouble,
and now, although heavy tra<U+FB01>ic in the street occasionally
causes disturbances, vibrations are so rapidly damped as not
to interfere with work.
    The apparatus was <U+FB01>rst used to test the modulus of some
copper wire (g inch diam.) specially drawn straight (by Messrs.
Glover of Salford), and loaded with varying initial loads,
beginning with an initial load of 2791 grins. for the three
wires—2'. e. about Th of the estimated breaking-weight—and
proceeding with successive additions of 2 kilos. About twenty
observations were made at each stage, the weight producing
the extension observed being always the same. It may be
remarked here that the stretching-weight above described was
standardized by weighing the cylinder directly (on Prof.
Poynting’s large balance which was kindly put at my disposal)
when the water was respectively at the upper and lower levels
above mentioned, the temperature of the water being noted.
The difference between these weights (at 15°C.) was 5989'50
grms.
    The result of this set of observations is indicated in the
curve <U+FB01>g. 6), in which the modulus is the ordinate and the
initial load the abscissa. The modulus began at 8-24x10“
 (0. G. s.) and gradually increased for successive increments of
initial load until for an initial load of 111,- of breaking-weight
it reached the value 1'053 x 101*, after which it settled down
and the curve became sensibly parallel to the load axis as far
as the experiments went. On reducing the initial loads again
the curve practically went back the same way as it came.
Perhaps experiments of' this kind may throw light on the
discrepancies found by W'ertheim between values of the
modulus obtained by different methods. It may be pointed out
that if the wires were slightly curved, some such effect as that
just described might be expected.
    Heatz'ng.—This was a matter of some dif<U+FB01>cult '. Stirring
was inadmissible on account of vibrations,             ence water
could not be used. Heating by means of a current of
electricity through the wires themselves was out of the ques
tion ; for (l) the current itself apparently affects the elasticity,
and (2) the heating would tend to be patchy owing to
differences in radiating power of different parts of the surface

      enclosed in a chamber of thick copper, and heating was
      attempted by means of a <U+FB02>at platinum coil at the bottom, but
      this was unsatisfactory and was abandoned—probably on
      account of convection-currents.

 hole, that in D, for the suspending bolt and that in D5 for the
 hook which supports the weight. In each slot slides a movable

 piece inch long, and of section shown in <U+FB01>g. 9,'with two holes

 screw ; into the smaller one an end of the wire to be tested
 <U+FB01>ts (bent at right angles), and is clamped there by a brass
 clamp (a, <U+FB01>g. 7) <U+FB01>tting over the free part of the sliding-piece.
 The head (<U+FB01>g. 10) of the radial screw is squared to <U+FB01>t a clock
 key and has also a pulley-groove in it ; into this groove, when
 the sliding-piece is in position, the hinged piece of <U+FB02>at brass,
 shown in <U+FB01>g. 8, <U+FB01>ts and is then secured by the small screw
 shown on the other side of the slot. In this way the radial
 screw, unable to move backwards or forwards, is able to move
 the sliding-piece along the slot.
    Next below this comes the prism-suspending disk D2, with
 three narrow radial slits just wide enough to admit No. 20
 B.W.G. wire freely ; this is supported on the three upper
 clips. Each clip is made of brass with a hemispherical head
 of steel, the latter consisting of two sharp-edged jaws which
can be screwed together (two of these clips are shown in
 position on wire in <U+FB01>g. 7, bb).
    Near each of these radial slits in D, is a small hole into
which a screw from the edge passes. From these holes pass
wires of the same material as that under investigation, to
support D3 on which the prism-stand itself rests. D3 has three
large notches in its edge, and through these rise, without
touching, the pillars from 1),, which bear vanes (one of which
is shown in position in D4, 0, <U+FB01>g. 7) to dip into three corre
sponding dash-pots which stand on D3. Near the centre of D3
are three large holes to admit, without contact, the three
levelling-pegs of D4, on which the mirror rests. The prism
stand (f, <U+FB01>g. 7) carries the prism over the surface of the
mirror (g), and is provided with three levelling-screws as feet
for coarse adjustment. 1),, is the mirror-plate with three radial

                             Fig. I].
the washer bears a peg for the support of the mirror; and
under the point of the spring rises the levelling-screw, by
moving which up or down the peg itself is very slightly
raised or lowered. These levelling-screws are long and are
surrounded below the plate for about half their length by
brass tubes (see <U+FB01>g. 7) which when the instrument is in use
pass freely through the large holes near the edge of D5 and
dip into annular troughs on the upper side of the lower box
of the vapour-jacket (see diagramatic section <U+FB01>g. 12), while
the screws themselves pass out through the box.
                             Fig. 12.
   The troughs are <U+FB01>lled with oil into which the ends of the
tubes dip. The object of these oil-joints is to allow of free
communication with the exterior, while at the same time
preventing any in<U+FB02>ux of cold air, without impeding the free
movement of the disks when the wires are stretched. The
weight-supporting hook from the middle of D5 passes out
through a similar oil-joint. (Fig. 12 will make clear the
relations of these  arts.)  It must be observed that D», and D4
are quite inde en ent of each other, their only connexion being
by means of t e dash-pots, no metallic contact existing. The

vane-pillars are bolted to D4, and at their upper ends are screws
for the attachment of the cylindrical vanes.       A dash-pot is
shown at h, <U+FB01>g. 7.
   The vapour-jacket is in two parts, an inner and an outer.
The inner consists of two <U+FB02>at cylindrical boxes lying hori
zontally, and vertically underneath one another, connected by
three vertical tubes.   The top box is pierced by three tubu
lures for the thermometers, the bottom one has four for
levelling-screws and wei ht-hook. There is a large inlet
for vapour at the top of the upper box, and an outlet at the
bottom of the lower box. The steel supporting-rod extends
through a tube in the centre of the upper box (on to a felt
washer), and D1 is bolted <U+FB01>rmly to it and against the lower
face of the upper box (see <U+FB01>g. 13). An annular trough
                              Fig. 13.
round the edge of this box receives a <U+FB02>ange from the upper
extremity of the outer part of the vapour-jacket, and a little
oil makes the joint draught-proof.
   The outer part of the jacket is simply a pair of concentric
cylinders of brass, with an inlet at top and outlet at bottom,
the annular space being closed in at both ends. The inner
cylinder projects at its base in a <U+FB02>an e, which di s into a
trough on the outer edge of the lower <U+FB01>at box. T ere is a
double window of glass, at a suitable height, through the
outer jacket to allow of viewing the bands in the prism.
When in use the jacket is covered with felt. In putting in
fresh wires the outer jacket is raised, as in <U+FB01>g. 5, coarse
adjustments are made, and the bands got to a good clear
state, and then the outer jacket is lowered again into position.
   From the boiler a pipe passes to the inlets of the two parts
of the jacket, and from the outlets another pipe passes
through a condenser to the boiler, giving of? below the con
denser a small tube, which is connected with a manometer,
air-reservoir (a glass bottle of about 2 gallons capacity), and
water-pump.

with these indiarubber joints, the nature of which is shown
 diagrammatically in <U+FB01>g. 14.
    Even so, after the water had been boiling for some hours,
 the “bumping” caused vibrations, but this was stopped by
 putting into the water some fragments of pumice.
    By adjusting the pressure by means of the water-pump
 the water was boiled at ditthrent temperatures between 45° U.
 and 100° (L, and the apparatus was kept at constant tem
 perature within the jacket for any length of time, at least the
 three thermometers remained stationary. For lower tem—
 peratures alcohol serves. At present little use has been made
 of intermediate temperatures, as the results of observations at
 13° C. and 100° C. respectively have given so much material
 for consideration.
    The source of light is a sodium <U+FB02>ame placed behind an
 aperture in a screen at the focus of a convex lens; the
parallel beam thus obtained is re<U+FB02>ected by a mirror at an
angle of 45° into the prism, and through an aperture in the
 silvering of this mirror the fringes are viewed along the path
of the incident light. The lower of the two equal faces of
the prism is half-silvered, and is adjusted about '25 mm.
above and parallel to the fully-silvered upper surface of a
gjass plane ; both plane and prism were specially worked by
   ilger. Between the light from these two silvered surfaces
the interference is effected, part of the pencil of light being
re<U+FB02>ected from the lower face of the prism and part from the
upper face of the mirror, the relative retardation depending
on their distance apart.
   Results.—We may now consider the results of some of the
observations on (1) copper,        soft iron, (3) “silver” steel,
and (4) hard brass.

550      Mr. G. A. Shakespear on an Interference-Method for
will be unnecessary to give the actual modulus in each case,
but the <U+FB01>gures denoting the extension or contraction in half
wave-lengths of sodium light will be quoted where necessary.
The length of wire used is about 28 cm. (28'15 to 2830 for
different specimens), diameter about '075 cm. ('0690 to '0810).
It must be understood that the weight applied in all cases is
the same.
    In all cases the e<U+FB01>'ect of putting on and removing the
weight, and of raising the temperature and letting it fall
again, has been to increase the modulus, i.e., the observed
extension is always greater at the beginning of operations
on any specimen than it is at the end. As examples : a
specimen of copper at the beginning showed an extension of
317 bands, whereas at the end of the series of observations
the elongation for the same load had settled down to be
constantly only 279—an increase of about 12 per cent. in the
modulus. Similar <U+FB01>gures for a specimen of soft iron are
 178'6 and 175-9, say an increase of 1'5 per cent. A specimen
 of silver-steel gave 149'1, falling to 143'7, or an increase of
 3'6 per cent. A specimen of brass gave 315-3 to 293'7, or
 an increase of 6'8 per cent.
    In all cases the change of modulus produced by change of
temperature from 13° to 100° showed much variation at
 <U+FB01>rst, the e<U+FB01>'ect of the <U+FB01>rst heating being that the modulus
 was greater at the higher temperature than at the lower, but
 after this an increase of temperature decreased the modulus.
    The following are some characteristic <U+FB01>gures for a specimen
 of copper :—

                   292'8
    Hence in all cases the <U+FB01>nal value of the modulus was lower
 for the higher temperature than for the lower: viz. 3'6 per cent.
 for copper, 1'6 per cent. for iron, 3'2 per cent. for steel, and
 3 per cent. for ard brass. It is interesting to note that, with
 the exception of the brass, these <U+FB01>gures are in the same order
 as those given above for the increase of elasticity from
 be inning to end of observations on each specimen.
     n almost all cases after any change of temperature, or after
a rest (of any time more than half an hour, say), the <U+FB01>rst
 observation of the series showed an amount of elongation
different from those given by succeeding observations of the
same series, the <U+FB01>rst elongation generally being greater than
those succeeding.                                                   _

552      Mr. G. A. Shakespear on an Interference-Method for
    Another e<U+FB01>'ect to be noticed is that, in the case of steel and
brass at least, after the weight had been left on for some hours,
in the succeeding observations the “ up ” numbers (2'. e. con
traction on removing load) exceeded the “down” numbers
 (i. e. extension on putting on load), and after the weight had
been left off for a length of time the “ down ” numbers were
greater than the “ up,” as though in the former case the wires
were gradually recovering and in the latter case gradually
 yielding slightly. It may he remarked here that no gradual
   ielding was observable when the load was kept on. (The
  oad was about 2 kilos to each No. 20 B.W.G. wire.) In the
 case of copper the “ up ” readings showed a tendency to be
 greater than the “ down ” throughout. No such tendency
 was observed either way in the soft iron.
     If the weight was left on for some time the modulus was, in
 general, temporarily a<U+FB01>'ected—decreased in the case of copper,
 increased in iron ; but in the latter metal if the load was left
 on at 100° C. for several hours and then observations made,
 and a rest of about half an hour allowed with the weight 011',
 on resuming observations there seemed to be a tendency, after
 the <U+FB01>rst two or three extensions, to a sudden decrease of the
 modulus of about 1 per cent. (this occurred on several occa
  sions). Generally, at each change of temperature eight or
 ten observations were made, of which the above quoted <U+FB01>gures
 are examples.
     During the delay caused by waiting for the construction of
  the heating-apparatus, some experiments were made on various
  magnetic e<U+FB01>'ects on iron wires. The form of apparatus above
  described was modi<U+FB01>ed for the purpose. Three similar solenoids
  were made, one for each of the three wires, and an electric
  current was sent through them in series.
     Observations on the effect of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld on the elasti
  city were not quite satisfactory (these are being repeated under
  more favourable conditions at the present time); there seemed,
  however, to be an undoubted decrease in the modulus on
  putting on the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
     Other experiments were made, at some length, on' the
  changes in length produced by magnetization in iron and
  steel wires under different stresses.
     For these experiments the wires were 75 cm. long, and
  the solenoids extended all their length. The number of turns
  in each solenoid was 13th and the resistance 1'21 ohm ;
  a current of one ampere would thus produce a <U+FB01>eld of
  about 23 C.G.S. units. The interference-bands in this case
  were
  by     got by
      a tube       the upperlight

        the Inrestz'gation of Young’s Modulus for Wires.       553
   The solenoids were wound on brass tubes, down the centre of
each of which passed a concentric inner tube, leaving an air
space of about 4 mm. all round, and the wires examined passed
along the axes of these inner tubes ; this was to reduce the
effect of heating due to the current in the solenoid, and in
addition air was constantly pumped through this space.
   The current was started at practically O (by a potentiometer
method), and rapidly increased to 2 amperes ; then reduced to
0, reversed, and taken up to 2 amperes again and returned to
0, completing a cycle.
   In general, for iron wires with only a small load, the <U+FB01>rst
effect was a contraction, followed by an expansion as far as the
current was increased (1'. e. up to 2 amperes) ; on decreasing the
current a further lengthening took place, till a turning—point
was reached, and then contraction set in, and continued till
the current reached 0; after reversal the <U+FB01>rst effect was a
continued contraction, then a turning-point was passed, and
expansion ensued till the current reached a maximum, and on
decreasing the current the expansion increased until the same
turning-point as before was reached, after which there was a
contraction till the current fell to O.
   For heavy loads the effect was very different, and consisted
of a contraction till the current reached its maximum and an
expansion afterwards until the current reached 0.
   It seems somewhat strange that in the former case expan
sion should result from an increase in the <U+FB01>eld, and also from
a decrease after the current has reached a maximum, and the
idea naturally occurred that it might be due to a rise in
temperature ; that this, however, is not the case, seems to be
shown by the fact that, while elongation due to heating (by
the solenoid) can be seen to take place slowly and uniformly,
this effect on the other hand is produced immediately on
changing the current, and stops the instant the decrease or
increase of current is stopped. Moreover, on stopping the
change of current no gradual contraction was observed, so that
the effect is presumably not due to heating by Foucault currents.
The amount of this extension did not appear to depend on the
rate at which the <U+FB01>eld was changed. Hard pianoforte-steel
showed, even with small loads, a contraction on magnetization
and an elongation on reducing the <U+FB01>eld, behaving in fact very
much as heavily loaded iron.
   The following are examples of cycles taken at random from
the results of about 600 observations. The load is the actual
load in grms. which was supported by the three No. 22 B.W.G.
wires ; the current at the turning-points is given in amperes

for a cycle through t e range of <U+FB01>eld used in the abOVe
 experiments, viz., from +47 to —47 (LG. 8. units. The
ordinates are elongations of the wire expressed in half wave
 lengths of sodium light, the abscissze give the current in the

<U+FB01>eld. The continuous line is the curve for a specimen of
soft iron with a load of 3000 grms. on the three N0. 22 B.W.G.
wires; the dotted line is the curve for hard pianoforte-steel
with a load of 20,000 grms. In each case the left half of
the curve is higher than the right, which may possiblg be
due to a rise of temperature during the experiment, per aps
due to hysteresis.             Fig. 15,                          .

   The second cycle in Table B is interesting ; it shows
that for that load the wire is in a transition state, and for the
lighter loads the state of affairs is similar to that indicated in
the upper half of the cycle, while for heavier loads the type
of curve is that given by the lower half.
   It will be noticed that in the above examples the elongation
is considerably greater than the contraction, so that the net
result of a cycle is an elongation. This might be due to a
gradual rise in the temperature, owing to the heating of the
solenoids, or it might mean that the fact of reversing the

current makes the wire yield to the stress. (The apparatus
is now being modi<U+FB01>ed to avoid heating-effects, and it is hoped
that any irregularities due to that cause will be removed.)
   It seems reasonable to suppose that if the act of magneti
zation and demagnetization causes the wire to yield to the
stress, then on applying an alternating current to the solenoids
a considerable elongation would result ; this was accordingly
tried, and the immediate effect was an elongation, but as
soon as the current was stopped the wire steadily contracted
to its original state. The elongation began rapidly and then
slowed down, and <U+FB01>nally stopped, while the current was still
on. This elongation seems to have been due to the heating
effects of hysteresis, for on substituting copper wires for the
iron no such effect occurred.
   This suggested an interesting method of getting the area
of the hysteresis-loop. The alternating current is put on and
the elongation measured by counting the bands which pass.
until the latter have come to rest. Then a current (C) is
passed down the wires themselves until a steady elongation
of the same amount is produced. Then if we assume that
the energy supplied in the two cases to the wires is the same,
and we know the number of alternations per second, a suppose,
of the current in the solenoids, we can put
                      znjud1=oea=cn
wheredeI is the energy dissipated at each cycle of mag
netization, l the length of the wire, and R is the resistance of
the wires.
   The following is an actual example for soft—iron wire:—
                C=l‘2 a1np.,
                n =80,

   This neglects the heating due to Foucault currents, which
could be re luced by lamination, though the absence of such
elongation in (opper wires seems to show that the heating due
to this cause is not very considerable compared with that due
to hysteresis. (But of course in copper the Foucault heating
would be only 1 of that in iron wire.)

           LII. Denudation and Deposition.—-Part II.
       By G. Jonxsroxn S'roxsr, J[.A., I).Sc., F.R.S.*
1.    N the May number of the Philosophical Magazine Dr.
         Charles Chree comments upon a paper in the preceding
number, in which the present writer suggested that Dcnuda
tion and Deposition have probably taken a large part in
increasing and rendering permanent the elevations on land
and some of the depressions in the ocean which are found to
prevail over the earth.    In reply to Dr. Uhree’s criticisms it
seems suf<U+FB01>cient to call attention to the facts of nature with
which we have to deal, distinguishing those about which we
are justi<U+FB01>ed in feeling con<U+FB01>dent from others of which we can
only affirm that they are probably what we suppose them to
be.    To emphasize this distinction, the qualifying terms
certain and probable will in the following paragraphs be
applied to such facts of nature, or supposed facts, as we have
occasion to refer to. It will thus be seen that our information
about the compressibility of the earth is dependent almost
exclusively upon the known facts.
   2. It seems certain that the volume of a body of any given
material when it is compressed equally in all directions,
de ends, so long as it does not undergo a change of state,
only on the temperature and pressure : that in fact,
                           v =fits P),
where v is its volume,t its temperature, and p the surface
pressure to which it is exposed. The body is supposed to be
of such moderate size, that the variations of pressure arising
from gravity need not be taken into account. From this
expression we obtain the following expression for /c, the coef<U+FB01>
cient of compressibility when the body is subjected to a small
increase of pressure without changing its temperature—
                         __B_v_ I
                        k_ a!) “f (t: P):
where f’ is that function of t and p which is got by keeping
t constant and differentiating f by p only.       We thus 5%
that for each kind of material the coe<U+FB01>cient of compressibility
is a function of the temperature and pressure.
   3. The circumstance that the mean density of the earth is
only about 515 times that of water, which we may take as
certain, supplies us with information which has signi<U+FB01>cance
in our inquiry.     The so-called solid part of the earth, by
which is to be understood the earth minus its atmosphere and
                   * Communicated by the Author.

 558    Dr. G. J. Stoney 0n Denudation and Deposition.
 ocean, certainly consists of super<U+FB01>cial layers which are almost
 exclusively oxygen salts, and of a great underlying centro
 sphere about which we know little. The oxygen salts have,
 at the surface of the earth, densities which range between
 two and three times that of water, and in forming them, along
 with that liquid oxygen salt which we call the ocean, nearly
 all the oxygen upon the earth is certainly used up.    In proof
 of this statement see the paper on p. 565 of this number of
 the Phil. Mag., from which it appears that the free oxygen is
 certainly an exceedingly small proportion of the earth’s stock
 of oxygen, probably much less than a ten-thousandth part.
 It is further probable that the whole would now be used up
in forming the oxygen salts, were it not for the ease with
which heat and chemical agencies evolve carbon dioxide from
the carbonates, and the fact that the energy that reaches
the earth from the sun enables vegetation to evolve free
oxygen over the earth’s surface from the carbon dioxide so
produced. This enables a very small proportion of the whole
stock of oxygen to present itself at any one time as free
oxygen in contact with the outer boundary of the lithosphere.
From these considerations joined with others, it seems
probable that the oxygen salts form only a super<U+FB01>cial crust
“perhaps having a thickness something like ill-0- 0f the
earth’s radius—over a relatively vast mass of deeper-seated
materials, which probably are not oxygen salts. In fact it is
probable that the great interior of the earth is for the most
part something intermediate between an alloy of various
metals and a mixture of them; whence it is probable that
the materials of which it consists would, if those materials
were brought to standard temperature and pressure, have an
average density more than twice that of the layer of oxygen
salts. They are, however, far from being at either standard
temperature or pressure.     What is certain about them is that
these materials are such and so circumstanced that the mean
density of the earth is little more than twice that of the <U+FB01>lm
of oxygen salts over its surface. The more deeply-seated
materials are certainly compressed by enormous pressures
increasing downwards, and are also as certainly so dilated by
the temperatures to which they are exposed, that notwith
standing the extreme intensity of the compressions, the
counteracting expansions are great enough to bring down
the average of all the densities to the very low value of 5‘5
times the density of water.
   4. Another fact which I think we may regard as certainly
known, is that wherever there prevail between and within
the molecules of a body those active motions the energy of

        Dr. G. J. Stoney 0n Denndulion and Deposition.              559
which we call heat, there the material in which these move
ments can take place is compressible; in the sense that if
already compressed it will yield to any extra pressure great
or small tending to further reduce its bulk. We also seem
to know with certainty (as I think, and notwithstanding
what Dr. Chree has urged) that it is elastic also, that is
that if relieved of a part of the pressure it will recm'er its
pristine volume, provided that the temperature is kept from
changing; and when Dr. Chrce speaks of great pressure as
“killing the elasticity” he has perhaps not taken into
account the necessary dynamical consequence, which is that
the density would in that case increase without limit as time
goes on.
    5. In paragraph          we had occasion to speak of the so
called solid part of the earth. This is because the earth is far
from being solid in the sense attributed to that term in
physical laboratories or by the mathematicians to whose
investigations respecting elasticity Dr. Chree refers. If we
desire to represent the earth on a small scale and within the
brief duration of a laboratory experiment, it will in the <U+FB01>rst
place be necessary to substitute for a solid material something
very much more plastic; nor will it be easy to <U+FB01>nd a material
which will represent, within the brief duration of human
experiments, the kind of plasticity by means of which nature
slowly carries on her work during the lapse of geological
ages—a plasticity which causes the several parts of the
earth to yield to pressures however feeble when time enough
is allowed, but where they yield so imperceptibly, even under
great pressures, that a sustained‘ force is at any one time
transmitted across any part of the earth with almost the
de<U+FB01>niteness as regards its direction with which it would be
transmitted by a theoretically rigid body. Accordingly
when the earth is described as being plastic, what is to be
understood is that the materials of which it is made up yield
to any stresses tending to change their form,             these stresses
continue in action for su<U+FB01>ciently long periods of time. The
yielding seems mainly to consist in slips, which sometimes
take place abruptly and on a molar scale by the small starts
which occur when there are earthquakes or during volcanic
eruptions; but usually they are molecular readjustments,
acting without breach of continuity, and very slowly, both on
a large and on a small scale. Some of the results on a small
scale are familiar to us as foldings in strata and such like
   'F By a sustained force is meant one so gradually applied and so long
maintained that it does not produce appreciable waves within the
earth.

phenomena ; which are most conspicuous in the older forma
tions where the stresses that produced them may have been
in operation for enormous periods of time. I have seen a
 slab of white marble which formed the lintel of a very old
chimney-piece that had so far yielded in less than a single
century to the small stress produced by its own weight,
 aided by the alternate beatings and coolings to which it had
 been subjected, that it had become bent until it was lower
 by almost an inch in the middle than at the ends. The
length of the slab, so far as I can recollect, was about four
 feet, its width about <U+FB01>ve inches, and its thickness about
 it of an inch. There does not seem to be any solid material
known to us in which there is not some plasticity of this
kind—if bent, the molecular and intra-molecular motions
that are ever going on accommodate themselves in some few
instances to the new state of things ; and though the cases in
which this happens may be very few compared with the
whole number of molecular motions going on, every such
accommodation when once effected is a step towards the body’s
assuming, in the long run, its new strained form. In a body
like white marble, which is a congeries of small crystals, this
accommodation may perhaps take place with most facility as
molecular slips parallel to the planes of cleavage or along the
junctions between crystals. In non-crystalline rocks, which
are a more irregular jumble of materials, the new adjustment
probably occurs with more facility in the positions of partial
discontinuity ; while in slaty rocks it seems to have operated
chie<U+FB02>y along the planes of cleavage, as well as (on a molar
scale, as in all strati<U+FB01>ed rocks) throughout the looser material
which is interposed between the strata. The slips which
bring about the adjustment assume their largest proportions
when they take the form of geological “faults,” the pro
duction of each of which is accompanied by an earthquake.
    6. Whether we are right in supposing that the adjustments
operate with most e<U+FB01>'ect in the situations indicated above, what
is certain is that plasticity has brought about, after the lapse
of geological ages, changes of form in the parts of the solid
earth exposed to our view, which are accompanied by bendings
vastly more curved than those required for the movements on
a great scale which are everywhere going on within the earth;
which force us to recognize that the earth though elastic
(Le. resilient) as regards its volume is not quite elastic as
regards its form.     That this is the case seems certain.
    7. If I understand Dr. Ohree aright, he regards as incredible
any hypothesis which would imply that the earth, owing to its
elasticity, would expand from its present size, which is a globe

        Dr. G. J. Stoney on Denudalion and Deposition.         561
about 8000 miles across, to one of 12,000 miles in diameter, if
the mutual gravitation of its parts were to cease, and if (which
is a further necessary condition) that great amount of energy
were imparted to it which would enable its several portions
while expanding to retain the same temperatures which they
have in their present compressed condition. Now, it is certain
that under the circumstances supposed the earth would expand;
and I see nothing antecedently improbable in the expansion
having the amount which Dr. Chree thinks incredible, or one
larger than it, or smaller. It is to be observed, however, that
no authority attaches to the amount of expansion arrived at by
Dr. Chree’s mode of applying my provisional hypothesis, since
he has taken no account of the fact that coetiicients of expansion
are functions of both t and 12, as is shown above in paragraph 2,
and that accordingly, if the temperatures are kept constant, the
average value of these coetiicients within the earth will vary
 with the pressures, and therefore change as the expansion
 goes on.
    8. Dr.(th1'ee’s comments have left me under theimpressiou
 that he conceives that l infer what has occurred geologically
 from a value of the average elasticity assumed beforehand ;
 whereas the process I have attempted to follow is the converse
 of this. I infer the average coetiicient of compressibility from
 the observed farts Off/18010.91] ; and I endeavour to show in my
 paper that the value so inferred, or something near it, must
 be the true value of this constant, if the compressions and
_expansi0ns undergone by portions of the earth when loaded or
 relieved from load have been a machinery by the instrumen
 tality of which nature has for ages been engaged in slowly
  augmenting the inequalities of the earth’s surface.
     9. It is from a consideration of the facts of geology, and
 especially of those under the ocean, that we can deduce the
  most definite estimate of what the average coef<U+FB01>cient of com
 pressibility of the earth must be to produce the observed
 effects. A careful study I gave to this subject many years
  ago led me to form the opinion that all the geological data
  I could then collect—terrestrial and oceanic—point to the
  conclusion that if a layer of material of twice the density
  of water were uniformly spread over any large portion of the
  land-surface of the earth, the new surface would (after the
  lapse of a suf<U+FB01>cient time, and unless counteract-ing agencies
  are in operation) be nearly at the same level as the old. And,
  further, that the condensations and other movements within the
  earth, to which the slow imposition of this deposit would give
  rise, are of a sa<U+FB01>cz'ently reversible character to enable the
  surface to resume nearly its original position if the deposit

  562    Dr. G. J. ,Stoney on Denudation and Deposition.
 were gradually removed. It follows from this, that a heavier
 deposit would cause the new surface to be lower than the old
 had been, and that by the imposition of a deposit of less
  speci<U+FB01>c gravity the surface would be raised. The reverse of
  these effects would take place on the removal of a super<U+FB01>cial
 layer. The observations seemed also to show that the size of
 the loaded area, provided it exceeds a certain limit of size,
 makes little difference in the effect. From this we may infer
  that the plasticity of the earth acts in such a manner that the
  loading of a large area produces for a limited time (which,
  however, is probably many millions of years) nearly the same
  compression of the portion of the earth between it and the
 centre, as an equal loading of the whole surface of the earth
 would produce upon the whole volume of the earth. If
 we may assume this, we <U+FB01>nd that the earth’s average
  coef<U+FB01>cient of compressibility has the value 1 assigned to
 it, viz. about the same as the coef<U+FB01>cient of compressibility
 of glass.
    10. It is, however, of no particular importance whether this
 estimate is correct. What is of importance and at the same
  time certain is that the compressibility of the materials of
 which the earth consists and their plasticity operate in such
 wise that a uniform pressure, great or small, over a large part
 of the surface (if applied so gradually as to avoid generating
 earth-waves, and also so as to give time for the plasticity to
 act) will inevitably cause the surface to which the pressure is
 applied to descend, except in those situations at which other
 counteracting movements are going on. And, contrariwise,
 a relief of pressure over a large part of the earth will of
 necessity cause the smface from which the pressure is taken of,
to rise, unless prevented by interfering agencies. These
 qualitative results are certain.
    11. As to what their quantitative value is, this must be
ascertained by observation of the apparent elevations and
depressions, since we do not possess the means of <U+FB01>xing
a priori either the average coef<U+FB01>cient of compressibility or the
degree and kind of the earth’s complex plasticity. As already
stated, a comprehensive survey of the geological evidence
seemed to show that the compressil'iility and the plasticity are
such that the limiting speci<U+FB01>c gravity of matter which leaves
the level unchanged when it is deposited on or removed from
the land-surface of the earth, is nearly 2, probablya little less
than 2. In other words, either the spreading of a layer of
lighter material over a suf<U+FB01>ciently wide expanse of the earth’s
land-surface, or the removal of a layer of heavier material,
will bring the new surface to a higher level than the old;
provided always that other agencies, such as deep-seated

         Dr. G. J. Stoney on Demulalion and Deposition.       563
movements within the earth, do not interfere.         In the case
of submarine deposits they must, being buoyed up by the
water, have a speci<U+FB01>c gravity either approaching or ex
ceeding 3, to be competent to occasion a deepening of the
ocean. If the deposit has less speci<U+FB01>c gravity it tends to
make the ocean shallower. The general result is that denu
dation everywhere tends to make the land part of the surface
 of the earth to rise, inasmuch as denudation always removes
matter with a s )eci<U+FB01>c gravity greater than 2 ; whereas under
water some oft e deposits tend to make the ocean deeper and
 others tend to make it shallower.
     12. Some of the events to be accounted for are the fol
 lowing :—The surface of the solid earth partly projects above
 the ocean in the form of continents and is partly submerged.
 Denudation has been going on for eyes orcr those parts that
project ; while deposition of heavy materials (sec ‘Challenger ’
 Report) has with equal persistcncy been going on over pre
 cisely those portions of the <U+FB02>oor of the ocean which are in the
 <U+FB01>resenl day the most subnm'gca'. Not only so, but denudation
    as, as a rule, been going on for ages more rapidly orer the
 parts which are now the most eleratcd above the sea, and less
 rapidly over the parts which are less elevated. What I desire
 to insist on, and what I think has been proved and is certain,
  is that it is physically possible that what were originally less
  elevations and depressions may have been intensi<U+FB01>ed as time
 went on, by the denudations and depositions which have
  invariably accompanied them; and I venture to express the
  opinion that it is largely through this agency (in fact every
  where except where it has been counteracted by other factors)
  that the elevations and depressions which we now <U+FB01>nd upon
  the earth, have attained their present magnitude. lf Dr. (.‘hree
  will wei h the fact that this is physically possible, he will
  hardly T think continue to maintain the paradox that the
   elevations and depressions have become what they now are,
   not in consequence of the agencies we <U+FB01>nd persistently in
   operation, but in spite of them.
      13. In his <U+FB01>rst para raph, p. 494, Dr. Chree describes it
   as “legitimate to hold t at the deep-seated material has had
   its elasticity, so to speak, ‘killed’ under the enormous pres
   sure to which it is exposed ” ; and in his third paragraph he
   gives as his opinion that the only satisfactory alternative “ is
   to treat the earth as incompressible, or very nearly incom
   pressible, throughout all but the surface strata.” Of these
   alternatives I have endeavoured to show in paragraph 4 of the
   present paper, that the former is physically impossible, and
    in paragraphs 3 and 4 that there is no presumption in favour
    of the second alternative.

564      Dr. G. J. Stoney on Denudation and Deposition.
    14. Finally, Dr. Chree thinks that the result arrived at by
calculating the amount of strain produced by applying a
normal force at one point of a plane bounding a theoretically
in<U+FB01>nite elastic solid, devoid of plasticity and without weight,
would give “a much better idea ” than my method "' of the
order of magnitude of the elastic effects due to denudation
and deposition ” in the cases where the loaded area is limited
to some few thousands of square miles [say where it is an
area from 30 to 100 miles across]. Before this view can be
admitted, Dr. Chree will have to show that a force applied
at a point of the supposed surface would produce anything
like the same dynamical etfect as a pressure applied over an
area so extensive that it behaves ‘dynamically somewhat like
the upper surface of a girder from 30 to 100 miles in length.
He will also have to <U+FB01>nd some mass of nonwolcanic mountains
of this extent, which stand upon materials devoid of the plas
ticity, and not accompanied by the geological “ faults,” which
tend to isolate such mountain ranges and their “Hinterland”
from the neighbouring parts of the earth. My own obser
vations lead me to suppose that no such case can be found.
    15. On the whole, it does not appear to me that Dr. Chree’s
criticisms have shaken any of the positions that I ventured to
put forward.
    16. To put the whole matter brie<U+FB02>y :—-What I submit as
the outcome of a careful inquiry may be summarized as
follows—\Vhenever through the operation of any cause one
of the existing continents emerged however little above the
waters, denudation at once began to operate everywhere over
it, and has ever since persisted in producing upon it whatever
is the natural effect of denudation. So far is certain. It is
also certain that the removal from any large continental area
 of a layer of such materials as exist at the surface of the earth
will either (1) raise the new surface above the old surface
or (2) will depress it*. A priori reasoning does not indicate
 which of these opposite effects should follow from the removal
 of the load, viz., a stratum having a speci<U+FB01>c gravity between
 2'25 and 3 ; because the issue depends not only on the known
 factors (the thickness of the stratum and its weight), but also
on the compressibility and other physical properties of the
   *F The fact that in a mountainous country denudation scoops out valleys
may suggest to the super<U+FB01>cial observer that the essential etfect of denu
dation is to lower the surface. It is, however, certain that the mountain
rang; e, as a whole, will press less on the material beneath it in consequence
 of the denudation which has scooped out its valleys; that this under
lying material down to unknown depths will in consequence expand; and
 t at this expansion must somewhat raise the whole mountain-range.

underlying portions of the earth, which we do not know
aprz'ori.     Accordingly to determine which of the opposite
effects has been the real one, we must have recourse to
geological evidence. And what geology teaches us is :—-(1)
That the effect produced by denudation, whether it has been
to raise the surface or to depress it, has been accumulating—
all in one direction—for the immense geological age which
has elapsed since the existing river-systems of the earth were
established. And             that this accumulated movement
whether it has been an upward movement or a downward
has affected different parts ofthe continents upon the earth in
different degrees: it has been exerted most ef<U+FB01>ciently upon
those parts which we <U+FB01>nd to be now the highest; it has
operated most t'eebly upon those which now lie the lowest;
and it has affected in various degrees the other parts that
stand at intermediate elevations—but always in degrees pro
portioned to the elevations at which we now <U+FB01>nd them.
    17. From this geological evidence (especially when ex~
tended to the geology of the ocean, and pursued into details),
we seem to me to be justi<U+FB01>ed in drawing the inference that it:
is more likely—much more likely—that of the two physically
 possible effects of denudation, the raising or the lowering of
 the surface, the former is that which has actually been pro
 duced on the earth by this agent, and that the elevations have
 reached their present magnitude with the help of, not in
 opposition to, denudation.      And the conclusion to which the
 geological evidence points so emphatically, is supported by
 our <U+FB01>nding that it leads to values for the compressibility of
 the earth and for its plasticity which fall well within the limits
 of physical probability.                                           -

    with that in the Earth’s Crust. By GERALD STONEY,

 VI‘HE atmosphere consists of about 22'7 per cent. oxygen,
        76 per cent. of nitrogen and argon, and 1‘3 per cent.' of
 aqueous vapour and minor constituents ; and since its mean
 pressure is about 1033 grammes per square centimetre, it
 follows that there are 234'5 grammes of oxygen over every
 sq. centim. of the earth’s surface.
    Water contains eight parts of oxygen to one of hydrogen,
 and therefore 264 grammes of water contain 234'5 gr. of
 oxygen.                        '
    From this it follows that. a stratum of water which is

566‘ Lord Rayleigh 0n the Calculation of the Freauency of '
264 centim. (or 8 feet 8 inches) deep, contains as much oxygen '
as the superincumbent part of the atmosphere.
     Similarly, since rocks, clay, &c. of which the land is com
posed are at least 40 per cent. oxygen, and have an average
density of at least 2}, the same depth of the land will contain
as much, if not more, oxygen.
     Thus it appears that a stratum less than 9 feet in depth of
the surface of the earth, contains as much oxygen as the whole
of the atmosphere. This shows that the quantity of free oxygen
on the earth is exceedingly small in comparison with the
quantity in combination, and that a very small quantity more
in the crust of the earth would have left us with an atmo
sphere devoid of oxygen.
   ' If we may assume the thickness of the earth’s crust to be
not less than 17 miles, and that it consists throughout of rocks
similar to those exposed at the surface, it will follow that the
quantity of oxygen in the atmosphere is less than a ten
thousandth part of that in the crust.

             Vibration of a System in its Grarest diode.     567.
   ' When the determinantal equation is fully expressed, the
  smallest root, or indeed any other root, can be found by the
 ordinary processes of successive approximation. In many of
 the most interesting cases, however, the number of coordi
 nates is in<U+FB01>nite, and the inclusion of even a moderate number
 of them in the expressions for T and V would lead to
 laborious calculations. We may then avail ourselves of the
 following method of approximating to the value of the
 smallest root.
     The method is founded upon the principle" that the
 introduction of a constraint can never lower, and must in
 general raise, the frequency of any mode of a vibrating
 system.     The <U+FB01>rst constraint that we impose is the evan
 escence of one coordinate, say the last. The lowest fre
 quency of the system thus constrained is higher than the
 lowest frequency of the unconstrained system. Next impose“
 as an additional constraint the evanescence of the last co
 ordinate but one. The lowest frequency is again raised.
 If we continue this process until only one coordinate is left
 free to vary, we obtain a series of continually increasing
 quantities as the lowest frequencies of the various systems.
 Or if we contem late the operations in the reverse order, we
 obtain a series 0 decreasing quantities ending in the precise
quantity sought. The <U+FB01>rst of the series, resulting from the
sole variation of the <U+FB01>rst coordinate, is given by an equation
of the <U+FB01>rst degree, viz. A—p2L=O. The second is the lower
 root of the determinant (2) of the second order. The third
is the lowest root of a determinant of the third order formed
 by the addition of one row and one column to (2), and so on.
 This series of quantities may accordingly be regarded as
 successive approximations to the value required. Each is
nearer than its predecessor to the truth, and all (except of
course the last itself) are too high.
    The practical success of the method must depend upon the
choice of coordinates and of the order in which they are
employed. The object is so to arrange matters that the
variation of the <U+FB01>rst two or three coordinates shall allow a
good approximation to the actual mode of vibration.
    The example by which I propose to illustrate the method
is one already considered by Prof. Lamb. It is that of _the
transverse vibration of a liquid mass contained in a horizontal
cylindrical vessel, and of such quantity that the free surface
contains the axis of the cylinder (r=0). If we measure 0
vertically downwards, the <U+FB02>uid is limited by r=0, r=c, and

An Introduction to the hIathematical Theory of Attraction. By
   F. A. TABLETON, Sc.D. (Longmans, 1899, pp. xiv-+290.)
     R. TARLETON remarks that it is a matter of: much im
        portance that the acquisition of a competent knowledge of
the Theory of Attractions should be made as easy as possible.           ,
   His object in the present work is to assist in doing this, and so
 he writes for Students and not for Professors. Though there is
 much of new presentment of the details of the work, he naturally,
 nay necessarily, draws extensively upon previous authorities, more
 especially upon Maxwell‘s ‘ Electricity and Magnetism,’ Thomson
 and Tait's ‘ Natural Philosophy,’ and Dr. Routh’s recent treatise
 on the subject in vol. ii. of his ‘ Analytical Statics.’ The main
 problems are, as he points out, to <U+FB01>nd the resultant force between
 two bodies, and to determine the distributions of electricity and
 magnetism which take place under given conditions.
    Prof. J. D. Forbes, in his Dissertation on Physical Science (Encyc.
 Brit. p. 989) describes the doctrine of Attractions as being a.
 complex and dif<U+FB01>cult one even when the distribution of the attract
 ing matter as well as the fundamental law of attraction is known.
 And our author points out that the recent progress of the sciences
 of Electricity and Magnetism has increased the direct value of the
 theory. He discusses the ‘Resultaut Force’ at some length, and then
_considers ‘ Lines of Force ’; next he devotes nearly one third of his
Treatise to the consideration of the Potential.       This branch is very
 thoroughly treated.    The remaining chapters are devoted to Stir

THIS book forms part of Poincare"s 0010‘8116 Physique Jlathéma‘
tigue, and it may be said at once that it is the best of the series.
The author is, as everyone knows, a master of mathematical
analysis; he is besides the possessor of a most luminous style of
exposition, and, as he is here occupied with a subject in which he
has himself made important advances, great hopes must have been
aroused among mathematicians interested in the Theory of the
 Potential by the announcement of the publication of these lectures.
 Such hopes will not be disappointed.
    The theory under consideration is the most striking example of
 the‘assistance rendered to pure mathematics by applied mathe
 matics. The importance of a thorough study of what we now call
 “potential functions” was seen by Laplace in his researches on
 gravitation, and especially on the <U+FB01>gure of the earth; it was
 emphasised by Green in connexion with electrostatics and mag
 netism. Such a study has been found to be no less requisite
 as a preliminary to the mathematical theories of hydrodynamics
 and elasticity; in the formulation of each of these branches of
 applied mathematics it has been found that, if the theories are not
 to be self-contradictory, there ought to exist functions which
 satisfy Laplace's equation at all points in a particular .region of
 space, and also satisfy certain conditions at the boundaries of the
 region. The determination of a function from such conditions
 becomes a problem of profound interest to mathematicians, and
 the principle of the existence of such functions led, in the hands
 of Riemann, to nothing less than a revolution in the theory
  of functions of a complex variable. In the time of Riemann the
  proof of this principle which had been given by Dirichlet was
 accepted as valid; but since the fallacy that underlies this proof
  has been exposed by Weierstrass, mathematicians have had to
  seek for proof in other directions. Thus has arisen the famous
  “ existence-theorem,” to the construction of the rigid proof of
  which the efforts of many analysts have been directed.
     But if the existence-theorem is the roof and crown of the theory
 of the potential, it is by no means the only part of the theory

 574              Notices respecting New Books.
 which has needed to be made rigorous by the touch of a master
 hand well skilled in the re<U+FB01>nements of modern mathematical
analysis. That the strengthening of the base of the structure was
a problem well worthy of the powers of a fully equipped analyst
 was realised by Picard, and the chapters of his Traz'té d’Analys-e
devoted to the exposition of the theory show the conspicuous
success which attended his efforts. The author of the work
 before us has been no less successful in the independent treatment
of fundamental questions, and his discussion of the convergence
of the integrals which represent the components of attraction at
or near a point on a charged surface will especially repay careful
reading.
   The author devotes the <U+FB01>rst three Chapters of his book to what
would in this country be regarded as the elements of the theory,
sparing no pains to establish them in a thoroughly rigorous
fashion. In the fourth Chapter he introduces Green’s function
and explains its importance; and in the following chapter he
utilises Green’s function for a sphere and a point to construct a
function satisfying Laplace’s equation within a sphere and taking
 a given value at all points of the surface: this is Dirichlet’s
 problem for a sphere. The sixth Chapter is devoted to the
 properties of magnetic shells or sheets of doublets.        In the
 seventh Chapter the author presents his own proof of the existence
theorem : this proof is founded on a theory of the equivalence of
 certain surface and volume distributions; it is shown that. the
equivalent distributions can be determined for a sphere, and that
for any surface without conical points the solution of Dirichlet’s
problem can be arrived at by constructing such distributions and _
the related potential functions for a de<U+FB01>nite series of spheres.
As is well known, the author has extended this proof to a more
general class of surfaces, and the construction of it must be
regarded as one of his most brilliant achievements in analysis; in
his book he wisely refrains from presenting the proof for the
more complicated case, and refers the reader to his memoir in the
‘ American Journal of Mathematics,’ vol. xii. The eighth Chapter
contains an account of the method by which Neumann sought to
construct the solution of Dirichlet’s problem for a surface by
means of a sheet of doublets, or a magnetic shell, coinciding
with the surface; and the ninth and last Chapter contains indi
cations concerning a number of extensions of Neumann’s method.
The account of the method is most lucid and suggestive, and, as
the author points out, the method is of especial importance on
account of the identity which it establishes between the functions
which satisfy Laplace’s equation in limited regions of space and
the potentials of distributions of density.
   British readers will not fail to notice the use that is made,
throughout the last six Chapters, of Gauss’s theorem that the mean
value of a potential function over the surface of a sphere is the
same as the value at the centre; in English books on the same
subject this theorem appears as a curious incidental result.     It

will also be observed that the book as a whole presents an orderly
development of a single beautiful theory with few divergences
into by-paths, though with some indications of possible extensions.
In particular the two-dimensional or logarithmic potential is not
exhaustively treated in the same manner as the ordinary potential,
although the importance of the results obtained in respect of the
general theory of functions is pointed out. The extension to space
of more than three dimensions is not treated in any detail.
   It is very unfortunate that a book otherwise so excellent should
be carelessly printed, some of the misprints are of a most irritating
character.                                                  A. E. H. L.
A History of Physics in its Elementary Branches, including the
   Evolution of Physical Laboratories. By FLORIAN CAJORI, Phi).
   New York: The Macmillan Company, 1899.
THIS is in many respects a disappointing book. The author has
endeavoured to write a history of experimental method in the
 various branches of physics, rather than a. historical survey of the
 development of physical thought and ideas. The result is that a
 large portion of the volume is made up of material gathered from
 the ordinary text-books and somewhat amplified, to which short
 biographies of the various physicists mentioned have been added.
 As a concise collection of facts, most of which are well known to
 the majority of teat hers of physics, although gathered from various
 sources, it may serve a. useful purpose in directing a student’s
 reading; but it can scarcely be regarded as an important contri
 bution to the history of physics.                              J. L. H.

 (North Wales).’ By Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
    The rocks described in this communication were collected in
  1877, in series, at short intervals, from a point at the mouth of the
 River Conway near Bodlondeb. They consist of felsitic lavas and
 tuffs, sometimes nodular, and generally exhibiting some variety of
 <U+FB02>uxion-structure, corrugated, or banded. A specimen showing
 brown bands is compared with one described by Iddiugs from
 the Yellowstone Park. What were once possibly red bands are
 now represented by devitri<U+FB01>ed brown glass, and the change in
 colour may have been due to the action of water upon the ferric
 oxide which originally gave its colour to the glass. Some of
 the rhyolites are tufaceous, and envelop fragments of rocks, some
 of which were originally vitreous, others lithoidal.   Coarser rhyolitic
 tu<U+FB01>' occurs at the northern end of the series.

    2. ‘ The Geology of Southern Morocco and the Atlas Mountains.’
By the late Joseph Thomson, Esq.
    This paper gives the results of observations made under con
siderable difficulties during a journey in Morocco in 1888. The
 tract traversed is roughly triangular, the base being the Atlantic
 Ocean between Sn<U+FB02>i and Agadir, and the apex the district of Demnat
 on the northern slopes of the Atlas, some 60 miles east of the city
of Morocco. This district consists of three main sections :—(l) The
Coast Lowlands; (2) the Plateau in two chief steps, the northern
 rising to 2000 and the southern to 5000 feet; (3) the Atlas itself,
which only begins to be a mountain-chain about 30 miles from the
coast, and which ranges <U+FB01>rst east-by-north and then north-east in
its central and loftiest part.
    (1) The Lowlands are practically conterminous with the Tertiary
 deposits, among which apparently Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene
 rocks are represented. The latter consist of shelly sands 200 to
 300 feet thick, gradually rising to a height of 700 feet south
 and east of Satli. Their surface is often covered with the slaggy
 tufaceous crust described by Maw. The local presence of this
 crust and the porous character of the deposit elsewhere have pre
 served it from denudation, and thus (in the opinion of the author)
 its surface still presents the appearance of the Tertiary sea-bed on
 which it was formed. Certain quarry-like pits, one of which
 contains a pillar of White crystalline calcium carbonate, are sup
 posed to be due to the explosion of steam connected with the
 existence of hot springs.
    (2) The Plateau is underlain by three rock-formations :—
(a) Metamorphic rocks including clay-slates, which probably under
lie the whole Plain of Morocco and rise into a group of rugged hills
called the ‘Jebelet,’ in contradistinction to the ‘Jebel’ or Atlas
 proper. (b) The Lower Cretaceous rocks, consisting of red shales and
 sandstones, the former frequently giving rise to brine springs and
 containing salt-deposits at .Demnat in the Atlas. (0) The Upper
 Cretaceous rocks, chie<U+FB02>y white and cream-coloured limestones, which
 attain their greatest development on the Plateau.
    (3) The Atlas itself is made up for the most part of the same
 rocks. There is a core of metamorphic rocks, which is better
 developed and wider at the western end of the range and narrower
towards the east. Next comes the great development of the Lower
Cretaceous strata, followed by a diminutive representative of the
 Upper Cretaceous rocks. These rocks are much broken by folding
and faulting, and their structure is displayed in several sections
taken across the range from Demnat westward. The <U+FB01>rst signs of
 glacial action were met with at Titula, consisting of moraine-like
heaps of débris; elsewhere, scratched stones were found. The
Boulder-deposits described by Maw were not seen either east or
west of the locality described by that author; but Maw’s original
section was not traversed, and the present author does not offer any
opinion as to the origin of the beds. Intrusive basalts penetrate the
Cretaceous rocks, while porphyrites, diorites, and other igneous rocks
pierce the metamorphic rocks of the central core.
