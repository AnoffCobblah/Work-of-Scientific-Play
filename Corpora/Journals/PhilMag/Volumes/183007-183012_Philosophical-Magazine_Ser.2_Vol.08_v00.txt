 I.  On   the  Measurement {by Trigonometry) of the Heights of
    the jjrincipal Hills ofSwaledale, Yorkshire. By John Nixon,
    Esq.*
                             [With a Plate.]
 AVAILING myself last year of the favourable state of the
        weather about midsummer, I undertook, and within three
weeks     finished, the Trigonometrical Survey of the Hills of
 Swaledale, avalleynorth of, and adjoining that of Wensleydale.
    It was originally intended to have placed signals on the
principal hills only (the peculiar features of the dale rendering
impracticable the plan adopted in the preceding survey) ; yet
the temptation in the course of the operations, of marking for
measurement such others of minor note as were situated on
our route, could seldom be resisted. The exceptions had at
length become so reduced in number, that the deficient signals
would have been supplied, and the survey made complete for
hills of both descriptions, had not numerous indications of
approaching tempestuous weather urged the propriety of
commencing the observations without further delay. As an
additional motive to dispatch, it was noticed during the pro-
gress of the measurements that two of the more distant signals
had successively disappeared ; one of which, on West Stones-
dale Moor, having been observed from one station only, was
totally lost to the survey.    The other, on the Nine Standards
Hill, had most probably been demolished by a jealous shepherd
or keeper, acting under the impression that it had been set up
in opposition to the adjacent nine standards or boundary marks
between Westmoreland and Yorkshire, whence the fell derives
its .name.    As the line of demarcation passes in this vicinity
through every point on the ridge common to the geological

2 Mr. Nixon on the Measurement {by Trigonometry) of the
troughs of the Eden and the Swale, it would at once be ad-
mitted that our signal, raised on the extreme summit of the
hill, stood on the precise line of division between the two
counties, and that the standards, placed a quarter of a mile to
the north-west on ground considerably lower, were unequivo-
cally within Edendale; but on descending the east side of the
hill, we should discover that a stream, deriving its supplies
principally from ground in the direction of the standards,
divides and pours its waters into both valleys. To fix perma-
nently a boundary evidently debateable, has no doubt led to
the building of these numerous and enormous pikes. To pre-
vent the destruction of the second signal, recesses were made
within two of its opposite sides, each furnished with a stiff
card, on which was explained (in pencil, to avoid obliteration)
the occasion of its erection.       From the effects of a similar
jealousy the measurement of the heights of the Dent Hills,
commenced in 1824, at which period the boundaries between
Dent and Newbyhead were in dispute, was obliged to be
abandoned for two years; the signals within the contested
ground being regularly destroyed, though repeatedly renewed,
and every particle of the materials removed from the place.
    The inferior hills of Swaledale not included in the survey,
are the following.       1 West Stonesdale Moor ; the loftiest
                          .
eminence on the boundary ridge between the Nine Standards
and the pass at Tanhill. 2. Angrain Moor ; one of the many
ridges of which Shunnor Fell is the common crest; eligible
for measurement or otherwise, according as the ridge previous
 to its termination in a knab is interrupted by a depression, or
 more probably forms one continuous declivity. 3. Windyates ;
a transverse bank of the boundary ridge (crossed by the road
from Askrigg to Reeth), inferior in altitude to either High
 Fleak or Pickington Ridge, between which it is situated with-
out the intervention of a regular pass, but well known from
the bold cliff of the top or twelve-fathom lime at its southern
 extremity. 4. Mirk Fell; partly in Teesdale, a dependent of
 and considerably lower than Water Crag, from which it is
 scarcely sufficiently distinct to merit a separate appellation.
 5. Healaugh Crag ; a mass of grit rock breaking the uni-
 formity of a broad ridge falling from Great Pinch Yate, in the
 direction of the village of Feetham. 6°. Windegg; a slight
 cliff of the twelve-fathom lime at its termination on the boundary
ridge under the grit of the Hoove.          6. Hurst Moor: and 7.
 Fremington Edge; together forming a lofty escarpment of the
 same and other limes on the left bank of the Arkle. From the
 Hoove to Freminfjton the eastern ridge of Arkendale is one
 uninterrupted and nearly uniform descent, possessing no other

     Heights qf the principal Hills qf Swaledale, Yorkshire.      3
claim on the survey than its celebrity as an extensive and most
productive mining field.     (Having finished the signal on the
Hoove in the early part of the day, it was intended to have
descended the ridge and marked two or more conspicuous
points for measurement; a design unexpectedly frustrated by
the occurrence of a local storm of wind and dense mist.)
Lastly, there appears, according to the shading of the maps, a
round eminence, marked as Byer's Hill, situated considerably
to the east of the Hurst Moor.      From the station on Pinch
Yate, which affords a commanding view of that part of the
dale, the hill, probably from its insignificancy, could not be
distinguished.
   Conical piles of large sods, constructed of the usual dimen-
sions, served for signals on Hugh Seat, Nine Standards,
Keasdon, East Stonesdale Moor, Rogan's Seat, Blake Hill,
Brownsey, Great Pinch Yate, the Hoove, and Gibbon Hill;
smaller piles of stone marking the summits of the Tail Brigg,
Calvey, Harker, and Grinton Grits. Of these hills the highest
point was most carefully determined by the (repaired) twelve-
inch telescopic-level. About half a mile S.S.W. of the signal
on the Nine Standards is an eminence so nearly of equal alti-
tude, that it was deemed necessary to repair there in order to
confirm by reciprocal observation the correctness of the adjust-
ments of the level. With a view to expedite the completion of
the signals required, as well as to guard against their future
demolition, parties of miners were hired as frequently as pos-
sible to procure and pile the materials on the exact spot
marked out. At Dod End and Satron Hangers it was una-
voidably necessary to entrust to them, not only the erection of
the signals, but also the fixing of their sites; a task which the
extensive practice of the miners in forming watercourses would
render them competent to execute with the requisite accuracy.
That these signals were properly placed was verified by apply-
ing to them the test of the horizontal wire of the horizon-sector
from several stations of about the same altitude, in which case
the true and apparent (or perspective) summits would sensibly
coincide in level.   The highest point of Robincross Hill, at a
right-angled turn of the wall crossing its ridge, was marked by
placing on the wall an adequate number of loose stones. Hol-
gate Pasture was not visited; but from its round figure, incon-
siderable size, and remote distance, it scarcely required a signal.
   The difficulty of correctly bisecting a signal by the vertical
wire of the telescope of the theodolite, hitherto effected by the
 tedious perfecting of an approximate bisection, was finally sur-
 mounted by the following mode of operation. Commencing at
 once with the wire placed at an angle of some minutes to the
                                B2                              left

4 Mr. Nixon on the Measurement (by Trigonometry           ) of the
left of the object, the tangent screw was turned in the proper
direction at one uniform, somewhat rapid rate, until the wire
appeared to have reached the middle of the signal, when the
screw was abandoned as instantaneously and abruptly as pos-
sible. Bisections of this description are not only permanently
exact, but have the advantage of being completed with great
ceconomy of time; a consideration of great importance in vari-
able weather. The method, though difficult at first, requiring a
quick eye and considerable address in the manipulation of the
tangent screw, becomes with practice mechanically easy and
certain. If we estimate the probable angular error of bisection
inversely as the distance of the objects, it must be allowed, on
a comparison of the subjoined list with the corresponding one
for Wensleydale, (regard being had to the greater magnitude
of the triangles of the latter,) that the observations of 1829 are
decidedly superior to those of the year preceding it.

Survey, and form the extremities of three base-lines, sufficient
in number and advantageously situated for a basis to the sur-
vey but on calculating the approximate distances required to
     ;
obtain the corrections for the excentricity of the theodolite, it
was discovered that the given distance of the highest standard
to  Water Crag must be      several hundred   feet in excess.    On
this   account it was considered proper to connect the triangu-
lation with other stations of the Ordnance Survey, which was
effected in the autumn following, on the occasion of the
measurement at Ingleborough of some angles relating to ope-
rations in another quarter.      As the high opinion entertained
of the accuracy of the distances of the Trigonometrical Survey
has justly rendered them the foundation of county and other
extensive surveys, it becomes a duty to point out such as have
been discovered to be indisputably incorrect.
   At Water Crag the horizontal angle between Shunnor Fell
and the highest standard measured 52° 47' 56", or 1' 36" less
                                                                than

      Heights of the principal Hills of Swaledale, Yorkshire.             5
 than as observed by Colonel Mudge * ; the trifling difference
arising from the imperfection of the small theodolite added to
 some uncertainty as to the precise site of the original signals,
rather than from the want of identity in the object bisected by
the two observers.        This is sufficiently obvious from the cir-
cumstance of the Nine Standards being placed in a line of at
least fifty yards in extent, nearly fronting Water Crag, and on
the very extremity of its horizon in that direction. To remove
 any unreasonable doubt of identity founded on the idea that
the ambiguous term " the highest pile on the Nine Standards"
does not absolutely or exclusively apply to the loftiest of the
standards, it may suffice to observe that the other erections in
their vicinity are all situated to the west of, and considerably
below the level of a long transverse bank (terminating to the
north at the Standards), which completely interrupts the view
of them from Water Crag. The loss of the original signal on
the Nine Standards having been first noticed from Water
Crag, I have a perfect recollection of the anxiety with which
the telescope was repeatedly directed to every part of the edge
of this bank, in the vain hope of distinguishing some vestige of
the signals : nothing whatever could be seen rising above the
level of the heath.       Having clearly proved that the loftiest of
the Nine Standards was the object alluded to by Colonel Mudge,
it is equally demonstrable, on the authority of measurements
derived from two independent bases (of which the results are
given in the calculation of the distances), that his statement of
its distance from Water Crag exceeds the truth by about 697
feet.   The correctness of the observation from Water Crag
being established, the error in excess in the distance must have
been committed in the corresponding observation from Cross
Fell, at which station it would appear that some objects to the
west of the Nine Standards had been mistaken for them. This
is the more probable, as the boundary ridge in that quarter of
the fell and the adjoining coal-field are literally studded with
piles of stone of every description.            It would, in fact, require

a most favourable distribution of light and shade to render
the dull masses of the standards distinguishable, at a distance
of twenty miles, from the dark sides of the ridge immediately
behind them.
   The horizontal angles were all measured on the six-inch
theodolite already described, and generally in opposite di-
rections of the telescope within its Ys, of which the mean
readings, corrected for the distance of the instrument from the
signal, are given in the Registers.
   In the event of the measurement of a distance from more
than one base, the mean of the results, when not sufficiently
accordant with each other, has been determined by the formulae
given in the Phil. Mag. and Annals, N.S. vol. v. page 354.

II.    On   the Obliquity     of the Ecliptic.       By William Gal-

    To   the Editors    of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
T^HE         subject of the obliquity of the ecliptic has so fre-
  =r quently engaged the attention of astronomers, that it may
at first appear superfluous for me to attempt, in the present
short sketch, to throw          much    light  upon   this interesting sub-
ject.
     Still, however, it appears to me that sufficient attention has
not been bestowed, at certain public institutions, on some parts
of it, particularly that arising from a small error in the lati-
tude, which, as will presently appear, produces a double effect
on the difference between the summer and winter obliquity, by
 this means rendering that small error very sensible.
     Let w be the summer obliquity, «/ the winter, X the lati-
 tude,    z the zenith distance in summer, z' that in winter, and
 e   the error in latitude; then it will readily appear that in
 Summer            u>  =                X + s —z                        (1)

 Whence w—         co' = 2X — (« + «/) + 2s ={2X— (z + z') + 2e}...(3)
     But 2X— (z+z') should be           = 0,   if the summer and winter
 obliquities are the same, as it          is probable they are ; whence
              co — «/ =    Aco  =   2e                                  (4)*
 Or     the difference of the summer and winter obliquity is af-
 fected by the sum of the errors in the latitude arising from
 using an erroneous table of refractions, a constant error in
 the instrument, &c.
      Hence it is clear that an error in this determination will
 continue so long as the latitude and the obliquity of the eclip-
 tic continue to be determined by Bradley's Refractions, which,
 though they possessed great merit at the time of their first ap-
 pearance, and in a considerable degree still do so, yet are un-
  doubtedly inferior to those called the French Refractions, as
  well as to those of Bessel, Brinkley, Ivory, and Young.
      It has been long known that the Greenwich published de-
  termination of the obliquity in summer, does not accord with
     * Indeed, without any attempt at demonstration, a very little considera-
  tion will show that the difference between the summer and winter obli-
  quity is increased by twice the error of the latitude of the place of ob-
  servation ; since the zenith distance must be subtracted from the latitude
  in the former case, and the latitude must be subtracted from the zenith
   distance in the latter.
                                                                         that

that obtained in winter, as    may be seen in a table (20) pub-
lished   by Dr. Pearson in the first volume of his Treatise on
Practical Astronomy, page 175; and that the winter obliquity
is in general less than the summer, which seems to have been
increasing in amount since the year 1754, in the time of Dr.
Bradley. In the first volume of Dr. Maskelyne's Observa-
tions, page v. of his explanation of the tables, he expressly
states that Bradley adopted 51° 28' 39^" N. as the latitude
of Greenwich, which he was induced to increase by half a
second, making it finally 51° 28' 40"; and it is believed that
this value of it continued to be used till his death, and per-
haps to a still later period. From some calculations made
from the Greenwich Observations by the French Refractions,
I was induced to think the latitude about 51° 28' 38^", or ex-
actly a second less than Bradley, and a second and a half less
than Maskelyne.
    Bessel has also investigated this matter in Schumacher's
Astro?wmische Nachrichten, No. 73, apparently with great care,
and obtains 51° 28' 38"*34, affected with a very small error,
which cannot by the Greenwich Observations be removed,
since the mural circle is incapable of reversion.
    Again, in the Greenwich Observations for 1826, the lati-
tude is deduced from numerous observations connected by
various tables of refraction. But if a star near the zenith, such
as y Draconis, be chosen as least affected by any small error
in the refractions, and a mean of the refractions in highest
esteem be employed, as those of the French, Bessel, Brinkley,
Young and Ivory, the latitude will be 51° 28' 38"-5, from
which all those derived from tables of most authority deviate
very slightly. This result may therefore, I presume, be con-
fidently trusted as the true latitude from which future obser-
                                       ;
vations will, in all probability, make no sensible deviation.
The difference between the most common estimation of it, or
51° 28' 40", and 51° 28' 3S"\5, is l"-5      =  E., and therefore
2e   =  3" will be the difference between the summer and win-
ter obliquity arising   from this cause alone ; that is, the winter
obliquity will be 3" less than the summer.
    It will next be necessary to inquire what effect the refrac-
tions will have on the zenith distance in winter as being the
greatest,   and consequently most     affecting, when taken from
different tables.    The  meridian zenith distance of the sun at
Greenwich near the winter solstice will be about 75°, as ex-
treme nicety is not necessary to form an estimate in this case,
at which few tables, especially Bradley's, are without the sus-
picion of error.     For this purpose, suppose the atmosphere
                                                                 is

That is, the correction to be added to the zenith distance is
too small by l"-56 in winter, and consequently the obliquity
is also too small by the same quantity, on account of the error
in Bradley's Refractions.          This would, however, be partly
corrected by the proportional defect at the summer solstice,
which amounts to       —  0"-34 ; consequently the whole difference
arising from this cause would be the difference between l"-56
and 0"-34, or l"-22 to be added to 3"-00 formerly obtained,
making 4"-22 on the whole.
    It may therefore, I think, be reasonably concluded, that
when the latitude of Greenwich is assumed at 51° 28' 40", and
the observed zenith distances of the sun at the solstices is cor-
rected by Bradley's table of Refractions, the difference between
the summer and winter obliquity will, independent of errors
of observation, amount generally to 4"*22.
    Now it will appear from an examination of the Greenwich
determinations from about the year 1765 till 1790, in Dr. Pear-
son's table formerly alluded to, that the mean difference du-
ring that period is very nearly equal to that which has now
been found. From 1790 till 1811 the differences are so great
(about 10" or 12") that there must of necessity be some other
error mixed up along with it. Perhaps the error of the mural
quadrant then used was the principal cause.
    Mr. Pond's observations from 1812 till 1819 inclusive, give
a mean of      — 4"*87, so nearly the same as      — 4"*22, the quan-
tity obtained on our theory, as to be a strong confirmation of
its  justness.
    It is also   confirmed by the observations of M. Bessel,
whose results may be seen in table 4, page 436, of Dr. Pear-
son's work already referred to.
    I am aware, however, that M. Cacciatore, superintendent
of the Observatory of Palermo, has advanced a theory of this
discrepancy of the obliquity, as determined by observations at
the summer and winter solstices, depending on the effects of
                                                                  the

  the heat of the sun upon his circle.       Still, however, by means
  of equations, which give the necessary corrections attributable
  to this cause, he renders them nearly equal.          It is generally
  understood that the Palermo circle made by the late Mr.
  Ramsden is very liable to be acted upon by heat during the
 time of observation, while that of Greenwich is much less so,
 or not very sensibly.
      No doubt this may be one of the causes of discrepancy in
 others, and almost the sole cause in his, since it is very liable
 to alter its form by heat; but in more northerly latitudes it per-
 haps may be doubted whether this is the true cause, more
 especially as an adequate one, depending upon a different
 principle, has just     now been produced.

 III.    On the Vegetable Fossils found at Lennel Braes, near
     Coldstream, upon the Banks of the River Tweed in Berwick-
     shire.   By Henry Witham, of Lartington, F.G.S. fyc.*
 X_TAVING          been requested by several gentlemen to present
 -*--*-
         to the public a statement of facts, respecting the fossil
 Flora in the neighbourhood of Coldstream, upon the banks of
 the river Tweed, I feel confident you will allow this paper a
 place in your valuable publication.
     As the fossil vegetable kingdom has been divided into four
great groups or periods, and as M. Adolphe Brongniart is of
opinion that the transition is abrupt, and that there is a sud-
den difference in the most important characters of the vege-
tables, it becomes necessary for me to divide this memoir un-
der three heads.
     1st   A description of the surrounding strata.
    2ndly.    A description of the fossil plants themselves, with
their position and,
                 ;
    Srdly.   A  few observations upon both these heads.
    1st. It has long been matter of dispute under what class of
rocks the deposits in the neighbourhood of Coldstream are to
be described. Some are of opinion that they are members of the
old red sandstone series ; and others, that they are to be classed
with a much more recent deposit, the new red sandstone.
    The following facts, which have been taken with great ac-
curacy by my intelligent friend Mr. Francis Forster and my-
self, will I trust set this question at rest.  —  Immediately below
the bridge at Coldstream, at its south end, you perceive a bed

                                                                    of

seen rising to the north-west at an angle of about 14°.
   Above the bridge, on the north side, beds of sandstone,
bituminous shale and iron stone, form the cliff rising 8° to
the west.
   Between the bridge at Coldstream and Lennel Braes, a di-
stance of rather more than two miles, a great variety of shale
and grit beds, evidently belonging to the coal formation, may
be seen rising to the south and south-south-west; but irregu-
lar in their inclinations.
   Lennel Braes being the place most exposed to the swelling
waters of the Tweed, these ancient fossils are to be obtained
there in the greatest abundance.              It becomes necessary to
be most minute ; and I shall therefore present the following
section.

   Both banks of the river are occupied by beds similar to the
above, from Lennel Braes down to a very fine cliff about
three-quarters of a mile above Sir           David Milne's house.
   This sandstone has many characteristic marks of the new

 18   Mr.Witbam     on the Vegetable Fossils found at Lennel Braes,
 red sandstone formation. It is about forty-five feet in height,
 and nearly one hundred and twenty yards in length. This
 sandstone dips at an angle of 9° in the direction of north,
 35° east. It is underlaid at its western point by a bed of shale
 containing organic remains of vegetables, and dipping north
 73° east, at an angle of 16°. Hence it appears extremely
 probable that this is a lower bed of new red sandstone re-
 posing on the coal measures.
    On the south side of the river, in Twizell grounds, a similar
 sandstone is quarried. The position of this sandstone is al-
tered near the edge of the bank, being bent down towards
the river.      It dips here 8° to the north-east, but in the
 western part of the quarry it appears to take a more regular
course, and dips to the south at the rate of 8°. Further down
the river a bed of shale is seen abutting against this sand-
stone, evidently thrown up by a fault.        This quarry possesses
all the characters of the new red sandstone.
    There is also a bed of sandstone quarried in the burnside
near Milne Graden, colour gray, close-grained, making a very
fine building-stone. It dips at an angle of 5° to the south-south-
east, and is probably a member of the new red sandstone.
            —
    Again: A few hundred yards to the north of Coldstream
is a thick bed of very fine sandstone belonging to the coal for-
mation, dipping to the east-south-east, and, in its lower part,
vegetable remains, mineralized by sulphate of iron, are lying
in a horizontal position.     It is underlaid by a bed of soft bitu-
minous shale of unknown thickness, and the beds of sand-
stone are streaked and irregularly marked with the same sub-
stance.
    These are all the remarks I think it necessary to make re-
specting the immediate rocks in which these singular fossils
are to be found.
    I  beg leave, however, to mention that my intelligent young
friend   Mr. Charlton, jun. of Hesleyside, Northumberland, a
member     of the Natural History Society of Newcastle-upon-
Tyne, accompanied us      ; and from the acute, and consequently
striking observations made by him, I have little doubt that the
world some day or other will be much instructed by such
geological remarks as he may choose to submit to the public.
Many people having great doubts how far the coal-field, which
is worked to the south of the river Tweed, extended in a
northerly direction, Mr. Forster and I proceeded from Cold-
stream to Greenlaw, between which places an extended and
undulating plain of diluvium evidently covers the bassets of
many    strata.
                                                                On

      near Coldstream, upon the Batiks of the River Tweed.     1
   On the top of the hill, south-east of Greenlaw, is a quarry
of new red sandstone. It dips to the south at an angle of 19°.
This great inclination may probably be attributed to the im-
mediate vicinity of a whin dyke running a few yards to the
north.    In the direction of south 65° east (about four or five
hundred yards west) this dyke has been worked to a width of
twenty-seven yards. Whether this is its regular thickness, or
an overflowing at this point, could not be ascertained, as the
quarry does not extend more than four or five feet below the
surface.   The sandstone in the eastern quarry shows igneous
phaenomena in a striking degree. Another quarry of very red
sandstone is worked on the side of the hill near Greenlaw.
Between the bridge over the Blackadder, at the west end of
Greenlaw, a bed of red sandstone, of twelve feet in thickness,
is seen rising 14° in the direction of north 65° east.
   The walls of Polworth are built of new red sandstone con-
glomerate from Leases quarry, about three-quarters of a mile
to the west of this village.
   Immediately below the bridge crossing Langton Burn, on
the road from Polworth to Dunce, a bed of yellow sandstone*
four feet in thickness, is underlaid by a bed of shale five feet
thick, containing layers of iron-stone from six to eight inches
in thickness, all rising about 22° to the north. It appears more
than probable that there are members of the coal formation
cropping from under the new red sandstone, which forms the
hills behind them to the south.
   At St. Helens, two miles south-east from Dunce, beds of
shivery coal sandstone and shale, nearly horizontal, containing
nodules of ironstone, occur. The coal shale also occurs ex-
tensively on the banks of the Blackadder, twelve miles from
Berwick on the Paxton road, and repeatedly to the east on the
banks of the said river.
   At the bridge of the Whiteadder, one mile west of Churn-
side, a thick series of coal-measures dip rapidly to the east,
forming a bold cliff, capped on the north side of the road by
a thin detached bed much resembling new red sandstone.
   Many interesting remarks might here be made, but I re-
serve them for a future paper, upon the red sandstones of
Berwickshire.
   2dly. The great abundance of these fossil plants in the
above-named stratum lying in a state of much confusion,
must be matter of surprise to those who have paid any atten-
tion to the ancient vegetation of the coal-fields in the north of
England and Scotland. In all these fields it is well known the
vascular cryptogamic plants appear greatly to prevail : and
we have but occasionally been amused by some unheard-of
                                D  2                   recumbent

 20 Mr.Witham on the Vegetable       Fossils found at  Lennel Braes,
  recumbent fossil, whose class, genus, or species generally oc-
  casioned much comment, and not a little hesitation.
      Since the introduction of the art of slicing the stems of these
  fossil plants, the difficulty, which before appeared almost in-
  surmountable, has been greatly removed and I take much
                                                 ;
  pride and pleasure in having recommended this method to the
 York and Newcastle Philosophical and Natural History So-
  cieties.   The method is a beautiful one; and I think 1 do not
 exaggerate in saying, that by it we are enabled at once to ob-
 serve the internal structure of any monocotyledonous or di-
 cotyledonous plant.      It is a refinement in the art which opens
 to view that which, from its antiquity and opacity, was before
 hidden from the sight of man. It enables us to view those
 early productions which for thousands of years have (when
 by accident exposed) either been neglected, or represented as
 something monstrous and absurd.
     In this position, amongst the members of the independent
 coal-field, however, we have every reason to believe in a forest
 of unknown extent, all apparently of the same genus, differing
 altogether from the vascular cryptogamic plants.
     To what genus and species are we therefore to refer these
 ancient remains of a former world ?
    They cannot be vascular cryptogamic plants, as they contain
 decided woody texture from the centre of the stem.
     They cannot be monocotyledonous, the pith not forming
 the greater part of the stem, and the woody parts not being
composed of fasciculi, which are disseminated throughout the
pithy texture of plants of that kind.
    They having, in my opinion, most decided medullary rays,
it would therefore appear to me that they must be classed
 amongst the dicotyledonous plants.
    As such, therefore, after repeated and most minute micro-
scopic examinations and comparisons, not only with fossil but
with recent plants, I do not hesitate to class these numerous
fossil vegetable remains.
    Lastly: —  By the above observations it appears therefore quite
clear, that the coal-measures to the south of the river Tweed
by no means terminate at or near the ancient boundary of the
two kingdoms, but approach within a short distance of the
transition range of the south of Scotland.
    The contorted and flattened shape of many of these ancient
stems is worthy of remark.         Their external coatings are in-
variably carbonized probably their present forms may have
                        :
been caused by extreme pressure when these vegetables were
in a state of decomposition; and subsequently it was, that
foreign substances, by percolation, look possession of the de-

      near Coldstream, upon the Banks of the River Tweed.                21
cayed portions of the plants.        It is difficult also to ascertain
their height, as by the above description they must have been
liable to be fractured and broken.         The highest stern I have
been able to obtain is not much more than four feet, and the
lower part of it is about six feet in circumference. No two
stems possess the woody appearances alike, some retaining it
in the centre of the stem, others having such appearances dis-
tributed in various parts of the stem.         Owing to the immense
superincumbent mass, this part of the research is rendered both
tedious and expensive.
   By these examinations it is equally evident, that this un-
known extent of early vegetation seems to have been called
into existence during the formation of the carboniferous rocks,
or in the first period of Brongniart's division.            Now, accord-
ing to that gentleman's opinion, out of six classes (with the ex-
ception of the marine and a few uncertain plants) only two
existed at that period ; namely, the vascular cryptogamic
plants, comprehending the Filices, Equisetacece, Lycopodice,
and the monocotyledons, containing a small number of plants
which appear to resemble the palms and arborescent Liiiaceae;
in fact, Mr. A. Brongniart states, that out of 260 species dis-
covered in this terrain, 220 belong to the vascular crypto-
gamic group.
   The existence, therefore, of so extensive a deposit of dico-
tyledonous plants at this early period of the earth's vegetation
appears to demand the attention of the naturalist and it does;
indeed go far to prove the necessity of more minute examina-
tion amongst the dark and pathless repositories of an ante-
diluvian world.
   The following is the analysis of one of these plants            :

   The similarity of the above analysis to that of the fossil
stem found in Craigleith quarry, in the year 1826, is very re-
markable*.      From recent minute examination and compari-
sons, there is reason to believe that plant to be a member of
the same class as the above-described ancient fossils.

       IV.  On  the Power of Horses.    By  B. Bevan, Esq.
     To the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
 T^O     determine the average power of horses under different
   -   kinds of labour, has been a subject deemed worthy of
 the inquiries of many of the first class of scientific writers.
 It is one of those points which can be determined only by ex-
 periment. The power to be maintained depends upon the ve-
 locity; and various formulae are given by writers on this sub-
ject.    Thus, Professor Leslie gives (15 — v) 2 = pounds avoir-
 dupoise for the power of traction of a strong horse, and
 (12 — vf  =  pounds traction of the ordinary horse, v == velocity
 in miles per hour.
    In the period from 1803 to 1809, I had the opportunity of
ascertaining correctly the mean force exerted by good horses
 in drawing the plough ; having had the superintendence of the
 experiments on that head at the various ploughing matches,
both at Woburn and Ashridge, under the patronage of the
 Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Bridgewater. I find among
 my memoranda the result of eight ploughing matches, at
which there were seldom fewer than seven teams as compe-
titors for the various prizes.
    The 1st result is from the mean force of each
horse in six teams of two horses, each team upon             lbs.
light  sandy  soil                                       =   156
    The 2nd   result is from seven teams oT two horses,
each team upon loamy ground, near Great Berk-
hamstead                                                 =   154
    The 3rd result is from six teams of four horses,
each team with old Hertfordshire ploughs                 =   127
    The 4th result is from seven teams of four horses,
each team upon strong stony land (improved ploughs)      =   167
    The 5th result is from seven teams of four horses,
each team upon strong stony land (old Hertfordshire
ploughs)                                                 =  193
    The 6th result is from seven teams of two horses,
each team upon light loam                                =  177
   The 7th result is from five teams of two horses,
each upon light sandy land                              =   170
   The 8th result is from seven teams of two horses,
each team upon sandy land                               =   160
   The mean force exerted by each horse from fifty-two teams,
or 144 horses,     =  163 pounds each horse; and although the
                                                           speed

          Mr.    Alison's Ascent of the Peak of   Teneriffe.      23
speed was not particularly entered, it could not be less than
at the rate of    2\ miles per hour.
   As these experiments were fairly made, and by horses of
the common breed used by farmers, and upon ploughs from
various counties, these numbers may be considered as a pretty
accurate measure of the force actually exerted by horses at
plough, and which they are able to do without injury for
many weeks     ;
                 —  but it should be remembered, that if these
horses had been put out of their usual walking pace, the re-
sult would have been very different.        The mean power of the
draught-horse, deduced from the above-mentioned experi-
ments, exceeds the calculated power from the highest formula
of Mr. Leslie.         I am, Gentlemen,
                                 Your obedient servant,
                                                         B. Bevan.
V. Narrative of an Excursion to the Summit of the Peak of
   Teneriffe on the 23rd and 24>th of February 1829.             By
   Robert Edward Alison, Esq.*
TT AVING          frequently observed the rapid fall of the atmo-
-*--* spheric temperature when ascending from the sea-coast
of TenerhTe to an elevation of 1000 feet, and on the contrary
the very slow alteration at higher points, I was desirous of
ascertaining the proportional decrement of heat in the upper
regions.
   The ascent to the top of the Peak of Teneriffe is consi-
dered by the natives of the island as impracticable in the
winter season, on account of the snow and the supposed ex-
treme cold it is therefore seldom made before the month of
             ;
June, when it is free from snow: but I was not able to wait
for a more genial season, as I was in daily expectation of re-
turning to England; I therefore resolved to make the at-
tempt.
   On the 23rd of February, at 4 A.M., I left the Augustine
convent Orotuca, which is situated nearly 1100 feet above
the level of the sea. At the time of my departure the thermo-
meter stood at 56°'5, and there was a gentle breeze from the
N.N.W.
   After joining a stout active   young peasant who was       to act
as my guide, we entered the " Camino de C'rasna," which is
dignified by the name of a road, although, like almost all the
highways in the island, it is only a steep and uneven line of
                    * Communicated by the Author.
                                                                lava

24?     Mr.  Alison's Narrative of an Excursion to the
lava.    An ascent of 500 feet took us to the extremity of the
beautiful zone of vines, antl at half-past si* A.M. we crossed
the barranco or ravine Penilla; the surface here gradually
began to assume a different appearance, from the vegetation
which clothed it being common to Europe.
    Shortly after leaving the zone of chestnuts and lupines, we
entered a belt of heaths which form the third region of plants
this belt is about four miles long, and a quarter of a mile
broad, and extends nearly across the valley of Orotava. The
temperature here began to decrease very sensibly and al-   ;
though the lavas in some places were only covered with a
few inches of decomposed volcanic and vegetable matter, yet
they were clothed with a most luxuriant verdure. This is no
doubt to be attributed to the moisture from the clouds, which
frequently completely envelop even this inferior elevation
towards the close of the day, or before or after any sudden
alteration of temperature.
    Fifteen minutes after leaving the last barranco, we crossed
another, called Pilloni, which is rather more than 3000 feet
above the sea and soon after, we entered the Barranco del
                ;
Pino Dornajito, which is 34<10 feet above the sea*; it is so
named from an enormous pine-tree that grew near the west-
ern side of the ravine. It is said that this tree was full-grown
at the time of the conquest of the island, 360 years ago     ; — thus,
having stood the storms of so many ages, it was at last swept
into the ravine by the dreadful waterspout that devastated
the island on the 7th of November 1826. Although this tree
is partly destroyed by its fall, yet it still measures 128 feet in
length,  and 30   in circumference.
    Under   a precipice in the middle of the ravine is a small
spring of water, with a wooden cross at the side of it the tem-
                                                          ;
perature of the spring was 56°, but it appears to vary more
than any other which I have examined, as in October the
temperature of the water was 65°'5. At the time of the be-
fore-mentioned waterspout, a body of water, some hundred
feet wide and thirty or forty deep, fell over this spring and
cross without doing it the least damage ; which the peasantry
attribute to the Divine interposition, forgetting that the water,
in falling from the height above, would form a curve and ef-
fectually protect it from injury.
    From the great depth of this ravine, the various strata of
lava can be observed ; the superior stratum consists of decom-
   * According to a barometrical admeasurement made by Humboldt and
calculated by the formula of Laplace.
                                                                posed

      Summit of the Peak of     Tenerijfe in February 1829.      25
posed lava and vegetable mould, to the depth of three feet;
next is a sort of volcanic breccia or conglomerate, held to-
gether by a brown mud and tufa afterwards a bed of volcanic
                                     ;
tufa, of four or five feet in thickness, succeeded by alternate
strata of compact bluish-coloured basaltic trap and brown
mud. In the bed of the ravine were large blocks of lava
mixed with hornblende and augite.
   In my first ascent to the Peak I was much disappointed
in not meeting with the forest of pine-trees above the zone of
chestnuts, which the visitors to the Peak during the last cen-
tury mention with so much pleasure but the destructive axe
                                           ;
has not left a single trace of them. On the way towards the
defile of the Portillo, there are several spots pointed out as
famous for the enormous size of a particular pine-tree, such
as Pino del Domajito, Pino de la Caravela, Pino de la Meri-
ejida, and Ultimo Pino.
   A short distance above Dornajito the surface is intersected
by numerous small      ravines, and the soil is so thin that the
lava frequently appears above the surface. Ascending a little
further we approached the lower region of the clouds, where
we found    the temperature begin to fall rather rapidly but at
                                                           ;
the same time vegetation became so luxuriant, that it was
difficult to observe the nature of the lavas. The tree heaths
{Erica arborea) are of considerable size, being sometimes six-
teen or eighteen feet high, with stems half the thickness of a
man's body ; they are mixed with the laurel, cytisus, and va-
rious other arborescent shrubs      :  it is worthy of remark, that
all the leaves of the different shrubs here are of the same size,
form and colour, which is a brilliant dark green. This strong
vegetation is certainly produced by the humidity of the at-
mosphere, from the clouds generally resting at this elevation
during the night and early part of the morning.
   What makes this more evident is, that as you advance to
the verge of this climate, where the air is drier and the sun's
rays more powerful, vegetation becomes less luxuriant, and
the leaves are of a light green instead of a dark green co-
lour.
   The lavas here appeared to have flowed in numerous
streams from various openings; they look like a sort of wacken:
their colour is black, rather vesicular, and they contain green-
coloured augite, hornblende, and olivine, and all affect the
magnetic needle strongly. Many of the lavas are much de-
 composed, with the pores on the outside free from crystals,
 which have no doubt fallen out, as I always found them
internally.

26        Mr. Alison's Narrative of an    Excursio7i to the
   We    still gradually ascended ; and as we crossed Barranco
 Haya we were      rather annoyed by the lower region of clouds
condensing on our clothes and bodies, and producing by
the evaporation a degree of cold considerably greater than
that indicated by the thermometer, which was 49*5 ; we like-
 wise encountered a strong current of air blowing from the
west-by-south, although both above and below us the wind
was blowing from the N.N.W. This current of air was pro-
duced probably by the wind sweeping down the western ex-
tremity of the mountain called Tigayga, into the entrance of
the Cafiadas, between the Cavison and the Portillo (which is
a sort of defile or opening in the chain of mountains that sur-
round the Cafiadas), thus creating a considerable pressure of
air, which caused a rush of wind into the valley below.
   Some distance above Barranco Haya we crossed an ancient
stream of lava, which appeared to have proceeded from a
volcano to the S.S.W., but it was so covered with vegetation
that it was difficult to discover its composition. The detached
pieces which I picked up were a porphyritic trachyte, with
crystals of augite and felspar, partly destroyed by fire.
   At j to 8 A.M. we crossed the ravine named Fuera el Monte,
and entered the Llanos de Gaspar (the plains of Gaspar). Here
vegetation became very scanty, and almost the only plant was
Canarian thyme.         But this spot is particularly interesting,
from its being evident that a considerable part of the water-
spout which deluged the island in November 1826 had burst
here, cutting the surface into a vast number of ravines,
some of them of great depth. From the appearance of the
surface, the columns of water which fell must have been very
numerous ; as in ten or twelve different places the lava is cut
into deep trenches, some of them fifteen and twenty feet deep,
with the soil which was between them completely washed away
by the spray or overflowing of the water. Many of these deep
channels frequently converge into one, forming a destructive
and overwhelming      ravine.
   Considerable bodies of water have frequently fallen upon the
Canaries, and done some mischief by washing into the sea the
vegetable mould which so thinly covers the lavas.           But the
visitation of the 6th and 7th of November 1826 was the most
awful and destructive, both to life and property, of any
of which the inhabitants have any tradition.       My   friend Mr.
Auber, of Orotava, has furnished me with the interesting
details of the phenomena attending this waterspout, which I
shall here subjoin.
   On the afternoon of the 6th of November, the wind, which
                                                               was

       Summit of the Peak of Teneriffe     in Febniary 1829.      27
was blowing strongly from the N.E., veered round to every
point of the compass, and ultimately established itself from the
north; but at sea, a few miles from land, it was blowing a
hurricane from the N.E., and in a moment, without any inter-
mediate change, it blew as strongly from the S.W. The sky
became obscured all at once by enormous masses of black
clouds, which hastened the night some time before sunset;
but neither thunder nor lightning was observed.            The rain
commenced to fall in torrents towards 10 o'clock at night,
and the wind to blow with an overpowering impetuosity. At
half-past two on the morning of the 7th, Mr. Auber observed
several globes of fire moving upon the sea, at various distances
from the shore, whilst others remained stationary. One of
them, from its position, appeared to be on the top of the Mon-
taneta of Realejo, and caused him to suppose that that extinct
volcano was going to threaten the valley of Orotava with an
eruption but he was soon undeceived, by observing that the
          :
globe moved about on the surface of the water like the others,
and at some distance from the spot where he first thought it
was situated.
   These luminous globes appeared to move towards the S.W.
and follow the direction of the waves. The light which they
spread in the atmosphere extended more than 45° high; and
although he was three miles off, it was often sufficiently strong
to enable him to read rather small print; but no detonation
was heard. The number of globes increased from half-past
two o'clock till four, when they began to diminish. Mr.
Auber, at one period of his observations, counted fourteen
moving about at one time but the glare of light which he
                              ;
perceived on his right, where the surrounding houses bounded
his view, caused him to suppose their number to be much
more considerable. Their duration was from one minute to
five or six, but seldom longer    ;  and their apparent diameter
was about the half of that of the moon at her full, when she
reaches the zenith. When they had all disappeared the dark-
ness was extreme, and he could not see the neighbouring
houses; but a quarter of an hour afterwards, the reappearance
of the same globes, or the formation of new ones, allowed him
to see the island of Palma, though nearly sixty miles distant.
The rain fell with equal force whilst these globes were appear-
ing upOn the sea and after their disappearance.         It was men-
tioned that a globe of fire had fallen at the foot of the mountain
of Tigayga, which bounds the valley of Orotava to the west,
and that it had made a deep hole in the earth         : — search was
made   respecting the truth of this assertion, but   it did not lead
                                E   2                              to

28       Mr.  Alison's Narrative of an Excursion to the
to   any positive result.   I was likewise informed that similar
 globes of fire were seen traversing the Llano de Gaspar, the
 spot which I have mentioned as bearing such evident marks
 of the effects of the water.    My  informant, who was a small
 farmer living near Tigayga, and almost on a level with the
 Llano de Gaspar, likewise added, " that all the heaths ap-
 peared to be on fire; and at the same time I saw a column
 of water several fathoms wide move across the top of the
 valley."
    I will now resume    the thread of my  narrative to the  Peak
 and  for the purpose of pointing out the devastation committed
 in 1826, I shall incur the risk of being thought tedious, by
 enumerating the ravines which I crossed at the spot where
 the waterspout appeared to have burst.       The first was Bar-
 ranco de Llano de Gaspar; it was of some depth, and exposed
 a stratum of basaltic lava, a species of puzzolana of consider-
 able thickness, and a brown volcanic mud resting on a bed of
 close black lava.    A little to the west were two new ravines,
 which united into one at a short distance from the commence-
 ment, and formed the barranco which did so much mischief to
 the port of Orotava. The next was a new ravine, and is only
 remarkable for being the spot where you take leave of the
 luxuriant vegetation of the third zone, and enter that of the
 cytisus, which may be termed the fourth zone of plants. The
 surface here is a brown volcanic mud mixed with small pieces
 of lava, forming a hard breccia or conglomerate, with a slight
 covering of vegetable mould, which in many places between
 the ravines was completely washed away by the spray of the
 water.
    Towards the south-western extremity of the Llano de Gaspar
 is a spot named the Camilla del Alta, where there is a stream of
 trachytic lava that has separated at a short distance above, and
 formed a sort of half-circle: the two streams are nearly destitute
 of vegetation. Another column of water appears to have burst
 here, and made three or four ravines, which converge into one
 a few hundred feet below. At 8*30 A.M. we entered a part of
 the inclined plane called Chasquitas Abaxo and Chasquitas
 Arriba. The ravines here are very numerous, and some are
 so close together that there is hardly space sufficient to pass
 between them. Within a few hundred yards I crossed eleven,
 which were all formed in 1826; and in the upper part of
 Chasquitas Arriba the surface was cut into almost innumerable
 trenches of various depths, according to the force of the water
 or the compactness of the lava.
    When we gained the top of a rather steep acclivity called
                                                             Lomo

       Summit of the Peak of Teneriffh        in  February 1829.        29
Lomo    de   la Calavera,   we met with a new barranco running
into an ancient one of the       same name as the hill and about
                                                             ;
three-quarters of a mile from it we came to Barranco Jura-
dillo, which is of an immense breadth and depth.               At the spot
where we crossed it the torrent had divided itself into two
branches, forming a sort of islet in the centre. The sides of
the ravine were composed of various strata of lava and mud
the superior stratum was basaltic trap, occasionally inclined to
a columnar formation; the second was a brown volcanic mud,
about ten feet thick, below which was trap in laminar masses,
volcanic breccia, and a sort of colorific earth.        A  short distance
beyond Juradillo we passed on our left hand a hill of pumice *,
which had been cut down in a perpendicular manner to the
depth of at least eighty feet by the waterspout of 1826.
   The surface now entirely consisted of white rapilli partly
decomposed, and masses of porphyritic lava, occasionally mixed
with veins of pumice in the centre. Some time before we
gained this elevation we found vegetation gradually becoming
less luxuriant and more and more scanty, till here it was re-
duced to one variety only, the mountain broom (Spartium
nubigenum\ which is the last plant of the upper regions, and
indicates the fifth and highest zone of plants. The dry, close,
and ligneous formation of its leaves fully enables it to support
the immense difference of temperature which it is obliged to
undergo every four-and-twenty hours. During the summer
season, in the day-time, the intensity of the solar rays is almost
insupportable on account of the nature of the soil and the
clearness and rarefaction of the air: on the contrary, the
night air is excessively cold and moist. In winter the snow is
permanent for some months, which, joined to the great ele-
vation, produces a cold equal to that of the arctic regions.
   At 10 P.M. we passed a spot called the Ultimo Pino (last
pine), and had a view of the foot of the Peak, which bore W.
by N. of us. The view on our right was a novelty to a person
who was not accustomed to ascend great elevations. The
valleys below were filled with vapours, whilst the sea and the
regions above were quite clear. Objects below were unusually
refracted.      Two brigantines, which were just in the horizon,
presented inverted images of some of their parts; but what was
very singular, they occasionally altered their form: sometimes
   * At this spot the waterspout brought to light two earthen bowls which
had belonged to the Guanches. The possessor of them, Don Lorenzo Ma-
chado, very kindly presented me with one of them    ; it is made of argilla-

 the masts and ship appeared as if they were separated, then
the masts touched each other, and afterwards rapidly increased
in length, presenting quite a distorted appearance. The sea
looked as if it were on a level with the eye; and although it was
four or five miles off, the ripple upon the water was distinctly
visible. This refraction was probably caused by the difference
of temperature between the lower and upper stratum of air
(18° of Fahrenheit), which produced a medium of varied
density; and from the extreme evaporation over the sea, the
refractive power there was small, but gradually increased to
the point of observation, which possibly was its utmost limit,
as after we ascended a few yards this unusual refraction or
mirage went off, and the vessels assumed their usual ap-
pearance.

VI. A direct Method offinding the shortest Distance between
   two Points on the Earth's Surface when their Geographical
   Position is given. By James Ivory, Esq. M.A. F.R.S. fyc*
rT  ,
      HE    geometers who, supposing that the earth is an oblate
 *     elliptical  spheroid of revolution, have investigated rules
for computing the shortest distance between two points on its
surface, usually assume that there are given the two latitudes
and the angle which the geodetical line makes with the meri-
dian of one of the points.         The direct problem for deducing
the geodetical distance from the geographical position of the
two points has not hitherto been solved. In the Conn, des
Terns for 1832, M. Puissant has given formulas which supply
this defect.      But his method merely consists in deriving from
the two latitudes and the difference of longitude, what is
necessary for applying the formula for the shortest distance
published long ago by M. Legendre. I shall here shortly
explain a different solution of the problem, which I lately ob-
tained; according to which the shortest distance of two points
on the earth's surface is expressed by means of their latitudes
and the inclination to the equator of the great circle of the
celestial sphere that passes through them.
   The radius of the equator of an oblate elliptical spheroid
of revolution being represented by unit, and the semipolar
axis by     V — 1     e\ let X denote the latitude of a point on the
surface, and i> the longitude reckoned from a fixed meridian        :
then, if x, y, z be the three coordinates of the point, the ori-

equal to an arc ir of a great circle on the surface of the cir-

titudes, and the same difference of longitude, as the two points

    As this formula is perfectly general, it must comprehend
the case when the two points are on a meridian, that is, when
they are situated in a great circle perpendicular to the equa-
tor.     On this supposition we have sin i                     =     1, cos i      =   0, a   =   A,
a' =   A',   tr  =    A —   x';   and the formula becomes,

which coincides with the usual formula for the length of an
arc on the meridian of an oblate elliptical spheroid.
    The same method of investigation which I have here used
may be applied with advantage to other cases of spheroidical
trigonometry, as I may show on another occasion.

    To  the Editors     of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
"VTOUR        insertion in the Philosophical Magazine of the fol-
 *     lowing notices, occasioned by the perusal of Mr. Bab-
bage's book, will oblige me.             I regret that this communication
was not in time for your Magazine of last month but not hav-        ;
ing been able to obtain an extension of my leave of absence,
which expired on the 30th of May, and being under the neces-
sity of leaving London in order to join my regiment, it was not
in my power to prepare it sooner.                       I am, Gentlemen,
                                                    Your obedient servant,
Charlemont, Ireland, June 6, 1830.                            Edward Sabine.
    1. Being at Paris in the spring of 1827, I received a letter
from Captain Kater, acquainting me that he had ascertained
the value of the divisions of the level of a small repeating
circle, which I had used to observe zenith distances for lati-
tude and time at some of my pendulum stations, to be 10*9
seconds each, instead of single seconds, which Mr. Dollond
the maker had mentioned as their value, when I received the
instrument from him.            I lost no time in recalculating all the
observations made with the circle, and, returning to England
soon afterwards, gave a paper to the Royal Society, and in-
serted a letter in the Philosophical Magazine and Annals *

                                                                                   in

 in both of which I communicated the corrected lengths of the
 pendulum, and the latitudes and showed by their comparison
                                  :
 with those previously calculated, that the differences were
 far too small to have any influence whatsoever on any of the
 deductions in which those results had been or were likely to
be employed. That, in fact, for every practical purpose re-
garding the pendulum experiments in which the circle was
used, it was immaterial whether the divisions of the level were
 considered as single seconds, or as 10*9 seconds each.
    Regarding the divisions as single seconds when observing
with the circle, I had deemed it of less consequence that the
readings of the level should be a precise record, than I should
have done had I known their true value. Satisfied if the
readings should approximate within limits which, as I be-
lieved, would not occasion error of greater amount than the
results were subject to from other causes, I made no comment
beyond the notice of the fact, being occasionally obliged to
employ the circle on supports that were not perfectly stable
or insulated    ;   such as on window sills, &c, such positions
being on those occasions the best within my command.                 For
the same reason I suffered myself greatly to underrate the
real disadvantage I laboured under, in not having, as is usual
in observations with a repeating circle, an assistant, whose
observation should be exclusively given to the level, and who
should read it simultaneously with [the observation at the te-
lescope, to which moment the reading should correspond.
Having both operations to perform myself, I was obliged to
attend to them in succession, and thus to read the level sub-
ject to such small alterations as the changes of my own posi-
tion or other causes might have occasioned in the interim*.
    I may here remark, that had I been acquainted with the
true value of the level at the time, I should still have em-
ployed the circle when I did for it was the best resource
                                      ;
I had, and was amply sufficient for the purposes of the
pendulum, for which alone I required its use. But I should
   * I had trained my servant, who had been with me in the northern
voyages, to render me the assistance alluded to, and other assistance of
the same nature but I had the misfortune to lose his services at Sierra
                  :
Leone, my first station, by the fever of the country, from the effects of
which he ultimately died. Capt. Clavering, in his anxiety to promote the
objects in which I was engaged, endeavoured, as far as he was able, to re-
medy the loss, by supplying me with assistants chosen from amongst the
marines of his ship's company ; but after witnessing the deaths of five
men thus landed at different times for my assistance, I determined from
thenceforward to do the best I could alone, rather than obtain assistance
at such fearful risk to others.
                                                                      not

46            Capt. E. Sabine's Notices occasioned by the
not have deemed the observations made with it, under circum-
stances that necessarily rendered the readings of the level an
approximate instead of an exact record, a specimen of what
the circle was capable of performing when an attention should
be given to the level, commensurate with the greater value of
its   divisions.
    The    circumstance noticed by Mr. Babbage, that some of
the latitudes observed with the circle agree better together
when computed with the smaller and erroneous value of the
level, than when computed with the larger and more correct
value, is a natural consequence of the readings of the level
being approximate and not exact.
    To exemplify this, let it be supposed that the sum of the
readings of the level may have had an accumulated error, in
an extreme case, of ten divisions that is to say, an error of
                                        ;
 + 10 divisions, or of —10 divisions from the truth. Now let
there be observations of two stars, in all respects precisely ex-
act, except that the one star be charged with the positive, and
the other with the negative, error let the number of repe-
                                           ;
titions be 10      : then will the resulting latitudes be charged,
in the one case with an error of -f 1 division of the level, and
in the other case of —1 division.            When the divisions are
reckoned as single seconds, the effect of this error will be to
remove the latitudes 2 seconds apart but with the greater
                                                ;
multiplier of 10*9, they will be removed nearly 22 seconds
apart.
     Hence if there are several observations at a station, and the
observations are good in all respects except in the liability
to error, within the above named limits, in the record of the
level, the latitudes will have very small differences when com-
puted with the small but erroneous value of the level; and
the differences will be increased tenfold in amount when the
larger and more correct value is introduced.
    As might be expected the differences in the recalculated
latitudes are most remarkable at the stations where the sup-
port of the circle was least stable at New York, where it
                                           :
stood in the window of the cupola of Columbia Cottage; at
 Bahia, where it was placed upon a garden table; and at Ma-
ranham, where, although great care was taken in all respects
then deemed of most importance,         —  the position of the circle on
the window sill of the apartment was unfavourable in regard
to stability, and probably influenced the two observations of
aLyrae, which depart each about 10 seconds from the mean*.
 At Spitsbergen, on the contrary, where in addition to the same
                                                                    case

case in other respects as at Maranham, the circle rested on a
firm basis of rock, the recalculation shows that the record of
the level was unusually free from error.                       The observations at

79° 49' 54"-25.
   The mean latitude with the same observations calculated
with the divisions of the level as single seconds is 79° 49' 57"*8.
The recalculation with 10*9 manifests a slight defect in the
vertical adjustment of the circle, which defect was previously-
masked and the observations being separated into northern
          ;
and southern results, are found to agree, with a single excep-
tion, and that not to a great amount, even better than they
appeared     to  do before.
   The    observations with the circle were originally noted down
in pencil on detached pieces of paper                   ;    they were calculated,
and transcribed in the form in which they are printed, either
at the station itself, or on the passage to the next station ; the
transcript was made in duplicate, and one of the copies sent
home. The original pencil record may not always have been
preserved after the transcript was made; and of those then
preserved, some have probably been lost in the years that have
since passed, as I have never had the advantage of a fixed
residence, and have frequently been obliged to move all that
I possessed from place to place.                    I have been so fortunate,
however, as to find several of these original papers in search-
ing in the last few days amongst them are three of the four

There are      also the originals of four of the six latitudes at
Maranham ; one of these is the observation of a Lyras, on the
31st of August, which is. one of the two which differ most
from the mean ; the others are of a Lyras, August 29th
a Cygni, August 31st; and a Gruis, September 2nd. I have
also found the original noting of the observation of a Lyrae,
at Bahia, on the 26th of July 1822, by which I am enabled to
correct the signs in the 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th repetitions
{Pendulum Experiments, page 298), which have been incor-
rectly transcribed      —   instead of 4- ; the summing up of the
           —
column ( 5) which appears as the mean reading of the level
is thus seen to be correct, and the result of the observation
recalculated with 10*9, is 12° 59' 17", instead of 12° 59' 21",
as calculated with single seconds.
   The original papers to which I have referred are now in
Capt. Kater's possession.
   2. When transits are observed with a chronometer, and ir-
regularities of less amount than a beat of four-tenths of a second
are not taken into account in the registry, the times of passage
from wire to wire will be identical in a much greater number
of instances than when the actual time of transit at each wire
is estimated to the tenth of a second, and registered accord-
ingly, as is the case in observatories; but the latter is without
doubt the more exact method of obtaining the absolute time
of transit.     My    purpose, which was simply to determine the
rate of a clock, did not require that I should adopt the best
method of observing absolute transits, but merely that the
method adopted at the commencement should be also em-
ployed at the close.
   3. The purpose for which naval         officers  observe Lunars,          is
usually to ascertain the position of a ship at sea; for that pur-
pose it is not requisite, nor is it customary, to attend to se-
veral particulars in respect to the instrument, the modes of
observation and calculation, on which precision in the re-
                                                                           sult

          Perusal of a late Publication by Mr. Babbage.           49
 suit depends.     My object was different; it was to employ
 Lunars   as a  means of accurate determination of longitude on
 shore; and with that view I neglected nothing that could con-
 duce  to accuracy, either in the observation or in the result.
 I may add, that there can be few naval officers who have had
 so much experience, in that kind of Lunar observation, as I had
already gained before I commenced the observations in 1822,
having before that time published the results of more than two
thousand such observations. Of the seven stations the longi-
 tudes of which I determined by Lunars in 1822, one only, so
far as I know, has been since examined, and the result pub-
lished.    I made the longitude of the Barrack Square in the
Island of Ascension 14° 23' 46"*5 W., being about ten miles
west of the longitude given by Professor Lax, as furnished to
him by the Hydrographic Office, and nearly twenty miles west
of the longitude assigned in the Connaissa?ice des Terns ; which
two publications might with propriety be regarded as the best
authorities of that time.   Capt. Duperrey, who visited Ascen-
sion in 1825, with pendulums, made the longitude of the Bar-
rack Square, by chronometers from St. Helena, 14° 24' 05'''7
and from Tarifa 14° 24' 21 "'2, both determinations being
within one mile of mine, and both still more to the westward.
   4. Those who are conversant with experiments with inva-
riable pendulums know that the accord of partial results is
                                                —
dependent, not on the skill of the observer, for the method
is such as to render the observation nearly independent of in-
dividual skill, — but on the quality of the clock in keeping an
uniform rate in short intervals, and on the means of preserv-
ing an equable temperature.      It is difficult to institute a just
comparison in these respects between the different circum-
stances of different observers.
   There is one case, however, though it is a rare one, which
does permit a comparison; it is when the circumstances of two
observers have been exactly the same.          The last published
part of the Phil. Trans., containing Capt. Ronald's observa-
tions, with No. 4 Pendulum in London, affords such an op-
portunity.     Capt. Ronald was furnished with the same inva-
riable pendulum which I had previously employed          ; he tried
it in the same room, and with the same clock that I had used
the circumstances were as nearly the same as possible, ex-
cept that it was the first time (at least I believe so, for I was
not then in London) that Capt. Ronald had observed with an
invariable pendulum.      Of eleven results obtained by him in
London, there are eight of which the difference from the mean
does not exceed one-tenth of a vibration in twenty-four hours

those which I had obtained under the same circumstances.
I may remark als©, that Capt. Ronald's mean result differs only
one-fiftieth of a vibration in twenty-four hours from the mean
result of my observations.
    Further, if the observations are examined of the many per-
sons, both in this country and elsewhere, in conjunction with
whom I have at different times made pendulum experiments,
amongst whom are several who, though eminent observers in
other respects, were unaccustomed previously to that kind of
observation,  —   abundant evidence is afforded, that the circum-
stances being the same, the accord of the partial experiments
is nearly the same, whether the observer be previously in-<
experienced, or whether he has had, as I undoubtedly have,
the advantage of very considerable practice.

and communicated         to me by Mr. Taylor and   ;       I  have now the
pleasure of sending you these observations, together with                my

 X.    Note on Mr. MacLeay's Abase of the Dichotomous Method
         in Natural History.       By the Rev. Dr. Fleming.
    To  the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
              " Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress ?
               Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
               That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?"
       Gentlemen,
 "XTOUR       Magazine for June having reached me at the or-
  -*-
       dinary period, I proceeded to an examination of its con-
 tents with the usual degree of interest.          The article from the
 pen of Mr. MacLeay " On the Dying Struggle of the Dichoto-
 mous System " naturally attracted my notice, not merely as
 an attack against myself, but as the exhibition of a mode of
 conducting philosophical discussion I had never witnessed
 before.    Whether this new style be calculated to advance the
 interests of science, to increase the respectability of your
 Journal, or to promote friendship among naturalists, must be
 left to the decision of the moral feeling of your readers and
 the public.     In the meantime, however, I may take the liberty
 of stating, that if there be any of your readers capable of re-
lishing such kind of lucubrations, they may blame you for
having, hitherto, neglected to gratify their taste while I assure
                                                         ;
 them that I have no wish to secure their favour.
     The subject of " Methods in Natural History" is one of very
great importance to the interests of science, though hitherto in
this country in a great measure disregarded. Discussions con-
nected with it, and conducted in a suitable manner, could not,
in such circumstances, fail to be useful.          Had Mr. MacLeay,
therefore, confined his attack against me as one who admired
the dichotomous method and held quinarianism in derision,
to the merits of the respective systems, he would have received
the satisfaction of a candid reply ; as I am not aware of hav-
 ing published any opinion which I am afraid to defend, or
 would be ashamed to modify or abandon with increasing know-
ledge.     But Mr. MacLeay, having laid aside the language of
a gentleman, and violated the customary civilities of life, has
compelled me, in due regard to my own character, to pass
over in silence this effusion of his pen, which is probably with-
out a parallel in the records of science.
    As Mr. Vigors has thought proper to appear in connection
with the publication in question, I request him to assure his
friend at Cuba, that he never was the object of my malice or
envy, but that at present he shares largely of my pity.
    Before concluding, I beg to assure your scientific readers,
that I still adhere to the opinions I formerly expressed in my
                                                                "Philo-

          On    the Dying Struggle of the Dichotomous           System.       53
 V Philosophy of Zoology," and more recently in " British
 Animals," respecting the value of the dichotomous or binary
 method in natural history. With regard to the opinions ad-
 vanced in the Quarterly Review, I presume that the Editor
 and his coadjutor are fully qualified to defend themselves, or
 rather that they are disposed to smile at the harmless abuse
 which Mr. MacLeay has thought proper to send forth against
 them. They are accustomed to witness the " dying struggles"
 of harpooned whales. It is indeed their pastime. I am, &c.

 XI. On      the  Dying Struggle of       the Dichotomous System.            By
    W.    S.  MacLeay, Esq. M.A. F.L.S.              In a Letter       to  N. A.
    Vigors, Esq. F.R.S.
                           [Continued from    p. 445.]
 [Upon the reconsideration of this article, we cannot but re-
    gret, in common with many others who take interest in
    the discussion, that so much personality should have been
    introduced into a scientific controversy; and Mr. Mac-
    Leay's paper having been printed entire for private circu-
    lation, we have, in acquiescence with the general opinion,
    omitted, in the continuation which follows, and which will
    be concluded in the next number, many paragraphs, &c,
    irrelevant to the subjects discussed.             The portions of the
    paper, therefore, which our readers have now to peruse,
    must be considered as consisting only of a series of con-
    nected extracts from the original; containing, however, all
    the arguments advanced respecting the Dichotomous System.
    Our opinion of the unfairness of the article in the Quarterly
    Review, had been expressed (See Phil. Mag. and Annals,
    N. S. vol. vii. p. 379.) before Mr. Macleay's paper had been
    received; but what authority our much esteemed friend has
    for ascribing it to Dr. Fleming, is wholly unknown to us.

    edly appeared in our pages *.            Editors.]

54            Mr.   W. S. MacLeay        on the Dyi?ig Struggle
a writer that denies the existence of a single natural method ?
No, says he, I must admit that there are as many natural
methods as there are organs. But where there are an infi-
nite number of methods to effect a given object, such as the
creation, it is clear that there can be no fixed plan.                If the
architect of the kirk of Flisk has in its composition huddled
Grecian and Gothic, Saracen and Scotch, with every other or-
der of architecture together, it is clear he had no plan, and our
worthy minister preaches in the midst of confusion. So also, if
the minister of the said kirk be right, must the creation be a
mass of confusion, without any fixed plan on the part of the
Creator ? And yet he ventures to sneer at one of the most
distinguished of naturalists, and to cite the following lines with
respect to him:
              " But Reason still, unless divinely taught,
                 Whate'er she learn, learns nothing as she ought."
    He talks of demonstrating         that there   is no fixed plan in the
creation.        But how does he do       this?    Because, forsooth, the
locomotive extremities of the horse and cow are represented
by hands in man, fins in the whale, and wings in bats and
 squirrels  ;    because, moreover, teeth may be incisors in one
animal and molars in another, and so on               !
                                                        — therefore, animals
are susceptible of one natural distribution according to their
 locomotive organs, and of others according to their teeth, &c.
 To return to the kirk Supposing it to be built on the most
                             :
 harmonious and uniform plan of Grecian architecture, and to
 be another Parthenon, Dr. Fleming may dichotomize it into
 architraves and not architraves, columns and not columns,
 friezes and not friezes, or any positives and negatives he
 pleases  :
            —  but will he tell us that, because he chooses so to di-
 vide it, therefore the architect had not one plan for the fabric,
 but as many plans as there are terms in architecture? Yet
 such is the reasoning by which he conceives himself forced to
 admit that the Deity had no plan in the creation. Sorry for
 it, very sorry he is; but he assures us there is no remedy.
    But he says, " If unity of method in the creation be admit-
 ted, it will in many cases separate groups from other genera
 with which they are intimately connected ;" and he proves
 this, by the genus Lepus in Zoology and Sambucus in Botany,
 as follows " The hare, in relation to her offspring, exhibits an
               :
 affinity with the horse and sheep while the rabbit, in the same
                                           ;
  relation, claims kindred (as does also the cat) with the opossum
 and kangaroo." Ergo, a natural dichotomous division, accord-
  ing to Dr. Fleming, is into those that at their birth have their
  eyes open, containing the natural group the hare, the horse,
                                                                         and

                      of the Dichotomous System.                   55
and the sheep    ;  and those which have them shut, such as an-
other natural group comprising the rabbit, the cat, the opos-
sum, and the kangaroo        !
    The Doctor's botany is on a par with his zoology ; for says
he, " In any arrangement which contemplated plants according
as their stems were capable of producing flowers and fruit du-
ring many years, or able to produce flowers and fruit once only,
(and the distinction is an important one,) these two species,
the dwarf and the      common elder, would have belonged to dif-
ferent genera   and even different orders." This system of vege-
tables now proposed by Dr. Fleming, is not quite new.          I have
before heard of plants annual, biennial, perennial, and ever-
lastings.   The    credit he deserves, however,  is the original con-
sideration of    it  as a natural method of distribution.    A   simi-
lar system depending on their duration must, without doubt,
be equally natural for animals, and he          will, perhaps, soon
publish, with his usual learning, names for the dichotomous
subdivision of A?iimals immortal, and of Animals not immortal,
in the first of   which groups he places himself.
    In like manner our botanist would naturally class one species
 of willow with arrow-root, because it is monandrous, and an-
other with the ladies' -slipper, because it is diandrous.          All
 methods are equally good, all divisions are the same, and he
 is there ready with his pen to favour all alike with crack-jaw
 names. But enough, and more than enough, of the above ex-
 amples, which according to him prove that there is necessarily
 a rupture of affinities, " when we restrict a genus or species
 to a single place in our physiological system."        If the reader
 does not think it proved, the Doctor asserts that it is, and
 that  is quite sufficient.
     Dr. Fleming has been, I have already said, so far acute
 as to perceive that in order to make the dichotomous divi-
 sion of nature go down, it was certainly necessary in the first
 place to deny all unity of plan in the creation.             So also
  was it absolutely necessary to attack the law of continuity, and
 to deny the Linnaean maxim, " Natura opifex rerum non
 facit saltus";for certainly no method takes such prodigious
 leaps as the dichotomous, which may also be termed, 'par excel'
 lence, the leaping one.        Dr. Fleming indeed admits that the
  law exists when the changes of bodies take place with respect
  to time and space, but says he, " Where is there even the sha-
  dow of proof that the most perfect of created beings must
  previously have gone through all the progressive steps of ad-
  vancement, or that among created beings there is such a gra-
  dual transition from one kind to another as to render it im-
  possible for man to pronounce where the one ends and the
                                                                  other

  56         Mr.  W. S. MacLeay on the Dying Struggle
 other  begins ?"     Now Lamarck never made the first assertion
 as above stated, nor have I ever       made the second and yet
                                                         ;
 both of us acknowledge the law of continuity in natural hi-
 story.
    In the Hone Entomologies I state that " Lamarck had un-
 fortunately from a ready perception of affinities been induced
 to confound natural order, by which is meant the actual regu-
 larity of disposition which exists in nature, with that order of
formation, by which is meant the process of it in time," and
 had thus fallen on that system of progressive development which
 Dr. Fleming now thinks he has so wittily caricatured. Indeed
 every naturalist who has had any perception of affinities be-
 stowed on him by nature as among created beings, observed a
 regularity of disposition and a gradual transition from one
 kind to the other, which, although not such as the Doctor
 above describes it, is nevertheless certain. No one indeed
 can doubt the    fact.  Let Dr. Fleming visit any great museum
 in Paris or  London, let him for once in his life take the scalpel
in hand, let him study such books as the Philosophie Ana-
tomique, and he will soon be sensible how ignorant he has
 been of natural history that is, if there be not some natural
                           ;
imperfection that prevents him from detecting affinities.
    True it is, that chasms occur; but now, thanks to our col-
 lectors, those chasms are comparatively trifling, and moreover
are every day filling up.     As to their being many, it may ap-
pear paradoxical to the Doctor, but I wish to see infinitely
more of them. If indeed those that exist should never be
filled up by the exertions of collectors, we may still safely at-
tribute them either to that extinction of species which has
manifestly been produced by the ancient revolutions to which
the surface of this globe has been at various times exposed,
or to that extinction which has been produced by the hand of
man. Geology, however, according to our author, is opposed
to such bold ideas. Why ? " Because the strata present to the
student the relics of various groups of organized beings,"
a most convincing argument truly      ;  and, secondly, " Because
the fossils of the chalk rocks must not be mingled with those
of the carboniferous limestone, nor with the species which
now exist. All these must be studied as separate systems"         !
That is, the shell of a chalk rock is not a shell if it occurs in
carboniferous limestone, and still something else if it occurs
in Flisk.
    " Greatly   to our annoyance,"     says the Doctor, " nature
occasionally makes a halt     — as   when she    refused retractile
claws to the hunting-tiger "!     So that he does not merely lay
down "    first principles of arrangement founded on abstract
                                                           reason-

reasoning," but, attempts to support them by examples.
Let such men but have the heedlessness to pin themselves
down by an example, and the utter futility of their reasoning
is manifest at once.               He cites the chiitah for a want that only
proves how the genus Felis passes off to the Canine tribe.
And this he calls a halt              !   So also he says, " Nature indulges
in frolicsome leaps, as in passing from the vertebral to the
invertebral animals, and completes the confusion of those who
wish to train her, by bolting off the course to convey man
to his rational throne."                The frolicsome leap from vertebral
to invertebral animals I shall hereafter show to be grounded
on ignorance of zoology. I shall merely now ask any person,
whether naturalist or not.                    Does nature really bolt off her
course in conveying man to the throne of reason ?                         It may be
indeed that her paces are not always equal that I believe to   —
be truly the case; but nevertheless she remains steadily on
the course, and if she has put man on the throne, she has also
placed a series of animals on the steps that lead up to it.
Some persons indeed have doubted, whether those steps on
which she has placed the ourang-outang and some savage
tribes of man, ought upon the whole to be considered the
widest apart; and were it not that man possesses the gift of
speech, they would so doubt with reason.                        There is no occa-
sion, therefore, " to hope for the discovery of a semirational
species to         fill  up the greatest gap that         exists."
    But, after          all,  this has really     little to do with our present
subject,        unless Dr. Fleming be a materialist.                 We     are now
discussing the forms of matter, and unless Dr. F. thinks
that mind is matter, he has no business to bring his reason
upon the carpet. In their corporeal structure the ourang-
                                                     —
outang and negro differ but little it is degrading to think
how little. It has however pleased the Deity to distinguish
man by adding to his body a conscious immaterial being, en-
dowed with a degree of free agency sufficient to render it
morally responsible to             its  Creator.      Bovtevrixov  h povov av8gwTio$

from a world which has furnished us only with senses capable
of distinguishing the various forms of matter.

ON       the elasticity of threads of glass, with some of the most useful-
       applications of this property to various kinds of Torsion Ba-
lances." By William Ritchie, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
    The author proposes the employment of threads of glass in the
construction of torsion balances, in place of the silver wire used by
Coulomb, for the measurement of minute electric or magnetic forces.
He describes a galvanometer of his invention acting upon this princi-
ple, the intensity of the galvanic current being measured by the tor-
sion of a slender filament of glass, to the lower end of which a mag-
netized needle is fixed at right angles.          He also applies the same
power to the improvement of the sensibility of the common balance
for   weighing minute bodies, by affixing to the beam a long glass
thread horizontally in the axis of suspension, by the torsion of which,
when the balance has been brought nearly to a level, the more accu-
rate adjustments are to be effected.        On the whole he considers that
glass, from its perfect elasticity, possesses decided advantages over
metallic wires, for the construction of instruments acting on the prin-
 ciple of torsion.
    " On the quantities of water afforded by springs at various periods
of the year." By J. W. Henvvood, Esq., F.G.S. Communicated by the
 President.
    It has been a matter of dispute, whether the whole of the water
 afforded by such springs as are but little influenced by the change of
 the seasons was derived from rain.        With the hope of elucidating this
 question, the author endeavours to ascertain the comparative quan-
 tities of water yielded by the same spring at different periods ; and to
 obtain simultaneous observations in springs rising in different strata
 and existing at considerable depths in the earth. For this purpose
 he has availed himself of the information contained in a paper by the
  President of the Royal Society, of which an abstract was given in the
 last  number of the Phil. Mag. and Annals, on the performance of
 steam-engines in the Cornish mines. The details of these investigations
 occupy several tables. After making due allowance for the loss of
 water, owing to imperfections in the engine, which he considers as
 nearly balanced by the amount of rain-water which penetrates from
  the surface and is carried off by the adit, he thinks himself warranted
  in assuming the actual quantity of water raised by the engine, as re-
  presenting with sufficient accuracy that which would be naturally
  afforded by the springs of the mine. On comparing the known quantity
  of rain falling in any district with the quantity of water given out by
  its springs, added to that returned to the atmosphere by evaporation
  from the same district, which he estimates according to Mr. Daniell's
  method, he finds the former of these quantities is to the latter nearly
  in the proportion of two to three.       After adverting to the hypothesis
  of the infiltration of sea- water, which might be proposed in explanation
                                                                           of

of this excess in the supply of springs, he remarks that he was not
able to detect the presence of sea-salt in the water from the bottom
of the  mine of Wheal Towan, which he examined         in August 1828.
   " On   the preserved bodies     of aboriginal Peruvian Indians."    By
Dr. Carter.    Communicated by Dr. Granville.
   In this paper a description is given o* the bodies of a female and of
an infant, which were lately found in a state approaching to that of
mummies, at the foot of a hill forming a promontory near Arica, on
the western coast of Peru, and which were sent to England in 1827,
by Dr. Harnett, and are now deposited in the Museum of Natural
History at Haslar. A tradition exists that the desolate spot where
they were dug up was an ancient burying-ground of the aboriginal
inhabitants, although it is certain that no interments have taken place
in it since the first invasion of Peru by the Spaniards. The cloth which
formed the outer envelope of the mummy is of a dark brown colour, and
woven from the wool of the Camelas vicugna. The inner covering is
of a finer texture, and consists of white cotton, either woven or spun,
with blue stripes. The body has been compactly put together, and
doubled up in a square form, with the breast upon the knees j the
arms folded over the abdomen, and the face depressed, so as to occupy
as small a space as possible.       It was strongly confined, by several
turns, with the bejuero, or tough and luxuriant creeping osiers, na-
turally twisted together, and knotted at regular rhomboidal intervals.
Within the case were contained a considerable quantity of leaves of
unknown plants remarkable in having lateral nerves, matte, heads of
Indian corn, pods of capsicum, and two small globular vases.          The
skin of the body had the appearance of dried leather ; the hair was well
preserved, and was collected into long black platted tresses, doubled
over the chest.     Many of the muscles remain, perfectly exsiccated,
but distinctly marked. There was also found in the same place a de-
tached head, apparently that of a female Indian ; and from the pecu-
liar care bestowed on its preservation, probably the wife of a cacique.
The hair is still glossy, and in good preservation, very black, lank,
and coarse, and firmly platted. The brain appears to have been ex-
tracted through the occipital foramen, and its place supplied by some
bituminous substance, filling the cavity of the cranium. The fillets
surrounding the head are terminated by knotted fringes, of differently
coloured worsted, constituting the quissa of the Peruvians ;  —  a species
of symbolical writing not used for Oral tradition, and, in this instance,
serving as a record of the history of the deceased. This head appears
to be much flattened posteriorly, and the frontal bone is also depressed ;
both of which are well known to be characteristic of the skulls of the
aborigines of South America ; and which were probably the result of
artificial compression applied to the head during infancy. The author
then enters into a disquisition respecting the funeral customs of the
Indians, their modes of embalming, and of manufacturing cloths for
interment.     He concludes by a variety of statements illustrating the
 desiccating influence of the atmosphere and soil in those regions,
by which the bodies of men and animals are preserved in a dry state,
 somewhat analogous to that of the Egyptian mummies, for a very
 considerable number of years.

   " Experiments     to determine the quantity of light reflected by plane
metallic specula under different angles of incidence, with a description
of the photometer made use of." By Richard Potter, Jun. Esq. Com-
municated by the President.
   Sir Isaac Newton has stated, that metallic specula, in common with
all other substances, reflect light most copiously when incident most
obliquely.     Some experiments made by the author, with specula of
his   own   construction, having raised doubts in his mind as to the
accuracy of the prevailing opinion on this subject, which accords with
that of Newton and of Bouguer, he instituted a more exact inquiry
into the proportions of incident     and reflected  light from specula at
various angles of incidence.      He  used for this purpose a photometer
resembling that of Bouguer, and consisting of an upright screen, with
a square aperture, across which a piece of thin tissue-paper was ex-
tended, destined to receive on one compartment the reflected light
from one lamp, and on another compartment the direct light from
another lamp, employed as a standard of comparison. By adjusting
the respective distances of the lamps, the lights on the paper were
rendered sensibly equal in point of intensity,      —  the equality being
judged of by the eye, viewing them from the other side. The mea-
surements were taken alternately, first one of the direct, and then
one of the reflected, lights, until a sufficient number of uniform re-
sults were obtained.      The author, after taking every precaution that
occurred to him for ensuring accuracy, invariably found that the pro-
portion of light reflected by metallic surfaces, instead of increasing, di-
minished in pretty regular gradation, as the angle of incidence was aug-
mented. Thus, in the first experiment, when the angle of incidence was
20°, the proportion of the reflected to the incident light was as 69*45
to  1 00, at 40° it was G6/9, and at 60° it was reduced to G4-9 1  . Some
irregularities occurred in the series of results deduced from different
sets of experiments, arising partly from the variableness of the light
given out by the lamps, and partly from the difficulty of preserving
the metallic surface in the highest state of lustre which it has when
newly polished. The author combats the opinion, that the quantities
of light which metals are capable of reflecting when polished are in
the ratio of their densities ; and finds, that in those metals which
were the subjects of his experiments, the quantities of light absorbed,
or lost by reflection, at incidences nearly perpendicular, are almost
exactly in the ratio of their specific heats.
   " On the theoretical investigation of the velocity of sound, as cor-
rected from M. Dulong's recent experiments, compared with the results
of the observations of Drs. Moll and Van Beck." By Dr. Simons, as-
sistant at the observatory of Utrecht.
   Laplace has demonstrated, that Sir Isaac Newton's formula for ob-
taining the velocity of sound, requires, in order to render it correct,
that it be multiplied by a certain co-efficient, depending on the ratio
between the specific heats of atmospheric air under a constant pressure
and under a constant volume.         Laplace has endeavoured to deduce
this co-efficient, first  from the experiment of MM. de la Roche and
Beiard ; secondly, from those of MM. Clement and Desormes } and       -
lately from the more accurate investigations of MM. Gay-Lussac and
                                                                   Welter.

Welter.     By applying this correction, the velocity of sound deduced
from calculation corresponded very nearly with the result of actual
experiment. Still, however, a degree of discordance was always found
to take place.   With a view to perfect the theory still further, Dulong
attempted, by reversing the process of Laplace, to deduce the co-
efficient by which the Newtonian formula is to be multiplied, directly
from experiments themselves. The object of the present paper is to
compare the investigation of Dulong with the experiments on the
velocity of sound made by Drs. Moll and Van Beck, of which an ac-
count has lately been published in the Phil. Trans. By applying the
values of the co-efficients thus obtained, the computed velocities of
sound came out much nearer to the observed velocities 3 and the
author concludes by remarking, that such differences as yet remain
between calculation and experiment, may, with great probability, be
ascribed to the errors which are unavoidable in observations of so com-
plicated a nature.
   "On the occurrence of Iodine and Bromine in certain mineral
waters of South Britain."      By Charles Daubeny, M.D. F.R.S., Pro-
fessor of Chemistry in the University of Oxford.
   The author lays claim to being the first who announced to the
public the existence of bromine in the mineral springs of England        :
a discovery similar to that which had been previously made by others
in many analogous situations on the continent.           His reason for
offering the present communication to the Royal Society is, that he
has examined on the spot a great number of mineral springs, and en-
deavoured to obtain, wherever it was practicable, an approximation
to the proportion which iodine and bromine bear to the other ingre-
dients.    He has also aimed at forming an estimate of their compara-
tive frequency and abundance in the several rock-formations ; an ob-
ject of considerable interest in geology, as tending to identify the
products of the ancient seas, in their most minute particulars, with
those of the present ocean. The results of his inquiries are given in
the form of a table, in which the springs, whose waters he examined,
are classified according to the geological position of the strata whence
they issue, and of which the several columns exhibit the total amount
of their saline ingredients the nature and proportion of each ingre-
                             ;
 dient, as ascertained by former chemists, or by the author himself;
and, lastly, where they contained either iodine or bromine the ratio
 these substances bear to the quantities of water, and likewise to the
 chlorine also present in the same spring.     He finds that the propor-
 tion of iodine to chlorine varies in every possible degree ; and that
 even springs which are most strongly impregnated with common salt,
 are those in which he could not detect the smallest trace of iodine.
 The same remark, he observes, applies also to bromine ; whence he
 considers, that although these two principles may, perhaps, never be
 entirely absent where the muriates occur, yet their relative distribu-
 tion is exceedingly unequal.     The author conceives that these ana-
 lyses will tend to throw some light on the connexion between the
 chemical constitution of mineral waters and their medicinal qualities.
 Almost the only two brine springs, properly so called, which have
                                                                  acquired

 acquired any reputation as medicinal agents, namely, that of Kreutz-
 nach in the Palatinate, and that of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicester,
 shire, contain a much larger proportion than usual of bromine,                        —
 substance, the poisonous quality of which was ascertained by its dis-
 coverer, Balard. The author conceives that these two recently found
 principles exist in mineral waters in combination with hydrogen,
 forming the hydriodic and hydrobromic acids, neutralized, in all pro-
 bability, by magnesia, and constituting salts, which are decomposable
 at a low temperature.             He has no doubt that a sufficient supply of
 bromine .night be procured from our English brine springs, should it
 ever happen that a demand for this new substance were to arise.

     June     1. —The President, Lord Stanley,            in the chair.
     Read; the commencement of a paper by J. O. Westwood, F.L.S.,
 &c. upon the Paussidce, a family of coleopterous insects.
     The objocts which Mr. Westwood has selected for his communica-
 tion, form, perhaps, the most interesting family of Beetles, not only
 from the extremely singular and anomalous structure of some of their
 most material organs (especially the antennae, which in some of the
 insects are larger than the head and thorax together, and composed
of only two joints) ; but also from the circumstance of the typical
 genus constituting the final entomological labour of the immortal
Linnaeus, whence, as some authors have imagined, the generic name.
Paussus was derived from the Latin pausa, a pause or full stop.
    The species are inhabitants of the tropical regions of the old world,
and do not exceed half an inch in length.
    A paper was read before the Linnsean Society in 1798, upon these
insects, by Professor Afzelius, to whom five species only were known.
Mr. Westwood has, however, described twenty-three species (besides
several others which have been incorrectly placed in the family,) in-
cluding several new genera.

     Mr. Westvvood also mentions the Hispa bihamata of Linnaeus as
supposed to belong to the family, and has also given the characters
of a new genus, which he names Megadeuterus, related to the Te-
 lephoridae, containing two species, the type of which is the Paussus
flavicorms, Fab. The drawings exhibited in illustration of the paper,
 comprised fifty-five figures of species and their anatomical details,
 including representations of all the genera and new species described
 by the author.
     A paper by John Morgan, Esq. F.L.S. was read, in which the au-
 thor described some anatomical peculiarities which he had met with
 in the   organs of deglutition in several of the order Rodentia.
     It appears that in the Capybara (Hydrochcerits Capybara), as well
 as in some of its congeners, Mr. Morgan has found a singular de-
 velopment of the velum palati, or membrane interposed between the
 mouth and throat, to which he has assigned functions different from
 those which are attributed to this structure in any other class of
  animals. After noticing the very extensive grinding surfaces of the
  molar teeth of the Capybara, and the necessity for such an arrange-
  ment of parts in the masticating organs of an animal living occasi-
  onally upon hard vegetable substances, and possessing a simple sto-
  mach, as in the case of this species, the author proceeded to show that
  the complete mastication of the food is not only provided fovbythe form
  and extent of the    teeth, but that it is rendered absolutely indispensable
  to the passage of nutriment from the        mouth to the stomach, by the pe-
  culiar conformation of the velum palati, which occupying the whole
  area of the passage through the fauces, would form a complete sep-
  tum between the mouth and pharynx, but for the existence of a
  small circular aperture in its centre, through which the food is al-
   lowed to pass. The velum palati thus formed assumes the shape of
   a cone or funnel, during the act of swallowing, from the pressure of
   the food against its anterior surface, and the smaller end or apex of
   this funnel, which is terminated by the central aperture, is thrust
   backwards into the cavity of the pharynx beyond and above the open-
   ing of the glottis, to which part it thus offers additional protection.
   A sort of membranous strainer is thus produced, through the small
   aperture of which the grosser particles of unmasticated food are pre-
   vented passing from the organs of mastication to those of digestion.
   The muscles attached to these parts were also particularly described.

 the head of the genus. The characters distinguishing the subdivisions,
 or phalanges, he draws from the anatomy of the wing, and from the
 general construction, particularly of the posterior wing. He names the
 phalanges as follows : Equites, Heliconii, Danai, Nymphales, Satyri,
 Morphi, Plebeii, Urania. The paper concludes with some remarks
 upon the innovations which have been made upon theLinnsean System,
 confined chiefly to Lepidopterous insects.

   A Paper was read, entitled " Sketches explanatory of Geological
 Maps of the Archduchy of Austria and of the South of Bavaria j" by
Ami Boue, M.D. For. Mem. G.S. &c.
   The accompanying maps of the Archduchy of Austria and of Ba-
varia were made during repeated visits to those countries, and partly
with the assistance of M. Partsch of Vienna.
   The author premises that in consequence of his last visit in 1829
he has changed some classifications, and rectified certain errors which
appear in his former works.
   I. Structure of the Archduchy of Austria.   —  Dr. Boue" describes the
principal part of Austria as consisting of the primary chain of South-
ern Bohemia on the north, and of the great secondary calcareous
Alpine chain on the south, which are separated from each other by
the tertiary and alluvial valley of the Danube.       He divides this last
region into three parts  :
   1. The molasse and alluvial basin of Upper Austria, extending from
Bavaria to near Blindenmarkt and St. Leonhard.
   2. The basin of St. Polten, containing shelly sand, sandstone, marl,
alluvial marl, and gravel.
   3. The basin of Vienna, which is now united with that of St. Polten
by a narrow gorge of the Danube.
   The direction of the primary chain of Bohemia is from south-west
to north-east j gneiss being the predominant rock, with some sub-
ordinate masses of granular limestone and diorite. Granite occurs in
the western, and sienite, leptinite, and serpentine in the eastern part
of this range.   The central ridges of the Alps are primary, and these
are succeeded, in an ascending order, by talco-quartzose rocks, distin-
guished by masses of compact limestone with iron ore. Between the
preceding' rocks and the escarpments of the Alpine limestone, are an-
cient longitudinal valleys, which certain rivers occupy in their early
course, and afterwards quitting abruptly, run at right angles
through newer and transverse rents in the secondary formations. At
the base of the Alpine limestone, and subordinate to it, are red sand-
stone and shale, with gypsum, but without porphyry. This group
can be traced from Mont Blanc to Hungary, and it again appears
                                                                       in

in the Tatra, or northern Carpathians.         The Alpine limestone    is  cha-
racterized generally by organic remains         common    to the superior se-
condary formations, such as belemnites, ammonites, nautili, echini,
and many zoophytes ; but accurate subdivisions of it are made with
great difficulty.
   One of the most important of these subdivisions is marked by the
presence of salt and gypsum, which are found in shale, associated
with gray sandstone and limestone, containing belemnites, ammonites
and fuci ; and in some places, as at Hallein, with orthoceratites and
madreporic limestone.
   Dolomite prevails in the upper part of the Alpine limestone, and is
usually connected with peculiar anomalies of stratification and incli-
nation, which according to the author offer evidence of the rupture and
friction of the displaced masses    ; the whole having, he conceives, been
elevated and depressed by the action of subterranean gaseous forces.
   Another member of the Alpine limestone is characterized by lead
and  iron ores.
   The Alpine limestone passes      into a superior sandstone (designated
as " Vienna sandstone"), with alternations of marl and schistose litho-
graphic limestone and whetstones. This part of the series contains
coal at Greater Ipsitz, &c. with cycadese and in other places this group
                                             ;
is capped by ruiniform, compact limestone, with ammonites, belem-
nites, and fucoides. (St. Veit, Sontagsberg, Elixhausen, &c.)
   Serpentine and greenstone traverse secondary sandstone at Ipsitz,
and both sandstone and Alpine limestone at Willendorff.
   The author then proceeds to identify certain rocks having a similar
mineralogical character, whether in the northern Carpathians, where
they rest upon the "Vienna sandstone", or at Griinbach near Vienna,
where they are stated to contain belemnites and Ananchytes ovata,
with the formations of Gosau-thal, which Messrs. Sedgwick and Mur-
chison, he states, have erroneously described as tertiary. He does not
admit that this deposit of Gosau can be considered as intermediary
between the secondary and tertiary formations, but he assigns to it
the place of the lowest secondary green-sand.
   The tertiary character of many of the remains is not considered by
him to prove the age of this deposit, for he states that some fossils in
the oldest secondary rocks at Hale, Bleiberg, and Maibel in Carinthia,
have also a tertiary appearance.
   The true green-sand of the Alps is then described ; and the author
identifies the iron ores of Sonthofen with those of the Kressemberg,
which Count Munster, as well as Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison,
has considered tertiary*.
   Chalk is stated not to exist in the German Alps, though the lower
green-sand of Gosau contains beds like the Planer Kalk or upper green-
   * In this part of the paper Dr. Boue has been led into an error in conse-
quence of misunderstanding a passage in the abstract of a communication
by Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison, published in the Phil. Mag. and Annals
for January 1830, p. 53.     The deposit of Sonthofen was never considered
tertiary ; but on the contrary, was distinctly stated by them to be secondary.

 sand.     The tertiary deposits of Austria are stated to  belong entirely
 to the superior division of that great class of rocks,    and the author
 asserts that they in no case enter into the Alpine regions, except on
 the eastern side, viz. in the drainage of the Mur, the Scive, and the
 Drave, where they occupy ancient longitudinal valleys.
     Haring, described by Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison as an an-
 cient estuary, or area of the great tertiary sea of Bavaria, is consi-
 dered by the author to be a continental local freshwater formation.
    The lowest tertiary formations of Austria are, he says, characterized
 by blue, shelly marl, and marly, shelly molasse (Schlier), which he
 assimilates to sub-apennine marl.
     In lower Austria this blue marl is succeeded by sands, marls, lig-
 nite, and shells, both marine and fluviatile, and these again by gravel
 and conglomerate, and lastly by nummulite and coralline limestone,
 alternating with sands and conglomerates, which separate the true
 tertiary basins of Vienna and Hungary from the deposits of the allu-
 vial period.
    The   oldest alluvial gravel follows many   Alpine valleys in the form
 of terraces, and the    same is extended with beds of marl far into the
 actual valleys of the Danube and the March, and also into the plains
 of Hungary, where bones of extinct quadrupeds and terrestrial shells
 are found in it.
    It is in the marl of this old alluvium near Krems that the human
 skulls have been found, which have been described by Count Breunner.
 The author remarks on the peculiar form of these skulls, and their
 resemblance to those of the Caribs and Chilians, &c.; also that he has
 himself found human skulls in alluvial marl of the same age at Lahr
 in the valley of the Rhine.
    II. Structure of the south of Bavaria.    — The south of Bavaria is
 chiefly occupied by an extensive tertiary basin, from 1 600 to 2000
feet above the level of the sea, which is bounded by the primary range
of Bohemia and the German Jura on the north, by the Alpine chain
on the south ; whilst it communicates with the tertiary deposits of
Vienna and Hungary by the valley of the Danube, and with the
molasse of Switzerland on the west.
    The German Jura offers no fissures or transverse valleys by which
 this basin of Bavaria could have communicated with the Neckar and
the Maine j and at the period of the tertiary deposits this great de-
pression must have been equally shut out from all communication
with the Mediterranean, by the intervention of the Alpine chain, which
the author, differing from M. Von Buch, has in former memoirs de-
monstrated to have been elevated at various periods ; an idea which
has subsequently been adopted and enlarged upon by M. Elie de
Beaumont.
    The German Jura contains also the subdivisions    of the oolitic series,
from lias up to Stonesfield slate and cornbrash,      viz. — 1. Lias with-
out the white beds. 2. Lias marl. 3. Lias sandstone. 4. Inferior
oolite, with iron ores.      5. Great oolite, mostly compact.     6. Dolo-
mitic limestone.      7. Calcareous slate of Solenhofen, with tortoises,
fishes, Crustacea, sepiae, ammonites, belemnites, lepadites, insects, and
vegetables.                                                           Upon

    Upon   this system of Jura limestone there are small patches of iron
 and green-sand     at Ratisbon and elsewhere.     In this deposit, asso-
 ciated with argillaceous marl, are found the pisiform iron ores, or
 Bohnerz of the Germans, concretionary masses of siliceo-calcareous
 millstone, with many univalve shells and corals (Natheim), and
beautifully zoned, chalcedonic nodules, or kugel jaspis, with echini
                                                          •
and microscopic shells (near Basel).
    The author agrees with Mr. Schiibler that it is essential to distin-
guish this deposit of Bohnerz from those alluvial accumulations with
iron ore made up of the detritus of older rocks, and in which are
found the bones of many extinct quadrupeds. (Kanderu, Haiberg near
Tutllingen, &c.)
   The Alpine chain south of the tertiary basin of Bavaria is consti-
tuted of materials nearly the same as in its range through Austria;
viz.   1. A base of red-sandstone and conglomerate.       2. Lower lime-
stone with fishes (Seefeld).    3. Gray sandstone and shale with salt
and gypsum. 4. Gray dolomite and oolite. 5. Sandstone of Vienna,
which though thin and obscure at Salzburg and Sonthofen, expands
into a vast formation in its westward range into the Voralberg.
6. Green-sand, filling cavities in the Vienna sandstone, from which
it is separated by conglomerates made up partly of Alpine limestone,
but chiefly of primary rocks, which are not found in situ nearer than
the Black Forest. The author conceives this conglomerate to be of
the same age as those at the base of the Gosau formations, and in
the Allgau; and he further identifies with it the Nagelfluh of Switz-
erland, which, although hitherto considered tertiary, he places in the
lower green-sand ; and as proofs of this he cites the existence of a
similar conglomerate or Nagelfluh on the summit of the Voisons near
Geneva, and also near Saanen, where it overlies and is united with
what he considers to be the equivalent of the Vienna sandstone.
   The green-sand of the Allgau consists of marls and calcareous sands
of various colours containing plants, with here and there subordinate
masses of true green-sand, having some characteristic fossil shells of
that formation, and iron ore.
   For the details of the tertiary rocks of Bavaria the author refers to
his last work (Geologische Gemalde von Deutschland).         In speaking
of the vast alluvial accumulations which encumber this basin, he re-
marks that the debris are all primary near the primary chain of
Bohemia, and secondary on the flanks of the Alps or Jura. Erratic
boulders of large size are spread out in lines, and extend to some
distance in front of the mouth of the valley of the Rhine ; whilst lesser
detritus only is found at the debouchure of the Inn. According to the
author the elevatory forces which so greatly affected the western Alps
must have operated less powerfully upon the eastern prolongation of
these mountains.
   Alluvial marl, as in Austria, covers the sides of the Danube in its
course through Bavaria ; and all the lower regions of the latter country
offer innumerable proofs of various changes during the alluvial period
in the successive drainage of lakes, and in the alteration of the course
of rivers.

               —
   March 26. Mr. Brooke on the principles of the doctrine of life
contingencies.      Mr. Brooke developed the manner in which from
time to time the probabilities of life had been deduced by the Go-
vernment and by Life-assurance companies, explaining his statements
by reference to tables and to many curious and singular facts in the
philosophy of population.
   April 2. —  Mr. Ainger on the theory of the radiation of heat. Mr.
Ainger's point was to explain a difficulty in M. Prevost's theory of the
radiation of heat, dependent upon the manner in which surrounding
objects frequently influenced the apparent quantity of radiation from
a given central heated body, as a thermometer, in complicated and
frequently unperceived ways.      By taking into account the tempera-
ture of all these bodies, and the reflective as well as radiating power
of such as were important, he showed that the difficulty really had no
existence. He pointed out also by an experiment, that a given body
with a constant temperature and surface might appear either hot or
cold to the same thermometer according to the temperature of the
surfaces, the rays from which would be intercepted by the body and
prevented from impingeing on the thermometer.
   There were no meetings in Passion and Easter weeks.
   April 23. —   Mr. Faraday on the flowing of sand under pressure.
This was an experimental account of the very curious experiments
made by M. Huber Burnand on the intermediate properties which
sand exhibited between those of solid and fluid bodies. Sand pre-
pared so as to be uniform and free from dust will flow in the air at
angles above 30 or 32 degrees, but not at smaller angles.      Sand put
into a box or reservoir and allowed to flow out at an aperture, either
in the bottom or side, amounts to the same quantity passed, whatever
the head of sand may be, or whatever the pressure there exerted, be-
ing in this respect quite unlike fluid ; so that perhaps it may be made
to constitute a moving force probably more independent of deranging
causes than any other which can be devised. When a perpendicular
tube is filled with sand, very little of the weight is borne by the bot-
tom of the tube ; indeed only so much as would equal the weight of
a cone of sand standing on that bottom ; but nearly the whole is
supported by the sides. If a tube an inch in diameter be filled for
about six inches or more with sand, and laid horizontally, all attempts
to push the sand out of the tube by a stick of nearly the same dia-
meter will fail. These and many more curious facts, with their ge-
neral principles and applications, were explained and illustrated.
   April 30. —   Dr. Clarke on the ascent and descent of Mont Blanc.
Dr. Clarke had on a former evening given an account of his ascent up
 Mont Blanc he now concluded his account, and went at considerable
               ;
length into the geology and botany of the mountain. His obser-
vations were illustrated by numerous specimens of minerals and plants,
and also by drawings.

   May 7. Mr. Faraday gave an account of the triangulation which
has been proceeding in Ireland for some years past, under the direc-

North of Ireland, upwards often miles in length. This base has been
measured by a set of beautiful compensation bars, devised by Col.
Colby, and executed in the most perfect manner by Mr. Troughton.
Two metals are used in their construction, which support cross bars
at their extremities, upon which dots are marked that never change
in their distance from each other, whatever change of temperature the
apparatus itself undergoes. These dots are observed by microscopes
themselves supported on compensation systems. The beauty and
perfection of the apparatus, the minuteness of work, and the accuracy
of performance, were illustrated by two bars, out of a set of six, which
are in course of construction by Messrs. Troughton and Sims, under
the orders of the East India Company, and are to be placed in the
hands of Capt. Everest for the purpose of an exact survey in the
East. Mr. Faraday drew his instruction this evening from Capt.
Drummond and Lieut. Portlock, two officers who have been exten-
sively engaged in the Irish measurement.
               —
    May 14. Mr. Burnett on the operation of lithotrity, with the
history of the discoveries of Le Roy, Civiale, Heurteloupe, &c. &c.
 Baron Heurteloupe's apparatus was upon the table, and also that of
 M. Civiale ; and the general principles of the operation were shown, in
 various ways, upon different calculi.       Several cases were adduced to
 show the value of this great discovery in modern surgical practice.
               —
    May 21 Mr. Faraday on the application of a new principle in the
             .
 construction of musical instruments.          The principle here referred
 to is that which has lately been so popular in the small musical in-
 struments called iEolinas. A spring generally in the form of a pa-
 rallelogram being fastened at one end to a plate with an aperture
 of corresponding size, so as nearly to fill the latter, is put into iso-
 chronous vibration when the breath is urged past it, and produces mu-
 sical sound.    The laws of the vibrations of rods and springs were re-
 ferred to, and then all the instruments which have been constructed on
 this principle, from the ancient Chinese organ to Mr. Day's iEolian
 organ, were produced and explained amongst them were of course
                                           :
 the iEolina and Mr. Wheatstone's orchestrion, the fingering and
 powers of which were fully explained. Each instrument had its ca-
 pabilities exhibited by performances.        Mr. Wheatstone supplied the
 philosophy of the evening.
               —
     May 28. Capt. Manby on the means of preserving lives in cases
 of shipwreck, and on a new practical mode of hauling life-boats, &c.
 through the surf. Capt. Manby gave an account of his own apparatus
 for these important purposes, and illustrated it by experiments and
  drawings. That part which related to the preservation of shipwrecked
  mariners is already before the public ; but his method of hauling a boat
  off from shore is new, and is said to have been found useful.      An an-
  chor with a buoy to it is laid out at any previous time beyond the line
  of surf, a block is fastened to the buoy so that it cannot turn, a rope is
  passed through this block and both ends brought onshore; but to
  prevent the rope sinking into the sand, a small buoy is made fast
                                                                          to

this  buoy carries a loop, and through that loop the other part of the
rope passes. A boat made fast to one end of this rope is easily
hauled through the surf, and can then proceed to give assistance to a
 ship in distress.
    June 4.— Mr. Brockedon on the perception and application of co-
lour.     Mr. Brockedon's observations related to the manner in which
the eye perceived colours, with their agreement and disagreement,
and to some of the compensating forces appointed by nature to pre-
vent distress to that organ when under the influence of bright colours.
After remarks upon the complementary colours, with apparatus and
diagrams illustrating their principal properties, he proceeded to con-
sider the nature of ocular spectra, which are always complementary
to the colours that occasion them. This he seemed inclined to consi-
der as the result of a natural effort in the eye to relieve itself from the
undivided influence of any one bright colour ; and he referred to the
beautiful structure of minute parallel lines, observed and figured by
Mr. Bauer, in his drawings of the part immediately over the retina.
These lines are governed by muscles which can alter their distance         ;
and thus if the analogy between them and the colours of mother-of-
pearl or Barton's engraved plates may be admitted, allow of altera-
tions, which, excited by the influence of coloured rays entering the
eye, may cause the appearance of the complementary spectra.
    Mr. Brockedon advanced these suggestions very modestly, and only
as he said to excite others to inquiry.
    June 1 1  .
                — On the laws of coexisting vibrations of strings and rods.
This was one of the series of evening communications, given at this In-
stitution by Mr. Faraday, the matter and illustrations of which are sup-
plied by Mr. Wheatstone. The separate vibrations of a string as a whole,
or as subdivided by nodal points, were first shown, and then the co-
existence of two or more modes of vibrations in the same string, and
the consequent form of the string in different parts of its vibration,
illustrated    by diagrams.    Then the manner in which rods vibrated
either in the lowest or in    any higher mode was shown, and reference
here made again to the coexisting vibrations, and to their combination
also with motion of a more general and ordinary kind.
    The experiments of Dr. Young were then referred to, in which he
observed the figure of the orbit described by any part of a vibratory
string, by remarking the line described by light reflected from it, after
which the Kaleidophone of Mr. Wheatstone was resorted to for further
illustration of these effects.     This instrument consists essentially of
an   elastic steel wire, twelve or fourteen inches long, fixed firmly in a
vice or foot at    one end, and at the other furnished with a round me-
tallic bead. This serves as a convex mirror, and if held in the sun's
rays or near a single light, as a lamp or candle, reflects a spot to the
eye.     When the wire is made to move, the spot describes an orbit
of various shapes according to the path of the end of the wire; and
if vibrations be inflicted on the wire, either by tapping it with the
finger or bv drawing a violin-bow along it, these are rendered visi-
                                                                       ble,

  Society  of General Practitioners in Medicine and Surgery. 71
ble, by the forms which they impart to the orbit.       The application
of this instrument to the demonstration of coexisting vibrations was
then made, in many ways.
   Mr. Faraday also referred to certain new and curious forms ob-
served when the eye has a motion given to it, either perpendicular to
or across the path of the vibrations ; a compound result of the motion
of the eye with the motion of the vibrations, or moving particles is
obtained, which is more or less oblique according to the ratio of the
velocities of the two motions.     It is expected that extremely rapid
motions, defying all ordinary examination, may in this way be mea-
sured ; but as the subject is at present under consideration, it will be
returned to very shortly.
   The meeting then adjourned for the season.
  SOCIETY OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS IN MEDICINE AND
                                SURGERY.
   The following Prospectus    of a plan has been circulated of a " Me-

signed William Gaitskell, President.
   " While almost all public bodies, whether professional or commer-
cial, form associations, corporations, or companies for the purposes
of legislating for their mutual protection and for the advancement of
their prosperity, it is found that no association of the numerous class
of medical men comprehended under the term General Practitioners,
has yet in any manner been formed for the protection of their parti-
cular interests.

NOTES ON A LETTER ADDRESSED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE
 ROYAL SOCIETY TO THE PRESIDENT. BY C.BABBAGE,ESQ.F.R.S.
" HHHE Secretary of the Royal Society, in a letter addressed to the
    •*•    President *, proposes to refute a charge I have made against
the Royal Society in my late work ' On the Decline of Science in
England.'
   " If the facts stated in that book are correct, explanation    is difficult,
refutation impossible.
   " The case is shortly this      :
   " The Secretary either did write down the rough minutes of its pro-
ceedings during the meeting of the Council on the 26th November,
J829, or he did not.
   " If he did not, they must have been written from memory. Is any
argument necessary against such an unheard-of course ?
   " If the Secretary wrote the rough minutes during the sitting, he
must have written down the name of Captain Beaufort, which he
admits was the one decided upon and it was impossible that he could
                                        ;
know of Captain Beaufort's refusal until late the next day, because
that gentleman did not communicate to the President his intention of
declining the nomination until that time.         .
   " The paper preserved amongst our records which professes to be the
rough minute of the Council of the 26th November, is a single folio half-
sheet, written on both sides ; towards the middle of the second page
are the names of the persons recommended. If that of Captain Beau-
fort were found in this list with a line drawn through it by the pen,
and that of Sir John Franklin substituted, it might have been argued
that although the subsequent alteration of a rough minute was highly
irregular, yet it could give no just ground to suppose that it was in-
tended to conceal from the Society the fact of the refusal.
   " But any member of the Royal Society may satisfy himself that the
name of Captain Beaufort has never been written on that paper. I
confess I can see no alternative but to suppose, either that the paper
containing those minutes was written from memory subsequently to
the date it bears    —  or that it is not a genuine document.
   " The Secretary has accused me of ' not having chosen to take the
slightest pains to inquire into the truth of an accusation,' and also
with having drawn the ' sweeping conclusion that the whole of the
minutes are unworthy of the least confidence.' To the last of these
charges I can only say that I shall be obliged by his pointing out the
passage in which it occurs. To refute the first, I shall adduce an evi-
dence which the Secretary will be the last to dispute;      — Dr. Roget has

himself undertaken to assure the world that I have spent an immense
                                                      '
 time in ransacking the records of the Society, with an industry worthy
of a better cause.'
    '
      ' I perfectly agree with      the Secretary, that it is becoming in those
who bring forward charges, to attend to the accuracy even of the most
trifling    circumstances which are connected with them and now that
                                                                  ;
the minutes of the Councils (of the dates to which he has referred) are
entered, I perceive that there is no entry of any Council held on the
 11th of February. That officer possessed better opportunities than
myself of knowing the fact that a Council was summoned for that day
by order of the President, and that it did meet in consequence of that
summons. The Secretary is therefore inaccurate when he states that
' no Council was
                        held on that day.' And the circumstance of his having
neglected to enter its meeting in the Council book, and that the only
business it transacted probably was to resolve itself immediately into
a Committee of Papers, cannot prevent a meeting regularly summoned
from having been a Council            ; nor if it could, ought it to be urged, at
least by him, as a reproach to me, had 1 fallen into a mistake. In fact,
 as on the 6th of March, the minutes of the Council of the 4th of Fe-
                 1
bruary and 1 1th of March had not been entered, I could only know of
the existence of a Council on the 1 th of February, by inquiring of the
                                           1
Assistant Secretary if he had been directed to summon one, to which
 he replied in the affirmative.
    "Whether these are ' the only instances of inaccuracy in the minutes'
 I have been able to adduce, can scarcely be within the knowledge of
 the Secretary; time may enable him to correct that opinion.               What-
 ever value may be attached to the explanation he has given, the accu-
 racy of my facts are fully admitted by all            : indeed, in the statement
 made by the President at one of the ordinary meetings of the Royal
 Society, he not only fully admitted their correctness, but most can-
 didly added that it was quite natural that, in my ignorance of the ex-
 planation he was then about to offer, I should have viewed the subject
 as I had done.

                June 17, 1830.
      OBSERVATIONS BY DR. ROGET, IN REPLY TO MR. BABBAGE.
      " Mr. Babbage has printed a Paper in reply to my refutation of
 his charges against me, upon which I beg to make a few obser-
 vations.          A slight attention to the arguments contained in the first
 part of it will show, that they all proceed upon the gratuitous as-
 sumption that the Paper which I gave to the Assistant Secretary, to
 copy into the Minute-book, and which Mr. Babbage says pro-                 '
 fesses to be the rough minutes," is the identical Paper written at the
 Council on the 26th of November.                   This it neither is, nor ever
 professed to be.          Every one conversant with business must know,
  that    it is  generally impossible, during the time of a meeting, to take
  down more than the heads of what is to form the minutes; and
  that on many occasions it is requisite that the minutes, in order
  that they may accurately express the sense of the meeting, should

be afterwards written out more fully and more deliberately. At
the meeting in question, a rough minute was of course taken
down and it did contain the name of Captain Beaufort. That
       ;
minute was afterwards corrected, as I have already sufficiently ex-
plained in my letter to the President.        The rough draft itself, be-
ing then of no use, was destroyed.       The Paper which the Assistant
Secretary has in his possession, and which Mr. Babbage has mis-
taken for the original rough draft, is the fair copy of this cor-
rected minute.      The whole of his reasoning built upon this erro-
neous supposition falls, therefore, to the ground. Had he, both
in this and in other instances, taken the trouble to inquire into
the truth of facts from the persons capable of giving him the
most accurate information, namely from the Secretaries them-
selves, he would have escaped committing this error, and been
spared the pain he must surely feel at having brought forwards
 groundless accusations    : nor would he have hazarded the insinua-
tion, that it was intended to conceal the fact of Capt. Beaufort's
 refusal to be nominated on the Council     ;  than which, it is scarcely
 necessary to say, no charge can be more void of foundation.
    " The same direct course of inquiry would also have prevented
the incorrect statements contained in the latter part of his reply.
 Had it occurred to him that the persons most likely to give him ac-
 curate information respecting the meeting of the Committee of the
 1 lth of February were those who were present at it, he might have
 saved himself the trouble of reiterating his imaginary charges, and
 of accumulating hypotheses to sustain them.         Instead of assuming
 that the Council must necessarily have met, merely because it had
 been summoned ; and that having met, it must have transacted
 business ; and that ' the only business it transacted probably was
 to resolve itself immediately into a Committee of Papers ;' and that
 a minute of such transaction ought to have been made; and that,
 consequently, the Secretary must have been guilty of negligence
 in not entering such minute    ;
                                  — he would have learned the real fact,
 that no meeting of the Council was held at all. The President stated
 at the time, that as there was no business to come before the Council,
 he had given orders to summon a Committee only, and not a
 Council; but a summons for the latter had, by accident, accom-
 panied that for the Committee.         The Council' therefore held no
            —
 meeting; the mace was not placed upon the table;— there was
                           —
 no business transacted, no resolving of itself into a Committee,
 —                             —
    no minute to take down, no negligence in not recording a non-
  entity.
    " As to Mr. Babbage's question respecting the particular passage
 in his  book in which he has stigmatized the minutes as unworthy of
 confidence, I should indeed be most happy to find that he did not
 intend to convey the harsh censure which the tone of his criticisms
 appears to imply.      I do not however see how the concluding pa-
 ragraph of chap. iv. sect. 3. (page 65) can bear any other inter-
  pretation.

        CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF WAD.                  BY DR. TURNER.
     Under the name     of Wad,   or Black   Wad,  are  comprehended several
minerals, which are distinguished by the following characters :— They
are soft, light, and porous, more or less earthy in appearance, of a
brown colour, soil by contact, and contain manganese.                     Though
they agree in these general points of resemblance, several of them
are distinguishable from each other by physical properties, and differ
essentially in chemical constitution.
     First species.    Wad   from Upton Pyne in Devonshire.
     For  this  Wad  I  am  indebted to the kindness of Mr. Konig of the
British Museum.         It occurs in a curved tabular mass about half an
inch thick, and may be easily separated into thinner lamina?.                It is
easily broken, is considerably softer than gypsum, and soils when
handled. Its colour is brown with a shade of yellow, somewhat like
that of bismuth.        The lustre of a fresh surface is considerable, and
rather metallic.       The streak is brown and shining. It consists of
small scaly particles, arranged together so as to give to a broken
surface a fibrous appearance.         It is very porous, and emits numerous
 air-bells with a hissing noise when put into water. Its specific gravity,
 after being boiled in water, is 2*314.
      100 parts of the mineral were resolved into
               Red oxide of manganese                          79*12
               Oxygen                                            8*82
              Water                                            I0C6
              Baryta                                             1  '40
                                                             TochkT
     The   essential ingredient of the mineral, inferred from these          num-
 bers, appears to be a hydrated peroxide of         manganese, consisting of
 88 parts or two equivalents of peroxide, and 9 parts or one equivalent
             —
 of water, a compound which, to my knowledge, has not been observed
 in the mineral kingdom.          Were such a compound quite pure, the
 analysis should have given the following proportions              : —  Red oxide
  79 12, oxygen 10*57, and water 9;
      -
                                             — that is, rather less water and
 rather more oxygen than was actually obtained.
      The hydrated peroxide of manganese may be regarded as the es-
  sential ingredient of the Devonshire Wad, and, according to my ob-
  servation, is the most frequent variety of this mineral.              I have not
  met with it in a state of perfect purity. It usually contains small
  quantities of some other oxide of manganese, together with baryta,
  oxide of iron, lime, and    silica.
      Second species. Wad from Derbyshire.
      This Wad, for which I am indebted to Mr. Konig,         is   earthy without
  the slightest crystalline appearance.         It acquires a slight lustre      by
  friction,  but is otherwise dull.      It is very soft and friable, and soils
  when handled. Its streak and powder are of a reddish-brown colour.
  It absorbs moisture greedily on being wetted, and when put into
  water emits numerous globules of air with a hissing noise. Its spe-
   cific gravity, after its contained air is expelled, is 3*024.       It separates
   readily into parallel layers, the natural joinings being formed by thin
                                         L 2                                  strata

strata of hydrated peroxide of iron, which           is largely and intimately
mixed with the wad, so       as not to be separable from      it.
   According to analysis, 1 00 parts of the Derbyshire Wad were re-
solved into        Peroxide of iron                               52*34
                  Deutoxide of manganese                          385
                  Water                                            1029
                  Baryta                                            5*40
                  Insoluble earthy matter                           274
                                                                  99-36
   The Wad from the Harz, of which Klaproth has given an analysis
in the 3rd volume of his Contributions, appears to have been of the
same nature as the preceding but it contained a greater proportional
                                   ;
quantity of manganese and baryta.
   Third species of Wad.
   Another species of Wad of the exact locality of which I am ignorant,
                               ;
was lately sent me from Germany, under the name of ochreous Wad,
by Professor Hausmann. It is a friable earthy substance, like the
foregoing species ; but the colour of its streak and powder is dark
or blackis brown.
            i           It is very porous, and emits a copious stream of
air-bells when put into water.         Its specific gravity is 4*506.
   On exposure to a red heat, after being dried at a temperature of
212° P., it loses 3*08 per cent, of water, together with oxygen gas.
Its loss at a white heat amounted to 12755 per cent.; namely, 3 08
                                                                             -
of water, and 9 675 of oxygen.            In muriatic acid it is readily dis-
solved with free disengagement of chlorine, leaving merely traces of
insoluble matter.      The solution was free from lime and iron, but
contained a trace of baryta.          Considering its high specific gravity,
the small quantity of combined water, and the large quantity of ox-
ygen, which it loses at a white heat, there cannot be a doubt that
this species of wad consists essentially of the anhydrous peroxide of
manganese, with which a small quantity of some hydrated oxide, pro-
bably manganite, is casually intermixed.           Brewster's Journal.
              ORGANIC TEXTURE OF VEGETABLE FOSSILS.
   Mr. Witham, of Lartington, who has for some time been occupied
in examining the vegetable remains which occur in our coal-fields
and other formations, intends to lay before the public the results of
his investigations.     A method has been discovered by which the in-
ternal structure of these plants may be exposed to view in a most
satisfactory manner*', and a series of microscopic drawings made from
sections of the fossils    is in the course of being engraved.           It has
been denied that any vegetables of the dicotyledonous class exist in
the coal formation, but Mr. Witham hopes to be able to demonstrate
the fallacy of this opinion.       The plates will be accompanied by re-
marks on the nature of the plants, and an account of their geological
position,  and of other circumstances        relative to their history.

 great Biscaina Vein at Real del Monte, is cleared to a point where a
 stream of water coming from the western ground has been intercepted,
 and instead of falling to the deep parts of the mine, it will now be
 carried off.    It is proposed also to employ the power which may be
 derived from this water, to drain a part which is expected to be pro-
 ductive,   and at present out of the reach of the steam engines. This
 will be done by one of the hydraulic machines called pressure engines,
 which it is ascertained can be placed there, and may relieve this part
 of the mine from water sooner than other means which are pursuing.

                               SOLAR SPOTS.
   A curious and interesting group of spots     are now (May 1st) near the
western edge of the sun's disc, in the form of an angle, and there are
two large and very black ones in one umbra, just above the angular
point.   Should they not wear off in going round, they may be seen
in the same figure on the eastern side of the sun about the 20th or
21st of May.                                                             W. B.

    General Observations. —The characteristic of this month to the 20th was
dry and pleasant, with much warm sunshine; but the last ten days were
showery, accompanied with cold westerly gales. The temperature of the
air was often variable, and there were several hoar frosts in the first part
of the period. The rains that fell here during the last ten days have been
of great service to vegetation and the grass lands, and have restored the
verdant appearance of the young wheats; for about the 19th the air be-
came arid and blighty, and the roads exceedingly dusty, so that vegetation,
&c. began to droop. There appears now to be a more abundant show of
fruits than could have been expected, from the extraordinary severity of
the last winter, and the weather has been favourable to their setting firmly
on the trees. Great blights, however, may still be seen in many places.
                   '
    On the 5th and 21st instant lightning occurred in the evenings, which
was brought on by crossing winds; and distant thunder was heard most of
the day of the 23rd. None of the heavy thunder-storms that are said to
have happened in different parts of the country, have passed over this place.
    The 1 1th, 12th, and 13th, were very cold days, with prevailing North,
and North-east winds.
    The mean temperature of the external air this month is a quarter of a
degree higher than the mean of May for many years past.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are four solar halos, four meteors, lightning on
 two days and thunder on one, and eight gales of wind, or days on which
 they have prevailed, namely, one from the North-east, two from the East,
 three from the South-west, and two from the West.

\\TE       believe that several years have elapsed since any ac-
  * *    count of the structure of the Alps has proceeded from
the pen of an English geologist. A paper by Professor Buck-
land, published in the Annals of Philosophy of 1821, threw a
new and unexpected light on the geological relations of the
whole chain showing, by many striking details, the analogy
                ;
between some of its formations and a part of the English
series; and proving that the great northern and southern cal-
careous zones belong exclusively to the secondary period.
About the same time Mr. Bakewell was employed in making
a series of observations on different parts of the Alps, which
led   him to similar conclusions f     .   Of the many excellent me-
moirs published on the same subject by the geologists of the
Continent, we are not now called upon to speak.
    The elevation of the Alps during the tertiary period, first
asserted by Dr. Boue, has been confirmed, with innumer-
able details, by the successful labours of            MM.   de Buch and
 Elie de Beaumont, and is now generally admitted.                A large
 series of strata on the southern flank of the chain, once re-
 garded as primitive and afterwards elevated to the transition

82       Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison on the
class, has been finally referred to the age of the lias. Number-
less strata, formerly described as primitive or transition, have
also been successfully compared with the green-sand and the
newer secondary formations. These discoveries belong to the
recent history of geology*.         Many new and careful observa-
tions must, however, be made before the great deposits of the
Alps can be brought into a rigid comparison with the secon-
dary formations of the North of France, of the North of
 Germany, and of the British Isles. The peculiar mineral
structure of the Alpine limestone      —   the great mountain masses
of it, so modified by crystallinepower as to lose the traces of
depository origin     —  the frequent absence of organic remains,
and of those well-defined beds of clay and sandstone which
form the best subdivisions of the English secondary groups
the enormous faults and dislocations produced during the dif-
ferent epochs of elevation      — all these causes have greatly ob-
scured the minuter subdivisions of the different systems of
the chain so that in the Geological Map of Germany (only
           :
finished last year, under the superintendence of one of the
greatest naturalists of Europe) nearly the whole of the secon-
dary calcareous zones are still represented by one colour, and
described as the Calcaire indetermine des Alpes-\. Under these
circumstances we have ventured to throw into a connected
point of view our own observations, made in the summer of
1829 during several traverses among the eastern parts of the
chain.    We    offer them as nothing more than an imperfect
sketch, filled up in some instances by materials derived from
others: we are anxious to state matters of fact correctly; and
we wish that in every instance they should be carefully se-
parated from any theoretical conclusions we may have derived
from them.
   The following are the principal directions in which we made
traverses through the eastern portions of the Alps. 1st, From
Vienna to Gratz over the Somring 2nd, From Gratz to Lay-
                                         :
bach, over a portion of the primary axis and the southern cal-
careous zone 3rd, From Laybach to Capo dTstria, over the
               :
calcareous chain, which is a prolongation of the Julian Alps,
and forms the water-shed between the basin of the Danube
and the Adriatic 4th,
                    :         A complete traverse by the gorges of
the Tagliamento and the crests of the Tauern Alp to the
valleys of Salzburg: 5th, Through the lateral valleys of the
northern calcareous zone between Salzburg and Inspruck
6th, Across the calcareous zone by the Seefeld pass to the

plains of Bavaria.      To these may be added, a complete tra-
verse,   made by one of the authors of this paper in the
summer of 1828, from the subalpine plains of Italy, over the
Brenner and Seefeld      pass, to the plains of the Danube.
   In all these regions the structure of the Alps, when consi-
dered only in a general point of view, is of great simplicity;
the chain being composed of an axis of primary and transition
rocks, chiefly of a slaty texture, flanked and surmounted by
the two great secondary calcareous zones; which are in their
turn surmounted by the tertiary sandstones and conglome-
rates, descending on one side into the plains of Italy, and on
the other into the elevated plains of the Upper Danube.          We
have endeavoured to show, in papers read at former meetings
of this Society, that the chain of the eastern Alps has been
elevated at successive epochs and (agreeably to the views first
                                ;
published by Dr. Boue) that it has undergone a great move-
ment   since the tertiary period. By these successive elevations
the relative position^ of its subordinate parts has been greatly
deranged the northern and southern calcareous zones being
           ;
in   many   places completely rent asunder, and having their
component     strata thrown into the most violent contortions.
   To the east of that part of the valley of the Inn which in-
tersects the Alpine limestone, the derangements of the chain
are, we believe, in no instance so great as to produce an en-
tire  inversion in the order of the calcareous formations ; and
the transition rocks and red sandstone series on the flanks of
the central axis are uniformly surmounted by the lower part of
the system of Alpine limestone.       But on the west side of the
great chasm through which the Inn escapes into the plains at
the northern foot of the Alps, the dislocations are more com-
plex; as there appear to be two distinct axes of elevation
ranging nearly parallel to each other; one along the true
geological central line of the Alps; the other through the
centre of the northern calcareous zone.       The effect produced
by the second      axis is such, that some of the higher mem-
bers of this zone are carried, with an inverted dip, directly
against the central chain, and appear to pass under it.         This
singular derangement of the strata passes through the dolo-

it ranges towards the west, we had no means of ascertaining         :
we have been informed, however,         that similar   derangements
may   be traced into the heart of Switzerland.
   Having thus noticed      the general position of the great mi-
neral masses of the eastern Alps, it may be expedient briefly
to explain the transverse section     which forms, the chief basis
of our observations, and to which nearly        all the subdivisions

84         Prof.  Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison on          the
of the several formations will be referred *. This section com-
mences   in the marshes on the shores of the Adriatic, passes
through the plains of Udina to the foot of the Alps, inter-
secting the tertiary marls and conglomerates on the left bank
of the Tagliamento then traverses the calcareous chain (con-
                      :
nected with the Julian Alps) to the longitudinal valley between
Tarvis and Ponteba, in a part of which is the outcrop of the
sandstone, red marl, and conglomerate inferior to the Alpine
limestone.     It then crosses a low longitudinal ridge of doubt-
ful character, but based upon, and partly composed of transi-
tion rocks, and is continued through the secondary, dolomi-
tic ridges of Bleiberg to the valley of the Drave, which here,
like so many of the longitudinal valleys of the Alps, forms the
boundary between the primary and secondary ridges of the
chain.    It will be seen by the general section, that the Blei-
berg dolomites rest on red sandstone and red gypseous marls
and that the secondary system is based on grauwacke, which
contains beds of limestone with fossils resembling those of
transition limestone. From the Drave the section is continued
through the primary region of the Alps, over the Katsberg, to
the valley of the Mur at St. Michael.            These primary ridges
 are chiefly composed of micaceous schists, the beds generally
 ranging parallel to the principal chain, and dipping nearly due
 south. From the valley of the Mur the section is prolonged over
 the crests of the Tauern Alp to the longitudinal valley of the
 Enns at Radstadt. This part of the line cuts through a great
 succession of mineral masses, some of which, though eminently
 crystalline and primary in external character, contain a few
 subordinate beds of limestone with organic remains. The dip
 of these transition beds is irregular but on the northern flank
                                         ;
 of the Tauern Alp, and in the ridges near Radstadt, the strata
 become less crystalline, and the prevailing dip is unequivocally
 towards the north.     From Radstadt the section crosses some
 of the newer transition rocks graduating insensibly into the
 conglomerates, red sandstone, and gypseous marls; which
 here, as on the Italian side, form the base of the whole Al-
 pine limestone system.     The line is then continued through
 the great precipices of the older Alpine limestone; through
 the middle system with the subordinate saliferous marls ; and
 through the younger Alpine limestone, flanked by the sand-
 stones, marls, and conglomerates of the tertiary formations.
    The principal section is drawn in such a direction as to
 show the position of the unconformable beds of Gosau, and
 the commencement of the tertiary system at the foot of the
 Traunslein.

   To explain more fully the structure of this part of the Alps,
we have added another parallel section (fig. 2), about thirty
miles west of the former, from the primary rocks at Gastein
across the transition formations of the Upper Salza, the
red sandstone series of Werfen, the older Alpine limestone of
the Tannen Gebirge, the saliferous deposits of Hallein, the
younger Alpine and hippurite-limestone of Untersberg, to the
tertiary plains of Bavaria.
   After these introductory remarks, we may proceed to notice
each of the successive deposits seen on the line of transverse
section, and on other corresponding parallels of the eastern
Alps.     They may be subdivided into the following natural
groups in the ascending order.         1. Primary crystalline rocks
forming the central axis. 2. Crystalline rocks with calcareous
beds containing a few traces of organic remains the system     ;
graduating into rocks agreeing with the ordinary transition
type.    3. Red marl, sandstone, and gypsum, &c.                 ; containing
in parts of their range large, subordinate masses of magnesian
limestone.     4. Older Alpine limestone.         5. Alpine limestone
with subordinate saliferous deposits. 6. Younger Alpine lime-
stone.    7-  Tertiary formations.
        §  II.  Successive Formations of the Eastern Alps.
                  1.  Central Axis ofprimary Rocks.
   The primary       rocks of the central axis have their culmina-
ting peaks on      the eastern borders of the Tyrol, where the
 Grosse Glockner and the Venediger Alp rise to the respec-
tive elevations of 11,775 and 11,698 Vienna feet* above the
level of the sea. To the east of these peaks the central ridges
 diminish gradually in elevation; separating, in their range,
 Carinthia on the south from the Salzburg country on the
north.     Following the direction of the Mur for a considerable
 distance, they are finally divided into two irregular branches;
 one of which is prolonged in a south-easterly direction into the
 Bacher Gebirge, and forms the south-western boundary of
 the tertiary basin of Gratz; the other is continued in the di-
 rection of the principal axis of the Alps, and forms the great
 boundary between the tertiary basins of Vienna and Styria.
 This latter branch, after disappearing under some of the re-
 cent deposits connected with the Vienna basin, emerges near
 Presburg, and is said finally to die away in the low ridges
 extending thence towards the north-eastf.

    It forms no part of our object to give any detailed account
 of the mineral structure of the central axis ; we may however
 observe, that as it decreases in elevation in its range towards
 the east, its prevailing character of granitoid gneiss seems to
 give way to that of mica-schist and some other primary slaty
 rocks.
    In the higher part of the valley of Gastein the principal
 rocks we observed were the following: (1) Granite; (2) Gra-
 nitoid gneiss, alternating near the highest waterfall with thin
 beds of white, granular marble; (3)         A  very feldspathic variety
 of mica-schist, here and there containing garnets; (4) The
 same variety often passing into white-stone, also here and
 there becoming quartzose and graduating into slaty quartz-
 rock  ; (5) Mica and chlorite slates, &c. &c.            Some of these
varieties   below   Hof Gastein, and      close to the transition series,
 alternate with thin beds of a beautiful greenish, striated marble
 resembling cipollino.
    Above Gasteiner Bad several of the slaty masses contain
 small disseminated crystals of auriferous pyrites; and in one
of the precipices in the highest part of the valley, gold mines
have been worked at the height of 7800 Vienna feet above
the level of the sea.       Similar mines have been worked in the
adjoining peaks of the Raurisberg at the height of 9080 feet
above the same level *.
    In the traverse we made through the primary system over
the Katsberg, from Spital on the Drave to St. Michael
on the Mur, the prevailing rocks were mica-schist; and we
have already remarked that for many miles along the great
longitudinal valley of the Drave they have a decided dip to
the south, carrying them unequivocally under the transition
rocks, hereafter to be noticed, which form the base of the
Bleiberg ridge.
    Between Gmiind and Rennweg the rocks contain abun-
dance of garnets and not far from the latter place there are
                      ;
subordinate masses of serpentine in the mica-schist.               On the
south ascent of the Katsberg, the prevailing rock is a beauti-
from the higher peaks of the Tyrol towards the east, and the great ex-
pansion of the southern calcareous zone of the Alpine chain, produce an
effect upon the hydrography of the whole region which deserves notice.
The calcareous zone not only becomes greatly expanded; but near the
commencement of the Julian Alps gives off a second chain, extending into
the provinces on the eastern shores of the Adriatic. The consequence is,
that the parting of the waters between the Black Sea and the Adriatic
takes place, in all the country east of the Adige, among the higher eleva-
tions of the secondary calcareous system.    West of the Adige, the parting
of the waters takes place among the crests of the central axis.
   * In English feet the respective heights are 8135 and 9470.
                                                                        ful

of light blue and green, laminated and granular limestone,
somewhat resembling the cipollino of the Italians sometimes   ;
also alternating with thin quartzose bands, identical with the
beautiful green, quartzose, slaty masses which abound in a
corresponding part of the pass of the Brenner.                 . With the
beds of the Katsberg terminates what we consider the pri-
mary system of our transverse section. It is not however
possible to draw any precise line of demarcation between
this and the superior transition system ; for here, as well as in
the valley of Gastein (see PL II. fig. 1, 2), the two classes of
rocks seem, through the intervention of chloritic schist with
thin bands of limestone, to pass insensibly into each other.
We     have thought this fact worth stating, although it is pro-
bably a mere local accident of structure, and of no real im-
portance in the history of the successive formations*.
2,   Crystalline  Rocks containing calcareous Beds 'with traces of
      organic Remains, graduating into Rocks conforming to the
      ordinary Transition Type, 8?c. fyc.
    The  prolongation of the section over the Tauern Alp, from
St.  Michael on the     Mur to Radstadt on the Enns, is through
the lower transition system of the Alps.             Near St. Michael,
beds similar to those of the Katsberg alternate with large
masses of crystalline limestone and for some miles north of
                                       ;
that place, the abundance of limestone among the other cry-
stalline rocks begins to give a new character to the country.
In our passage through it, we however thought that we were
still in the primary system of the chain ; and we can hardly
express the surprise we experienced when we first discovered,
near the village of Tweng, mica-slate with garnets, and chlo-
rite-slate with thin layers of white crystalline limestone, alter-
nating with, and passing into a more thick-bedded limestone,
part of which was of a dark blue colour, of less crystalline
texture, and contained many encrinital stems.
    In ascending the mountain above the last-mentioned vil-
lage, we found the same dark-coloured encrinite-limestone
   * In using the terms primary and transition, we have only endeavoured
to conform to the language current among geologists.       The two classes of
rocks cannot, perhaps, in any case be precisely separated from each other.
It is true that among the stratified rocks of a considerable part of the
central axis there are no traces of organic remains    :  but they may once
have existed, and have been obliterated by subsequent crystalline action :
and the central peaks of true granite are (at least in their present form)
probably among the most recent mineral masses of the chain.
                                                                 repeatedly

repeatedly alternating with chlorite and mica-schist, also with
fine,  glossy clay-slate containing crystals of pyrites.          Higher
up the mountain are great masses of thin-bedded white cry-
stalline limestone overlaid by thickly bedded, blue limestone;
and the whole system passes into a series of lofty calcareous
peaks, the highest of which, in the Radstadter Tauern, is
9762 Vienna feet above the level of the sea. The highest point
of the calcareous peaks belonging to this system, east of the
Weiss Eck, is 8360 Vienna* feet above the same level f.               We
had no opportunity for examining any of these elevated peaks
of the chain but from their mode of weathering we were led
                ;
to suppose that some of them were of dolomitic structure.
   On descending the north flank of the Tauern Alp we
found the same blue, thick-bedded limestone alternating with,
and graduating into micaceous and chloritic schist, and ap-
pearing by a north-easterly dip to be carried under the peaks
of the Radstadter Tauern.
   When we first found the organic remains in the calcareous
rocks above described, we supposed that the whole system
was probably an outlier from the great northern calcareous
zone, altered in structure by its contact with the primary for-
mations.      The sections from the foot of the Tauern to the
banks of the Enns, proved that this opinion was untenable.
The rocks above described are not only interlaced with the
central system of the chain, but are inferior to a long series
of strata, considered, if we mistake not, as transition by all the
geologists who have described the Alps.
   This conclusion is made still more clear by the sections
laid bare in the gorge between Hof Gastein and Lend ; and
on the banks of the Salza between Lend and Werfen \. The
primary rocks of the valley of Gastein are supposed to termi-
nate above the gorge with some great masses of micaceous and
chloritic schist containing subordinate, thin beds of crystalline
limestone.      These masses are succeeded, in the ascending
       —
order (1.) By an enormously thick calcareous series, generally
of slaty texture, but obscurely stratified, often arranged in
great vertical masses with an irregular cross cleavage              :  the
limestone is here and there so mixed with dark shale as to

  \ In the Geological Map of Germany (published by Simon Sell ropp and
Co. of Berlin),   all the region of the Alps between St. Michael and Racl-
stadt is erroneously represented as mica-schist. The calcareous chain con-
nected with the Radstadter Tauern extends westwards to Scheideck and
Dragstein. The Weiss Eck on the south, and Kalk Spitz on the east, are
detached masses belonging to the same svstem.

neous veins running in irregular lines transverse to the beds.
(2.) Micaceous and chloride slates with a nearly vertical cleav-
age, having in many places the structure of primary rocks.
(3.) Similar slaty masses, but of more incoherent texture, irre-
gularly mixed with calcareous matter, and with calcareous beds
generally of a dark blueish colour and of a close subcrystalline
texture. This system extends to the bottom of the gorge, and
is continued for some way below Lend on the right bank of
the Salza.      (4.) Fine talcose slate mixed with and passing
into serpentine.      (5.) A series of beds composed of coarse
micaceous slate, sometimes of nearly incoherent texture, mixed
irregularly with beds and masses of blueish gray, subcrystal-
line limestone, which pass in some instances into a fine,
white, crystalline dolomite.      (5.) Great masses of grauwacke
slate, here and there becoming earthy and passing into shale.
(6.) Great beds of limestone, some of them white and cry-
stalline, plunging at a high angle into the valley above St.
Johann.
    We    found no traces of organic remains in this lone- series
of deposits, from their commencement above the gorge in
the valley of Gastein     : but we are convinced, both from their
mineral structure and range, that they are prolonged into,
and form a part of the system of the Tauern Alp.
    On the banks of the Salza, between St. Johann and Werfen,
there are    some  repetitions of mineral structure similar to those
above described but on the whole the beds gradually present
                    ;
a coarser and more mechanical texture the shales are less
                                              :
micaceous and chloritic, and the slaty masses alternating with
them often pass into grauwacke. With this change of structure
there is a much greater regularity in the dip; the whole of
this upper system being carried, by an undeviating inclination
towards the north, under the great precipices of secondary
limestone.
    A  still higher series of rocks on the banks of the Salza are
of such a character that it seems uncertain whether they
 should be referred to the transition or secondary class. They
consist of variously coloured shales passing into grauwacke-
 slate, alternating with greenish gray or reddish fine-grained
 sandstone; and subordinate to them are some beds of highly
 calcareous shale and of limestone, in texture resembling some
 varieties of our transition or mountain limestone. The sparry
 iron ore of Winterwald, a little south of Werfen, appears to
 be associated with these ambiguous strata.

90            Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison on the
    We      did not examine in detail any of the great deposits of
sparry iron ore which characterize the eastern Alps. Although
not, perhaps, on the same exact parallel, they chiefly occur
under the system of secondary, red, gypseous marl and sand-
stone, along with a fine grit or grauwacke which is more or
less calcareous.         According to information which we owe to
His Imperial Highness the Archduke John, who from personal
examination is most intimately acquainted with the mineral
structure of every part of the eastern Alps, the following
are among the most important localities where the ore has
                                 —
been extracted for use: Freisnitz near the Somring; Ricke-
nau Neuberg ; Veitsch ; Niedereibl Goldrath near Marian-
        ;                                      ;
zell   ;   Eisenerz; Radmar; Admont; Lietzen near Aussee;
and Winterwald south of Werfen *. To the south of the
iron ore runs a low chain of limestone more or less argilla-
ceous, which between Neuberg and Admont is said also to
contain several small veins of iron spar.                 In two localities,
one near Aussee, and the other at Imlau Graben near Mari-
anzell, the ore is said to overlie red gypseous marls.                 From
all these facts we conclude, that the greatest part of these re-
markable deposits are close to the confines of the lowest se-
condary group of the Alps, and perhaps in some instances
enter partially into its composition f.
     It would be incompatible with our present object to enter
into any longer details respecting the structure of the great
 series of rocks above described          : but it may be asked how we
prove them to be of the transition class, since the organic
 remains imbedded in them exhibit no specific characters.
 Considering the crystalline structure of some of the secondary
 formations of the western Alps, it would be difficult to meet
 this objection, had we not found an answer to it in the facts
 exhibited by our transverse section on the south side of the
 central axis.
     On     the right  bank of the Drave below Paternion the forma-
 tions of crystalline slate are       surmounted by grauwacke, shale,
 and red sandstone, forming the base of the Carinthian lead hills.
 These formations are not so well exposed, but the order ap-
 pears to be precisely the same, as on the north side of the
 axis.       A great fault ranges up the valley of Bleiberg, between
    *    To the same Illustrious Personage we are indebted for many other de-
 tails   connected with the immediate objects of this paper. The section PI. II.
 fig. 4, which we owe to Professor Rippl, shows that the geological rela-
 tions of the great deposits of sparry iron ore near Eisenerz are similar to
 those above described.
    f This conclusion is, we believe, in accordance with the opinion of
 Dr. Boue.
                                                                           the

the Schlossberg and the Erzberg, producing an upcast to the
south-east, in consequence of which the red sandstone and
red gypseous marl forming the base of the metalliferous dolo-
mites, are once more brought out, and the whole secondary
system is seen to rest unconformably upon inclined beds of
grauwacke passing, in some places, into a millstone conglo-
merate, in others, into a grauwacke slate which is here and
there calcareous, and contains subordinate, thin beds of dark*
blueish coloured limestone.
    In the calcareous grauwacke slate there are many stems of
encrinites ; and the beds of limestone contain innumerable fossil
shells chiefly of the three genera Producta, Spirifer, and Tere-
bratula.     Hand specimens of these rocks could not be distin-
guished, either by their structure or by their fossils, from Eng-
lish mountain or transition limestone: and it deserves remark,
that in one of the sections below the village of Bleiberg, thin
calcareous bands full of transition fossils mark the dip and
bedding of the rock: while its slaty cleavage (precisely as in
some of the calcareous transition slates in the north of Eng-
land) is transverse to the stratification.
    The fossil shells collected by ourselves are
      Producta hemisphaerica
      Producta latissima;
      Producta, a species resembling P. Martini
      Pecten, resembling a species in the transition series of Cork.
And to this list may be added,
      Encrinites, fragments of Spirifers, &c. &c.
   These facts appear to decide the question respecting the age
of the system of beds we are describing, as far as regards the
country south of the central axis and to place the correspond-
                                        :
ing beds on the north side of the axis in a different system,
would be a violation of the plainest rules of analogy. It seems
therefore to follow, that certain important inferences, recently
drawn from the non-existence of transition rocks with organic
remains in some portions of the western Alps, have no appli-
cation to the eastern parts of the chain here described*.
   * By reference to M. Rengger's memoir in the Denkschriften der allge-
meinen Schweizerischen Gesellschaft (Zurich 1829), it will be seen that
transition rocks form an equally important band in a part of the western
Alps, and that on their southern or inferior limit they graduate downwards
from grauwacke slate into mica-slate and gneiss; whilst in an ascending
series they pass through iron ore deposits into red sandstone and conglo-
merate. So that in the western division of the chain, as well as in the
eastern, they separate the Alpine or Jura limestone (synonymous terms)
from the primary rocks.

    This deposit is, we believe, found nearly throughout the
whole extent of the eastern Alps overlying the transition
series, and forming the base of the great precipices of the
older Alpine limestone.        Its characters are so peculiar, and
its continuity is so remarkable, that, independently of its im-
portance as a term of comparison with other regions, it would
well deserve a separate notice.      — On the northern side of the
transition system of the Alps, the red sandstone is exposed in
a series of longitudinal valleys, and overlies nearly all the
principal deposits of sparry iron ore, of which we have already
pointed out the general range.

 in the position we have indicated, forming a succession of
 red terraces and, in consequence of a great increase in the

 thickness of the subordinate fetid limestone, spreads out into
 a succession of low ridges of hills ranging parallel to the
 escarpment of the Alpine limestone. On the west side of the
 Inn it is no longer visible, in consequence of the great dislo-
 cation pointed out above, which brings the higher beds of
 the calcareous zone into contact with the central axis.
     On the south side of the central axis the deposit has the
 same position, and we believe also the same continuity; and it is
 well exposed in the valley between Ponteba and Tarvis ; also
 on both sides of the Bleiberg hills, as is indicated in our trans-
 verse section.   —  In order to convey some notion of the struc-
 ture of this formation, we proceed to notice one or two sec-
 tions on both sides of the chain, where it is well exposed.
     In describing the succession of deposits on the banks of
 the Salza, we have already pointed out certain beds of close-
 grained grauwacke sandstone and variegated marls, which
 seemed to form a passage between the true transition system
 and the red sandstone. About half a mile south of Werfen
 are some quarries in the secondary series, exposing the fol-
 lowing succession of beds in the ascending order        :
     (1.) Irregular masses of red conglomerate with rounded
  pebbles of the older rocks. (2.) Black, calcareous shale pass-
 ing into dark smoke-gray, fetid limestone, the whole irregu-
  larly traversed by veins of gypsum.        (3.) Argillaceous beds
  striped with parallel, red bands of gypsum.       (4.)    A  thick, ir-
  regular cellular bed with much hydrate of iron, thin veins of
  gypsum forming      reticulations through the mass.      (5.)  A  mass
  composed of several beds of gypsum,       finely granular,     but not
                                                                fibrous,

fibrous,  and   at its upper surface alternating with gray gypseous
marls.     (6.)  Thin beds of dark fetid limestone surmounted
by beds of gypsum lost under the alluvium of the hill. The
aggregate thickness of these beds is fifty or sixty feet, and
their dip is north.        Near the same place is another quarry
exposing red and variegated gypseous marls, alternating with
beds of red sandstone perfectly like the new red sandstone of
England.
    On the whole, the formation we are describing is ill ex-
posed, the greater part of it being obscured by the accumula-
tions of alluvial matter near the foot of the great calcareous
precipices; and we have only pointed out the previous sections
for the purpose of conveying some notion, however imperfect,
of its internal structure. Its thickness is very considerable, but
its lower limit is very ill defined.        Its upper portion seems to
pass into the Alpine limestone through the intervention of dark
calcareous shales with subordinate beds of fetid limestone.
    On the right bank of the Drave, south-east of Paternion,
the red sandstone is much concealed, but the order is as fol-
lows:     (1.) Grauwacke; (2.) Red sandstone; (3.) Shale and
fetid limestone; (4.) Dolomite of the Erzberg.
    The great fault which brings up the red sandstone series
 under the Schlossberg, on the left bank of the rivulet below
 the village of Bleiberg in Carinthia, exposes the following
 succession of phenomena*: (1.) Contorted and broken beds
 of shale and bands of compact limestone.            Some of the lime-
 stone is fetid; many of the beds of shale are meagre and mica-
 ceous, of a gray and blueish gray colour; others are red or
 variegated, more argillaceous, and contain irregular and earthy,
 nodular masses of gypsum.          This system is traversed by one
 of the adits to the lead-works, which intersects many beds of
 stinkstone like those under the dolomites on the north side of
 the Erzberg.
    (2.) Red sandstone alternating with red and variegated gyp-
 seous marls, not to be distinguished from the most character-
 istic beds of new red sandstone.           This system rises from be-
 neath the contorted shales, and in its prolongation abuts
 against some highly inclined beds to be next enumerated.
    (3.) Highly inclined beds composed of coarse grauwacke,
 passing here and there into a conglomerate with rounded peb-
 bles of quartz and primary rocks.             The cementing principle
 is close-grained and micaceous, and so hard that the masses
  are quarried for millstones,

    (5.)  A  series of highly inclined beds of grauwacke slate,
succeeded or cut off' by an irregular mass of trap.
    (6.) Trap, which traverses the ravine and occupies the
banks of the rivulet for several hundred feet. It is close-
grained, of a dark greenish colour, and breaks into irregular
fragments at a number of earthy ferruginous joints.                We   have
no specimens of this rock; but it may we think be regarded
as a variety of the black porphyry, or melaphyre of De
Buch. It contains several fragments of white crystalline
limestone, and here and there passes into a conglomerate with
a cement of iron clay.
    (7.) The trap is immediately succeeded by grauwacke slate,
with the subordinate thin beds of limestone above described,
containing Encrinites, Spirifers, Productae, &c. Further down
the valley, and at the south base of the Schlossberg, the red
sandstone series is seen for several miles overlying the grau-
wacke series and underlying the Alpine limestone.

marl and sandstone, but have made the dolomite of the

the accompaniments but probably the causes of the disrup-

of the transition class the clear relations (notwithstanding
the local confusion) of the transition and secondary systems
—   all these circumstances together make the sections in the
neighbourhood of Bleibero- the most instructive we have seen
in the   Alps.
    On   the south side of the chain, porphyry is said to be in
many     instances subordinate to the red sandstone. In the val-
ley above     Ponteba we found red sandstone passing into con-
glomerate with pebbles of porphyry; and in the range of the
formation, towards the west, porphyry becomes so extremely
abundant as to predominate over, and in some instances
almost to take the place of, the red sandstonef.
                                                                           It

   j- The range and extent of this porphyry is well marked in M. Ployer's
Map of the Tyrol. One of the sections which best exhibits its relations
and intimate connection with the gypseous red sandstone, was well seen
between Neumarkt and Cavalese, in a traverse, from the valley of the
Adige to Predazzo and the Val di Fassa, made by one of the Authors of this
paper in 1828. (PI. II. fig. 7.) The lowest beds observable in ascending from
Egna or Neumarkt, on the Adige, to the pass of St. Lugano leading to the
Val d'Avisio, and thence to Predazzo, consist of red sandstone with greenish
                                                                        marls

    It remains for us to notice the sections on the right bank of
the Inn, through the red sandstone series especially as we
                                                        ;
have there a good exhibition of that expanded portion of it
which contains great subordinate beds of limestone.                      We
have in a former paper noticed the masses of red marl, red
sandstone, and conglomerate, which on the right bank of the
Inn rise from beneath the Alpine limestone and form the
support of the unconformable tertiary deposits of Ha'ring.
The     sandstone passes, near the coal-works, into a very close-
grained, thick-bedded, micaceous rock ; and alternates with
masses of limestone resembling rauchwacke, some of which
are bituminous and extremely fetid.                   From this place to
 Schwatz (a distance of more than two posts), there are, on the
 right bank of the Inn, a great succession of sections show-
ing alternations of fetid limestone and red marl or sandstone*.
                                                                      South-
marls and reddish gray calciferous grits. By following these on their rise
 towards the north-east, they are found to repose upon a sandstone, which
 passes downwards into a recomposed porphyry, and finally into a coarse
 conglomerate. This conglomerate at Lugano is seen to rest against the
 mountain masses of crystalline porphyry, from which it has been derived,
 and to which it appears to have precisely the same relations as the older
 conglomerates of Foyers, Trefad, and the Ord of Caithness, have to the
 granitic and syenitic rocks of the Highlands. (See Geol. Trans. 2d Series,
 vol. hi.  p. 139.)
     In an ascending order, these conglomerates, graduating into sandstones
 and grits, exhibit in one part a fine-grained whitish grit, like some of the
 best freestone of the Scotch coal-measures ; and these beds contain im-
 pressions and detached portions of plants, and thin laminae of carbonaceous
 matter. The red marls and red sandstone which succeed, immediately
 support the Alpine limestone of Monte Cislone; and the highest members
  of that mountain assume the prevailing dolomitic aspect and shivery struc-
  ture of all the peaks of Alpine limestone in this part of the Tyrol. The
  same relations of red sandstone, marls, and grits, supporting the Alpine
  limestone, are seen well exposed in the adjoining valleys of Avisio and
  Fassa, wherever the general range and structure of these formations is
  not obscured by the trap dykes abounding in that region, many of which
  have a syenitic and granitic character. In the higher part of these val-
  leys, and particularly near Predazzo, these dykes frequently burst through
  the regular strata, which in many instances are altered in their mineral
  character, dislocated, and frequently overwhelmed by bulging masses
  of the igneous and intrusive rocks.       At the Canzocoli, the Alpine lime-
  stone in contact with the trap, is changed into a crystalline, white marble,
  which is now quarried for statuary purposes ; the edges of the limestone
   presenting bands of serpentine, and the whole forming a beautiful and di-
   rect analogy to the altered lias (described by Dr. Macculloch) in the Isle of
   Skye, where that deposit comes into contact with syenite.
      The red sandstone and marl which have been derived from the pre-exist-
   ing porphyry, and which so uniformly support the Alpine limestone, con-
   tain subordinate protuberances of anhydrite and gypsum near Cavalese
   and the rock-salt, recently discovered in the adjoining valley, is probably
   subordinate to the same deposit.

96        Prof.   Sedgwick and Mr. Murchisoti on the
South-west of Schwatz this system terminates in red conglo-
merates, and is seen distinctly to rise up to, and repose upon,
the older formations.
    In this part of the range the limestone greatly predomi-
nates in the exposed sections ; for the red marls and sand-
stones being more destructible, do not form precipices, but
occupy small longitudinal valleys. The contortions of some
of the limestone beds, and the nature of their alternations with
the sandstone, are well exposed in sections south of Ratters-
berg.    We     believe that the greatest number of these limestone
beds are magnesian, some of them are metalliferous, and nearly
all of them are fetid*.      Their structure is extremely various.
Some of them are compact, some white and crystalline, some
yellow and earthy, and some cavernous.              When struck with
the hammer, some of the masses shiver into innumerable frag-
ments; and one of these varieties, of a beautiful white colour,
has externally the small columnar structure of dried starch, and
when struck falls into minute grains with trapezoidal faces.
The name of rogenstcin has been given to this variety, which
however presents no analogies to the rogenstein of the Hartz.
    This limestone series has often been called transition.           We
have allowed the difficulty of drawing a line between the se-
condary and transition systems of the Alps and in this in-
                                                      ;
stance we derive no assistance from organic remains, for a few
casts of Terebratulae are the only fossils we saw in the beds
we are describing. They are, however, too much interlaced
with the lower part of the red sandstone to be separated from
it; we agree therefore with Dr. Buckland in considering them
secondary and if the red sandstone of the Alps be identi-
              :
fied with the new red sandstone, they approach both in posi-
tion and in mineral character, much nearer to the zechstein or
magnesian limestone than         to any other formation with which
we   are acquainted.       At the same time we wish carefully to
distinguish them from the great zone of older Alpine lime-
stone, from which they are separated by the red sandstone and
gypseous marls, and to which, according to our views, they are
in  no respect subordinate.
                      4.  Older Alpine Limestone.
    By  the term Alpine limestone we mean the limestone found
in  any part of the great secondary calcareous zones superior
angle with the range of the red sandstone system, and therefore conveys
an erroneous idea of its thickness ; which, however, after every deduction,
 must be very considerable.
   * Most of the old works below Schwatz were, we believe, in veins of
 argentiferous galena.   They are now deserted.
                                                                         to

 to the red sandstone.          The calcareous beds described in the
 preceding section are not therefore included under this term                 ;
 which has undoubtedly led to some mistakes, having been ap-
plied to the zechstehi, to the oolitic series, and to true transition
 rocks.      It is not well that the same name should designate
formations so widely separated from each other; but limiting
 the term Alpine limestone as we have done, we think that it
may be used with advantage, and that it can lead to no con-
fusion. This great deposit admits, as we have already stated,
of three natural subdivisions, which we proceed to notice in
order*.       It is, however, entirely foreign to our purpose, to
give many details respecting a formation so well known, and so
often described by those who have possessed incomparably
better means than we had of studying the details of its mine-
ral structure     :   we shall therefore in a great measure confine
ourselves to a brief notice of some of the phenomena on our
lines of section.
    The first division, the older Alpine limestone, appears on
our transverse section in the dolomites of the Bleiberg and
the great escarpments of the Tannen Gebirge.                    We  have be-
fore noticed the marls and thin beds of fetid limestone below
the village of Bleiberg, which seem to form a passage into
the superior limestone series.             The thin-bedded, fetid lime-
stone also appears in great force near the northern base of
the Erzberg, overlying the red sandstone, and passing into
the superior dolomites.
    Near Werfen the order observed at the base of the calca-
reous zone was as follows          :
    1. Thin, dark, bituminous beds with calcareous veins; some
of them fetid, and the masses shivering into angular fragments.
    2. Light-gray limestone, breaking into similar fragments.
    3. Dark, fetid beds, alternating with dark, micaceous shale
throwing out copious springs of water.
    4. Beds of limestone of compact texture, much traversed
by calcareous veins, and used for marble. The beds sepa-
rated into vertical masses by many great perpendicular clefts.
   5. Gray limestone and shale.
    6. Dark beds of limestone, traversed by contemporaneous
veins, alternating with dark shale, into which they pass in-
   *  The   subdivisions of the Alpine limestone here adopted, were we be-
lieve first given   by M. de Lill, of Hallein, a gentleman whose investiga-
tions" have thrown great light on the natural history of the secondary for-
mations of the chain. The Geologists of the French school seem disposed
to reject the term Alpine limestone altogether, and to substitute in its
place the term Jura limestone.       We are unwilling to exclude the term Al-
pine limestone from what we think its proper place, and are only anxious
to give it a consistent meaning, which may lead to no mistakes.

 98         Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison on           the
 sensibly, and become of earthy texture.       —  This system is sur-
 mounted by the great, gray, bare precipices of lower Alpine
limestone    many thousand     feet in thickness.   It appears, there-
fore,   that in the structure of the lowest beds of the Alpine
limestone there    is, to say the least of it, a very strong analogy
between certain parts- of the great northern and southern
 zones.
    Dark, bituminous, slaty beds are not, however, confined to
the base of the series, but in some instances, for example in
the Seefeld pass, compose whole mountain masses.               In con-
 sequence of the very complex dislocations of that part of the
calcareous zone, it is difficult to ascertain the exact place of
the bituminous ichthyolites of Seefeld.          But placing the do-
lomites of Mittenwald as the mineralogical centre, we think
 that the Seefeld schist is considerably inferior to the salife-
rous deposits of Hall, and that some of the beds of the
 system descend far down into the lower Alpine limestone.
    It would be useless for us, after all that has been written
on the subject, to attempt any general description of the do-
lomites of the Alps.      The metalliferous hills of Bleiberg are
chiefly composed of this variety of rock, arranged in great
irregular beds dipping south at an angle of 70°.              The lead
ore of these hills is arranged in masses which appeared to us
parallel to the beds of limestone: but our persevering and
skilful young friends, Messrs. J. and 11. Taylor (who had
previously visited the mines and examined them with great
care) have since convinced us that the ore is deposited in true
veins; which, though they for considerable spaces range
parallel to the strata, cut obliquely through them at certain
intervals.    In the dolomitic beds of the hill above the village,
are a few casts of shells and other obscure fossils; and we
were happy to recognize among them two or three specimens
of the Gryphaea incurva. Immediately behind the village are
some beds of shale and limestone (fire-marble), with many
fossils; among which are the celebrated iridescent Ammonites,
which Dr. Buckland, we believe, identified with the fossils of
the lias.    Considering, then, that in this single locality we
have grauwacke with beds of limestone containing transition
fossils,, surmounted by red sandstone and gypseous marls;
and this latter series again surmounted by fetid limestone, do-
lomites, &c. containing the Gryphaea incurva, and by other
                                                     —
beds containing Ammonites and Belemnites there can, we
think, be no doubt to what part of the secondary series we
should refer the lowest division of the lower Alpine limestone
as it is developed in the Bleiberg Hills.
   Notwithstanding the magnificent scale of the sections in the
                                                              Salzburg

 Salzburg country, the geological evidence on that side of the
chain is not so complete as in the neighbourhood of Bleiberg.
 Ammonites and Belemnites have been found, though rarely, in
the lower part of the great precipices which surmount the red
sandstone series near Werfen ; but we are not aware that the
Gryphaea incurva has ever been seen along with these fossils.
The argument from analogy is, however, sufficiently convin-
cing where we have nothing to oppose to it.                  We   therefore
venture to conclude, that the great system of the older Alpine
limestone, overlying the red sandstone, commences on both
sides of the chain with the lias.          Its precise superior limit we
are not able to indicate but we believe, from its enormous
                                ;
thickness, as well as from some of its fossils, that it ascends
considerably into the oolitic series*.
     5.  Limestone with subordinate salifcraus Marls,           fyc. fyc.
    No   mines of salt have, we believe, been worked in the for-
mation of red sandstone and gypseous marls which underlies
the older Alpine limestone. All the principal deposits of that
mineral are in a much higher position; being incased in the
calcareous system of the Alps, and distinctly overlying the
older Alpine limestone.           This fact appears to be incontesta-
bly proved in the memoirs of M. de Lill de Lilienbachf
to whose kind assistance and instructions we were greatly in-
debted during our visit to the Salzburg Alps.
   * Along the line of our transverse section, we in vain looked for that
structui'e which is so characteristic of many of the secondary rocks of Eng-
land  ; and in no instance did we discover a single specimen of true oolite.
In the range of the calcareous zone along the southern flanks of the Bather
Gehirge, and from thence towards the lower regions bordering on the Da-
nube, the rocks, however, occasionally exhibit the external characters of a
part of our oolitic series. Thus, near Gonowitz, we found beds of a yellow
colour, and a coarse open texture, somewhat resembling cornbrash, and
containing many well preserved fossils. At the time, we were not aware of
the rarity, and consequent interest, of these phenomena; which are well de-
serving of a much more careful examination than we bestowed upon them.
   On the great road from Cilly to Laybacli, there are some highly interest-
ing sections, especially near Franz and St. Oswald, where great beds of
shale alternate with coarse, reddish sandstone resembling millstone grit ;
the whole being surmounted by masses of rauchwacke and other modifica-
tions of dolomite.    In the same neighbourhood are several beds of coal,
which we wished to visit, as we supposed them analogous to the coal de-
posits we had seen, subordinate to the newer secondary system, south-west
of Vienna. We were however disappointed in our hopes of seeing them and ;
we have been since informed that they all belong to formations of tertiary
brown coal. We mention these facts, not in the expectation of throwing
any light upon the structure of this portion of the Alps, but in the hope of
directing the attention of future observers to the interesting phenomena    of
the calcareous chain between Gonowitz and Laybach.

.   Jn several parts of the chain the older Alpine limestone is
  succeeded by a great series of beds, composed of limestone,                 -
  calcareous gritstone, sandstone, and shale.             The calcareous
  beds are often nearly compact, sometimes cherty, commonly
  separated by thin bands of marl, and offer many varieties of
  colour and structure.        The other members of the system are
  liable to like variations.      The beds of marl, shale, and sand-
  stone sometimes become greatly expanded ; and the whole
  system frequently becomes contorted to such a degree, that
  great masses of brecciated sandstone, shale, &c, are rolled up
  and enclosed in mountain masses of the limestone we are now
  describing.     To what causes the phenomenon may be due
  we do not inquire but it is, we believe, among such brec-
                          ;
  ciated and contorted masses that all the rock-salt of the east-
  ern Alps has been discovered.            The several deposits, com-
  mencing at Hall, and ranging through Berchtolsgaden, Hal-
  lein, Halstadt, Ischel, and Aussee, are certainly not now, and
  probably never were, continuous; but they have all been
  formed under nearly similar circumstances, and are all nearly
  on the same parallel.        We    proceed briefly to notice one or
  two sections where the true position of the rock-salt is indi-
  cated and for fuller details we must refer to the papers of
         ;
  M. de Lill and other writers on the structure of the eastern
  Alps.
     (1.) Salt deposit of Hall. (PI. II. fig. 5.)    —  The accompany-
  ing section (for which we are indebted to M. Pohringer, Ober
  Bcrgmcistcr at Hall) shows the true position of the rock-salt
  among the calcareous mountains on the left bank of the Inn.
  The whole system has a regular dip of about 30° towards the
  S.W., and belongs to that part of the secondary chain which,
  in consequence of an enormous dislocation, seems to plunge
  under the central axis (see above p. 83). The lowest beds
  of limestone in the section rise into the peaks of the Lavats-
  cherberg, in which are found many iridescent Ammonites.
  They are succeeded by some compact, red beds resembling
  those immediately below the salt in some other localities.
  These red beds are surmounted by bands of anhydrite, form-
  ing the base of a great saliferous mass, composed of green, red,
  gray, and variegated marls, brecciated masses of sandstone,
  fetid limestone, &c, in which all appearances of stratification
  are entirely lost*. The whole thickness of this mass, measured
  in the direction of the section, is about 1250 English           feet: and
                                                            a
    * This position of the anhydrite seems to be nearly similar to that which
  has been noticed by Charpentier, Bakewell, and other writers on the gyp-
  seous and saliferous masses in the Alps.
                                                                    galleries

                  Structure of the Austrian Alps, §c.                 101
galleries  have been opened in it at the height of 4480* Vienna
feet  above the level of the sea: but, like all the other corre-
sponding deposits, it appears soon to thin out, so as not to be
continued through the neighbouring mountains.                 The brec-
ciated saliferous mass is surmounted by three beds of the united
thickness of fifty feet.     The lowest (c) is chiefly composed of
marl; the middle bed (b) of gypsum; and the highest (a) con-
sists chiefly of a gray and white concretionary limestone, the
nuclei of the concretions being often composed of small Tere-
bratulae. To this rock the term rogenstein has been applied, as
well as to the singular concretionary magnesian rock near
Schwatz {supra, p. 96); but they both differ essentially, in their
structure and relations, from the rogenstein of the Hartz, which
is a coarse oolite subordinate to the new red sandstone.            Over
these beds come the upper strata of limestone containing many
fossils; among which we recognized Ammonites, Belemnites,
Buccinites, Pectens, Terebratulse, Sic. &c.
   The whole of the beds here described, both from their
position in the chain and from their fossils, belong evidently
to the middle system of Alpine limestone; and notwithstanding
the brecciated structure of the saliferous mass, they seem to be
less disturbed than in the other analogous deposits of theAlps.
   (2.) Salt formations of Berchtolsgaden and Hallein.          —  These
two deposits, though very near together, are not continuous;
probably in consequence of the great dislocations and contor-
tions of the neighbouring portions of the chain. The relations
of the salt mass of Hallein are extremely clear and may be seen
even in our very reduced section (PI. II. fig. 2). It is in a len-
ticular form, being about 1520 toises in length, 600 in breadth,
and 220 f toises in its greatest thickness and it is imbedded, or
                                                ;
rather enclosed, in the contorted strata of limestone.                The
limestone below the salt is thin-bedded and compact; in colour
gray, red, or variegated alternates with bands of green and
                              ;
red marls, and contains here and there considerable portions
of chert.     It is surmounted by dark-coloured, gypseous marls
which form the lining of the salt deposit |. The saliferous
masses are made up of green, red, and variegated gypseous
clays, much mixed with brecciated masses of red micaceous sand-
stone, and with fragments and concretionary masses of dark-co-
loured limestone. The whole system is surmounted by twisted
beds of light-gray, compact limestone, some of which contain
many fossils. These relations are proved, not only by the
   * 46/2 English  feet.           f 9722, 3837, and 1407 English   feet.
   X In the galleries through the dark- coloured gypseous marls there is  an
extraordinary efflorescence of sulphate of magnesia.
                                                                  general

 102         Prof. Sedgwick        and Mr. Murchison on         the
general structure of the whole region, but also by numberless
internal traverses through every part of the saliferous mass. It
is therefore obvious, that the salt of Hallein is subordinate to
strata separated from the lower red sandstone and gypseous
marls, above described (p. 92), by many thousand feet of the
older Alpine limestone*.
    3. Saliferous mass at Ischel.      —   The salt deposits of Halstadt,
Ischel and Aussee are, we believe, very nearly on one geolo-
gical parallel; and in their structure and relations to the,- near-
est portions of the chain, they seem to be almost identical.
The accompanying plan of the Ischel works f, which we owe
to the kindness of M. Dicklberger the Ober Bergmeister, will
convey a correct notion of the position of the salt mass among
the beds of limestone.           The neighbouring hills to which the
salt is subordinate, in consequence of a great flexure, dip to
the south-west.         The beds under the salt are argillaceous,
and contain some bands of dark-coloured limestone with casts
of Ammonites and some bivalves.                 Over these beds, and im-
mediately under the salt mass, are some thin, compact, cherty
beds of limestone. The salt mass is a confused, irregular com-
pound of gypseous and saliferous marls, &c. ; which has been
worked, at the lowest level, through a breadth of about 500
Vienna feet, and through a depth, between the highest and
lowest levels, of about 1500 feet.             These different levels are
approached by means of 12 horizontal galleries cut through
the inferior beds, as represented in the plan. It deserves re-
mark, that here, as at Hallein, the saliferous mass (E) is sepa-
rated from the surrounding limestone by bands of dark-
coloured gypseous marls (D) not saliferous. The superior beds
of limestone (F) are hardly to be distinguished, either by their
structure or their fossils, from those which underlie the salt.
    These details are sufficient to explain the nature and posi-
tion of the great saliferous deposits of the eastern Alps, which
evidently occupy an intermediate position between the older
and younger portions of the calcareous zones and may there-
                                                          ;
fore, along with the accompanying strata, be conveniently re-
garded as one of the natural subdivisions of the Alpine lime-
stone, in which so many of the distinctive characters of secon-
dary formations are almost entirely wanting.
   * The relations of the saliferous beds of Berchtolsgaden are not so obvious
but  we have little doubt that they are nearly in the same geological position :
for the system is continued northwards across the valley, and passes finally
under the ridge which is a prolongation of Untersberg. On this account we
think that the saliferous beds of Berchtolsgaden cannot, by any complex
series of faults, be brought into comparison with the marls inferior to the
older Alpine limestone.

   If it be asked in what part of the secondary series we place
the salt deposits above described, we are unable to give any
very definite answer to the question.          In the limestone beds
associated with the salt are many fossils ; among them are Am-
monites, of which the concamerations are marked by simple or
undulating lines, and Orthoceratites. Both these fossils might
be supposed to indicate strata older than any part of the oolitic
series. Along with them are however near Hallein, oval Am-
monites, and spheroidal masses resembling organic remains of
the green-sand; also several casts of shells resembling oolite
fossils, and a singular body, found in our Kimmeridge clay, to
which the name Tellinites solenoides has sometimes been given.
At Aussee, in the beds of limestone containing the saliferous
marls, there are, along with other fossils, corallines of the ge-
nera Tubipora and Astraea, and Pentacrinites. On the whole
we are disposed to place the salt formations of the Alps high
in the oolitic series.
   The preceding conclusion might appear strange to one who
had only studied English geology; but it cannot now be con-
sidered anomalous, as recent discoveries have established the
existence of salt among rocks of almost all ages.            In the Cri-
mea it is said to be daily accumulating in inland lakes. In
Poland it probably exists among tertiary deposits. In the
Austrian Alps we have placed it among the upper oolites. In
Switzerland Mr. Bakewell places it in the lias.             In Wirtem-
berg Alberti has proved it to be both in the Keuper and Mus-
chel-kalk.    In England, though all the great salt mines are in
the new red sandstone, there are two or three copious salt
springs in the coal-measures.        Lastly, in certain parts of the
United States, salt springs are stated by Mr. Featherstone-
haugho   to issue from old transition   slate rocks*,
                   6.  Younger Alpine Limestone.
   Under    this designation  we include all those portions of the
northern secondary chain which are superior to the saliferous
deposits of the Alps.      As we were unable to define the upper
limits of these deposits, we are necessarily unable to define
the lower limit of the formation we are now attempting briefly
to describe.     We, however, suppose that it commences some-
where in the middle or upper system of the oolitic series; and
it terminates on the outskirts of the chain, in ridges of indu-
rated shale, sandstone, and limestone; in some places contain-
ing many characteristic fossils, and now supposed, by most
of the geologists who have visited the region, to be the equi-
valents of the green-sand and chalk.

104-        Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison on      the
   Our examination of the calcareous zone on the south flank
of the Alps was much too hasty to enable us to establish the
three subdivisions we are now attempting to illustrate.    We  be-
lieve however that they may be traced, and that the zone may in
many places be distinctly divided into older Alpine limestone
and younger Alpine limestone, separated from each other by a
system of strata composed of thin-bedded limestone, alternating
with shales, gypseous marls, &c. One or two sections, kindly
shown to us by Professor Rippl, exhibited this succession:
and if these gypseous marls be considered as the representa-
tives (in a somewhat altered form) of the saliferous system of
the northern Alps, the subdivisions of the two great calca-
reous zones will be in perfect accordance.
   In the southern Italian Alps, the younger formation of lime-
stone has been examined with great care by     MM.    Maraschini
and Catullo; and the latter gentleman has, by the help of a
great suite of organic remains, proved the existence of beds of
the age of the green-sand, overlying rocks containing many
organic remains of the oolitic series.     Near Belluno, Feltri,
Canal di Brenta, &c, the system terminates in a red and
white fissile limestone (scaglia) containing many flints which,
                                                         ;
from its structure, position, and fossils, has been indentified
with the chalk.
   Between Adelsberg and Trieste the limestone beds contain
many fossils, and among them are innumerable Nummulites.
How far these fossils descend in the secondary series, we are
not able to determine.      In the ascending order, the forma-
tions, before they reach the Adriatic, undergo a great change
in external character.    The calcareous beds (chiefly composed
of a compact, light-gray limestone full of Nummulites) no
longer predominate but become subordinate to great masses of
                      ;
blueish gray micaceous shale, and of sandstone generally of a
gray or greenish gray colour, and here and there containing
a few traces of carbonaceous matter.     Along the shores of the
Adriatic, for several leagues south of Trieste, the micaceous
shale is so abundant as to produce a succession of ruinous
cliffs, apparently held together only by the subordinate bands
of sandstone and nummulite-limestone.       We   believe that this
system is now generally regarded as the representative of the
                       —
green-sand or chalk a conclusion which is in perfect accord-
ance with our views of the structure of the district.
    It is not our intention, in such a sketch as this, to attempt
any detailed description of the younger secondary formations
of the Austro-Bavarian Alps we must, however, notice some
                                 ;
of their varieties of structure, and some of the masses which
are subordinate to them.       Occasionally they pass into dolo-
                                                            mites,

mites; in which case they generally rise into peaks, weather
into peculiarly fantastic forms,     and lose all traces of stratifica-
tion.   From  this  it would seem, that their mineral structure has
originated in some great crystalline action, which commenced
after the deposition of the calcareous mass.           We   must how-
ever observe, that the same external forms, the same crystal-
line texture, and the same obliteration of all traces of deposi-
tory origin, may be found in numberless parts of the chain
where the rocks contain no magnesian earth.
     Gypsum    is  found, in several places, subordinate to the
younger Alpine limestone for example, at Faulenbach near
                                :
Fussen, where it is extensively quarried.            The same mineral
is found, near the head of the Kochel See, high in the series,
and close to the tertiary plains of Bavaria. It is there as-
sociated with black, blue, and red fetid marls, and with fetid,
porous rauchwacke, not to be distinguished in external charac-
ter from the mamiesian limestone of England.               We mention
this to show the hopelessness of attempting to determine the
age of the different portions of Alpine limestone by mere
mineral structure.      We    may further remark, that gypsum is
found in the Alps among secondary rocks of all ages, and is
therefore, by itself, no test of the age of any of them.            We
have already shown, that it exists in the marls inferior to the
older Alpine limestone, in the superior saliferous marls, and
also among beds high in the series of the younger Alpine
limestone: and in former communications we have shown that
the same mineral is also found, in considerable abundance,
among the tertiary formations of Salzburg and Bavaria*.
    In the extreme prolongation of the calcareous zone into the
ridges which terminate the chain a few miles south-west of
Vienna, coal- works have been opened, in one or two places,
under the direction of Professor Rippl. The coal is of bad
quality, and is subordinate to shale alternating with the
Alpine limestone.        We   obtained no fossils from the neigh-
bourhood of the works which we visited but we suppose,
                                                   ;
from their position in the chain, that they are in the higher
part of the system we are describing.
    One of the most abundant rocks of this series is a peculiar,
light-gray, compact limestone, well known to every one who
has visited the Alps but entirely unlike any secondary rock
                        ;
   * On the north-western batik of the Walcher See, near the side of the
great road from Inspruck to Munich, are traces of some works which were
opened about twenty years since in search of quicksilver.   We  were in-
formed that some traces of that metal had been found among the argilla-
ceous masses which there alternate with the beds of younger Alpine lime-
stone.
    N.S. Vol.  8.   No. 44, Aug. 1830.               P                of

106         Prof.  Sedgwick and Mr. Mnrchison on the
of England.        It is well exhibited in some of the beds of
Untersberg; which on the north-west flank of that mountain
contain innumerable Hippurites of the same species with those
found, both in Provence and the Pyrenees, among rocks sup-
posed to be of the age of the green-sand *.
    The Hippurite beds, in their prolongation towards the east,
pass under a great series of white and red indurated marls,
containing, we believe, some chalk fossils.              These are sur-
mounted by gypseous marls, with bands of calcareous grit
containing Nummulites which are in turn surmounted by a
                             ;
great system of beds, composed of sandstone (molasse), conglo-
merate, shale, and marl some of the highest of which (in ra-
                             ;
vines below Schweiger Mill, &c. &c.) contain fossils similar to
those in the overlying beds of Gosau. (See PI. II. fig. 1           & 2.)
    We    think these highest beds, from their position in the
section as well as from their fossils, are superior to the chalk
and on that account we in a former paper called them ter-
tiary.  We    at the same time stated that we regarded them as a
term of an undefined series, to be interpolated between the cal-
tdire grossier and the chalk, and that we did not pretend to draw
any well-defined line between them and the secondary system.
    We  have already mentioned the ridges of hills, composed
of shale, sandstone, and limestone, developed on the out-
skirts of the Salzburg and Bavarian Alps close to the ter-
tiary system.      Being more thin-bedded and of less firm tex-
ture than the older parts of the chain, they have been exposed
to extraordinary breaks and contortions; sometimes dipping
towards the mineralogical axis, and sometimes from it; in
one place being vertical, in others twisted into saddle-shaped
masses  ;   and, if we mistake not, being in some instances
absolutely inverted.       This series appears to be greatly ex-
panded near the eastern termination of the Alps, and has been
described by Dr. Boue, with many excellent details, under the
name of Vienna sandstone (gres Viennois). In the maps and
memoirs of M. Keferstein, it is designated by the name of Flysch.
    From the outskirts of the calcareous zone near Reichenhall
to the valley of the Rhine, it forms, in the position we have
pointed out, a nearly continuous succession of ridges, easily
distinguished from the inner portions of the chain.              In some
parts of the system the beds of limestone almost disappear, and
it then passes into a formation of sandstone and shale, hardly
to be separated, without the help of fossils, from the superior
   * We   have the authority of Mr. Lyell, for stating that near Cape Pas-
sero in Sicily, Hippurites occur in a tertiary formation newer than the
Sub-apennine   : but most frequently they seem to occur in the newer se-
condary formations.
                                                                  tertiary

 tertiary groups.     In other places the calcareous beds of these
 outer ridges are of much greater thickness, and they then ex-
 hibit all the usual mineralogical characters of Alpine limestone.
    The Kachel-stein (immediately south of the iron works of
 Kressenberg, near Teisendorf) exhibits the following cha-
racteristic succession.     (1.) Light-gray, calcareous marls with
indurated bands resembling planer-hoik. (2.) Blueish, mica-
ceous marls with calcareous bands, some of which are com-
posed of calc-grit; others of compact, argillaceous limestone
resembling blue and white lias. (3.) A great series of blueish
gray flag-stones, alternating with marls, generally blue, but
here and there of red or greenish red colours. (4-.) Micaceous
sandstone, mostly thin-bedded, and of a greenish gray colour,
but containing some thick beds extensively quarried for build-
ing.    Some of the calcareous bands of this lofty ridge contain
Ammonites, and Belemnites ; and it appears to be separated by
a double system of faults, on one side from the metalliferous
mountains of Alpine limestone, and on the other from the
newer ferriferous strata of the Kressenberg*.
    In the Alpen Spitz immediately south of Nesselwang, beds
of compact limestone, with many Belemnites, occasionally
passing into a more earthy texture (like indurated planer-halk)
and containing balls of pyrites, alternate with bands of calc-
grit and thick beds of dark-coloured shale.
    In some instances the rocks of this system exhibit the ordi-
nary characters of the green-sand of England. Thus at Son-
thofen the iron-sand is not distinguishable in mineral character
from the lower green-sand of the Kentish denudation; and it
contains many fossils, among which we may enumerate Am-
monites, Belemnites, Inocerami(?), Nummulites, Pectens, Te-
rebratulae, numerous Crustacea, &c. &c.            We   had no hesitation
in considering this deposit as subordinate to the higher part
of the younger Alpine limestone, and therefore secondaryf.
    At Haslach, a few miles south of Bregenz, there is a de-
posit of red oxide of iron in beds of calcareous shale, alterna-
ting with beds of calc-grit and limestone, some of which are
of a bright green colour.          The series seems to pass under
great precipices of Alpine limestone much charged with Num-
mulites.     At Oberdorf, in the immediate neighbourhood, is a
   * We have the authority of the Berg-Meister, who has many years
superintended the iron works, for asserting (in confirmation of the pub-
lished statements of Count Munster), that the Kressenberg beds contain
no Ammonites or Belemnites. In our opinion the formations of the Kachel-
stein and Kressenberg, though in close contact, ought not to be confounded.
   f Dr. Bou£ has erroneously stated, in different journals, that we had con-
sidered the Sonthofen deposit as tertiary.

 nummulite-limestone, apparently subordinate to great beds of
 indurated marl resembling planer-kalk. The geological rela-
 tions at the last-mentioned places are rather obscure; but the
 deposits are we think unquestionably secondary, and nearly
 on the same parallel with those at Sonthofen.
    On the whole we concluded, that the different portions of
 the ridges above described, which appear on the outskirts of
 the Alps, were nearly of the same age with the green-sand
 and chalk formations of England. The conclusion seems to
 be borne out by the position of the subordinate beds, as well
 as by their fossils, and is in some instances also confirmed by
 their mineral contents.
    It was our wish in this sketch of the structure of the East-
 ern Alps, to avoid mere matters of detail, as being incompa-
 tible with our object.           But the short abstracts of some of our
former communications having been misunderstood, and con-
 sequently misrepresented it became necessary, in this account

at length than we first intended, by referring to two or three

    Having      in  two papers, read last year before the Geological
 Society, explained our views respecting the tertiary deposits
of the Austrian Alps we should not have added anything to
                               ;
what we have already stated, had it not been necessary to
notice certain comments on these communications which have
been published by Dr. Boue f.
    1. He is mistaken in supposing that we confounded the iron
sand of Sonthofen with rocks of the tertiary age.                    We    dis-
tinctly stated that      it contained Ammonites and Belemnites, and
alternated with beds of the younger Alpine limestone from              ;
which we concluded that it was secondary; and this con-
clusion is given, though very shortly, in the published abstract
of our paper (Phil. Mag. and Annals, N.S. vol. vii. p. 53). On
the age of the Sonthofen beds there appears therefore to be no
difference of opinion between ourselves and Dr. Boue: but he
has been led to misrepresent our meaning, from knowing no-
thing of our communications except through the medium of
abstracts, which from their brevity may be easily misunder-
stood.
   * By tertiary deposits we mean all regular beds, of whatever age, newer
than the chalk.

   2.  He   states that the tertiary formation of Hairing is en->
tirely of freshwater origin.     We  prove that it contains several
species of marine shells     ; from which we conclude (contrary
to the opinion of Dr. Boue, but on evidence we think not short
of demonstration,)    —  that the marine tertiary deposits of the
Alps do sometimes ascend far up the transverse secondary
valleys.
   3. He contends that the tertiary formations on the flanks of
the Austrian Alps commence with the superior divisions of that
class of rocks, the lower divisions being entirely wanting. We,
on the contrary, have shown, both by transverse sections and
suites of fossils, that some of the inferior groups of the tertiary
deposits in the Gratz basin are of the age of the London clay.
So far there is a difference between Dr. Boue and ourselves
on what we consider questions of fact.
    4. We   also differ from him considerably on questions of opi-
nion.    For example he describes great masses of calcareous
                        :
conglomerate in the Salzburg Alps, which he compares with a
part of the nagelfliih of Switzerland, and places in the secondary
system under the green-sand.         We   have not examined the
nagelfliih, and can therefore offer no opinion respecting its age
but of late years it has been generally considered tertiary.     In
the Salzburg Alps, the great masses of calcareous conglome-
rate are chiefly found on the outskirts of the chain, and form
the base of a new series of deposits which are physically and
zoologically separated from the older system; and are, if we mis-
 take not, newer than the chalk. Occasionally, as in the valley
 of Gosau, they appear far within the chain but in that case
                                                  :
 they are unconformable to the rocks which surround them
 and there is then no means of determining their age, except
 by the help of their fossils, or by comparing them with the cor-
 responding beds on the outskirts of the chain. After making-
 use of both these means of comparison, we concluded that the
 overlying conglomerates of Gosau were newer than the chalk
 and in our examination of other parts of the eastern Alps we
 did not find any large masses of coarse, calcareous conglome-
 rate subordinate to the newer secondary system.
    5. M. Boue seems to attribute much greater importance,
 than we do, to mere mineralogical distinctions.          We  know
 numberless instances in which green-sand above the chalk
 cannot be distinguished from green-sand below the chalk.
 Some of the lacustrine formations of central France have been
 mistaken for old secondary deposits.      We  have found, on the
 outskirts of the eastern Alps, fossils of the London clay alter-
 nating with rocks resembling our coal grits, and masses of con-
 glomerate like those subordinate to the oldest secondary rocks
                                                                and

 110        Prof.  Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison on the
and we have shown, that the youngest      tertiary shells of Lower
Styria are sometimes associated with a beautiful oolite, undis-
tinguishable in hand specimens from the great oolite of Bath.
On these accounts we think that mineral character alone is
nearly useless in comparing the ages of tertiary formations
widely separated from each other.
   6. He appears to identify the two deposits of iron ore at
Sonthofen and Kressenberg. They both occur in a ferrugi-
nous green-sand with many Nummulites, and their mineralo-
gical resemblance is nearly complete.         But Nummulites by
themselves prove nothing and it may be asked whether all
                              ;
the circumstances of these two deposits are such as to justify
this identification.   We   think not.   For the Sonthofen iron
ores contain Ammonites and Belemnites, and (if we rightly
understood the plans of the works) are interlaced with the
secondary system of the Alps. On the contrary, the Kressen-
berg deposit contains no Ammonites or Belemnites, and is en-
tirely on the outskirts of the secondary system    ; so that its age
can only be made out by its internal structure and its fossils.
Now there is nothing in the mere structure of the Kressenberg
beds to prove that they are secondary and an elaborate ex-
                                            ;
amination of their fossils by Count Munster gave the follow-
ing results.
   (1st.) Of 172 species of these fossils, 42 exist in, and are
characteristic of, the tertiary formations of Germany, England,
France, and Italy.
   (2nd.) There are 3 species, 2 of which resemble, and one
of which (Ostrea semiplana) is identical with, certain fossils of
the chalk.
   (3rd.) Of the remaining 126 species, some are new and
others indeterminable but for the most part they belong to
                         ;
such genera as are commonly found in tertiary formations.
   (4th.) Of the characteristic chalk-fossils, (viz. Ammonites,
Belemnites, Hamites, Scaphites, Turrilites, &c. &c.,) there is
not the least trace.    Neither are there any traces of the Gry-
phaea columba, of Inocerami, plicated Terebratulae, &c. &c.
   (5th.) The only fossils (excepting the three above men-
tioned) which at the first glance seem to belong to the chalk,
are a Plagiostoma and a Gryphaea. But on a closer examina-
tion, they not only differ from fossils of the chalk, but are of
the same species with certain fossils found in the tertiary for-
mations of Ortenburg and Sternberg.
   Such are the statements of Count Munster. And no re-
ply has been, or can be, given to them unless it can be shown
                                          ;
that the fossil species have been erroneously determined. But
this has not been attempted.        We  therefore adopt the con-
                                                            clusion

elusion of     Count Minister, that the iron-sand of Kressenberg
is a formation newer than the chalk*.
    With the same spirit of generalization, of which we have
been speaking, formations widely separated from each other,
in the Alpine and Carpathian chains, have been brought un-
der comparison sometimes by the help of mineralogical cha-
                     ;
racters, almost unassisted by a single organic fossil.                 Nor do
we complain of this where no better evidence is to be had. On
the contrary, we owe the greatest obligations to               MM.     de Lill,
Boue, and other writers who have thrown much light on the
structure of parts of Europe which have been seldom visited.
At the same time, in all questions of doubt, we must take care
not to allow ourselves to be misled by mere words; and in
settling any difference of opinion, we must never apply to
one formation the properties of another in a distant region,
because it passes under the same name.                     For example ; in
arguing respecting the age of the overlying beds of Gosau,
we have no right to transport the reader over 150 miles of
Alpine limestone, and then to assert, that (at Grlinbach,
Piesting, &c.) the same deposit, as that at Gosau, contains Be-
lemnites and certain other secondary fossils.                 In the present
state of our information, and on questions of doubt, such an
argument is nothing better than a direct inversion of the rules
of induction.
    7. After the preceding remarks, we are prepared to enter
on the question of the age of the overlying deposit of Gosau.
                                 —
Let it be borne in mind that it is identical with formations
at the base and outskirts of the chain, and that it is equally
difficult to account for its present position among the serrated
Alpine peaks, whether it be considered secondary or tertiary
that the chain has undergone great movements of elevation
within the tertiary period         —  that the older divisions of the ter-
tiary groups do exist in certain portions of the eastern Alps
   * M. Boue appears    to assert that Ammonites and Belemnites are found
in the   Kressenberg deposit {Bulletin des Sciences, Juin 1829, p. 329.). On
the authority of the Berg-Meister, who has spent many years in excavating
this deposit, as well as from our examination of the spot, we doubt the cor-
rectness of this assertion ; and it would be to no purpose to tell us that these
fossils are found at Sonthofen.       M. Boue" also states, generally, that the
fossils of the green-sand make a near approach to those of tertiary forma-
tions  :  and that some fossils of the oldest secondary rocks at Hall, Bleiberg,
andMaibel inCarinthia,have also a tertiary appearance {Bulletin desSciences;
and abstract of the proceedings of the Geological Society, July 1830).
We do not wish to oppose all parts of this statement; but we think that
at least the Bleiberg fossils offer no support to it. — If such suites of fossils,
as those described by Count Munster, really occur in the green-sand below
the chalk, there is an end of any zoological distinction between secondary
and tertiary formations.          f See our last Number, p. 65. Edit.
                                                                            that

112          Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison on           the
that   we  have, consequently, no right to exclude them, at least
hypothetically, from the Salzburg valleys; and lastly, that the
tertiary deposits    do sometimes ascend (e. g. at Hairing) far up
the transverse valleys of the neighbouring portions of the chain.
 If all this be admitted, we must allow        —  that there is no great
d priori improbability, much less any impossibility, that the
Gosau beds should be of some age newer than the chalk. If
it be further considered     —   that there is a great break between
the calcaire grossier and the chalk, which has not yet been
filled up   — that in the neighbourhood of Maestricht, beds have
been found superior to the chalk, and containing a mixture
                                        —
of secondary and tertiary shells* and that the portion of the
chain we are describing, underwent its last elevation since the
commencement of the tertiary period ; we must then also con-
        —
clude that the regions bordering on the eastern Alps are the
very places where we ought to look for the presence of an-
cient tertiary formations.
    If the eastern Alps have been elevated at so recent an epoch,
may there not have been on their flanks a continuous succes-
sion of deposits, between the newer secondary and the older
tertiary periods ? And is it not further probable, that the older
tertiary rocks, having been deposited in deep water, may con-
tain a mixture of pelagian shells not commonly found among
the fossils of more shallow basins?            All this is undoubtedly
nothing but hypothesis but it has reference to existing facts,
                            :
and tends to bring the perplexing phenomena of the Alps
under those laws by which the development of successive for-
mations appears to have been generally governed.
    After all, the age of the Gosau beds must be determined by
their relations, structure,     and fossils. There is nothing in their
relations   and structure which, in our opinion, proves them to
be older than the chalk and on examining the Gosau fossils
                              :
on the spot, it is impossible to deny, that from their state of pre-
servation, the great preponderance of univalves over bivalves,
and the incredible abundance of shells of certain genera, sel-
dom found except in the newest formations, the whole group
has a decidedly tertiary appearance. At the same time, there
are a few shells (Hippurites, Gryphites, Plicatulae, &c. &c.f)
which forcibly reminded us of the fossils of the newer secondary
strata.
    Since our collection of Gosau         fossils reached England,     it

in the secondary rock of Untersberg; and we have before remarked that

has been carefully re-examined ; and we are enabled, through
 the kind assistance of our friend Mr. J. de C. Sowerby, to give
the following results.
     Out of more than one hundred different species (collected
 by ourselves on the spot) there are from thirty to forty bi-
valves and of those capable of being identified, nearly equal
          ;
numbers are referrible to the youngest secondary, and the
oldest tertiary formations*.            The univalves are much more
numerous, especially in the quantity of each species; a fact
seldom remarked in secondary deposits. Among upwards of
fifty species, three only are found in the chalk or green-sand,
whilst seven species are identical with known tertiary fossils
and several of the genera, such as Volvaria, Pleurotoma, and
Voluta, have, we believe, seldom if ever been found in any de-
posit below the surface of the chalkf.
    After all these facts and observations, we venture to reaffirm
those conclusions which in previous memoirs we have endea-
voured to       establish.
    1.  That     in association with different parts of the eastern
Alps,    is  a fine succession of tertiary deposits, commencing with
some of the       oldest and ending with some of the newest which
have hitherto been described.
    2. That the older tertiary deposits of the Austrian Alps
sometimes ascend far within the transverse valleys, and in such
cases rest unconformably upon the beds of secondary lime-
stone.
    3. That the same deposits are developed, in many places,
on the outskirts of the chain and do in such cases pass un-
                                      ;
der, and graduate into, those newer deposits to which alone
M. Boue would restrict the name of tertiary.
    We      now return    to the southern extremity of      our transverse
section     (PL   II. fig. 1.) Although there    is a general accordance
in the successive zones of secondary rock on each side of the
central axis, it will be seen, even on the minute scale of our sec-
tion, that the tertiary deposits of the Friuli form only inconsi-

taken into account, M. Puissant finds 78658 m, l for the same

    With       re-pect to the azimuths there is a remark to be made.
 It  is   usual to consider two stations as two points of the geo-
 detic curve infinitely near one another, and their azimuths as
 the angles which the curve makes with the meridians.                                     But
 the azimuths which are really observed and used in practice
 are independent of the geodetic curve; the azimuth at one

namics is reduced to that of statics. It is therefore evident
that there can be no new fundamental principle of the theory
of motion and equilibrium but what is contained in those two
others, and may be deduced from them.                       This is, however, no
reason why every other new principle should be of no value.
 It will always be interesting and useful to take new views of
 the laws of nature; some problems may thereby be more easily
 solved, or a particular fitness may be discovered in them.

 chanical science on the principle of virtual velocities in such

a  brilliant  manner, has not deemed it useless to give more de-
finiteness    and generality to Maupertuis's principle of least
effect;   and indeed this principle may sometimes be applied
with great advantage*.
    The  peculiar characteristic of the principle of virtual ve-
locities  is, that it contains a general formula for solving all
problems of statics, and is thus the representative of all other
principles of the kind ; but its title to the honour of represen-
tation  is  not so clear as to be self-evident by the mere enun-
ciation of    it.   In this respect the principle which I am going
to propose appears to me to deserve the preference                  ; it has
besides a second advantage, viz. that of embracing in a per-
fectly equal manner the law of motion as well as of rest.                   It
is perfectly natural that in the gradual advancement of science,
and in the acquirement of it, the easy parts should come in
before the more difficult ones, the simple before the more com-
plicated, the particular before the more general ; but, at the
same time, the mind, once arrived at the higher station, en-
deavours to reverse this order, and thus views the theory of
statics as a particular case only of mechanics.                   Even the
above-mentioned geometrician recommends the principle of
least effect, on account of its embracing the theories of equili-
brium and of motion at the same time, if the former be so ex-
pressed that the living forces should be a minimum in either
case.    This remark is however more a play upon the word
than truth, as the minimum takes place in both cases in very
different respects.
    The new principle is as follows
    The motion of a system of material                points connected to-
gether in any manner whatsoever, whose motions are modified
by any external restraints whatsoever, proceeds in every in-
stance in the greatest possible accordance with free motion, or
under the least possible constraint ; the measure of the con-
straint which the whole system suffers in every particle of
time being considered equal to the sum of the products of the
   * I beg however to remark, that the manner in which another great
geometrician has endeavoured to prove Huyghens's law of the extraor-
dinary refraction of light in crystals having double refraction, by means of
the law of least effect, does not appear satisfactory to me. The admissibility
of this principle is indeed essentially dependent on the preservation of
living forces, according to which the velocities of the moving material
points are determined by their places only, without being influenced by
the direction of the motion, as is assumed in the theory above alluded to.
It appears to me that on the supposition of emanation of light, all at-
tempts to connect the phenomena of double refraction with the general
laws of dynamics must prove fruitless, so long as the particles of light are
considered as points.
                                                                      square

square of the deviation of every point from its free motion into
its   mass.    Let m, m', m!', &c. be the masses of the points ; a,
a\ a", &c. their places at the time t ; b, 6', b", &c. the places
which they would occupy if entirely free in their motion after
the infinitely small particle of time dt, in consequence of the
forces acting upon them during- this time, and of the velocities
and directions acquired by them at the time t. Their real
places c, c', c", &c. will then be those for which of all places
compatible with the conditions of the system the quantity
m(bcY + m' (&' c') 2 + m" (b" c") 1 &c. is a minimum. The equi-
librium is evidently a particular case only of the general law,
and the condition for this case is, that m {ahf +m' (a' b')'1 +
m" (a" b")- &c. itself is a minimum, or that the continuance of
the system in a state of rest more accords with the free motion
of the single points than any possible change which the system
could undergo. Our principle is easily deduced from the two
others in the following manner.
    The force acting on the material point m is evidently com-
posed, first, of one which in conjunction with the velocity and
direction existing at the time t, will carry it during the time dt
from a to c; and of a second one, which would carry it in the
same time from a state of rest in c through c b, considering
the point as free.           The same applies to all other points.
According to D'Alembert's principle, therefore, the points
m, ml, m", must, by the conditions of the system, be in equi-
librio in the points c, c', c", &c. when acted upon by no other
forces but the second ones, tending to c b, c' b', c" b", &c.          Ac-
cording to the principle of virtual velocities the equilibrium
requires that the sum of the products of every three factors,
viz. of each of the masses m, m', m", &c. of the lines c b, c' b',
c" 6", &c. and any motions, compatible with the conditions
of the system, projected on those latter lines respectively,
should always be == 0, as this principle is commonly enun-
ciated*, or more correctly, that that sum should never be posi-
tive. If, therefore, y, y', y", &c. are places, compatible with the
conditions of the system, different fromc, c', c"; and S, .&', $% &c,
    *  The usual enunciation of the principle tacitly supposes such condi-
tions, that the motion contrary to every possible motion should likewise be
possible, as for example, that a point must necessarily remain on a certain
 surface, that the distance of two points from one another should be always
 the same, &c. But this is an unnecessary restriction not always accordant
 with nature. The surface of an impenetrable body does not force a ma-
 terial point on it, always to remain on it, but only prevents its deviating
 from it on one side; a stretched inelastic but flexible thread between two
 points renders impossible an increase of distance, but by no means a di-
 minution of it, and so on. Why not therefore at once express the law
 of virtual velocities so as to embrace all cases ?

    It is very remarkable that the free motions of a system, when
not consistent with the necessary conditions of the same, are
modified by nature in the same manner as the calculating
mathematician, following the method of minimum squares, ba-
lances results which refer to magnitudes connected with each
other by a necessary dependence.                  This analogy might be
further followed up, but this does not lie within the scope of
my present design.
XVII. On          the Measurement (by Trigonometry) of the Heights
   of the principal Hills of Swaledale, Yorkshire. By John
   Nixon, Esq.
                             [Continued from page  12.]
TN     the winter preceding the survey of Swaledale, some ex-
A    periments, undertaken to determine on a novel plan the
cylindrical error of the horizon-sector, led to the rejection of
the original object-glass of its telescope for one of shorter
focus, but much superior in the centering.                  The first trial of
its merits took place at Great Whernside on a perfectly calm
and remarkably clear afternoon in May the test being the
                                                       ;
consistency of repeated observations of the respective depres-
sions of the nearly level summit of Ingleborough and the
rounded one of Shunnor Fell; two different, yet equally dif-
ficult subjects for the correct pointing of the horizontal wire
of a telescope of a moderate power. On examining the an-
gles (corrected for the deviations of the bubbles from their re-
versing points,) it was remarked that the depression of Shun-
nor Fell had diminished as the decidedly frosty evening ad-
vanced, the decrement amounting to twenty seconds, whilst
the nearly contemporaneous depressions of Ingleborough might
be considered, one measurement excepted, to have been con-
stant.       Now as the Swaledale observations, compared with
those of the preceding surveys, present an unusually limited
range in the corresponding errors of collimation, the superi-
ority of the present object-glass over the               former one may be
concluded to be          satisfactorily established,     and the horary di-
                                                                    minution

     Heights of the principal Hills of Swaledale, Yorkshire.     121
 minution of the depression of Shunnor Fell must be accounted
 for, notwithstanding the unvarying value of that of Ingle-
 borough, by admitting the existence of local refraction. On
 a calm day, when the temperature reaches its maximum about
noon and declines rapidly towards sunset, the thin stratum of
 air based on an extensive plateau, has a tendency to become
rarer about midday than the one immediately above it, but
acquires in return a proportionate augmentation of density at
nightfall  ;
             — the refraction, during the interval, passing in con-
sequence from its least to its greatest value. This has evi-
dently been the case in the observation of Shunnor Fell, where
the ray, under circumstances of weather peculiarly disposed
to develop local refraction, literally grazed for more than a
mile the broad and level summit of Great Whernside.           In the
direction of Ingleborough, the ground, on the contrary, abso-
lutely precipitous at first, forms a steep declivity to the very
base of the mountain.       In confirmation of the explanation pro-
posed, it may be added, that the height of Shunnor Fell, cal-
culated from the mean of the observed depressions, and with
the usual estimate for refraction, comes out within half a foot
of the truth.     The measurements at Ingleborough, it is pro-
per to mention, were not made by the horizontal wire, but
by a new and infinitely superior method hereafter to be de-
scribed.
    The   large levels of the sector  had preserved    their adjust-
ments so nearly unaltered during the survey of Wensleydale,
that it was deemed advisable on the present occasion to ascer-
tain their reversing points from time to time, leisurely and
under favourable circumstances in the valley; rather than, as
had hitherto been the plan, from hurried and generally unre-
peated experiments with the instrument resting on such sup-
ports (sometimes of questionable stability) as the summit of
the fell presented.     The satisfactory determination of the two
points of the scale between which the bubble of the level will
come to rest, in two opposite directions of the telescope within
its Ys, is a task requiring extreme precaution and address.
The support, based on solid ground, must be perfectly firm
its surface sufficiently ample not to require any part of the
instrument to project over it; and without being smooth,
which is highly objectionable, it should be selected so nearly
a true plane that its contact with the under surface of the stand
may extend throughout its length. It is also of importance
that the surface should not yield, from the friable texture of
the material, to increased pressure.      At Reeth, the operation
was undertaken with great prospect of success on a pile of se-
veral tons of pig lead, but the results, probably from the soft-

122 Mr. Nixon on the Measurement {by Trigonometry) of the
ness of the metal, were too discordant to be worthy of confi-
dence.      When a proper support has been procured, still it
will frequently occur that a careful observation has been ruin-
ed on reversing the instrument, by disturbing the stand           ;
                                                                    — by
lowering the telescope so rapidly or incautiously as to bring
it forcibly in contact with the Ys;     —  or by a spontaneous de-
viation of coincidence in the zeros of the arc and index. From
the subjoined statement of the position of the reversing points
of the two levels, derived in every instance from numerous
observations, it will be seen that their mean places were con-
fined to a range of about 2".      Unfortunately this high degree
of constancy in the adjustments is not to be acquired until the
instrument has been exposed for a long period to extremes
of temperature, and frequently transported in rude vehicles
along uneven roads. On commencing some subsequent opera-
tions in another quarter, it was unavoidably necessary to dis-
turb the adjusting screws; a step which rendered the position
of the reversing points as fluctuating as they had hitherto been
constant.     As to measurements made by instruments requir-
ing the adjustment, on the spot, of the level, or even of the
line of collimation, it is difficult to conceive how the most skil-
ful observer can satisfy himself of their uniform accuracy.

 the vertical angle obtained at one station only ; yet the con-

lity, would evidently lead to irreconcileable discordances in
the results.     As the negative quantities diminish, and the af-
firmative ones increase with the contained arc, it is possible
that the refraction may have been always positive, and nearly
in the same proportion to the arc, but diminished by some
unvarying quantity arising from local refraction or imperfec-
tion     of the instrument.      If  we denote by ?'(= —              cc) the
observed refraction of the arc             a, affected   by the unknown
quantity x, and represent by          t' f— —        xj   the correspond-
ing quantity for the greater arc C, then will the true refraction
 S of an arc b, equal to their difference (= c— a) be equal to

          ;   and — the    correct measure of the (constant) refrac-
tion in terms of the arc*.           To   insure success to the calcula-
tion, the smaller arc        should be considerably inferior in mag-
nitude to the larger one, and be derived from very numerous
data.        If we have given any number n of arcs with their re-
spective observed refractions, each affected by the unknown
error     —   x, the sum of the latter will contain           — xxn; which
sum, divided by n, will give the true refraction minus xxl,
(or equivalent of the observed refraction) of the ?ith part of
the sum of those arcs.

The    sum of the 9     last               the   sum of their
    arcs     is                7167;           refractions         406 pos.
       One-ninth                796;                 one-ninth... 45*1 pos.
Then, as the greater                       and    its observed
    arc   is                    796;           refraction            45*1 pos.
       And      the lesser  arc 251;                                  4*6 neg.
The true refraction of
    their difference            545"    will   be equal to          49*7 pos.
    The     constant refraction being evidently-—         — ,  or very nearly
— th of the contained          arc,  it follows that the difference be-
tween that proportion of either the greater or lesser arc and
its  observed refraction will be equal to the constant error of
observation.         Hence   —-       45"- 1 ;  or   -~-  -    ~4'6  =  27"*5;
whence the formula must be           —         27"'5.
    On comparing the observed refractions with the quantities
furnished by the formula, the deviations will be found, in al-
most every instance, to be not only trivial, but, what is equally
conclusive of the justness of the rule, they are alternately po-
sitive and negative, without regard to the extent of the arc.
The discrepancies exceeding 6" are but four in number, and
admit of considerable explanation. At Shunnor Fell the tele-
scope has in all probability been pointed at the top of the wall
   * On the same principle the index-error ot a box-sextant may be conve-
niently found. Let a terrestrial object A lie between two others B and C, all
the three, as well as the eye of the observer, being apparently in the same
plane.      Measure the arcs AB, BC, and (their sum) AC. From the latter
subtract AB, leaving the correct value of BC, which will differ from     its ob-
served measure by the amount of the index-error.
                                                                             on

   Heights of the principal Hills of Swaledale, Yorkshire. 125
on Keasdon     in lieu of the base of the signal, of which it would
interrupt the view,    —  a mistake that would tend to give a re-
fraction proportionately too great.         At Water Crag the de-
pression of Pickington Ridge is noted in the field-book as an
uncertain observation ; the signal, owing to the heat and hazi-
ness, being tremulous and dim.        From the same causes it was
never once possible to bisect, even with the telescope of the
theodolite, the signal on West Stonesfield Moor, at that time
undestroyed.       The difference of 11"*5 in the observed and
computed      refraction between Pinch Yate and Shunnor Fell
will not  appear extraordinary, when we take into consideration
that the elevation of the latter must be in a great degree vi-
tiated by the rare deviation of 12"*5 in the error of collima-
tion from its mean value.         Lastly: were the refraction be-
tween Bakestone Edge and Water Crag founded exclusively
on the data of last year, it would accord within 6" of its as-
signed value.
    The   formula of refraction for the survey of the Dent Hills,
 deduced    chiefly from small  arcs,  was confessedly inapplicable
 to those of considerable extent.
     The formula of the Swaledale survey may however be
 substituted with singular success, and will be found to satisfy
 the observations on arcs of both descriptions.        On the other
 hand,   it is remarkable that the latter formula should differ
 materially from the equally correct one made use of in com-
 puting the altitudes of the Wensleydale Fells. The three sur-
 veys were nevertheless carried      on  all about the same time of
 the year, and the observations      took place nearly at the same
 hours of the day. In fact, the      only circumstances peculiar to
 the Wensleydale survey which        could possibly account for the
 difference in its refractions, were the almost total absence of
 frost, and the excessive humidity of the atmosphere.
    If we may not ascribe the constant error of 27" to the in-
 fluence of local refraction, it is quite certain that it cannot just-
 ly be attributed to a false estimate of the cylindrical error of
 the sector.     Not only do the most recent experiments indicate
 the quantity already assigned to be too great, but every com-
 parison of the measurements by the sector with the corre-
  sponding ones by the great theodolite of Ramsden confirms
  the exaggeration.       A few of the zenith distances observed
  at Ingleborough by the two instruments, corrected for their
 respective constant errors, and reduced to the level of the
  ground, are cited in the next table.

XVIII. Statement      respecting the Discovery of the new Species
   of Swan,  ?ia?ned  Cygnus Bewickii by Mr.            Yarrell. By     A
   Correspondent.
  To  the Editors   of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     Gentlemen,
 A LLO    W   me, through the medium ofyour Journal, to make
^*- a few remarks upon a paper by Mr. Yarrell, in the last
published part of the Transactions of the Linnsean Society,
                                                                  descri-

         named " Cygnus Bewickii    " by Mr.  Yarrell.       129
describing a new species of swan, named by him Cygnus
Bewickii. These remarks are rendered necessary, in order
to supply some deficiencies in the paper above named, and
that justice may be done to the proper discoverer and ori-
ginal describer of this new swan, Mr. R. R. Wingate of this
town, who is perhaps one of the best practical ornitho-
logists of the present day, and was for many years the inti-
mate friend and acquaintance of the highly-talented individual,
whose name Mr. Yarrell has so properly connected with this
valuable addition to our Fauna.
   It was in the February of 1829, that the original specimen
of Cygnus Bewickii was shot near Haydon Bridge in the
county of Northumberland ; it came into the possession of the
Literary and Philosophical Society here, and was sent to Mr.
Wingate to be preserved for the Newcastle Museum. Upon
examination he immediately pronounced it to be of a species
distinct from the common wild swan or hooper; and fortunately
another specimen of the same was already in the possession of
the Messrs. Hancock of this town, the peculiarities of the ana-
tomical structure of which had attracted their attention, and
which upon investigation was found to confirm the views
originally taken of the species.   So noble a discovery was of
course much talked of by the lovers of natural science here
and a gentleman, who is one of the ornithological curators of
the Natural History Society, being in correspondence with
Mr. Yarrell, mentioned the circumstance, and pointed out some
of the distinctions observed in the new species.   To this letter
he replied that the differences pointed out, might arise from
age, sex, or accidental circumstances, or even error of observa-
tion, more likely than that a new species of a bird so conspi-
cuous as this should have remained so long undiscovered. Not-
withstanding the weight of such an opinion from Mr. Yarrell,
Mr.Wingate was not deterred, being confident of his disco-
very, but proceeded to draw up a short notice of the new bird
for the Natural History Society of this town.       In the mean
time a new light liad dawned upon Mr. Yarrell, as he subse-
quently writes that he was now convinced the bird was of a
new species, and proposed the name of Bewickii for it; at the
same time liberally offering either to supply Mr.Wingate with
such materials as he had been able to collect, or that Mr. Win-
gate should supply him, in order that a proper description might
be drawn up and published. In reply, he was informed that
 Mr. Wingate had already drawn up a notice of the bird, and
 that Mr. Selby, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Society,
 whose name stands foremost amongst the ornithologists of
 Britain, had undertaken to describe it.

J 30 Mr.     Ha worth's Results     of an extensive Re-examination
    Mr. Wingate's notice was read to the Natural History So-
ciety   on the 20th of October 1829, and Mr. Selby's description
on the 16th of February 1830: both these papers, with beau-
tiful illustrations  from the pencil of Mr. Selby, will appear in
the   first part of the Transactions of the Natural History So-
 ciety,  about to be published.
     Mr. Yarrell's high scientific acquirements are well known
and generally appreciated nor is there any wish to detract
                                  ;
from his merit in this particular instance, in tracing out ex-
amples of peculiar structure in individuals of this genus which
had been observed by himself and others at different periods
at the same time it must be acknowledged that Mr. Wingate's
skill as an ornithologist is placed in a very favourable point of
view by the discovery, his acute observation having enabled
him to point out a new species, from the first specimen which
came under his notice.                I am, Sir, yours, &c.

       Gentlemen,
  A S    the valuable purchase of the Linnaean Herbarium by
*"*-
       the Linnaean Society of London has enabled me to make
a few useful remarks on, and additions to, my Narcissorum
Revisio, I avail myself of the opportunity so afforded, and of
your excellent Miscellany, for such purposes.
    Having, as far as possible to me, extensively re-examined
the Narcissean group of plants indeed, very nearly the whole,
                                       ;
 (except a few species which I studied in 1819 in the garden of
the Horticultural Society of London, but was desired not to
publish,) I am pretty confident as to the correctness of the
following statements.

132 Mr. Haworth's Results of an extensive Re-examination
             Obs.   I have never seen this plant in a single state
         (for  it must be  distinct from the two preceding species),
         but a root of a very beautiful double-flowering variety
         of it, from my friend the Rev. Mr. Ellicombe of Bit-
         ton Vicarage, near Bath, bloomed finely with me last
         March.

             Obs. This is the true Narcissus bicolor of Linnaeus,
         as appears by the specimen yet well preserved in his
         Herbarium, but the leaf is not that of a flowering bulb,
         but rather of a younger part of the plant.         My   own
         Narciss. bicolor Linn. Trans, v. 5. p. 244, and of
         Bot. Mag. t. 1187, became Ajax larifolius in my Nar-
         ciss. Revis. p. 119, in the year 1819.

             Obs. I have not seen this plant in a single state, but
         possess a beautiful double-flowering variety of it, from
         my friend the Rev.         W.  T. Bree, of Allesley, near
         Coventry; which is both well figured and well de-
         scribed in Parkinson's famous Paradisus Terrestris,
         t. 107. f. 4   ; and, until the present season, was one of
         the missing or lost hardy bulbous beauties of that
         faithful writer, and of the parterres of our forefathers
         two hundred years ago.
             Obs. In this place it is convenient to remark that
         Philogyne minor of my Narciss. Revis. p. 137, was pro-
         bably only a small plant of Philog. heminalis of Salisb.,
         and that the plant well known by the name of Queen
          Anne's Jonquil, is doubtless a double variety of a plant
         more recently figured in the Botanical Register, t. 816,
         by the name of Narc. gracilis, and which appears to be
          the Narcissus juncifolius luteus albicantibus lineis di-
          siinctus, of Park. Par ad. p. 94. No. 10, but which, till
          lately re-introduced, appears to have been long miss-
          ing in our gardens.
             It may be added, that the very intelligent foreman
          of Mr. Young's Nursery at Epsom, pointed out to me
          in April last, a lesser but also double variety of Queen
          Anne's Jonquil, which before I had not seen.- For a—
          list of the lost hardy bulbs of Parkinson's days, see my
          Notice in the Gardener's Magazine for July 1830.

        and semi-double varieties hitherto proposed doubtfully
         under it, have not yet come fairly under my examina-

         from Cyprus, which at present I would designate H.

   Fearful of taking up too     much room in your valuable pages,
it may be thought perhaps by some, that 1 have been too
brief; but    long experience has convinced         me  very satisfac-
torily,   that a really good specific diagnosis is better, less
perplexing, and more easily and even more certainly under-
                                                                 stood,

    Postscript.   — Please   to notice the following errata, &c.
    For " Cotyledones       2,  parvae," in    my    last communication,
 vol. viii. p. 106,  1. 28, read " Cotyledones nullae." For I have
just seen two germinating species of Mammillaria without any.
    In page 107, line 1 1, for " Cotyledones nullae," read " Coty-
ledones duae.*'      For I have also very lately perceived two very
 minute apical ones, on an apparent species of Cereus. And
 on mongrels purposely raised between Cereus speciosissimus
and Epiphyllum Phyllanthoides, I have likewise very recently
found two apical conspicuous connate and cordato-ovate fleshy
 Cotyledons; and have preserved the whole in spirits.
    In   my    communication for October 1825, page 177, 1. 32,
          for  " frequens" read " sequens" for    ;
 September 1 829, p. 302, 1. 20, for " erectus" read " erecta ;"
 February 1830, p. 108, 1. last but one, after " reptantibus "
           add " ramis ;"
 February 1830, p. 114, 1. last but one, for " plantis" read
           " plantae".
    To the above may be usefully added, that DeCandolle found
two very minute basal Cotyledons on Melocactus communis,
and two small apical ones on his Echinocactus cornigerus.
And hence Echinocactus becomes a subgenus only.

                            [Continued from  p. 57-]
 I~\R. FLEMING, however, has other and equally powerful
"-' reasons for disputing the law of continuity in the construc-
tion of organized matter.        Because some planets in our system
have moons, and others not; because Saturn has a ring, and
because nearly one-half of the comets move from west to east;
therefore there is no transition from one form of organized
matter to the other. Q. E. D.           So also, " If we arrange the
elementary bodies of which this globe is composed in a table,
according to their saturating power or atomic value, the eye
will not fail to perceive a series of coincidences or starts, more
                                                                      or

                   of the Dichotomous System.                   1 SB
or less extensive, from hydrogen at the one extremity to
uranium at the other;" therefore there is no transition from
one form of organized matter to the other. Q. E. D. Nay,
he favors us with a reductio ad dbsurdum of equal value to    :
wit; Let this law of continuity operate on the elements in their
mutual relations, then there cannot exist such a class of bodies
as chemical compounds: but these chemical compounds do
exist    ergo, there is no transition from one form of organized
matter to the other. Q. E. D.
    But although it be difficult to comprehend by what leger-
demain moons and hydrogen are, in the above manner, brought
to bear on the matter, I would ask how Dr. Fleming comes,
to know that in the universe there are not planets with one
two, three, or even a hundred of moons, or other bodies with
rings, besides Saturn? and, above all, I would ask how he
comes to know that minerals do not approach each other more
or less in nature? He is here at direct issue with one of the
most distinguished members of the French Institute, M. Am-
pere, as great a mathematician as chemist, who has published
a Classification Naturelle pour les Corps Simjrtes" and proved,
that " les corps sont tellement coordonnes Vun a V autre, qu'ils
 ne forment non plus une serie mais un cercle /" As to the
 Doctor's series of coincidences or starts, I can only say that
 such an extraordinary coincidence is sufficient to make any
body start, and that I trust he will explain it when he pub-
 lishes his Dictionary of Synonyms.
     The law of continuity, as it relates to forms of matter, may
 truly be proved possible in itself, and, in the next place, to
 exist in nature.    The critic, however, really does not under-
 stand what it means, and reminds me of an equally bright
 acquaintance, who inquired, how there could be a law of con-
 tinuity in the gradation of structure, unless all created beings
 were glued together. His ideas of continuity, like Dr. Flem-
 ing's, were taken probably from a string of mules, where one's
 head is tacked to the other's tail; that is, continuity with
 respect to space.      Continuity in gradation of structure has
 however nothing to do with space or time. Matter, with
 respect to space, is capable of incontinuity, but with respect
 to gradation of form, it is as clearly capable of continuity.       I
  will try to explain this truth to Dr. Fleming ; and for this
  purpose let us return to the above-mentioned beautiful Grecian
  temple, the kirk ofFlisk; and let us suppose it to have for
  its neighbour a sublime specimen of the Gothic in the parish-
  kirk of Frisk.    Let us suppose, that between these two dif-
  ferent kirks there is a transition made from one form to the
  other by an infinite number of intermediate kirks, passing
                                                                from

 1 36      Mr.  W.   S. MacLeay    on the Dying Struggle
from pure Grecian to the pure Gothic architecture. The
continuity, wheresoever as to space the kirks intermediate in
structure may be placed, will be perfect so far as relates to the
gradation of form.        And yet there must ever be some differ-
ence between the two structures nearest each other in form
for if no interval exists, then these two must have the same
structure, and one of them will thus produce no effect in con-
tinuing the chain of structure.         In this kind of continuity,
therefore, intervals between different forms are absolutely ne-
cessary ; and if they do not exist, there is only one form.      In
space or time, which afford the only continuity that Dr.
 Fleming can comprehend, an interval is impossible; and
their continuity depends on this impossibility.      On the other
hand, continuity in gradation of structure depends on the
existence of intervals but requires, in order that the gradation
                         ;
be more distinct, that these intervals be extremely small and
numerous. If only one mean be interposed between two ex-
tremes, there will be two chasms but no salhis, and the three
objects will be in continuity.    Augment the number of various
intermediate objects, and you only get the chasms more nu-
merous and the continuity more perfect. To chatter there-
fore about the innate impossibility of the law, is absurd     : the
only question for us now to examine, being, whether such a
continuity as I have described can be shown to exist in
 Nature.
    I think I have proved this in my Analysis and Synthesis of
Petalocerous Coleoptera.       You, my dear Vigors, have proved
it in Birds; and what the Linnaeans call natural genera, such
as Rosa and Erica, are likewise all proofs of it: so that if con-
tinuity manifestly holds good in these particular parts of the
Creation, which have been carefully examined, it may hold
good in all. True it is that Nature does not always proceed
pari passu. In the Linnaean genus Psittacus, a group of very
limited structure, the chain is composed of an immense num-
ber of links; whereas, in Pachydermata, a group presenting a
very wide range of structure, the number of links is compara-
tively small.    Still there is continuity manifest in both ; the
difference depending merely on the relative distance between
some two contiguous forms in each. Chasms in the chain may
be numerous and small, as in Psittacus, or few and wide, as
in Pachydermata      • but an hiatus is not synonymous with a
saltus.
    Some   years ago, in a paper in the fourteenth volume of the
Linnaean Transactions,      I stated it as an undoubted fact, that
hiatus or   chasms are every where in nature presenting them-
selves  to the view; and I think I have now satisfactorily ex-
                                                           plained

                     of the Dichotomous System.                  137
plained  how the more numerous they     are they produce the more
continuity.   " But this truth by no means contradicts the Lin-
nsean maxim, that no saltus exists in nature, although such has
been esteemed its effect by certain naturalists, who have been
in the habit of taking the words hiatus and saltus as synonymous
terms. Thus the series of the Systerna Natures and of the Regne
Animal is not natural where the Cetacea intervene between qua-
drupeds and birds, but is perfectly consonant with nature where
the tortoises are made to follow these last. In the first case there
is a saltus or leap from quadrupeds to birds over a group
totally dissimilar to the latter; there is, in short, an unnatural
interruption of the law of continuity, which shocks not merely
the naturalist but the ordinary observer.        In the other case
there is only an hiatus or chasm, which the discoveries of a
future day may fully occupy."
   Having thus, I think, established the truth of the law of con-
tinuity as well as of an unity of plan in the Creation, I arrive at
the cold, unfeeling sneer on the venerable and excellent natu-
ralist, whom Dr. Fleming, ever equally accurate, calls Lamark.
I am so far removed from the scientific world that I know not
whether Lamarck be alive or dead; but I revere him if still on
earth, and respect his memory if he has ascended to a better
place. Time has only shown me more and more the truth ol
what eight years ago I said of him. " His peculiar and very
singular opinions have never gained many converts in his own
country, and I believe none in this. They are indeed only to
be understood by those who are already supplied with the
means of refuting them ; so that the mischief they may have
occasioned being comparatively null, we may be permitted to
assign due praise to the labours of Lamarck, as being those
of the first zoologist France has produced as being those of
                                               ;
a person, whose merits in natural history bear much the same
relation to those of M. Cuvier, that the world has been com-
monly accustomed to institute between the calculations of the
theoretical and the observations of the practical astronomer."
   Dr. Fleming, by the way, seems to hint that I borrowed the
distinction of affinity and analogy from Lamarck.           But this
only proves that he reads as he reasons. Lamarck says, " On
distingue les rapports en ceux qui appartiennent a differens
etres compares, et en ceux qui ne se rapportent qu'a des par-
ties comparees entre des etres differens." Now the first of these
kinds of rapports may be either relations of affinity or of
analogy, for both affinity and analogy present resemblances
between different objects compared with one another; and the
second kind of rapports I shall speedily explain as having no
connexion with relations of analogy. There may be good
   N.S. Vol. 8. No. 44. Am. 1830.                T            reason

138        Mr.  W.  S. MacLeay     on the Dying Struggle
reason to doubt whether Aristotle did or did not make the
true distinction between relations of affinity and analogy, as I
have shown in a paper lately most shamefully misprinted in
the Linnsean Transactions, vol. xvi. p. 9.; but it is indisputable
that Lamarck never did make the distinction.         Lamarck de-
scribes three kinds of " rapports entre des organizations com-
parers," and two kinds of " rapports entre des parties sem-
blables ou analogues."     All the three first kinds of" rapports"
appear to be relations of affinity. It is indeed possible that
true relations of analogy may be confounded with relations of
affinity under the second of these three, which is " celle qui
embrasse les rapports entre des masses d'animaux differens
comparees entre elles." Vol. i. p. 354. But whether this be
 so or not, the " rapports entre des parties semblables ou
analogues," however these words may jingle in the ears of
 Dr. Fleming, have, as Lamarck has explained them, nothing
whatever to do with what I term relations of analogy. Of
 these " rapports" he describes, as I have said, two kinds, viz.
 " rapports particuliers entre des parties non modifiees," and
 " rapports particuliers entre des parties modifiees:" in other
words, the relations in point of value, as a groundwork of di-
stinction, between different systems of organs, such as those of
digestion, respiration, circulation, &c, and the relations in
point of value, as a groundwork of distinction, between differ-
ent forms of the same organ as they exist in different groups.
The study of the first kind of these relations is of use to point
out to us whether, in the variation of animals for instance, we
ought to lay most stress on the organs of digestion, like Lin-
naeus, or on the form of their eggs, like Sir Everard Home.
The study of the second kind of relations is of use to point
out to us whether, in the arrangement of animals for instance,
we ought to lay most stress on the variation of the structure
of the eye in Vertebrata where it is perfectly formed, or among
Mollusca where it is imperfect.       Surely neither of these two
last relations are relations of analogy. Yet this Dominie, who
cannot understand Lamarck, has the impertinence to scoff at
him   !
    M. Virey   out of national jealousy, as Dr. Fleming from
other feelings, has attacked me on this head.          They have
both impotently endeavoured to fix upon me the charge of
 plagiarism, with respect to the distinction of relations of
 affinity from those of analogy.      I have however repeatedly
 stated that Linnaeus, Pallas, and Desfontaines, and even
 Aristotle himself, have all mentioned certain analogies in na-
 ture as distinct from affinities, before I was born. They have
 mentioned the existence of this distinction in particular cases,
                                                              but

                     of the Dichotomous System.                 139
but I first pointed out its nature and its general application,
and called the attention of naturalists to the subject.
   Dr. Fleming says, that the distinction between these two
relations is only respected by me (for, as I have shown, La-
marck never made it) when they suit my views. This is to a
certain degree true; but let us examine the full value of the
remark, and we shall find that it is a proof of my respect for
nature.     Let us take his definition of relations of affinity
and analogy which he fathers off upon me, but to which he
nevertheless appears to give his full consent.         Relations of
affinity, says he, are relations of resemblance between different
objects compared with each other; and relations of analogy
are the relations of particular parts of different objects. Why,
if this be all the distinction, there is in reality none  ; the last
                                         —
kind being clearly involved in the first a resemblance between
parts being only a partial resemblance between the wholes.
 How   then is this confusion between the two relations to be
prevented?     By   applying another and most necessary con-
dition to relations of analogy, namely, their parallelism.     And
now Dr. Fleming        will  understand the reason why I only
respect the distinction he makes between relations of affinity
and analogy, when the latter suit my views of their necessary
parallelism.    I will repeat here for him, what I long ago said
on the subject in the Linnaean Transactions: " The theoretical
difference between affinity   and analogy may be thus explained.
 Suppose the existence of two parallel series of animals, the
 corresponding points of which agree in some one or two re-
 markable particulars of structure. Suppose also that the ge-
neral conformation of the animals in each series passes so
 gradually from one species to the other, as to render any in-
terruption of this transition almost imperceptible.       We   shall
 thus have two very different relations, which must have re-
 quired an infinite degree of design before they could have
 been made exactly to harmonize with each other.
    " When therefore two such parallel series can be shown in
 nature to have each their general change of form gradual, or,
in other words, their relations of affinity uninterrupted by any
 thing known; when moreover the corresponding points in
 these two series agree in some one or two remarkable circum-
 stances, they afford relations of analogy, and there is every
 probability of our arrangement being correct.       It is quite in-
 conceivable that the utmost human ingenuity could make these
 two kinds of relation tally with each other, had they not been
 so designed at the Creation."— See also Linn. Trans., vol. xiv.

 the ancient analogy detected between the moon and a green
 cheese, on account of both being round.                The learned Mr.
 Kirby, for instance, in his " Introduction to Entomology,"
 has written in a most flattering manner of my distinction be-
 tween relations of affinity and analogy but it grieves me to be

 obliged to confess that he appears not to understand it, and
 that his mistake principally proceeds from his forgetting the
 necessity of parallelism between different relations of analogy.

 XXI.     Narrative of an Excursion to the Summit of the Peak

 AFTER         leaving on our left a steep mountain of pumice,
       called Montana Alta, we passed La Estancia de la Cera
 and La Cueva de la Machoura, and entered the Canadas del
Pico, the thermometer standing at 50° *5. The Canadas is an
immense plain of white and yellow pumice, extending round
 the Peak from W.S.W. to E. by N. forming part of an
 ellipsis of seven or eight square leagues in extent.             The sur-
 face is 8957 feet* above the level of the sea; and rather to-
 wards one side of this plain, in lat. 28° 17' N., and in Ion. 16°
 39' 45"  W.   rises the Peak   to the further elevation of      3231   feet.
    At 10 h 30 m A.M., thermometer standing            at 49°, we passed a
mass of porphyritic rocks called           La Gayeta, and afterwards
some of a similar character, called by the guides La Estancia
 de Juan Benitiz. Shortly afterwards a thick mist swept across
   * This elevation was ascertained by M. Mouneron by levelling, and after-
wards confirmed by Humboldt by barometrical admeasurement, calculated
by the formula of Laplace. Most of the elevations which I have given here
were very kindly furnished me by Dr. Don Domingo Savinon of Laguna, a
physician, who by his various scientific attainments is an honour to his pro-
fession. This gentleman has a collection of valuable observations respecting
the physical history of TenerifFe, which, it is to be hoped, he will at some
future period give to the world.

us,   which lowered the thermometer to 44 5 : we at the same
time passed a small extinct volcano called Montana Ncgra,
or more generally known by the name of Los Gorros ; in it
are several caves, which the men who supply Santa Cruz and
Orotava with snow, use as ice-houses, by filling them with
snow, which they collect at the foot of the Peak at certain
seasons of the year when snow cannot be collected there,
                       :
they go up to a cave, which is 2131 feet higher up.             For
four baskets of snow, which is a mule-load, they obtain at
Santa Cruz a sum only equal to 135. 4c?. after undertaking a
journey of nearly 80 miles, reckoning from their own house
and back again. These men likewise act as guides to those

who visit the Peak, and are generally found both faithful and
obliging.
     At twelve o'clock we arrived at the foot of the Peak, and
halted for a few minutes.      The surface was composed of red-
dish-coloured pumice, studded over with large blocks ofgriin-
steinic lava of a grayish-green colour, mixed with crystals of
felspar, masses of common obsidian, and large bushes of
mountain broom.       We    found the temperature of the air to
fluctuate considerably, according as the wind blew away the
surrounding vapour. When we first arrived, the thermo-
meter stood at 44° in the shade; but it shortly afterwards rose
to 50° in the same situation, and to 57° where it was indirectly
 exposed to the influence of the sun.    A  small surface of aether,
 •25 of a line in depth, and sheltered from the sun and wind,
 evaporated in rather less than three minutes; and the bulb of
 a thermometer, covered with silk and kept moist, lowered the
 mercury three degrees in the same time. When I ascended
 the Peak on the 13th of October 1827, the same experiments
 had different results.   A  similar quantity of aether, and at the
 same spot, evaporated in about one minute and a half; and
 the thermometer, enveloped in the same manner, fell 4°*5 in
 less than three minutes.     I found the boiling point of water to
 be from 189 o, 5tol90°, and strong Havanna rum boiled at 175°;
 in the town of Orotava (1040 feet above the sea) water boiled at
 from 209°'2.5 to 209 Ol 5. When I ascended the Peak on the
 13th of October 1827, water boiled at the same spot at 188 0, 5.
      We  began to mount the Peak by a very steep ascent over
 beds of small yellowish-coloured pumice, between two em-
 bankments or currents of lava, which had separated from the
 general mass, called Mai Pais, situated at Alta Vista Arriba,
  1664 feet above the foot of the mountain. These currents
 are not in connected masses, but consist of immense blocks
  of various sizes and forms and different parts of the same
                                ;

 internally a shining vitreous lustre, breaking with a conchoi-

 destroyed by the action of fire ; others have an earthy ap-
 pearance, and although cellular, are hard and heavy ; and to-
 wards the upper part of the stream were several blocks of
phonolite of a greenish gray-colour.
    After a fatiguing but not a difficult ascent, which took us
 three quarters of an hour to accomplish, we arrived at a part
of the Peak which is 9930 feet above the level of the sea,
called La Estancia de los Ingleses de Abaxo, the lower resting-
place of the English     : the pumice here forms a tolerably level
surface of a few hundred feet square; towards the N.N.E. side
of it are scattered several large blocks of obsidian under the
                                                      ;
lee of one of them we lighted a fire of dried mountain broom,
and piled up some stones to form a shelter from the wind,
which was then blowing a hurricane.
    One hundred and twenty-eight feet above this Estancia,
is another called La Estancia de los Ingleses de Arriba, the
upper resting-place of the English, and is to be noticed as the
highest point at which the Spartium nubigenum is to be found;
after inspecting it, I think this place affords better shelter in
summer to a small party of visiters to the Peak, than the one
below.
    After taking some refreshment, we resumed the ascent with
the intention of observing the temperature of the summit that
evening, and likewise next morning; the acclivity became
more and more difficult, the pumice frequently gave way be-
neath our feet, and in many places the frozen state of the snow
gave us considerable annoyance from the extreme difficulty
of climbing up it.
   In an hour we arrived at Alta Vista Arriba, which is
10*621 feet above the sea, and is at the end of the surface of
pumice, at the point of intersection of the two branches of
lava, between which we had been ascending. Here my guide
declined to proceed any higher that evening, because we
should not be able to arrive at the top of the Peak before
dark ; and even if we gained the summit, we should be obliged
to remain there all night without the slightest shelter, which
would have been fatal at that season of the year. I was there-
fore obliged to defer my journey till next morning, and to
retrace my steps to the Estancia.
   The remaining hours of light were employed in endeavour-
ing to obtain some shelter from the wind, by forming a wall
of lava and pumice     :   for some time all our various contri-

vances were useless as it blew in eddies and frequently scat-
                       ;
tered our fires: but two hours after sunset the violence of the
gale very much abated, and only came in hollow gusts with a
noise similar to that of distant thunder in a mountainous
country.
   My   guide and muleteer soon forgot all their fatigues in a
peaceful slumber; but the scene around me was so strange
and interesting, and my feelings were so closely allied both to
pleasure and pain, that sleep was completely banished from
my eyes.     My   imagination took me to that distant period,
when   the Canadas upon which the Peak is situated was an in-
flamed gulf of volcanic matter, twenty miles in circumference,
and nearly a thousand       feet deep, sending forth on all sides
torrents of liquid lava, raising plains into high mountains or
sinking elevated lands into valleys, and creating by degrees the
celebrated volcano upon which I was placed, and which must
have so frequently threatened destruction to the interesting
people who were so cruelly exterminated by the sword of the
Spaniards. But everything around me was now calm and
placid: the valleys and mountains below were hidden from my
view by white fleecy clouds, which had the appearance of an
immense plain of snow some hundred square miles in extent;
and towering above this sea of vapours, like rocks in the ocean,
were the elevated lands of Canary, the mountain of Angostura*
in the Cumbre, Montana Blancaf above the Valley of Oro-
tava, Pedrogil % on the S.E. side of the same valley, and the
Risco of Guqjara §, which is a part of the elevated chain of
mountains surrounding the Canadas from K. to W.S.W.
From the refractive state of the atmosphere, these elevations
appeared to be higher than they actually were. This was
particularly marked by the neighbouring mountain of Guajara,
which is only nineteen feet higher than the Estancia ; yet at
night it appeared to be considerably above it.
   The blueness of the zenith was such, that a person who
had not witnessed it would have supposed it unnatural if he
had seen it represented in a picture ; and from the clearness of
the atmosphere, the light given by the stars and planets was
sufficient to enable me to see to write my observations ; and
Venus left a faint glimmering of light on a wreath of snow
near my resting-place and when the moon, which was just en-
                         ;
tering her first quarter, arose, I could distinctly see the degrees

upon   my thermometer. Another still stronger proof of the
extreme clearness of the atmosphere is, that I observed the
moon to be indented like a saw, between the light and obscui'e
part, which I suppose was caused by the projection of the en-
lightened tops of her mountains upon the part which was de-
prived of the sun's light. At first I thought it was some optical
illusion, as I had just before been standing before the fire, and
was almost blind by the smoke; but repeated observations
which I made during the night convinced me that I was right
in what I first observed.
   There is another observation which I made that may be
worth mentioning. Soon after the sun went down the wind
became much louder and had an acuter sound, although the
force was very considerably less than in the day-time. It has
been observed from the earliest antiquity, that the air becomes
more sonorous at night than in the day; but I am not aware
that the cause of it is well ascertained.   The general opinion,
I believe, is, that the air becoming colder, is therefore denser
and more susceptible of conveying the sonorous waves. This
to a certain extent   may be correct, as it has been well ascer-
tained by Dr. Priestley, that the force of the pulsations of
sound depends considerably upon the degree of density or
rarefaction of the air and I think Captain (now Sir Edward)
                        ;
Parry mentions the surprising distance he was enabled to hear
sound during the winter at the North Pole. From frequent
observations which I have made in Teneriffe, I am inclined to
attribute the intensity of sound at night to a certain increase
of moisture, and to an equability of temperature in the different
strata of the atmosphere.     The  increased intensity of sound,
when    I was on the Peak during the night, could not have
been caused by an increased density of the atmosphere be-    ;
cause instead of becoming colder, it was four or five degrees
warmer when the sound of the wind became more sonorous.
Humboldt has made a similar remark and as my observations
                                         ;
fully coincide with his opinion, I beg to quote it. He ascribes
the diminution of sound during the day to the presence of the
sun, which influences the propagation and intensity of sound,
by opposing to them currents of air of different density, and
partial undulations of the atmosphere produced by unequal
heating of different parts of the ground. In these cases a wave
of sound, when it meets two portions of air of different density,
is divided into two or more waves, a part of the primitive wave
being propagated with more rapidity through the denser por-
tions than the parts that pass through air of less density. In
this way the wave is broken down into different parts, which
arrive at the ear at different times.   These   different portions
                                                                of

of the wave passing again through succeeding portions of the
atmosphere of different density, may be so wasted and frittered
down as to be incapable of affecting the tympanum.
   My observation respecting the intensity of sound is not con-
fined to the Peak. At the town of Orotava, situated about two
miles from the sea, the noise of the waves in the morning
occasionally had a grave low tone: at the same time the air
appeared to be particularly dry, and distant objects were very
indistinct.    Towards the middle of the day, or the beginning
of the afternoon, the island of Pal ma, nearly sixty miles
distant, could be distinctly seen ; and the ridge of mountains
that surround the valley of Orotava were apparently brought
so close, that the vegetation upon them could be observed:
at the same time the sound of the sea invariably passed from a
grave to an acute sound. The natives prognosticate rain when
this particular clearness of the atmosphere takes place      ; and I
have generally found them correct.
   But to return from my digression. At various times in the
night I observed meteors, like rockets, with luminous points,
shooting about in the atmosphere, apparently at an elevation
not much greater than the top of the Peak. Their appearance
was different from those ignited vapours commonly called
falling- stars, and their course was different, as they generally
moved in a horizontal direction.
   At no period of the night did          the thermometer fall below
34°,  and the average height of it from 5 P.M. to 5 A.M. was
37°; but from the great rarefaction of the air, it appeared by
the feelings to be considerably below the freezing point.

THIS       work contains a proposition deserving of notice, as being
      in a great  measure new, and of considerable importance in the
theory of the motion of      fluids.  The proposition may be thus ge-
nerally stated  :
                  — If fluid of any kind be moving in such a manner
that at the same point in space the velocity is constantly the same
in quantity and direction, and if x, y, z, be the forces impressed at
any point whose coordinates are x, y, z, and v be the velocity at
this point, then will

Mr. Moseley, which          is as follows, is remarkable for simplicity and
is  perfectly general.         Let 4>, <f>', 4>", be the effective accelerative

the integration being performed with respect to x,y, z, only; t the
time being constant. But when the motion is uniform, a given
particle in the successive instants of its motion, passes through the
 states of the particles, which at a given instant are situated on the
 path of its motion. Hence, if the integral above be taken in re-
 ference to an arbitrary portion of this path, the term f(<pdx+<p'dy
 +   $''dz) may be taken in reference to the motion of a given par-
 ticle along this portion.          But in this case we know from the prin-
 cip, s     of dynamics that       f (<pdx + f'dy +         <p" dz)  =           c,  the
 constant c depending on the motion at the arbitrary limit. Hence
 the proposition enunciated manifestly follows.

       _
   This Memoir gives an outline of the mineral constitution of a
large tract in the south of Ireland, comprising the counties of Cork,
Kerry, and Clare, with part of those of Galway, Tipperary, and
Waterford and thus connecting this portion of the island with the
            ;
eastern part of it, formerly described by the author.
   This hilly and diversified region is chiefly composed of ridges,
having generally a direction from east to west, and attaining their
greatest elevation in the mountains of Kerry, where Gurrane Tual,
one of Magillycuddy's Reeks, near Killarney (the highest land in
Ireland), is 3410 feet above the sea.
   The rocks in this elevated country are chiefly of the transition
class : they decline gradually towards the north, and finally pass
under the old red sandstone and carboniferous limestone of the
midland counties.
                           I. Transition Series.
    In Kerry there   is a persistent series of transition rocks, having a
general direction from east to west, and dipping to the north and
south with vertical beds in the axes of the ridges : the strata as they
diminish in inclination on each side, form a succession of troughs.
The principal rock-masses are composed of grauwacke, slate, and
limestone ; but the general series is distinguished, by the author,
into simple and compound rocks ; the simple being clay-slate,
quartz-rock, hornstone, lydian-stone, and limestone.           The com-
pound sandstone and conglomerates with bases of clay-slate, quartz,
and sandstone ; grauwacke, and grauwacke-slate ; sandstone and
sandstone-slate ; greenstone ; and hornstone-porphyry.           Roofing-
slate, though comparatively rare, is found of an excellent quality in
the island of Valentia.
    Organic remains occur more frequently in the limestone of this
 series than in the slate and grauwacke.      In Kenmare these remains
 consist of a few bivalves, and some crinoidal remains; and these also
                                    U  2                              are

are most numerous       in  the Muckruss and Killarney limestones. At
the foot of the Slieve-meesh range this limestone includes Asa-
phus caudatus, Calymene macrophthalma, and perhaps a third crus-
taceous animal, with Orthoceratites, Ellipsolites ovatus, an Am-,
monite, Euoraphalites, Turbinites, Neritites, Melanites, and seve-
ral species of Terebratula, Spirifer, and Producta.        Other bivalves
irt this locality are referribie to species figured by Schlotheim, as
from transition rocks on the Continent.
    Near Smerwick harbour, similar organic remains are abundant in
 slate, and fine-grained grauwacke, together with Hysterolites, and
many genera of polyparia ; the whole resembling both in mineral
 and zoological characters the rocks of Tortworth in Gloucestershire,
 formerly described by the author, as well as those of the Taunus in
 Nassau, more recently described by Sir Alexander Crichton. Again,
 the same fossils are found in the limestone of Cork, associated
 with impressions of vertebrae of fishes ; and analogous remains are to
 be met with aho in a portion of the slate of that neighbourhood.
    Transition coal. —   All the coal of the province of Munster, except
 that of the county of Clare, is referribie to one of the earliest periods
 at which that mineral has been produced ; the true coal overlying
 the mountain limestone being found in that county alone.               At
 Knockasartnet, near Killarney, and on the north of Tralee, thin an-
 thracitic beds, inclined at various angles from 70 degrees to verticality,
 are included in grauwacke' and slate.      In the county of Cork this old
 coal is more extensively developed, particularly near Kanturk, ex-
 tending from the north of the Blackwater to the Allow. The gorges
 of the latter river, and various other neighbouring defiles, expose
clay-slate, grauwacke, shale, and sandstone, in nearly vertical beds,
 directed from west to east.        This transition tract extends to the
river Shannon on the north-west.        As the systems range from west
 to east, in a series of parallel, acutely angled troughs, the beds have
great diversity of inclination, dipping rapidly either to north or south,
and bending to horizontality between the ridges. This coal or
anthracite is raised in sufficient quantities for the purpose of burning
the limestone of the adjoining districts ; and the most considerable
collieries, those of Dromagh, have yielded 25,000 tons per annum,
at from 10s. to 15s. per ton.
   The coal, and accompanying pyritiferous strata are abundantly
charged with the remains or impressions of plants, belonging chiefly
to Equisetaand Catamites', with some indications ofFucoides.         Beds
of transition coal occur also in the cOunty of Limerick, on the left
bank of the Shannon, north of Abbeyfeale, and at Longhill ; and are
seen, though in very small quantity, on the right bank of the river at
Labbasheada.       Several other places where coal strata occur, are
mentioned by the author.
   The transition rocks of Kerry and Limerick are prolonged into
Cork and Waterford, preserving with certain modifications an ana-
logous character and composition. The carboniferous limestone re-
posing upon this tract, on the north, is usually unconformable to it,
but  is conformable   to the old red sandstone, wherever that rock in-
tervenes.    In this system of strata, organic remains, such as poly-
                                                                    paria,

paria, bivalves, Trilobites, &c. occur near the Bonmahon river ; the
horizontal planes which they occupy crossing the vertical cleavage of
the slaty grauwacke nearly at right angles.           The series rests upon,
and passes into clay-slate, and is capped by old red sandstone and
strata of the carboniferous order. Metalliferous veins with indications
of copper and lead are seen in the       cliffs of the transition series, east
and west of the Bonmahon river.
              II.   Metalliferous relations in Kerry and Cork.
    The author having succeeded in restoring the copper mines at
Ross Island, on the Lake of Killarney, and in effectually draining off
the water, was enabled to prove that the ore did not constitute a me-
talliferous  bed, or any real vein, but was contemporaneous with
the rock in which it is irregularly distributed in the form of ribs,
branches, strings, &c., analogous to those of calcareous spar, in
limestone.     The rocks at Ross Island consist of blue limestone, and
beneath it of siliceous limestone, but the ore is confined exclusively
to the former     ;  and various trials have proved the non-existence of
any vein communicating with the metalliferous deposit. Copper ore
is similarly distributed at Crow Island       : — but at the Muckruss mines
the ore was obtained chiefly from a metalliferous bed.            The author
has ascertained exactly the extent of the limestone bearing lead in
Kenmare, where most of the unsuccessful trials in search of ore have
shown that the mineral deposits are discontinuous, and nearly parallel
to the range and dip of the beds ; and in Castlemaine mine, where
lead ore was formerly worked in a mass of calcareous spar and
quartz, it thinned out into an unproductive pipe.             Near Tralee and
Ardfort, and on the left bank of the Shannon, lead ore has been un-
profitably worked in limestone, sandstone and slate.
    In the county of Cork, the copper mines are those of Allihies,
Audley, and Ballydehol ; and those producing lead are situated at
 Doneen and Rinabelly. The mine at Allihies is one of the richest
mines in Ireland ; it was discovered only in 1812, and has already
yielded more than 2000 tons of copper ore per annum. The ore occurs
 in a large quartz- vein, which generally intersects the slaty rocks of the,
 country from north to south, but in some places runs parallel to the
stratification.     It is remarked that all this portion of the county of
 Cork indicates a very general diffusion of cupreous particles, so much
so, that in the year 1812 there existed a cupriferous peat-bog on the
 east side of Glandore harbour, forty or fifty tons of the dried peat
 producing when burnt, one ton of ashes, containing from ten to fifteen
 per cent of copper. The lead mines of Doneen and Rinabelly are in
 slate.
    In concluding a long series of observations on the mines of the
 tracts described in this paper, the author        remarks that the diffusion
 of metallic substances throughout the mass of rocks is far from being
                                —
 an uncommon occurrence the metalliferous matter appearing in
 isolated particles, and in strings, veins or filaments, more or less con-
 nected with each other, but not continuous or persistent, and there-
 fore of  contemporaneous origin with the rock        itself.
                                                                     III. Car-

                       III. Carboniferous series of Clare.
    The  clay-slate formation in this    county is bordered by a belt of old
red sandstone, to which succeed, in ascending order and conformable
position, the mountain limestone and coal measures, both of which
occupy flat and undulating hills, and the strata usually dip from the east
of north to the west of south ; but seldom at a greater angle than 5°.
The best sections are seen in the cliffs of the west coast, where shale,
sandstone and sandy-flag-stone overlie limestone.             Coal, however,
is there of very rare occurrence, and when disclosed is of very indif-
ferent quality ; and the author infers, that the lower part of the series
in the county of Clare is comparatively poor in this mineral he, how-:
ever, suggests that the best chances of discovering valuable seams
must lie in the elevated regions of Mount Cullun j where if coal be
found, the beds being nearly horizontal, it might be worked with ad-
vantage.
   The Memoir concludes with some observations on the distribution
of diluvial matter in the South of Ireland.
    1. Boulders, gravel and sand, derived from the transition series are
lodged along the borders and sides of the mountains in Kerry.
   2. In a small district of Limerick and Tipperary, situated between
the Gaultees and Slieve-na-muck, the rolled debris consist not only
of portions of the contiguous rocks, but contain also porphyry, which
is not to be found in situ near the vicinity of Pallis Hill.
   3. In the peninsula of Renville, near Galway, the surface of the
carboniferous limestone is strewed over with numerous boulders of
red and gray granite, syenite, greenstone, and sandstone, which must
apparently have been conveyed from the opposite side of the bay of
Galway.

   The basin of Alhama is situated about 50 miles to the south-west of
the basin of Baza, which was described in the former letter. It occupies
a large circular area, bounded on the south and east chiefly by the
primitive chain of the Sierra Nevada, and on the north-west and
south-west by ridges of nummulite-limestone. The greater diameter
of the basin, namely, between the village of Huerta de Santillana on
the north, and the ridge near Alhama on the south, is about 36 miles ;
and the smaller diameter, between the village of Escujar on the east,
and the town of Loja on the west, is about 30 miles. The principal
river traversing the basin is the Genii, which takes its rise in the
Sierra Nevada to the east of Granada ; and having received all the
minor streams which water the basin, it passes through a chasm in
the nummulite-limestone near Loja, and afterwards unites with the
Guadalquiver.

   The whole area of the basin, with the exception of an insulated
group of transition limestone rocks near Granada, is occupied by con-
glomerates, marl, gypsum, and limestones containing freshwater
shells.   The conglomerates predominate to the north and east of
Granada, and form a high tract of waving hilly ground between that
city and the eastern part of the Sierra Nevada j and the other depo-
sits prevail through the southern portion of the basin.         The valley
through which the Genii flows is the lowest part of the district, and
is composed near Granada of a disintegrated conglomerate.
   The author gives a detailed account of the geological appearances
presented along the line of road from Granada to Alhama. The lower
strata consist of beds of gypsum alternating with strata of marl and
marly, micaceous sandstone. The gypsum is in general of the ordinary,
fibrous variety j but near the village of Escuzar, alabaster of a beau-
tiful whiteness is quarried.   In the bed of a rivulet passing by La Mala
a brine-spring issues, which yields from 18,000 to 24,000 fanegas of
salt yearly ; the fanega being equal to 251bs Spanish.        The strata of
marl and gypsum are covered with a compact limestone, containing
casts of Paludinse ; and on this limestone rest irregular masses com-
posed almost entirely of comminuted shells of the genera Limnsea and
Planorbis. The fossils found in these limestones have been examined
by Mr. J. Sowerby, who has supplied the following list:
Planorbis rotundatus, found in the      Paludina pusilla, of Deshayes.
   Isle of Wight.                       Paludina Desmarestii.
Planorbis rotundatus vel planu-         Paludina pyramidalis.
   latus.                               Ancylus.
Planorbis,   new  species.              Cypris.
Bulimus    pusillus, of Broard.         Limnaa.
   The structure of the country around Alhama        is explained by three
sections in the immediate vicinity of that village.      One of these, ob-
served by following the horse-road from Alhama towards Loja, presents
in an ascending order the following succession of horizontal strata,
 and may be taken as the type of the others.
    1. The nummulite limestone, which constitutes the boundary of part
of the basin.
    2. A coralline limestone, which in some parts alternates with a
calcareous sandstone and a fine-grained conglomerate ; the sandstone
 abounds with a Pecten, which resembles the Pecten reconditus of the
 London clay.
    3. The rock composed of alternate strata of gypsum and marl.
    4. The freshwater limestone with Paludina, above described, which
 forms a table land, extending in the direction of Loja as far as the eye
 can reach.
    Under the freshwater limestone, near the village of Arenas, is a
 large deposit of brown coal of unknown depth.         The remains of Pla-
 norbis are abundant in the upper layers of it.
    In conclusion, the author states that he had observed a compact
 limestone containing Limnsea and Planorbis, near Partaloba, in the
 province of Granada ; Montesa, in the province of Valencia and La
 Gineta ; and Ocana, in the province of La Mancha ;      — that he had like-

wise ascertained the existence of an extensive lacustrine basin near
 the town of Terruel in the province of Arragon, composed of a coarse
 limestone containing Limnsea pyramidalis (a fossil of the isle of
Wight), resting upon gypsurn and marl.

        NOTES ON DR. ROGET's REPLY* TO MR. BABBAGE.
THE        Secretary of
       sident attempted
                          the Royal Society having in his letter to the Pre-
                             to explain away the charges I had brought
against the mode of keeping our minutes, proceeds in his " Observa-
tions" to assert that they are "groundless accusations ;" and with sin-
gular infelicity himself supplies the most undoubted evidence of their
truth.
    There are three points on which he complains.
    1st. I have asserted that a certain minute of 26th Nov. 1829         is  not
correctly entered.
    To refute this the Secretary states that he destroyed the original
minute [" the rough draft was destroyed . ."], and caused to be en-
                                               .  .
tered on our minutes a resolution which he himself admits to be at va-
riance with the fact f.
    2nd. I have complained of great delay in entering the minutes of
the Council in the proper book.
    To this Dr. Roget replies, that one % of the three cases 1 have given
(and he must be aware I could easily have enumerated many more) is
    * Published in the last Number of the Phil. Mag. and Annals of Philosophy.

    1 1 shall not follow the Secretary into the special pleading, by which it is
denied that the meeting of the 11th of February was a Council. I may perhaps
 offer a few observations upon it in a subsequent edition of my work ; but I
think it would be ungenerous to a valuable officer of our Society, who can-
 not avail himself of the same means of rectifying a misapprehension, to
 allow it to be inferred, which it might, perhaps, from Dr. Roget's Observa-

not an instance of delay. Of what avail is the remark, even were it
correct ?    For the Secretary himself admits that he purposely delays
them j and he defends that practice lest " an improper use might be
made of them." I see no other interpretation of this than to suppose
 that the Secretary presumes the Fellows of the Royal Society will
 make an improper use of their own documents.
    Such are the charges which the Secretary of the Royal Society has
                                     —
 pronounced to be " groundless," a term about as appropriate as that
by which in his letter he designates the transition from fact to fiction
 as           a correction [" That minute was afterwards corrected"]       .
    3rd. The Secretary having stated in his letter to the President, that
 I have drawn the "sweeping conclusion that the whole of the minutes
" are unworthy of the least confidence, and can never hereafter be appealed
" to as authentic documents," ventures in his Observations to point to
the concluding paragraph of page 65 of the " Decline of Science in
England"    for the proof.
    I admire the boldness rather than the discretion, or the candour of
such a reference. Whoever will take the trouble to turn to that
passage, will find that      my  observation was confined entirely to one
single Resolution.
    To conclude I have bestowed too much pains on the subject to
                      :
 have any misgivings about the accuracy of the statements I have made
respecting the mismanagement of the Royal Society ; and if I thought
additional evidence necessary for their support, I would invite the
Secretary to refute them.

    Dr. Reade, of Cork, requests us to announce that he is about to
deliver, at the Mechanics' Institution, a course of lectures on his New
Theory of Vision, " demonstrating, from numerous experiments, that
the Cornea is the true seat of vision, and that we see by means of
 erect and reflected, and not by refracted and inverted images."

pupils, a considerable quantity of nitrate of silver.        The finest cry-
stals were put upon blotting paper, and were set aside, out of the
contact of any substances floating in the air.

             MAGNETIZING POWER OF THE SOLAR RAYS.
   MM. Riess and Moser, after alluding to the doubts which many
philosophers entertained as to the accuracy of M. Morichini's ex-
periments, as to the magnetizing power of the solar rays, observe
that the favourable results which Mrs. Sommervile obtained, had
dissipated the doubts of many persons, and consequently that the
supposed discovery had given rise to various theories on the mag-
netism of the earth and its variations.
   The authors then detail the results of their own experiments,
which seem to have been made with great care and under varied
circumstances the conclusion at which they arrive, and which seems
                 :
certainly warranted by their experiments, is, that they have a just
claim to reject totally a discovery, which, as they say, has disturbed
science at various times during seventeen years. The slight varia-
tions which they observed in some of their experiments, and which
they have not concealed, cannot, they conceive, arise from a real
action of the nature of that described by MM. Morichini and
Baumgartner as being so evident and decided ; added to which,
these variations are not always favourable to the supposed disco-

vol. iv., relates to a paper which was published, from the German, in
the Phil. Mag. vol. lxvi. p. 197.
Remarks on an article in the Journal of the Franklin Institute for
   February last, on Fulminating Powders, arid their use in Fire-arms.
   By Joshua Shaw, Esq.
                               To the Editor.
   Sir, —  I am induced, from reading an article        in the Journal of the
Franklin Institute, on the subject of certain fulminating powders
written by Lieut. P. Schmidt, of the Prussian service, to send you
some remarks, which are the result of much experience upon the
point in question.      I hope, however, that you will not expect from an
operative artist, anything which is very systematic or scientific, for in
this case you will be disappointed, as I am equally far from possessing
either the ability or the inclination to furnish it. To me, and to many
more practical men, the learning which writers appear anxious to
evince, seems to predominate over everything else, and thus to de-
stroy the utility of their labours.      It is in vain to attempt to give in-
struction,   excepting a language be used with which the pupil            is in
some degree     familiar.
   In the paper to which     I have, alluded, Lieut.  Schmidt,  in speaking of
                                       X  2                                 the

 the powder made from oxymuriate of potash, sulphur, and charcoal,
observes, that it is made by adding together twelve parts of sulphur,
ten of charcoal, and one hundred of the oxymuriate, and then proceeds
 to give the result of his experiments.        My   object at present is, not to
 treat of the best mode of preparing the different fulminating powders,
but rather to correct the       false statements which are made respecting
 the utility of the different kinds.       I will observe, however, that from
long experience, I can aver that the proportions above given are not
such as will produce the strongest powder from these materials.
    It is perfectly clear to me, that at the time the Lieutenant wrote, the
subject was new to him, and, indeed, he speaks of the recent use of
 the copper caps in Germany.           I have been in the habit of using cop-
per caps for at least thirteen years, and for the last seven years have
manufactured and sold them, at the rate of two millions annually.
After speaking of various contrivances, he says, " Besides these,
other devices have been used for the purpose of igniting this kind of
powder, yet they have all their defects, and offer so many difficulties
 in practice, as to have prevented their general introduction."                It
would then appear that we are, in this respect, much in advance of
 Germany, as we have had the prepared caps in almost universal use,
for many years, and have never met with the difficulties complained
of j this may have arisen, in a great degree, from our having fewerpre-
judices to contend with than the inhabitants of that country.
    Lieut. Schmidt alludes to the observations of Mr. Wright, of
London, on the use of fulminating mercury, mentions his mode of
filling the caps with this material, by means of an ivory rod, to which
he objects as being both laborious and dangerous ; he then recom-
mends a plan of his own, as being much more safe and expeditious.
Although this may be a subject of serious discussion between Eng-
land and Germany, it must here create a smile only. The Lieutenant
speaks of filling several thousands in a week ; by means of an appa-
ratus which I have invented, and long had in use, a little girl fills
several thousand in the course of a few hours, every morning.                In
about four seconds, 500 of the caps are collected together and arranged
for filling, and in about the same time an equal quantity of the pow-
der is deposited In each it is then, with great rapidity, secured by a
                              ;
 cement which renders it impervious to water.
    It is said that difficulties have been experienced in England, in
igniting gunpowder, by the fulminating mercury, and it appears that
the labours of the German professors upon this subject, have resulted
in their drawing conclusions altogether erroneous respecting the
kind of fulminating powder which should be used in fire-arms.
Fulminating silver may be considered as out of the question, on
account of its price, and need not, therefore, be further noticed. With
respect to that prepared with the oxymuriate, its destructive effects
are such as to forbid its use entirely.         It soon rusts the lock, pene-
trates the pores of the iron, rendering it carious, and, consequently,
liable to burst.   We   have long since abandoned the use of it altogether,
and are not likely to resume it, in deference either to English or
German     opinions.
                                                                              It

           Meteorological Observations for June 1830.                       157
   It is plain that    Lieut. Schmidt mistakes the meaning of the word
effect,  as used    by Mr. Wright.      The fulminating quicksilver makes
a louder report than the ordinary fulminating powder, but will not
fire the magazine at so great a distance.            Its fire is rapid, but not
elastkj or expansive, as it quickly condenses, and returns to the state
of mercury    :   it is, however, certain,      and presents no difficulties
whatever.
   The most extraordinary part of the statement is, that the fulmi-
nating quicksilver is more corrosive than the oxymuriate prepara-
tion  !   With what      difficulty do we sometimes arrive at the most
simple truths   !    Nothing can be more gratuitous and false than the
above conclusion. Mr. Forsyth of England expended, it is said, a
hundred thousand pounds in his attempts to establish the use of the
percussion magazine lock, in which he failed altogether, from the
corrosive effects of the powder ; the whole 14 years of his patent were
devoted to this point.        As soon as this period had terminated, Mr.
Wright introduced the fulminating mercury, since which there has
been no complaint whatever of the corrosion of locks and barrels,
excepting from the use of imported caps charged with the old ma-
terials.
   The cement used is a point of much importance: gum benjamin
and gum arabic have been principally employed j the first is always
soft, the latter attracts moisture ; neither of them answers well.         The
French, to obviate the defects of both these, sought the remedy by
enlarging the caps at the bottom, so that when the powder is intro-
duced and dry, it is, as it were, dove-tailed in, and a smaller quantity
of either of the foregoing ingredients will retain it.           This lessened,
but did not remove the evil.
   In America, the percussion gun has, in consequence of the man-
ner in which the caps have been made here, been more generally em-
ployed than in England, although the guns themselves are the manu-
facture of that country.       We   have, it is true, ran counter to the rules
established by the German officer and professors ; for, although we
may be less scientific in these matters, we know enough of the amuse-
ments of the field, to derive from our experience that information
which suits us better than the most learned theories, and we even
venture to adopt the suggestions of the former, although opposed by
the deductions from the latter.
   Should you think proper, sir, to give this a place in your Journal,
I shall again request a small place for some future observations, con-
taining the practical results of my own experience, as it may interest
a certain portion of your readers.          Yours, &c.

   General Observations.— The weather       this month has been showery, with
the exception of about ten dry days at short intervals ; and the frequent,
but not heavy rains here have been generally accompanied with cold gales
of wind: so that from the comparatively weak sunshine, and humidity of
the atmosphere, the growth and ripening of most of the vegetables and
fruits, that are looked for at Midsummer, have been retarded.       The various
kinds of corn, though backward for the season, look remarkably strong,
with a promising appearance for plenty. The unexpected continuance of
wet and ungenial weather for the last five weeks, it is hoped, will cause a
more favourable time for the operations of the ensuing harvest.
   Hay-making partially commenced here and in the neighbourhood about
the 20th instant ; but from a series of showers to the 28th, there was no
good opportunity of getting it in therefore those who deferred cutting
                                      :
their grass till the end of the month will have the best hay ; as a long
exposure to showery weather very much reduces its saccharine quality,
and is often the cause of its ignition in the rick. The crops of grass are
generally abundant from the nature of the weather, which appears to be
getting more settled for a few days.
   The mean temperature of the external air this month is nearly 3| de-
grees under the mean of June for the last fourteen years, and it is also
about a degree under the mean of May in 1822 and 1828           !
   From 5 o'clock till nearly sunset in the afternoon of the 2nd, two fine-
coloured parhelia appeared, one on each side of, and each 22£ degrees
distant from the sun's centre      :  they alternately appeared circular and
elongated, and each displayed a white vaporous train sixteen degrees in
length, like the tail of a comet reversed, and it terminated evanescently, or
without defining its conical point. No trace of a solar halo accompanied
these phenomena, but a moist wind and vapours of the cirrostratus kind
were flowing in from the westward and their trains were formed by the
                                         ;
solar rays passing through the increasing vapour that surrounded them.
                                                                              In

    In the evening        two   paraselenes also appeared from nine till after ten
o'clock, without the          bounding edge of a large lunar halo; their distance
from the moon's centre was 24£ degrees, each being about two degrees,
from the interior, and three quarters of a degree from the exterior edge of
the halo they exhibited a faint red tinge, underwent the same changes
            :
of figure as the parhelia in the afternoon, and had white vaporous trains ten
degrees long. These were the best defined paraselenes that we have seen
for   many years past.
   The afternoon of the 25th was              sultry, when thunder clouds passed over
from the S.E., and very vivid sheet and forked lightning emanated from
the clouds in every quarter from sunset till after midnight, which ter-
minated in light rain here, but heavy in other places, particularly in Bath
and its neighbourhood, where the rain is said to have come down in such
torrents, that it raised the Avon to an overflow in two hours, and for
a time gave the streets the appearance of rivers of water. The vivid and
momentary flashes of lightning and loud peals of thunder are described as
having been awfully grand, and the storm tremendous and appalling from
8 till nearly 10 o'clock. By this storm great damage has been sustained
by the heavy rains, and consequently floods, which spoiled and carried
off much of the out-lying hay in different counties; and several lives were
lost by means of the electric fluid.               It appears to have taken its course
through Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somersetshire, Gloucestershire, Coventry,
Staffordshire, Derbyshire, &c, and it extended to the neighbourhood of
London.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are three parhelia, two paraselenae, one solar and
two lunar halos ; and ten gales of wind, namely, two from the North,
three from the South-west, three from the West, and two from the North-
west.

 XXV.       Table of the Atomic Weights of Simple Bodies, accord-
     ing to Thomson and Berzelius, with a mean Weight deduced,
    for each Substance. By Mr. John Pride aux.
    To  the Editors of the Philosophical  Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
 rT, HE well-earned high reputation of Dr. Thomson, who
  •    has, perhaps, done more for the diffusion of the science
than any contemporary chemist the simplicity of the experi-
                                     ;
ments on which his "First Principles" were founded; and
the mathematical precision of his results;  — gave a general cur-
rency to his numbers, the more highly appreciated from their
conciseness and facility. And it is proportionately disappoint-
ing, when habituated to their convenient application, to ob-
serve, that, of several of those experiments which have been
disputed, hardly one, in other hands, has exactly corresponded
to his results.
    If thus obliged, for the present, to defer our expectation of
precise knowledge of the relative atomic weights, we are,
however, not required to undervalue the importance of Dr.
Thomson's investigations. It is a practice, in atomic inquiries,
to obtain approximations by different modes of operation, and
take a mean number, subject to such corrections as may seem
requisite.
    We   have now two general tables of atomic weights, ob-
tained by different experimental methods, and on the au-
thority of men of the first eminence in the science of Chemistry.
Although considerably at variance, yet each is so near the
truth as to have been adopted by a great body of the most
competent judges the numbers of Berzelius being generally
                    ;
used on the continent of Europe, and those of Thomson in
Britain and America.       Is it not probable, until more  defini-

      The following Table for correcting the scale, mentioned in

  The experiments which led me to it being comparatively few,
  it would not have been offered to                            your pages but for the
   obvious reasons above quoted.                       For such a purpose three or
   four places of decimals would have been inadmissible; nor
   does any one employ a scale of equivalents for delicate pro-
   portions, unless as a banker uses an interest-table to check
   his calculations.

                                                                                       {a.) Alumi-

     of Simple Bodies, according         to Thomson     and  Berzelius.     163
    (a.) Aluminum.       —   The number of Berzelius for this metal
is influenced by his Canon, of the proportions observed by
negative substances in combinations ; which makes 2 atoms of
aluminum combine with            3 of  oxygen (Al 2    *) to form alumina.
In following the simpler views of British chemists, as better
suited to the sliding scale, no inference is intended hostile to
that Canon; which has perhaps not been justly appreciated
in this country generally f.            Berzelius deduces his number
from an experiment (Essai sur le Theorie des Proportions
cJiimiques, p. 148), where in 100 sulphate of alumina gave, by a
red heat, 29*934 of alumina. Neglecting the Canon, this will
make alumina |^:f x 5 = 2*14; the mean, with 2*25, Thom-
son's number,       =   2*2, and hence aluminum 1*2.
    (b.) Antimony.      —   The experiments of Thomson giving very
direct results, confirmed by Phillips's analysis of tartar emetic
(Ann. Phil. 2nd Ser. ix. 373), his number is retained ; although
the statements of Berzelius (Essai, p. 123), and more at large
Ann. Phil. iii. 248, throw doubts upon its accuracy.
    (c.) Bismuth.    —   The experimental reasons for the alteration
of the number for bismuth in Berzelius's last table (Ann. Ck.
xxxviii. 427) not being given, his construction of the oxide
only,    Bs 3 , can be referred to for the explanation. Hence two-
thirds of his     number == 8*869 must be taken to compare with
Thomson's ; when they approached so nearly, that under the
circumstances no change seemed desirable.
    (d.) Boron.    —   According to Berzelius's former views (Essai,
p. 126), the atom of boron was 69'655: the experiments on
which the change is founded are not given. It is probable
they are of importance, as they have led him to such a curious
construction of boracic acid as Bo 9 6 ; but until the 4th
volume of his French edition of Chemistry comes out, in which
they will probably appear, we can hardly reckon upon them.
To compare his new number with that of Thomson, we must
take two-thirds of it        =   93*988.
    Thomson makes fluoboric acid             =  4*25; and fluoric      =   1*25
(First Prin. i. 161) ; but if fluoric acid be taken at a mean of
their numbers 1*3, boracic acid will turn out 4'25             —  1*3  =   2*95
   *  The exponent    - is substituted for the bisecting line, to facilitate the
printing  ; as the latter  would require type on purpose.
   t  It seems to have been regarded as a mere rule drawn from the com-
binations of protoxides with substances containing plural atoms of oxygen.
 {Vide First Principles, and Turner's Chemistry.) But this leaves out of view
 the numerous cases wherein a sesqui- or bin-oxide requires a propor-
 tionate number of atoms of acid • as for instance, sulphate of iron, in which,
 by the absorption of oxygen, two-thirds saturate the acid, and one-third
 precipitates : as well as other cases still more complex.
                                        Y2                              instead

164        Mr, Prideaux on      the  mean Atomic Weights
instead of 3    ; and boron 2*95—2       =  '95 ; which would lie be-
tween the numbers of these two eminent chemists between        ;
the result of Berzelius's analysis of borate of ammonia, and
Thomson's of borax and between the analysis of the hydrate,
                          ;
in which they exactly accord, and that of Davy.                 All these
experiments may be referred to (First Prin., article Boron).
    \e.)  Chlorine.  — Although Berzelius's method          of taking the
undecompounded          gases, hydrogen, azote, &c. in volumes,
instead of equivalents, be somewhat incommodious, it was
necessary, in giving his numbers, to conform to it ; and the
fractional expression        is employed as readiest of comparison
by neglecting the denominator.
     It may be here observed, that direct experimental compa-
rison of the atomic weights of chlorine and oxygen, by heat-
ing chlorate of potash very gradually in a platinum crucible
over a spirit-lamp, before I recollected the experiments of
 Berzelius (Ann. Phil. xv. 91), gave me a number for chlorine
 rather less than his although indirect trials, by double de-
                           ;
 composition, gave a number nearly corresponding with that
 of Thomson.
     (f.) Cobalt.  —  The number for this metal being calculated
by Berzelius from experiments not his own, it seemed fair
 to incline the    mean   to  Thomson's   side.
     (g.)  Columbium.    — This number being       also altered, without
stated reasons, in Berzelius's last table,        and two-thirds of     it,
(indicated    by  his construction of the acid    Cb 2 = 769'14-3,
                                                       )              dif-
 fering widely from Thomson's, even if doubled ; these            seemed
no    sufficient indications for altering the latter.
     (h.)                              —
           Fluoron (and Fluorine). If the fluoric be an oxy-acid,
 its   base must have a name; and the above is used as the
 readiest that occurs.
     Berzelius found (Ann. Phil. xv. 280) that fluate of silver,
 " heated to redness, melted, and continued, as long as it was
 exposed to the fire, to give out fluoric acid and oxygen gases
 whilst metallic silver was disengaged :" and he believed this
 was not owing to the presence of water. Even if it had been
 from that cause, it would be remarkable that so energetic a
 substance as the hypothetical fluorine should be so easily
 driven off; when iodine, under similar circumstances, bears
 a red heat. Fluoboric acid is explained on the fluorine hypo-
 thesis (First Prin. ii. 183), as " 1 atom fluorine and 2 atoms
 boron;" although       (at vol.  i. 161) it is said   "Davy's experi-
 ments on the composition of boracic acid Berzelius's ana-
                                                     ;
 lysis of borate of ammonia, and mine of borax           ;
                                                           — preclude the
 possibility of either more or less than an atom of boracic acid
 being united, in fluoboric acid, with an atom of fluoric acid."

There   is an evident oversight here       ; and we can only reconcile
fluoboric acid to the fluorine theory,       by supposing it analogous
to phosgene     gas.    If the oxygen theory be adopted, the base
of fluoric acid will    of course weigh two less than " fluorine."

   (k.) Mercury.     —  I have, on a former occasion*, offered some
reasons for conceiving the black oxide and calomel a suboxide
and subchloride of mercury ; and consequently that the atom
of metal is only half the weight assigned by Thomson.                   My
reasons are shortly these The red oxide is formed floating on
                              :
the mercury, in calcination per se ; the same oxide is produced
by boiling mercury with sulphuric acid, in which process sul-
phurous acid gas is given off"; and water decomposes the salts
of this oxide, precipitating a portion of it, unless there be an
atom of acid for every 12*5 parts of mercury. Solution of cor-
rosive sublimate produces no effervescence with solution of
carbonate of soda, though mixed boiling hot ; nor, mixed in
solution with oxalate of soda, evaporated to dryness, and
subjected to distilled water, does it affect turmeric or litmus
paper, unless the sublimate be in excess.              And the most inti-
mate combination of mercury with sulphur is cinnabar, com-
posed of mercury 12*5, sulphur 2. 12*5 may not be the pre-
cise number, though I think nearer than that of Berzelius.
 12*55 (Wollaston's number) is preferred.
   {I.) Nickel.  —   See note on Cobalt.
   (m.) Phosphorus.      —  The experiments of Dumas, corrobo-
rated by Buss {Ann. Ch. xli. 220), show that phosphuretted
hydrogen contains 150 hydrogen in 100 cubic inches ; and
requires 200 oxygen to produce water and phosphoric acid.
    150 of hydrogen consume 75 of oxygen; and the remain-
ing 125, weighing 42*36 grs., require (from Berzelius's syn-
thesis, phosphorus 100, oxygen 128; on a larger scale than
Davy's) 33*1 of phosphorus; which must have been present
in the gas.      The condensation of the hydrogen, analogous to
that in ammonia, would indicate the atomic proportion 3:1;
and in that case the 125 oxygen (           =  to 250 hydrogen) will be
5:1. The atomic weight of phosphorus will then turn out
              ("150 cub. in. of hydrogen weigh             3*177 grs.

    Then   3-9 phos.  + 5' oxyg.  will give 8*9 for the   atom of phos-
 phoric acid.     But  this quantity saturates    two atoms of base,
 and therefore probably contains two atoms of phosphorus,
 according to Berzelius's formula (Ph 9 ). Thomson makes 9
 phosphoric acid saturate 2 atoms of base; Berzelius 892*3 1.
 His number for phosphorus 196* 155, being very nearly half
 of that found above, and the mean of the three (calculating-
 Thomson's by the same formula) is adopted, neglecting the
 low decimals.
   (n.) Rhodium, &c.     —  Berzelius has given in the 40th volume
of the Ann. Ch. some elaborate Recherches sur les Metanx qui
accompagnent le Platine, in which their atomic weights were
ascertained by a very unexceptionable process,         —   reduction of
the triple chloride, placed in a glass tube, over a spirit-lamp,
by a current of hydrogen gas. The loss gives the chlorine                 ;
and the alkaline chloride being washed away, the metal is
weighed. Soda-chloride of rhodium was used and potash-  ;
chloride of the other four.        His numbers will hardly require
correction for the very different ones of Thomson, obtained by
less satisfactory operations    ;  but being calculated from chlo-
rine, estimated at 442*65, they give (when adjusted to 4*46,
the mean weight of that substance,) the numbers in the third
column.
   (o.)  Silicon. —  Berzelius's number is dependent on his
Canon, before quoted; and the deductions of Thomson (First
Prin., article Silicon) are so satisfactory, and his number is so
convenient in application, as to claim preference over any
result of hypothetical considerations.
   (p.) Tungsten.    —  The difference between these numbers is
so great, that one of them must in all probability involve some
unobserved cause of error; but the results of the experiments
(First Prin. ii. 62; and Ann. Phil. iii. 245) are so nearly
equal, that   it is not easy to discover with      whom      it lies.  It
seems better to go between the two, than to run the hazard
of taking the wrong; and the mean is adopted from expe-
dience merely.
   (q.) Yttrium and Zirconium.       — Yttrium is subject, in a less
degree, to similar observations with tungsten; and zirconium
also, with this difference, that the difficulty of choice consists
in the experiments of Thomson being indirect, and those of
Berzelius not given.
   (r.) Zinc. —  The difference here also is great but Thomson's
                                                     ;
experiments are so comprehensive, and appear to have been
so attentively conducted, that, notwithstanding the exceptions
taken to them, his number seems entitled to more confidence
than that of Berzelius, drawn only from the composition of the
                                                                    oxide

XXVI.       Reply    to the Statement respecting the   Discovery of
    Cygnus Bewickii, published in        the Phil. Mag. and Annals
   for August. By W. Yarrell,           Esq.. F.L.S.
   To   the Editors of the Philosophical    Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
  A  LTHOUGH            anonymous accusations can have little in-
^*- fluence with your readers, and might therefore safely be
treated with the neglect they merit; I yet, in self-defence, re-
quest insertion in your Magazine, of the following brief ob-
servations, in answer to a letter, addressed to you by a mem-
ber of the Natural History Society of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
which appeared in your 44th Number, published at the com-
mencement of the present month.
    It is first necessary that I should justify the opinion I gave
by letter, 'that the distinctions described as existing in the parts
of two swans might be occasioned by "age, sex, or accidental
circumstances."        For this purpose I shall quote, verbatim, the
description itself, as sent me in March 1829, at which time
the opinion was given.
    " A young man, of the name of               , who has given con-
 siderable attention to the ornithological part of Natural Hi-
 story, has the breast- bone and trachea of the common wild
 swan and of the new one and our joint observations are as
                                ;
 follows
    "The new species has eight ribs, and the old one only seven ;
 the two specimens of the breast-bone are the same length, ten
 inches from the extremity of the merry- thought (where it joins
 to the elbow of the neck-bone) to the other end of the breast-
 bone ; but whereas in the common wild swan the bend of the
 trachea takes place seven inches from the extremity of the
 merry-thought; in the new one it is only four inches and a
 half.    In the common wild swan the wind-pipe on entering
 the breast-bone     is nearly round ; in the new kind, so much flat-
 tened as to equal half an inch by a quarter. In the com-
                                                                 mon

 168 Mr. Yarrell's Reply on the Discovery of Cygnus Bewickii.
 mon     wild swan the junction of the wind-pipe with the bronj
 chial pipes takes place just underneath the        bend of the merry-
 thought ; but in the new one, exactly under the hind bend of
 the wind-pipe; and finally, in the new kind the bronchial
 tubes are much shorter.            I am afraid I have only given a
 very bungling description, but I hope, such as it is, it may be
 acceptable.       I quite regret I cannot draw sufficiently well to
 send you a sketch of the two."
    Such is the description ; and having stated it, I leave it to
 the opinion of any person conversant with the subject, whether
 I should have been warranted in deciding that the differences
 were such as would constitute a new species. How few are
 there even now, with the figures of both species before them,
 who would be able to recognise either from such a descrip-
 tion  !   And was I not justified in supposing there might have
 been "error of observation" ? To say nothing of the confu-
sion which renders much of this description unintelligible, it
is  quite clear from      what we now know, that in more than one
part of     it, for ' old species '  we must read new species ', and
                                                  '
vice versa.
    The new light stated by your anonymous correspondent to
have afterwards dawned upon me, he ought also injustice to
have added, was in the month of November 1829, and was
the legitimate consequence of the acquisition of new materials.
And surely I cannot with fairness be accused of any endeavour
to depreciate the merits of Mr. Wingate, whom I have never
spoken to or even seen, when in December last I offered to
him, thus wholly unknown to me except by name, the mate-
rials I possessed, to complete his paper        ; nor that I exhibited
any intention of keeping him out of sight, when, after he had
declined publishing, I included in my statement a notice of his
discovery of the same bird, with a date ten months antecedent
to my own paper.
    I have reason to believe, from several circumstances, that
there was a scarcity of materials at Newcastle, and that they
were insufficient for framing a description of this bird, as re-
garded the internal construction.
    At the end of December I received a letter from Mr. Selby,
requesting to be allowed to mate use of some observations in
a letter of mine on the subject of this bird, with any further
remarks, and the use of any drawings I possessed relating to
this species, which, to use that gentleman's own words, he
writes, "you so appropriately suggest should be named after
our celebrated countryman the late Mr. Bewick." The ma-
terials offered Mr. Wingate I transferred to Mr. Selby, with
all  the additions, which, during the interval, had       come  to my
                                                           knowledge,

 knowledge, at the same time stating, that, as Mr. Wingate
had declined publishing, and I had in the mean time obtained
five additional examples of the new species, I had drawn up
a paper from my own materials, which I had sent in to the
Linnaean Society, with all the drawings I possessed on the
subject.   '
             Mr. Selby's paper, I have no doubt, will be worthy
his high and deserved reputation           ; and the more information
we obtain of so interesting an addition to our native Fauna^
the better.
    I regret sincerely the necessity of referring to private cor-
respondence; but the contents of letters have been quoted
against me, and self-justification must be my apology.

XXVII. An         Attempt to explain theoretically the different Re-
  frangibility of the Rays of Light, according to the Hypothesis
    of Undulations. By the Rev. J. Challis, Fellow of Trinity
    College Cambridge, and of the Cam. Phil. Soc*
r rHE      object of this communication is to follow up an idea
  *   advanced by Dr. Young, to explain theoretically the dif-
ferent refrangibility of the rays of light. (Lectures on Natural
Philosophy, vol. ii. p. 623.)        His notions on this subject have
not met with the attention they deserve, probably because they
are vague, and are not supported by mathematical calculation.
There    is much plausibility in his leading idea, viz. that the ve-
locity ofpropagation of the aethereal undulations which traverse
any medium, is modified by the vibrations of the material
atoms of the medium, and differently according to the different
frequency of the undulations but the precise manner of the
                                      :
modification is probably not such as he supposes, and is open
to further consideration.
    For the object proposed, it will be necessary to attend to the
manner in which a series of undulations is reflected when they
encounter an obstacle.          Suppose the fluid to be such that
the pressure is proportional to the density, p = a2 {\ -J- s)         ;
and the portion of it we consider, to be included in a slen-
der cylindrical tube. Let two series of undulations, equal
in every respect, and generated under circumstances exactly
alike, be propagated in opposite directions along the tube. By
the principle of the coexistence of small vibrations, these un-
dulations will be propagated in their respective directions with-

170     The Rev.     J. Challis     on the different Refrangibility
out affecting each other.            Hence there will be one point at
least, at  which the velocities arising from the two propagations
will be equal and opposite, and consequently the resulting ve-
locity be nothing.        At this point suppose an indefinitely thin
rigid partition to be placed transverse to the axis of the tube,
so as to divide the fluid into two separate columns.               By this
 supposition the state of the motion will in no respect be al-
tei'ed.    But the column on one side of the partition cannot
affect that on the other; therefore if the one be removed, the
 motion of the other will remain unchanged. In this case the
 partition serves as an obstacle against which the undulations
 are reflected; and we are thus taught that the reflected waves
 are exactly like the incident, and are in fact a continuation
 of the incident, but diverted into an opposite direction of pro-
 pagation.     Let the law of the velocity v and condensation 5 of
                               r
 the incident undulations be given by the equations,
               v  = —     a  s   = — m sin    — (x + a     t),
 in  which x is measured from the plane of reflection, in the
 direction of the propagation of the reflected waves, and t is
 dated from an instant at which condensation commences at
 this plane.     By changing the sign of a, we obtain the equa-
 tions,           v' =   a s'   = — m sin     —     [x —a  t),
 applicable to the reflected waves.           At any point distant by x
 from the reflecting plane, the velocity at a time t will be
 v  -f v' =s  —  2  m  sin        cos      , and the condensation     s 4- s'

 the origin of x. a<r      = 2 m sin     l^—  t
     I will just remark, that the foregoing           method of solving the
 problem of      reflection     may   be readily extended to motion in
  space of three dimensions, by conceiving undulations to be
 propagated under circumstances exactly alike from two sepa-
  rate centres, and the fluid to be divided by an indefinitely thin
  rigid partition, bisecting the straight line joining the centres
  at right angles.      The principle of the division qfjluids, as it
  may be called, which is here made use of, is legitimately em-
  ployed, because the possibility of such separation of the parts
  of fluids, without affecting the state of motion or rest, forms a
  characteristic property by which they are distinguished from
  solids, and might be made the foundation of the mathematical
 treatment of them ; since the equality of pressure in all direc-
                                                                       tions

           of the Rays of Light considered                                   theoretically.                   171
tions from a given point, which is usually taken for the funda-
mental principle, is deducible from this.
    Having thus found in what manner a series of undulations
is affected when incident upon an immoveable partition, let us
consider what will take place if the reflecting plane be suscep-
tible of motion, in such a manner, however, that its velocity
is always very small compared to the velocity of propagation.
Suppose the plane to be acted upon by a force n x, varying as
the distance x from the place of rest.                                     Its velocity at the time
t is  —  , and the condensation on the                                  side opposite to that                  on
which the waves are incident                      will        be      ——

                                                                                                         *

   We   thus learn that when the reflecting plane is moveable
in a small degree, in the manner above supposed, the reflected
waves will be similar to the incident, but the condensations of
the former will have to the corresponding condensations of
the latter, a ratio cos <p, which depends on the breadth of the
waves, but is independent of the degree of condensation.
   To apply the preceding result to the action of the waves of
the aether on the particles of a me'dium through which they
are propagated, it will be necessary to make some hypotheses
respecting the constitution of the medium, and the state of the
aether in   its  interior.    I  suppose, after         M.      Poisson, that the
medium     consists of exceedingly minute but finite atoms; so
minute that the space they occupy                 is very small compared to
the intervening spaces free of atoms, and yet so near each
other that an immense number are disposed along a linear
space equal to the mean value of X for luminous waves, which is
a 50,000dth part of an inch. Also for the sake of precision of
idea I conceive the medium to be homogeneous, so as to
contain a given number of atoms all of the same size and mass
in a given space, and the atoms to be spherical in shape.
With respect to the state of the aether in mediums, Dr. Young
says, " It is simplest to consider the aethereal medium which
pervades any transparent substance, together with the mate-
rial atoms of the substance, as constituting together a com^
pound medium denser than the pure aether, but not more
elastic."    At the same time he admits that "the phaenomenon
of aberration is not easily reconcileable with the theory of
undulations, if the aether be carried along before the medium
it pervades, and partake materially of its motion."                          This
phaenomenon seems to leave us at no liberty to suppose that
the density of the aether is at all different in the interior
of mediums from what it is in free space.                   For admitting that
a medium in motion does not carry any portion of aether along
with it, it is difficult to conceive how the spaces into which it
is successively transported should receive a sudden accession
of aethereal matter, and that too without any sensible effect
                                                                            being

          of the Rays of Light considered          theoretically.      173
being produced.       Whatever hypothesis be adopted respecting
the density of the aether in the interior of mediums, it will be
proper to inquire in what manner the motions of the aethereal
particles are modified by the presence of the atoms of the
mediums and this inquiry is peculiarly necessary on the sup-
           ;
position that the density         is the same in mediums as in free
space (which is the hypothesis we have selected, and is the
simplest that can be made) ; for on this supposition the dimi-
nution of the velocity of propagation in mediums must be
solely owing to the obstacle which their numerous and closely
arranged atoms oppose to the free motion of the aethereal par-
ticles.  Wherever the continuity or homogeneity of the me-
diums is interrupted, sensible reflection will take place; but in
the interior of a uniform medium the cause of retardation will
act uniformly, and its mean effect, on the supposition of uniform
propagation, will be, to make the condensation corresponding
to a given velocity greater in a certain proportion than in free
space, and to diminish the velocity of propagation in the same
proportion. This may be inferred from an investigation relative
to this subject, which I gave in the Philosophical Magazine and
Annals of Philosophy for May 1830; in which it was also
shown, by reasoning on the above hypothesis, and on the sin-
gle assumption of the uniformity of propagation, that the ratio
m of the velocity of propagation in free space to that in a me-
dium, may be found from the equation
                               ^=1 =        H,
in  which g is the density of the medium, and              H    a constant
proportional to the mean retardation of a given number of its
atoms supposed immoveable. Hence if the atoms be suscep-
tible of motion, so that when drawn a little from their posi-
tions of rest they tend to return by forces varying as the di-
stances from these positions (and various phaenomena make it
probable that this is actually the case), the quantity H, in so
far as the retardation is proportional to the reflective power
of the atoms, should be multiplied by cos <$>.               For, without
stopping to inquire the manner of reflection from a single
atom, we may presume that the quantity of reflection from a
given number thickly disposed in a plane superficies, will
have a given proportion to the reflection from a continuous
 superficies of equal magnitude, and susceptible of the same
kind of motion as the atoms. Hence,

<p will be greater as \ is greater.         Therefore m will be less as
X is greater. Hence the rays for which A is greatest, that is
the least refrangible rays, will be propagated with the greatest
velocity.         Also the velocity of propagation is independent of
the intensity of the rays.         These results are conformable with
experience.
    As n     is    probably exceedingly small compared with           ——     *
it is  possible that \      may have   a value    much larger than it has

but become very small.            Then cos $ would       =  0, and m   =    1
nearly.         Thus     there may be aethereal undulations much
broader than those which cause light, that do not undergo
sensible change in their velocity of propagation, as they enter
mediums.

    It seems, however, to be found only in mountains contain-
ing magnetic iron-stone, although the quantity of this admix-

indeed it shows itself with different purely magnetic iron-
stones in the greatest variety of degrees of strength, and there
are some of these which show no magneto-polar action.

magneto-polar rocks and fragments, that there is any regula-

rity in  the position of the axes either in One and the same mass
of rock in general, or a fixed correspondence, in the position
of these axes, with the direction of the strata of the rocks.             In-
dividual cases are indeed found in which a number of traver-
sing magnetic axes lie parallel in a rock, and even instances
in which their position is in constant correspondence with the
direction of the strata of the hills in which they are found but        ;
there are found in the same rock, besides those parallel axes,
others of a deviating position, so much so as to intersect and
cross each other, and to meet within the rock with poles of the
same description*.
    But very recently       I received an official report of the mag-
neto-polar property of two basaltic rocks in the Eifel, which
may be considered as an extraordinary instance of variety of
position of the axes contained in them.                On my request to
Bergmeister Schulze of Duren to communicate to me his
observations on them, I received the following letter from him,
which, besides containing the information I sought, gives some
other interesting particulars of the district of the Eifel.
    I consider these two basaltic rocks as peculiarly adapted for
making strict investigations on the polarity of rocks, as they
are comparatively small, and may be examined on every side,
and the variations of the phaenomena are placed close, and yet
very conspicuously, together.           I shall employ my first leisure
for their examination.           For the present, a young but distin-
guished natural philosopher has promised to devote a few
days to this purpose during the Easter vacations. If the re-
sults turn out generally interesting, I shall publish them.                 In
the mean time the following letter may suffice.

    " Since you,      my respected friend, consider the discovery I
 made during      my last summer's excursion in the Eifel of some
 rocks of basalt having magnetic power, sufficiently important
 to be placed before the public, I shall have the honour to give
 you a short account of it. I only regret that it cannot be a
   * The greatest constancy in the position of magnetic axes in polarizing
 rocks has probably been observed in that of the above-named Haidberg.
 But it only requires a close study of the observations made by the last ex-
 aminers of it, Professors Goldfusz and Bischof, to discover that there must
 be in this- rock also, besides a great number of parallel axes, others of a
 deviating position ; a fact which beeomes the more apparent if we compare
 the description of the properties of the whole rock with the experiments
 made by Prof. Bischof with detached pieces of it. See Beobachtungen

   "Although an attempt may be made to form several of the
groups of basalt, with which the Eifel is scattered over, into
lines, there is none so long, and of which the range is so close,
as that round the Nurburg, one league and a quarter south of
Adenau. Its direction is meridional, with a slight inclination
towards the west. It begins in the S. near Bertrich (not far from
the Mosel), with the remarkable formation of basalt and scoria,
runs by Walmeroth, Ulmen, Horperath, over the high Kell-
berg, between the villages of Kellberg and Ursfeld, by the
Nurburg, the detached group near Adenau, with outliers as
far as the Hochthurn and Hasenberg, between Kirchsahr and
Altenahr.       With the exception of the Hohen-Acht, two
leagues S.E. of Adenau, this line includes the highest masses,
exceeding all the summits of grauwacke-slate, on which they
stand ; such are the Hoh-Kellberg, the Nurburg, and the
Hochthurn.         These cones rise between 1900 and 2000
Prussian feet above the level of the Rhine. There is no other
appearance of volcanic origin in the cones of this chain (ex-
cept at Bertrich and the Maars*) than in the basalts of the
Westerwald, Hesse, and Silesia and their nature would have
                                        ;
remained in doubt if the closely aggregated and undoubtedly
volcanic groups, running in a continuous range from the vol-
cano of Bertrich as far as Hillesheim, did not bear the clearest
evidence of it.      I will not allude here to the volcanic range
accompanying the Rhine, as it would draw me too far from
my object, which is to show that the line of elevated basaltic
cones here described, seven         German     miles in length, in their
position nearly parallel with the magnetic meridian, may bear
a relation to the peculiar magnetic property of the rocks of
several of the hills of this line.        I stood on the Michelstein, a
double-pointed hill of basalt ; on the northern mountain range
of the Eifel, the beautiful semi-circle of the high cones of
Hochthurn, Hohen-Acht, Nurburg, Kellberg, and Ahrem-
berg, lay before me.        The   Nurburg      rose in apparently a spi-
ral form, which deception         is  increased by the ruined tower
standing on its summit.         Three days after I ascended it, I
went up from Adenau as far as the Wimbacher-Hohe, be-
tween the village of Wimbach and Nurburg, where a promi-
  * The Maars are circular lakes among the grauwacke-slate, with steep
banks.   Without any visible supply, they overflow copiously through an
aperture in their banks towards the neighbouring valley. Their highest
edge is covered partly with a stratum of volcanic grit, mixed with scoria
and pieces of slate, masses of augite and pieces of basalt, and partly with
an alluvial deposit of trappean substances.
                                                                      sing

         of two Rocks of Basalt near Niirburg     in the Eifel.     177
 sing adit has been driven close.         It consists of various frag-
 ments of rocks, and its course is parallel with the magnetic
 meridian, and consequently with the group of basalt of Niir-
 burg.     The mountain consists of grauwacke-slate, formed of
 beds of common grauwacke, slaty grauwacke, and clay-slate.
 By the trials since made, under the name of Katliarinengrube,
 it is found to fall 70° S.   ;  a clip which is as little constant as
 its  direction.   The great    character of the strata  is undulation,
 and the greater declivities run S. and S.E.
     " The line on which the three highest cones, the Hohe-
 Acht, the Niirburg and the Hoch-Kellberg, are placed, is the
 south-eastern range of the Eifel, from the southern declivities
of which the waters stream towards the Mosel and Rhine, but
from the north-western declivity, towards the Ahr.
     " It seems as if the basaltic cone of Niirburg had afforded
some protection to the grauwacke-slate, as the latter gently
rises even to the spot whence the former abruptly ascends.
The mass of basalt is indeed small when we consider the view
it affords from a distance; but on the other hand the highest
cone is surrounded by several smaller ones, some of which,
such as the Selberg, at its northern foot, near Guiddebach,
equal it in bulk.      This Selberg rises from the bottom of the
valley without,    its top reaching the elevation of the borders of
the valley.      Other cones of a gray colour lie on the southern
declivity of the same valley to the N.E. of the Niirburg;
towards the E., at a distance of about 150 fathoms, rises on the
table-land of the mountain chain a low gentle acclivity, with
low rocks, called the Stein- Ecke, and a quarter of a German
mile, towards the S.W., rises a remarkable cone.             From this
cone several very small masses of basalt run in a line towards
the Niirburg, as it were marking the throwings up of an adit.
Except the Stein-Ecke, all these masses of basalt have nothing
to distinguish them from others of a similar formation. Look-
ing from the top of the Niirburg, I perceived at first some-
thing on the eastern flat hill resembling some unimportant
ruins of a building.      Instead of ruins, however, I found two
insignificant rocks, about half a fathom distant from each other
in their diagonals, about one fathom high, and holding each
half a square fathom in their base. The south-eastern rock is
one fathom long, half a fathom broad the other to the N.
                                             ;                      W.
a little shorter, but broader. Both rocks are in strata, or ra-
ther are separated into thick slabs, as is seen in flinty-slate,
which slaty structure is parallel to the long sides. Their dip is
twelve hours, and therefore parallel to the basaltic range on
which they lie, as well as to that of the metallic ore mentioned
above.      The separating surfaces fall 73° E. This inclination

does not seem to be confined to the rocks as far as they are
exposed, but probably descends deeper into the mountains, as
would seem from an uncovered part I noticed, lower down on
the south side. I marked the direction
of the slaty beds, and communicated
them to the Ober-ehifahrer, Mr. Bech-
er of Commern, who accompanied
me ; on his doing the same, we dis-
 covered a difference.       Our attention
 being thus excited, I went round both
 rocks, and holding the compass every-
 where close to them, noted the direc-
 tions of the needle, as represented in
 the annexed figure*. The variations
 of the needle were always sudden and
 violent, so that its vibrations were few,
 but rapid. The N.W. rock seems to contain a magnetic axis,
 but not the other; in the meridian it attracts the northern
 point of the needle, and on the cross line running through
 the centre, the southern point turns towards the rock.
     " The colour of the mass is dark gray, in some parts iron
 black, on the cross fracture conchoidal, without betraying to
  the naked eye any foreign admixture, such as magnetic iron-
 stone.     It is probable that there are other points about the
 surrounding basalt hills where the needle would be disturbed
 but want of time, and unfavourable weather, prevented my
  making further experiments.
     " From the Nurburg I went to the village of Kellberg, and
 looked the following day for trachyte porphyry with crystals
  ofalbite, about the cone called Freienhauschen.                Here, be-
  tween the hamlet of Kottelbach and the Hoch- Kellberg, are
  two cones close together, to the N. the Brink, and to the S. the
  Frauen, or Freienhauschen. On the first the mass of por-
  phyry is of two kinds; the one apparently prevailing is of a
 liver-colour with delicate admixed parts.            This latter mass is
  very distinctly formed in strata, and attached to, or more pro-
  bably inserted in the other, dipping twelve hours, and dipping
  pretty strongly to the E.        Too much engaged in looking for
  pieces of porphyry with remarkable crystals of albite, I suf-
  fered the weak attractive power of the black trachyte to escape
  my notice, on the spot, not perceiving it till afterwards in some
 pieces I had taken with me.           The strata in the Brink, where

Addition to the foregoing Article :     —  On the Magnetic Polarity
    of two Basaltic Rocks in the Lordship of Schrockenstein. By
    M. Reuss of- Berlin, Counsellor of Mines.*
    To   the very interesting discovery of magnetic polarity in
two rocks of basalt near Nurburg          in the Eifel, published by
 Mr. Schulze of Diiren, in the Jahrb. der Chem. u. Phis, (see
the preceding article in the Phil. Mag. and Annals) may be
added another made by myself in 1827, near the highWostrai,
in the lordship of Schrockenstein, in the Mittelgebirg.
    This high Wostrai forms in itself a small, rather insignifi-
cant cone, but which, owing to its high situation, overlooks
the whole neighbourhood, and affords an excellent prospect
of a great part of the Mittelgebirg on both sides of the Elbe.
Its elevation above the river near Aussig may be about 1800
feet.   This cone    is  covered with wood to       its summit, and is
precipitous on all sides ; only the top shows any rock unco-
vered, and forms a narrow coombe, falling from south to north.
In the steeper parts the basalt is separated into tabular masses
these tables, which are about six or eight inches thick, fall four
or five hours under nearly 24°       W.    On the west, the Wostrai
connects itself with the Skala, or rather forms the highest point
of it, and runs out in the southern and eastern gentle and well
cultivated declivity of the Gemeindeberg ; on the east the foot
of the cone falls in the equally well cultivated plain belonging
to the village of Malschen.
   The basalt is of a dark grayish black, very fne-grained in
the fracture, and contains very numerous but very small cry-
stals of pyroxene. There is no visible trace of magnetic iron-
stone, which is always distinguished by its metallic lustre. Its
polarity is remarkable, being so great that the needle at the
eastern foot of the basalt rock is moved 40°, and at the cone
itself 90°  W.    At the western foot of the rock the contrary
is the case; but this polarity is shown not only in the whole
mass of the rock, but likewise in the larger detached pieces,
and even in the smallest fragments, the north point of the
needle being at one end distinctly attracted, and at the oppo-
site  end as distinctly repelled.
   The same    polarity I discovered     on the Breitenberg, which
rises to the south of the great    Wostrai, about 1 0° to 15° higher,
is entirely covered with high forest trees, and presents only on

the eastern declivity detached low masses of rock, the nearer
circumstances of which, respecting their position, are not
known. Higher masses of rock project at the north-western
declivity.     The basalt forming them is also of a dark grayish
black, somewhat coarser in the grain, but contains instead of
pyroxene a great quantity of olivine, dispersed in very small
grains of olive-green and bright vine-yellow colours.                 It also
disturbs the magnetic needle, but less than that of the high
 Wostrai and its polarity only shows itself when the needle
            ;
is brought very close to the rock, whilst at the former it is
moved at a much greater distance.

 *   numerous compounds that have been discovered within a
 very limited period, and of which many have as yet been but
 partially or imperfectly examined         ; — of the results, often dis-

 theoretic views which are prevalent,          —  it is difficult to avoid
 suspecting the propriety of opinions that have been thought to
rest  on the sure basis of correct observation, or doubting the
 accuracy of analyses conducted by chemists of the highest re-
putation. The aera of brilliant discovery in chemistry appears
to have terminated for the present.             The time is arrived for
reviewing our stock of information, and submitting the prin-
cipal facts and fundamental doctrines of the science to the se-
verest scrutiny.       The activity of chemists should now, I con-
ceive, be especially employed, not so much in searching for
new compounds or new elements, as in examining those al-
ready discovered; in ascertaining with the greatest possible
care the exact ratio in which the elements of compounds are
united in correcting the erroneous statements to which inac-
         ;
curate observation has given rise ; and exposing the fallacy of
opinions which partial experience or false facts have produced.

mistry, lead to the detection of errors that had escaped notice,
and which vitiate many analyses previously regarded without
suspicion. An instance of this kind I shall have occasion to
notice in the present communication.
    The   foregoing reflections have been more immediately eli-
cited  by circumstances connected with Dr. Thomson's "First
Principles of Chemistry." The celebrated author of that work
has attempted to ascertain the equivalents of all elementary
substances; and as the result of his labours, has inferred the
truth of an ingenious conjecture, suggested some years ago by
Dr. Prout, that the weights of the atoms of bodies are simple
multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. (Annals of Phi-
losophy, vol. vi. p. 321.)    This hypothesis is of so much im-
portance if true, and may give rise to so much error if false,
that its accuracy cannot too soon be put to the test of a minute
experimental inquiry.      The only chemists who to my know-
ledge have objected on experimental grounds to Dr. Thom-
son's support of this hypothesis, are Dr. Ure and Berzelius;
but unfortunately both these gentlemen have written on the
subject with such acrimony, and assumed a tone so unusual in
 scientific controversy, as in a great degree to have destroyed
that confidence which their well-founded reputation for saga-
city and skill would otherwise inspire.        The uncertainty in
which this question is still involved, has induced me to inves-
tigate it; and the essay which the Royal Society do me the
honour to hear this evening, may be viewed as the commence-
 ment of a series of essays designed for the elucidation of the
 same subject. As I shall have occasion on individual points
 to differ repeatedly from Dr. Thomson, I embrace this oppor-
 tunity to declare, that in considering his statements with the
 freedom required for eliciting truth, I bear towards him no
 other personal feelings than those of kindness for civility re-
 ceived at his hands, and of respect for a man who has devoted
 his life zealously and successfully to the promotion of science.
     The object of the present essay is to determine the compo-
 sition of chloride of barium.      The frequent employment of
 this compound in chemical experiments renders an exact
 knowledge of its constitution peculiarly important; and it has
 been used so extensively by Dr. Thomson as a medium of ana-
 lysis, that an examination of it will afford an excellent criterion
 of the accuracy of his researches. Dr. Thomson has employed
 chloride of barium in ascertaining the equivalent of sulphuric
 acid, and of not less than thirteen metals and their protoxides
  so that if his examination of this substance is inexact, the error
 will probably affect a large portion of his treatise. Dr. Thom-
  son has been led by his observations to adopt 36 as the equi-
                                                              valent

  valent of chlorine, 70 as that of barium, and 78 as that of baryta.
  The equivalent of chloride of barium is therefore 106; and on
  mixing this quantity of the chloride with 88 parts of sulphate
 of potash, each being previously dissolved in separate portions
 of distilled water, he finds that the clear liquid left after the
 insoluble sulphate of baryta has completely subsided, is not
 rendered turbid either by muriate of baryta or sulphate of soda.
  It is hence inferred, that by double decomposition the whole of
 the baryta has united with all the sulphuric acid, and that all
 the potash and muriatic acid are contained in solution in the
 form of muriate of potash. The resulting sulphate of baryta,
 after being collected and heated to redness, weighed exactly
  118 parts; while the muriate of potash, when collected and
 duly heated, yielded 76 parts of chloride of potassium. It
 follows from this experiment that 40 is the equivalent of sul-
 phuric acid, and 48 of potash; and on mixing with one equi-
 valent of chloride of barium such a quantity of any soluble
 sulphate as should produce a similar interchange of elements,
 the constitution of that salt would be exactly determined.
     This leading experiment, from which Dr. Thomson deduces
 the composition of chloride of barium as well as the atomic
 weight of baryta, is maintained by Berzelius- to be inexact.
 He prepared chloride of barium and sulphate of potash with
 the greatest possible care ; and on mixing them in the pro-
 portion mentioned by Dr. Thomson, he found that a consi-
 derable quantity of the former, about 2*25 per cent, of the
 amount employed, remained free in the residual liquid. (Lehr-
 buch der Chemie, vol. iii. p. 106.) In an answer to this objec-
 tion, published in the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of
 Philosophy for last March, Dr. Thomson has maintained the
accuracy of his original experiment, stating that it had recently
been repeated by six of his practical pupils, and in no case did
the residual liquid contain a trace either of sulphuric acid or
baryta. I regret that my observations have forced me to a con-
clusion precisely opposite.      I have made the experiment in
question repeatedly, with the greatest care, and with perfectly
pure materials, and in every instance the result coincided with
that obtained by Berzelius.       The sulphate of potash which I
used was prepared by repeated crystallization from the crystals
of that salt as sold by the druggists, and was so pure that I
could not detect in it a trace of foreign matter. The chloride
of barium was formed by the action of pure muriatic acid on
native carbonate of baryta.       The resulting solution was ren-
dered alkaline with pure baryta, in order to precipitate any
oxide of iron or manganese which might be present; and the
crystals subsequently obtained by evaporation were reduced to

powder, boiled    in successive portions     of alcohol, and fused.
The fused chloride was redissolved     in distilled water, and again
obtained in crystals.    This salt dissolved without residue or
turbidity in water, and the solution was not affected by pure
ammonia it was not discoloured by sulphuretted hydrogen,
          ;
hydrosulphuret of ammonia, or chloride of lime; when preci-
pitated by an excess of sulphate of potash, the soluble parts
were not rendered turbid by an alkaline carbonate or oxalate
of potash and when thrown down by pure sulphuric acid,
            ;
evaporated, and ignited, the dry mass did not yield a trace of
any soluble sulphate to water. Both compounds were heated
to redness before being employed and the chloride of barium,
                                     ;
which if perfectly anhydrous, attracts moisture freely from the
atmosphere, was always placed while hot in a weighed bottle
secured by a tight cork, and its weight ascertained when cold.
This precaution is not necessary with sulphate of potash.
   I have thought it right to enter into these details, not only
that chemists may judge of the accuracy of my experiments by
the care with which they were conducted, but because the
error committed by Dr. Thomson appears referable to the
neglect of some of these precautions. This opinion seems the
more probable, since Dr. Thomson is uncertain whether in
his original experiments he did not employ the muriate of
baryta of commerce, and if so he doubtless must have operated
with an impure substance. But independently of any inac-
curacy arising from this source, I shall now endeavour to
prove that his method involves an error which precludes an
exact result even with the purest materials. When solutions
of muriate of baryta and sulphate of potash are mixed together,
a small portion of the latter invariably escapes decomposition,
and falls tenaciously adhering to the sulphate of baryta. I was
led to this fact by observing, that when a known quantity
of chloride of barium is precipitated by sulphate of potash, the
resulting sulphate of baryta always weighed more than when
the precipitation was made with pure sulphuric acid.             The
appearance of the salts after exposure to a red heat, was like-
wise different; the impure sulphate being harder, more brittle,
and less opaque than the pure sulphate. The former reduced
to powder and boiled with water, yielded a solution which
precipitated barytic salts freely, and afforded certain evidence
of the presence of potash with muriate of platinum.
   The presence of sulphate of potash was at first naturally
ascribed to imperfect edulcoration but as it was still found,
                                        ;
even after the precipitate had been washed with unusual care,
I was led to examine the subject minutely.         A  solution of sul-
phate of potash was mixed with a large excess of muriate
                                                                    of

 of baryta; the insoluble sulphate was edulcorated until the
 washings ceased to contain a trace of baryta, and was then
 collected on a filter, and ignited. On boiling it in powder
 with water, sulphate of potash was dissolved. The experiment
 was varied by mixing the solutions at a boiling temperature,
 and continuing the ebullition for some minutes; but the result
 was the same as before. On edulcorating the precipitate with
 boiling water, sulphate of potash begins to make its appearance
 in the washings as soon as the excess of muriate of baryta has
 been removed; but neither by this means, nor by boiling the
 recent precipitate for hours in successive portions of distilled
 water, have I succeeded in removing all the sulphate of potash.
 The adhesion of this salt ensues even in a dilute solution ; and
 it is not prevented by the presence of other salts, such as nitre,
 and nitrate or muriate of ammonia, nor by free muriatic acid.
 The quantity of adhering sulphate of potash is variable, de-
 pending apparently as well on the relative quantity of the two
 salts, and the strength of the solution, as on the manner and
 extent of edulcoration. I have known it to increase the weight
 of the sulphate of baryta by one per cent.
    The foregoing observations, unless I am much deceived,
 will fully justify the statement, that Dr. Thomson's method of
 analysing chloride of barium is radically defective.       For if
 chloride of barium and sulphate of potash be mixed in the
 proportion to make a perfect interchange, some of the former
 will remain in the liquid, proportional to the quantity of the
latter which escapes decomposition; whereas the absence both
of sulphuric acid and baryta from the liquid can only occur,
when the quantity of chloride of barium is insufficient for
effecting complete double decomposition with the sulphate of
potash. So that when the proportions appear to be right,
they are certainly wrong ; and they may be right, when they
appear to be wrong. It is obvious, too, that Dr. Thomson's
analysis of sulphate of potash by means of chloride of barium,
is not more satisfactory than his analysis of chloride of barium
by sulphate of potash. The equivalent of potash, deduced
from that analysis, cannot be relied on and his proof of 40
                                            ;
being the exact equivalent of sulphuric acid is also liable
to objection. But the error upon which Dr. Thomson has so
unhappily fallen, has been also committed by other chemists.
Every analysis of sulphate of potash, or of salts containing
this alkali and sulphuric acid, must be regarded with suspicion.
Thus the analysis of common alum by Dr. Thomson and
Berzelius can scarcely be quite exact; and the analysis of
potash-minerals, in which baryta has been separated by sul-
phuric acid, mav also be suspected of slight inaccuracy.

     Dr. Turner on the Composition of Chloride of Barium. 185
    The process by which I have endeavoured to analyse
chloride of barium consists of two parts. In the first, a given
quantity of the chloride was dissolved in water, and the baryta
thrown down as sulphate by sulphuric acid. In the second, a
similar solution was precipitated by nitrate of silver, and the
chlorine inferred from the quantity of fused hornsilver which
was produced. The quantity of chloride of barium employed
in each experiment varied from 30 to 40 or 45 grains.        The
sulphuric acid had of course been purified by distillation, and
left no residue when evaporated on platinum.
   The process by sulphuric acid was varied one while the
                                                  :
solution and precipitate were evaporated to dryness in a plati-
num capsule; and at another, the insoluble sulphate was
collected on a double filter. Both methods were frequently
repeated, and the sulphate of baryta was always dried by ex-
posure to a red heat. The quantity of sulphate of baryta ob-
tained by the first method from 100 parts of the chloride ranged
from 112*17 to 112*2, being more frequently the latter than
the former; and 112*19 may be adopted as a mean of the most
successful experiments. The quantity obtained by filtration
fell rather short of this, varying in the best experiments from
112*08 to 112*12. The difference is referable to a trace of
sulphate of baryta being retained by the acid solution, in which
it may really be detected by evaporation.     The first series of
experiments may therefore be considered the more accurate,
and it may be inferred that 100 parts of pure chloride of
barium are capable of yielding 112*19 parts of sulphate of
baryta. This result agrees very closely with that stated by
Berzelius in the last edition of his System of Chemistry, who
in one experiment got 112*17, and in another 112*18, of sul-
phate from 100 parts of chloride of barium. According to
Dr. Thomson, 100 parts of the chloride yield only 111*32
parts of sulphate of baryta. It is proper to state, in reference
to the foregoing experiments, that traces of chloride of barium
are apt to adhere to the sulphate of baryta but this source
                                                ;
of error is easily avoided by decanting the supernatant fluid
after subsidence, and stirring the precipitate with hot water
acidulated with sulphuric acid.
    In order to determine the chlorine of chloride of barium by
means of silver, it was desirable to ascertain the composition
of hornsilver.     For this purpose some fine silver contain-
ing only traces of gold and copper was dissolved in nitric
acid, precipitated by sea-salt, digested in dilute nitro-muriatic
 acid, and washed.     The dry chloride was then reduced by
 means of carbonate of potash in the usual manner, and after
 throwing a few fragments of nitre upon the fused metal, it
 was granulated and then boiled repeatedly in distilled water,

  In the silver thus prepared I could not detect potash, gold,
  copper, or any other impurity; whereas it is difficult, in employ-
 ing common silver, to purify it completely by one operation.
     1. Of this silver 28*407 grains were dissolved in pure nitric,
 and precipitated by pure muriatic acid, both of which had
  been prepared with the greatest care. The whole mass was
 evaporated to dryness, and yielded 37*737 grains of fused
 chloride of silver.
     2. In a second similar experiment 41*917 grains of silver
 yielded 55*678 grains of hornsilver.
     3. In a third, 40*006 grains of silver yielded 53*143 of
 hornsilver.
     According to the first and third experiments 100 parts of
 silver correspond to 132*84, and according to the second to
  132*83 parts of hornsilver.
     4. In a fourth experiment, 30*922 grains of silver were dis-
 solved in nitric acid, and precipitated by muriate of baryta in
 excess. The precipitate after being carefully washed and col-
 lected on a double filter, yielded 41*07 grains of fused chloride;
 and hence the silver and chloride are in the ratio of 100 to
 132*82.
    5. In a fifth experiment, 42*255 grains of silver were dis-
 solved as usual, precipitated by an excess of muriatic acid,
and collected on a double filter. The fused chloride amounted
 to 56*09 grains, giving the proportion of 100 to 132*74. When
 the silver is thus precipitated by free muriatic acid, and the
 chloride collected on a filter, the result is constantly below that
obtained by the other methods, owing to a trace of the chlo-
ride being dissolved by the strong acid solution.
    It may be inferred, as a mean of the four first experiments,
that 100 parts of silver correspond to 132*83 parts of chloride
of silver. The proportion stated by Berzelius is 100 to 132*75;
and it is estimated at 100 to 132*72 by Dr. Thomson. All
these results, therefore, are closely correspondent.
    From one of the experiments (No. 4.) just mentioned, it is
manifest that the precipitation of chloride of barium by nitrate
of silver does not involve any appreciable source of error. To
be quite certain, however, as to this fact, chloride of barium
was mixed with nitrate of silver in excess, and the precipitate
carefully washed.      It was then boiled in distilled water, and
the fluid examined for silver and baryta; but not a trace
of either could be detected. It dissolved completely in am-
monia, and the addition of sulphuric acid did not cause the
slightest turbidity.
    In five analyses   made by   precipitating chloride of barium
by an excess of      nitrate of silver, I obtained the following
proportions.

   Though all these analyses were made with great care, the
last two were the most successful, as being less influenced by
errors of manipulation than the others. Instead, therefore, of
taking the mean of the five, which is 100 to 137*61, I adopt
the mean of the two last experiments, which is 100 to 137'63.
In one of these the precipitate was washed with distilled water
only, and in the other with water acidulated with nitric acid.
Berzelius in his experiments on this subject found that 100
parts of chloride of barium corresponded to 138 06 in one       -
experiment, and 138*08 in another. This is the only material
difference between us which I have yet had occasion to notice.
It induced me to reconsider every part of my experiments
but as I am unable to detect the slightest inaccuracy in the
two analyses from which my result was derived, I cannot
hesitate to adopt it. I conclude, accordingly, that 100 parts
of chloride of barium correspond to 137*63 parts of chloride
of silver; and as, consistently with the preceding researches,
this quantity of hornsilver contains 34*016 parts of chlorine, it
follows that chloride of barium consists of
                   Barium                            65*984

                                                   100*000
    Its constitution      according to Dr.   Thomson and       Berzelius  is
shown by the following numbers             :
                                    Thomson.             Berzelius.

    It is   impracticable, from the composition of chloride of
 barium as above stated, to make any satisfactory inference
 relative to the real equivalent of barium, because the real
 equivalent of chlorine is not yet clearly ascertained.             By Dr.
 Thomson it is estimated at 36, and by Berzelius at 35*43; and
 on calculating the equivalent of barium according to both
 estimates, the following result will be obtained.
             Barium                   69 832               68-726

will   be 69'832, or very near 70 as stated by Dr. Thomson;
but if the calculation be continued, still taking the results of
my experiments as its basis, the equivalent of sulphuric acid
will turn out to be 40 '901 instead of 40.           From these con-
siderations it appears evident that at least one of the equivalent
numbers concerned in the calculation must be incorrect. I
abstain, however, from offering any further opinion on this
point at present, as it will form the subject of another com-

   To account for the great difference in the two observed de-
pressions of Pickington Ridge, it is to be remarked that in
1828 the excessive haziness, and again, in the following year,
the light mists skirting the dense rain in that direction, ren-
dered the observations very uncertain.
   The signal on Bakestone Edge is a grit tower placed close
to the east side of, and not much above the level of the coal
road formed of the same materials. Viewed from the greatly
superior height of Shunnor Fell, the western side of the roacl,
in favourable circumstances of light and shade excepted, would
certainly be mistaken for the base of the signal.       This source
of uncertainty, added to those just mentioned, may possibly
have led to the important discrepancies which the observa-
tions present.
   In both cases it is singular that the       mean   differences of
level  come out within a foot of the truth.

     As the errors of measurement at Pickington Ridge are
  (with one exception) constantly in defect, it would appear
  that its height had been underrated nearly two feet, or that
  the actual refraction there had been less than the estimated or
  average quantity.          To judge from the subjoined comparison
  of its height, as deduced from the measurements made at the
  place itself, and as calculated from observations at other sta-
  tions, it may be inferred that the latter had been the case.

    The true height of (the ground at) Whitfield Hill is with-
 out doubt the mean of the measurements, at Pickington Ridge
 of 1349-8, and at Settronside of 1352-3,— or 1351 feet. The
 consequent error at Bear's Head, amounting to the unprece-
 dented quantity of 17 feet, appears utterly inexplicable.

 XXXI.     Narrative of an Excursion to the Summit of the Peak
   of Teneriffe on the 23rd and 2^th of February 1829.          By
    Robert Edward Alison, Esq.
                          [Continued from p. 145.]
  A T   half-past five (thermometer 36°) I         awoke my sleepy
"£*• guide,    and in about an hour reached that part of the Peak
directly above Alia Vista Arriba, called Mai Pais. From what
I could observe during my two journeys thither, I consider
the diagonal line from the base to this point to be rather more
than a mile; but a person in ascending has considerably more
than that distance to go, from the serpentine direction he is
obliged to take in mounting.
   Mai Pais consists of large blocks of lava, heaped up together
in great confusion, sometimes forming deep hollows, or high
and dangerous banks. The lava is of various descriptions, but
generally similar to that of the two streams or branches before
mentioned and it appears to have run in a half-fluid state,
             ;
and to have broken into masses by cooling.
   We had made the ascent up to this point by the lights of
the bespangled vault above, and we here seated ourselves upon
a block of lava to wait for the rising of the sun. In a few
minutes a long and bright streak of light orange-colour began
to tinge the eastern part of the fleecy clouds below, which was
afterwards reflected on the mountains above us.         This streak
increased in size and intensity, till Aurora with her rosy
fingers burst open the gates of the East, and the twinkling
lights of heaven immediately hid their diminished heads. The
rapid transition from darkness to light was most striking, from
the almost total absence of twilight. I was rather surprised at
this, as the evening before it was of much longer duration.       I
suppose this was caused by the great refractive power of the
atmosphere, which was afterwards weakened in the morning,
by the vapour that was held in solution condensing, and the
air becoming dryer.
   The ascent over Mai Pais is not so laborious as the track
of pumice which we had previously been traversing; as we were
                               2 C 2                        obliged

196        Mr.  Alison's Narrative of an Excursion to the
obliged to jump from block to block, and to climb over some
with the hands and feet.       We   were again much annoyed by
the snow, which was in thick masses between the currents
and blocks of lava. The whole of it was frozen hard, forming
a surface like glass, which made it extremely difficult to cross,
as we were unprovided with proper shoes.
    After some exertion we reached a spot called La Cueva de
Nieve (the Cave of Snow), which is 11*098 feet above the
level of the sea, and 2*141 feet above the foot of the Peak. I
entered this cave by an aperture near the roof, which is about
twelve feet high and eight or nine wide ; and was let down to
the bottom by means of a rope fastened round my waist.             It
appears to be formed of large blocks of an earthy and cellular
 lava, containing large crystals of felspar, which have run
together in a half-fluid state, and formed a roof of stalactitic
lava, which gradually curves towards the sides.          The length
 in one part, I think, is 120 feet, and about 20 wide.           The
 bottom is filled with water, which is strongly frozen over
near the sides, but in the middle it is only covered with a
 slight skin of ice.   The water in some places is ten or twelve
 feet deep, but in others it is less. At the bottom of it I ob-
 served a plant that looked like a species of Fucus, but I was
 not able to get it up for closer inspection. Under the entrance
 was a wreath of frozen snow and several square blocks of ice,
 and from the roof hung innumerable icicles, and a quantity of
 nitrate of potash and a kind of ammoniacal salt. At the further
 end was an immense bunch of icicles, forming the rough out-
 line of the human figure, which the guides called the Man of
 Ice it has been in the same state for many years, which is a
      :
 proof of the low temperature of that part of the cave which is
 at a distance from the external air.        I am inclined to think
 that the ice in this cave is produced by the water being im-
 pregnated with nitre, and the porous nature of the lava, which
 conjointly may cool the water down to the freezing point.
 Water boiled here at 185°, and the bulb of a thermometer,
 inclosed in silk and wetted with aether, fell 9° in one minute;
 and a surface of aether, 0*25 of a line in depth, evaporated in
 the same space of time.
     In forty-five minutes after leaving the cave we arrived at a
  small plain of pumice called the Rembleta, situated 11*721 feet
  above the sea. This plain appears to have been the ancient
  crater of the Peak, previous to the formation of the present
  cone, which rises in the middle of this plain to the elevation
  of 467 feet.     The ascent up this cone, or Sugar-loaf as it
  is called, is the most difficult and laborious part of the journey.
                                                                 The

       Summit of the Peak of    Teneriffe in February 1829.       197
The surface is a light pumice and ash, with small pieces of
porphyritic lava, covered on the outside with an ochrey crust,
forming at the bottom an angle of 35°, and gradually increasing
in steepness till near the top ; the angle is about 40°, which is
nearly the greatest slope the body can ascend without falling
backward.
     After forty-five minutes of considerable exertion I seated
myself on the highest pinnacle of the Peak, 12*188 feet above
the sea.      Round the summit runs a wall of porphyritic lava,
which forms an ellipsis, having the axis from the N. W. to S.E.
Within is the crater, which I consider to be about 150 feet long,
 1 00 broad, and 50 deep.    I believe it is generally described to be
much larger but having only paced it, I cannot be certain
                 ;
that this is correct. On the east side the wall is broken down,
apparently by an ancient eruption of lava, the remains of
which appear above the pumice on the ascent the south-west
                                                     :
part has likewise given way, but it rises in a high mass towards
 the north. The whole of the lavas were in a rapid state of
 decomposition and the surface is of a chalky-white colour, pro-
                   ;
 duced no doubt by the sulphurous acid gas acting upon the
 alumina of the lava. The sides and bottom of the crater were
 rather hot; and from the W.N.E. to the E.N.E. there was
 a vast number of holes, about an inch in diameter and one or
 two feet deep, some of them emitting steam, and others sul-
 phureous vapours, which show that they must proceed from
 different sources, although the apertures were only a few
 inches apart the heat of them was considerable, as a thermo-
                :
  meter graduated to 133° burst when placed within their in-
  fluence and a stick thrust into one of them had the bark com-
           ;
  pletely charred.    The steam when condensed was perfectly
  tasteless, but the apertures whence the other vapours were
  issuing, were surrounded with the finest needle-shaped crystals
  of sulphur. In many parts of the bottom of the crater there was
  a white sort of paste, consisting of silica and alumina; a ther-
  mometer placed upon      it rose to 107°.
      As  the plain of the Cafiadas, upon which the Peak is si-
  tuated, rises by degrees to the elevation of nearly 9000 feet,
  you are not aware of the great height of this volcano till you
   are on its summit.    The clearness of the atmosphere even in
   the valleys below surpasses that of Italy, and no doubt equals
   the cloudless sky of most of the Pacific isles; but it is greatly
   exceeded on the top of the Peak, where on a clear day the eye
   is able to take in the enormous extent of between five and six
   thousand square leagues of vision. This peculiar clearness of
   the atmosphere is probably caused by the great dryness of the
                                                                    air

  198     Mr.  Alison's Narrative of an Excursion to the
  air over the great African Desert, which is wafted by the east
  wind to TenerifFe, and the rest of the Canary Islands.
     But this extensive, prospect astonished more than it pleased
  me, and I felt unsatisfied from not being able to see some
  boundary to the horizon. When we first attained the top, the
  atmosphere below was rather hazy, which in some degree
  confined the boundary of the horizon; but the islands of Grand
  Canary, Palma, Gomera, and Hierro were distinctly visible,
 and we had a complete bird's-eye view of the island below.
  The fertile plain of Laguna, more than seventeen square miles
 in extent, with the picturesque valleys, which slope up from
 the sea on all sides, had the appearance of a narrow belt
 of verdure round an immense ring of volcanic matter, with
 the mountain upon which I was placed rising nearly in the
 centre.
     You  naturally began to look for the crater whence these
 fiery torrents issued;    — from the position of the Peak it was
 evident that little, if any, of the devastation proceeded from
 that source.    From a careful observation of the Canadas, I
 have no doubt that they were the cause of the surrounding
 desolation, and that they formed an immense crater to an an-
 cient volcano.
    It is possible that volcanic fires had existed in the island in
 its primitive state, and at last the crust that confined them had
 burst in its weakest part, which would most probably be in the
 centre, nearly the present situation of the Canadas. The form
 of them is nearly a half-circle, surrounded from the E. by N.
to the W.S.W. by an uninterrupted circular chain of moun-
tains, rising like a wall in some places to the height of nearly
 1000 feet above the surface.       On the north side is a part of
the same circular chain, but with a wide chasm, which sepa-
rates it from the other this part is called the Risco de la Forta-
                         :
leza and El Cavison.       From the outer part of this chain spring
several high ridges of mountains like buttresses to it, forming
fertile valleys between;   — to make use of a familar illustration,
the Canadas may be likened to a half-wheel, the nave being the
Canadas, and the spokes the ridges of mountains diverging from
it.   From that part of the chain called La Fortaleza and El Ca-
vison, springs a high ridge, the upper part of which is called
Tigayga, which running to the sea forms the western boundary
of the valley of Orotava. From the east side of the unbroken
chain runs another high ridge, called Pedrogil, La Florida,
and La Resbala, which form the eastern limit of the same
valley.    On the south-east is another ridge, which is divided
into several branches, and on the south is part of one which
                                                                no

no doubt belonged to the main body. Towards the W.S.W.
the foot of the Peak is much lower than on the sides next the
Canadas, and the surface is totally different; it likewise has no
circular chain of mountains, nor any remains, that I could
observe, of ridges of mountains springing from them.
    I think the Canadas formerly were circular, and consider-
ably higher than they are now, but that they have sunk from
the immense quantity of matter they have thrown out       ; and it
is very probable that the W.S.W. side was surrounded by a
similar chain to that on the opposite point, but it was possibly
destroyed by some violent convulsion of nature at the same
period that the chasms were formed in the present circular
chain round the Canadas.
    Appearances strongly indicate that the whole island at one
period gradually sloped on all sides from the Canadas to the
sea, and that the beautiful valleys of Orotava and Icod were
formed by a sinking of the strata in the centre of them. What
makes this apparent is, that the mountains called Pedrogil,
La Florida, and La Resbala, which form the eastern boundary
of the valley of Orotava, are nearly on the same level and
inclination as the opposite mountains of Tigayga, and Icod-
el- Alto, which form the western limit     : as the upper part of
the sides next the valley are almost perpendicular, or, what is
practically the same thing, form an angle in some places of 60
 or 70 degrees, and as they are covered with a luxuriant vege-
tation, I was not able to discover whether the strata of both
ridges have the same succession.
    Several minor volcanos are scattered in different parts of
 the Canadas, which from the top of the Peak look like so
 many large hillocks on a sandy plain the craters of two of
                                           ;
 them are very distinct, and the side which discharged the lava
 is evident.    The surface of this immense crater is dotted over
 with masses of lava, which at a certain distance from the Peak
 is of a gfUnsteinic character; some are only a few inches above
 the surface, and others are several yards at first sight they
                                               :
 appeared to be without order, but upon closer inspection I
 found that they were generally disposed in concentric circles.
 It is difficult to account in a satisfactory manner for this ap-
 pearance, unless they were formed after the general sinking of
 the Canadas, when fresh eruptions breaking out in the centre
 formed new craters, which fell in one after another, and were
 ultimately covered over with a thick bed of pumice thrown out
 by the Peak or some of the numerous volcanos on the surface.
     Besides these before-mentioned masses of lava there were
 immense blocks upon the surface of the pumice, some of them
  12 feet high and nearly 40 in circumference     ; some of them
                                                              were

XXXII. On the Dying            Struggle of the Dichotomous System.
    By W. S. MacLeay,          Esq.  M.A. F.L.S. In a Letter to
    N. A. Vigors, Esq. F.R.S.
                         [Concluded from p. 140.]
"PJR.     FLEMING'S        late work on    British  Animals    I repeat
-*-*    that I have never seen   ; but his series of  affinity as  given
in the   " Philosophy of Zoology"      is as follows
                 Vertebrata.
                 Cephalopoda.
                 Mollusca.
                 Tunicata.
                 Annulosa.
                 Cirripeda.
                 Annelida.
                 Entozoa.
                 Radiata.
                 Acrita.
     In the  Hone     Entomologies, however, I have not merely
 said, but   I have proved to demonstration, that by the admis-
 sion of the Mollusca to a higher rank than the Annulosa, the
 latter would be so far separated from the Vertebrata as to oc-
 casion an unnatural interruption of the series.          Dr. Fleming
 now says that the degradation of the Mollusca is decreed by
 me, " although not very logically" in these terms " It follows
                                                          ;
 therefore that though they undoubtedly possess a very com-
 plete system of respiration and circulation, the Mollusca are in-
 ferior in the scale of nature to the Annulosa."          These are in-
 deed my words but the Doctor took good care not to cite
                    ;
 the passage which they follow, because that would have proved
 the deduction to be strictly logical. He appears to fancy, that,
 on account of their system of respiration and circulation, the
 Mollusca are superior to the Annulosa; in other words, that an
 ascidia and an oyster are superior animals to the bee and the
 ant But Annulosa breathe as well or better than any Mollusca,
      !
 and in my present opinion, founded on late dissections, possess
  a circulation, although of a most peculiar kind. But if they had
  no system of circulation whatever, the place assigned by me
  to the bee would not be altered, as Dr. Fleming would have
                                                                  himself

                       of the Dichotomous System.                201
himself seen if he had not mistaken Lamarck's " rapports entre
des parties semblables ou analogues" for relations of analogy.
Lamarck says in the very passage, " Voici l'ordre d'importance
qu'il faut attribuer aux organes particuliers que la nature a
employe dans l'organization interieure des animaux:
                 " 1. Les organes de la digestion.
                 " 2. Ceux de la respiration.
                 " 3. Ceux du mouvement.
                "  4. Ceux de    la generation.
                 " 5. Ceux de    sentiment.
                 " 6. Ceux de    la circulation."
                   Hist. Nat. des Anim. sans Vert., vol.  i. p. 360.
   Now    I say,  admitting that the organs of circulation in An-
nulosa may be, or are, inferior to those of Mollusca, still in the
above five other systems of superior importance the former
animals are infinitely more perfect in their organization than
the latter. So much for Dr. Fleming's judgement of logic;
a judgement which enables him also to decide that by thus
placing the Mollusca below the Annulosa, I have arbitrarily
arranged the animal kingdom into the following five groups:
                             Acrita.
                             Mollusca.
                             Vertebrata.
                            Annulosa.
                            Radiata.
   I  must persist however in asserting that neither the arrange-
ment of these groups, nor the groups themselves, are arbitrary.
Both I may say are almost mathematically proved to be na-
tural, since the five groups are distinguished, as I have shown
(Hor. Entom. p. 200,) by their five respective nervous sy-
stems and because, as to their arrangement, it certainly re-
       ;
quires the possession of remarkable powers of thought to entitle
us to suspect that a bee is an inferior animal in nature's scale
to an oyster.
   The only objections that the critic dares to adduce against
the above arrangement of the animal kingdom are two, viz.
the relation of affinity between cuttle-fish and chelonial reptiles
on the one hand, and between fishes and red-blooded worms
on the other. This is indeed scarcely the place for entering
upon so vast and pleasing a field of anatomical demonstration       ;
my   letter is already too long,   but I trust notwithstanding that
you, my dear friend, will excuse my trespassing still further
on your time by a few remarks on this part of the subject.
   There is a certain rule in nature so evident that I never
knew it doubted, except by Mr. Bicheno, who tells us that no
   N. S. Vol. 8. No. 45. Sept. 1 830.          2D            groups

202        Mr.   W.  S. MacLeay on   the Dying Struggle
groups exist in nature but genera and species ; thus differing
 toto ccelo from Dr. Fleming, who by advocating the binary
 system goes to the other extreme, and states that there
is an infinite number of natural groups superior to genus
and species. The rule alluded to is, that groups of different
degree vary in their distance from each other. It is manifest,
for example, in the animal kingdom, that the distinction be-
tween two congeneric species does not depend on so important
a point of structure as the distinction between two contiguous
genera, nor this again on so important a point as the distinction
between families; and, to proceed in like manner on, the distinc-
tion between two sub-kingdoms like Vertebrata and Mollusca,
must be greater than all, because it depends on some most
important point of structure. A species is not only nearer to
its congener than Vertebrata are to Mollusca; but there exists,
although it may be impossible to calculate its exact value, a
manifest gradation of intervals between the various two con-
tiguous groups of the same rank, which are intermediate be-
tween a species and sub-kingdom. A vertebrated animal, for
instance, is marked out not merely by its vertebrated structure;
the very circumstance of not being vertebral argues other
most important distinctions in the general structure of the
animal.     A gap therefore occurs between Vertebrata and all
the rest of the animal kingdom.      Not only Lamarck but all
other naturalists have admitted it.       How then is there no
continuity here ?     I shall show that there is, and again I say
an hiatus is not a saltus. Continuity in gradation of structure
cannot exist, as we have seen, without intervals; and the size of
these intervals does not lessen the truth of the chain, because
some of the links may not yet be discovered. How then, you
ask, am I to prove that the chain is continuous?        I answer,
Simply by ascertaining which animals of one group come the
nearest to those of the other.    If there be no approximation,
if all the animals remain equally distant, then there is no con-
tinuity; but if one animal of the one group approaches to the
structure of the other, then there is a chain of continuity pos-
sessing indeed only one link, but not the less presenting a
mode    of transition from one form to the other.    Thus if the
only animal existing between Mammalia and Fishes were one
Penguin, it would still be in the path of passage. But if a
Tortoise existed in addition, the chain would be more complete,
and if one Frog existed also, the chain would scarcely escape
notice.     In it there is a regular and obvious gradation of
structure, although the chasms remain vast.         Nevertheless
there is no saltus or leap by nature over one form to another
and Linnaeus knew this, although by placing a whale imme-
                                                          diately

                      of the Dichotomous System.                   203
  diately  between the cow and the hawk, he took himself a leap
  as frolicsome as Dr.     Fleming has since taken in placing the
   Tunicata between the Mollusca and Annulosa, as the link of
  their immediate connection.
     Such being the unequal nature of chasms, and their exist-
  ence being necessary to form that of a continuous chain of
  animals, the question now to ask is not whether the transition
  from Vertebrata to the Invertebrata of Lamarck be impercepti-
  bly gradual (for that, although theoretically supposable, has
  been shown in nature to be impossible), but whether any ani-
  mals of the Mollusca approach more than the others to the
  structure of the Vertebrata, and any of the Vertebrata more
  than the others to that of the Annulosa.       I have already de-
  cided this last question, and proved a number of relations of
 affinity between Mollusca and Vertebrata, and between Verte-
 brata and Annulosa, which cannot, as the Doctor imagines,
  be relations of analogy, for they want the great characteristic
 of these last, namely, their parallelism.     If any relations exist
  between Cephalopoda and Chelonial reptiles, they cannot be
 relations of analogy, and therefore must be relations of affinity.
 Dr. Fleming indeed gives, as usual, a garbled quotation from
 a passage that I have cited at length from M. Cuvier, but I
 will not repeat here what I have sufficiently proved.         So far
 as the mere name goes, the genus Chelys is cephalopod as
 well as Loligo.      I trust that he will endeavour to become
 acquainted with these and other genera of the two groups,
 and that he will compare Messrs. Guthrie's and Holberton's
 late anatomy of tortoises with that of Cephalopoda by M. Cu-
 vier, or, still better, that he will at length take the scalpel in
 hand. The genera just mentioned are not indeed the nearest
 to each other of their respective groups, but enough and more
 than enough is evident to prove their approximation.          If any
 relations exist between them, as there is no parallelism they
 cannot be relations of analogy     ; or even could Dr. F. reduce
 the numerous relations I have pointed out (Horce Entom.
 p. 248—261) to parallelism, and thus show them to be rela-
 tions of analogy, it would only add to our conviction that the
 two groups are contiguous, for such parallelism characterizes
 two contiguous circles. So, let Dr. Fleming dichotomize until
 doomsday, unless indeed he denies the truth of the anatomical
facts I have detailed on this question,  — the goal he will infallibly
 arrive at will be the same, namely that Vertebrata are connected
 with the Mollusca by means of the Cephalopoda and Chelonian
 reptiles.   But " has the attempt to unite the Vertebrata with
 the Annulosa been more successful ? "        No, not more so but
                                                                ;
 quite as successful.

 204?          Mr.   W.  S.  MacLeay on       the Dying Struggle
     Our critic talks a great deal about lampreys and leeches,
 about the former having eyes and the latter none, with many
  more observations of similar novelty and to much the same
  purpose.          He must excuse me, but I really have neither
  time nor inclination to notice them*.                 I only entreat him
 to recollect that the transition from Vertebrata to Annelida
 is not made directly by the eyed lamprey, but by a blind animal
 called Myxine glutinosaf, of which the last naturalist that has
 described it says, " Voisins des Lamproies par les Ammoccetes,
 auxquels ils ressemblent beaucoup, et avec lesquels ils forment
 un passage tres naturel de la classe des Poissons a celle des
  Annelides."        The whole      article, which  is by Bory de       St. Vin-
 cent, in the Dictionnaire Classique d'Histoire Naturelle, de-
 serves to be read, as           it details the grounds of the above affi-
 nity.       Cuvier had already pointed out the same self-evident
 fact   ;   yet here is a writer saying " that he is astonished that
 any individual who ever made the comparison should have
 been able to perceive very evident affinities where there ex-
 isted only a few very remote and insignificant analogies."                     I
 repeat it, and I have proved it, that he does not know an affi-
 nity from an analogy.
     Now the foregoing demonstrated affinities are his chosen
 points of attack, his fancied mortal stabs.                Valeant quantum
 valere possint, and I find myself still safe on my legs.                 To be
 sure the tender-hearted gentleman knows more vulnerable
 points, but he thinks it is useless to be cruel.             " In connecting
 the other circles, defects equally remarkable and extensive
 might be pointed out, were it necessary to enlarge." Equally
 remarkable and equally extensive I trust they would be                      —
 want no       better.
    He       says that the quinarian circle, like the tripod of the
 Isle of     Man, " stabit quocunque jeceris." So far as relates to
 the stability of the system, no doubt the remark is perfectly
 correct; but the Doctor is I suspect here awkwardly alluding
   *  I   suspect, however, that SirEverard   Home will scarcely feel ohliged to
 him  for citing his authority   on a point which has long since been disproved
by the celebrated French anatomists MM. Majendie and Desmoulins. His
admiration of Sir Everard's discovery of the hermaphroditisms of the lam-
prey, induced      him to institute the genus Homea in his honour; although it
ought clearly to be called Gastrobranchns, the original fish described pre-
serving the generic name Myxine given to it by Linnaeus.             In this way
Bloch's very appropriate name would not be lost.         It is truly unfortunate
that the above denial of any affinity between Vertebrata and Annidosa not
only proves our Doctor never to have seen his " Homea," which he only
knows by Sir Everard's description, but that even to this day he remains

to   its facility, on which head I can only say that when this
worthy has produced to the world a natural group differently
divided into five circles, each two connected by parallel ana-
logies, then I will believe him.            To do it once, the once of
nature is abundantly difficult, and the proof is the slowness
with which we are evolving the system.
    Only two objections of Dr. Fleming's remain to be consi-
dered.      The first of these is, that " one set of organs are em-
ployed to establish a connection here, and another to establish
a connection there." And why not? The white man and
the negro are distinguished by their feet              ; while the Asiatic
and African elephants are known from other animals by their
trunk.      I admit therefore the fact, and yet our system when
completed will express the variation of all organs. Will it be
believed that I am perhaps one of the first after Lamarck who
attempted to prevent the selecting such systems of organs at
hazard, and perhaps the very first who prescribed the fol-
lowing rule for their choice ?              " Like every other solitary
character that can possibly be adopted for the groundwork
of a zoological system, the mode of generation ought to rise
in importance only in inverse proportion to its degree of va-
riation.     In a group of animals for instance, where it varies
according to the species, it is manifestly of less importance as
affording natural characters, than among those groups where
it remains less subject to variation."            These words prove that
although we neglect no characters, yet we have a rule for
deciding upon their respective values.
    The other objection is stated as follows " The same means
                                                       :
which the quinarians employ to divide a group when a fifth is
wanting might enable them to subdivide others." Now the
same means will not enable them to subdivide others; for they
have remarked in nature that every natural group returns into
itself, in other words is a circle, and no group presents to their
view more than five such groups of equal degree returning into
themselves.       Again the Doctor destroys himself by an exam-
ple. "What," says he, "but the most obvious prejudices could
induce Mr. MacLeay to divide Insecta into Mandibulata and
Haicstellata, and leave entire the Arachnida??" He affords the
answer himself, but I scorn to take advantage of his ignorance.
He means Arachnida *, and I will now answer his question.
Mandibulata and Haustellata do not present one circle, but
   * Let Dr. Fleming visit the Collections of the Metropolis; there he will see
a variety of forms of Arachnida ; or still better, for Arachnida are not easily
preserved, let him visit the Torrid Zone, the metropolis of Arachnida, and
he will see a continuity of forms as remarkable as in Mandibulata or Haus-
tellata.  It is only a week since I discovered a spider with only two eyes,
and every day produces something new in this class.
                                                                         two,

  206         Mr.  W.   S.  MacLeay on      the  Dying Struggle
  two, therefore they form two natural groups. " Omnis sectio
  natural is," says Fries, "circulum per se clausum exhibet."
  And as the Arachnida, on the other hand, present not two
  circles but one, therefore they      compose one natural group *.
     This is the most common shoal upon which naturalists
  run aground. They forget the necessary and obvious in-
  equality of chasms in different natural groups, and found their
  own artificial groups upon this most fluctuating of all prin-
  ciples, of which moreover they can never detect, by a ma-
  thematical comparison of intervals, the exact value.              Instead
 of this conduct, they ought to look to the only certain prin-
 ciple, the closure of the group by the series having returned
 into itself.    This is the only test of a natural group. From
 the above expression of Dr. Fleming, one would really think
 that I had never divided Arachnida, but this is not meant.
 I certainly have not left it entire, and may possibly have di-
 vided it just as he would; and the Doctor merely means,
 that I have not given the divisions such dignity as he judges,
 from certain chasms, that they deserve. My object, however,
 was to express every natural group, and above all to demon-
 strate the chain of continuity.        All the rest, such as the com-
 parative width of fluctuating chasms, is but leather and pru-
 nella.
     By   the by,   if much more profound           naturalists   would  at-
 tend to the above definition of a natural group, they would
 not so often flounder about in all the difficulties which ne-
 cessarily attend the supposition of two determinate numbers.
 We    should not hear them agreeing with Mr. MacLeay, that in
 most cases five is the natural number, although in some cases
 there may be as many as seven. Were they to put their seven
groups each to the test of returning into itself, they would find
that in fact they compose only five natural ones.               The deter-
mination of the particular number must no doubt depend on
observation    ; but I have already proved in another place, that,
whatever this observed number may be, there is necessarily
only one.      The other parts of the quinary system, such as
the maxim of variation, the distinction of relations of affinity
from those of analogy, and the progression of relations of affi-
nity in circles, are all truths depending upon each other, as I
have shown in the Linnaean Transactions. Grant one, and you
arrive at the other.
   * If Dr. Fleming understood what he writes about, he would have known
that two out of five groups always come nearer to each other than the other
three aberrant groups ; that Aristotle gave the name of Ptilota to the nor-
mal group or centrum in the present case; and that, to use the words of
M. Fries, " Centrum abit semper in duas series," which here are Mandibulata
and HaiisteUata.
                                                                       Dr

                       of the Dichotomous System.                207
   Dr. Fleming gives just and due praise to the great natural-
ists of England, Ray, Willoughby, and Lister, and most pro-
perly exalts them above Linnaeus but it is evident, from the
                                     ;
mode in which he characterizes their works in contradi-
stinction to those of Linnaeus, that he never read them, and
consequently that he is, in celebrating them, only a plagiarist
from some person who has called his attention to their merits.
Let him say who this person is.
   If any one thing be more clearly prescribed in Natural
History than another, it is perhaps a species. Linnaeus has
defined species thus " Species tot sunt quot diversas formas
                        :
ab initio produxit infinitum Ens; quae formae, secundum gene-
rationis inditas leges, produxere plures, at sibi semper similes."
Our establisher of fixed principles, however, scorns this defi-
nition, and favours us with the following new one         :  " When
the similarity between objects is complete, the individuals, how-
ever numerous, are regarded by the naturalist as constituting a
species." This is certainly a shorter definition than the former
and to say nothing of the difference of the sexes, as the simi-
larity between two objects is never complete, it has the advan-
tage of making as many species as there are individual beings.
    His mode of distinguishing the sexes is equally accurate.
"In the more perfect animals we shall find that one individual
of the species will be drawn by an immaterial tie"      —   "to unite
with another individual in the propagation of its kind.        If this
selection has taken place in a state of freedom, we may with
certainty infer that the two individuals are male and female."
 Provided this attraction be the certain mode of discovering
 the sexes, the Doctor may perhaps, on his next spring visit to
the ditch that surrounds his glebe, discover a carp or tench
 to be the female of a frog.      As the fact to which I allude is
 not rare, to be convinced of the affinity, he will, without much
 difficulty, have the evidence of observation.       Insects, I sup-
 pose, he considers as less perfect animals, and so falling out
 of the scope of his definition; else would singular males and
 females be discovered.
    But there is no end to the absurdities of this article, which
 so singularly ornaments the Quarterly Review.          I might run
 on and investigate his "caterpillar's suckers," his "albuminous
 skeletons," and his "bisulcated pigs," &c. &c; but I will not,
 and only pray that the dust I have raised about his ears may
 lie light on these as well as all his other vagaries.

210 Mr.DelaBeche on theGeographicalDistribution of Organic
Of Pterodactyles     our knowledge is limited.       Crocodiles seem
to  have existed during the whole deposit of the oolite, and to
have been widely distributed the same may be said of the
                                   ;
Ichthyosaurus and the Plesiosaurus. Neither Pterodactyles,
 Crocodiles, Ichthyosauri, nor Plesiosauri, have yet been ob-
 served in the South of France.         The Geosaurus has at pre-
sent only been noticed in the lias of Wurtemberg, and the
 Megalosaurus in the Stonesfield slate, near Oxford, and in the
great oolite of Normandy*.           Respecting Tortoises, Turtles,
 and Fish, we do not possess information that can lead to any
 useful conclusions.     Insects are yet known only in the oolite
 at Stonesfield.    Polypifers occur in considerable abundance in
 particular places, and, as it would appear, principally in the
 oolite that has been thence named Coral rag, and in the upper
part of the great oolite, which has thence obtained the name
 of Calcaire a Polypiers in Normandy.           It has been imagined
 that the coral rag is a constant rock in the oolitic series ; which
is supposing that during the deposition of the oolite there was
 a time when the whole bottom of the sea was covered by an
universal coral reef, and that the same polypifers could exist
under various pressures of water; suppositions that are at
 variance with the habits of existing polypifers.        When poly-
pifers   do however occur in any abundance, they have been
 observed in the strata above noticed, in both cases accom-
panied by remains of the genera Clypeus and Cidaris. By re-
ference to the above lists, it will be also observed that several
 shells are common to the coral rag and great oolite.              The
 Crinoidal remains contained in the oolite appear principally
 Pentacrinites and Apiocrinites the former occurring abun-
                                      ;
 dantly and widely distributed in the lias the latter in the great
                                              ;
 oolite, or its accompanying beds, the cornbrash, forest mar-
 ble, or Bradford clay.
    Of the Conchiferous and Molluscous remains entombed in
 the oolite, 540 species have, according to the foregoing list,
 been determined; of these 114 (more than one-fifth) are Am-
 monites, which are not only abundant as species, but as in-
 dividuals, so that some beds are almost wholly composed of

     Whether we        are to conclude that the            same species occur
in the cretaceous         and    oolitic  groups depends on the credit we
may     consider due to the respective authors cited; in fact, to
their ability in determining specific differences              ;
                                                                 — no easy task,
but I do not see why, with our present limited knowledge, we
should determine the question without further examination.
     It has been generally supposed that the rocks of the oolitic
series have been deposited in a sea ; and the great abundance
and proportion of marine organic remains entombed in them
would seem to render this supposition probable.                        We     have
no data by which to form any conception of the extent of such
a sea.      The portion of the world occupied by the oolitic rocks,
noticed in the foregoing remarks, is of insignificant extent, com-
prised within a few degrees of latitude and longitude.                        How
far the oolitic series may hereafter be found to extend, it would
be difficult to say. It is possible that it may merge in some
other great rock deposit, or even be considerably developed at
the expense of the cretaceous rocks above or the red sandstone
rocks beneath.
     It will be remarked that terrestrial plants, lignite, or coal,
occur     more    or less throughout the whole series.              May we       not

 therefore conclude that dry land existed in, or not far distant
 from, the comparatively small space containing the organic re-
 mains enumerated in the foregoing table ? The principal de-
 posits of carbonaceous matter would seem to be Brora and
 Yorkshire.
    Most of the great Saurians now buried in the oolite would
 seem also to have required the protection of land ; for though
 the Ichthyosauri might, like the Porpesse, brave the waves of
 an ocean, the structure of the Plesiosauri would seem to unfit
 them for such exposure; and, judging from the habits of mo-
 dern crocodiles, the ancient species are not likely, from choice,
 to have quitted the neighbourhood of land. The Pterodactyles
 probably flew over the land, and the Didelphys must have lived
 upon    it.
    The quantity of corals      contained in the forest marble, great
 oolite,   or coral rag, would seem to show that the places, where
 these remains are the most abundant, must have had a compa-
 ratively shallow covering of water at the time these Zoophytes
 existed.
    The evidence, therefore, would seem to be in favour of a com-
 paratively shallow sea, interspersed with dry land, for the for-
mation of so much of the rocks usually termed              oolitic, as  occur
within the space treated of in these notes.              The great abun-
dance of Oysters and Gryphites may probably also be in favour
of comparatively shallow water*.
    I have been thus particular in enumerating what may appear
to be evidence of comparatively shallow seas, because the same
deposit may have been, and probably was, going on in conti-
guous and deeper portions of the ocean, and because these con-
tinuous portions of the same formation may differ very consi-
derably both in mineralogical and organic character.                    Thus
the oolitic series of England and of France may be represented
even so near as Italy and Greece, by a series of beds so differ-
ent in organic contents, as at first sight to be considered di-
 stinct.
    Endeavours to trace the small divisions into which the oolitic
series of    England has been separated, are no doubt useful if our
attention be directed to an examination of the areas over which
certain minor causes may have operated but when these small
                                                  :
   * It is remarkable that the three great argillaceous deposits of the oolitic
series  contain an abundance of either Gryphites or Oysters, and that the
Saurian remains are most commonly observed in the same strata. Thus the
Ostrea deltoidea in England, and the Gryphaea virgula in France, have
been termed characteristic of the Kimmeridge clay; the Grypha?a dilatata
is a common shell in the Oxford clay; and the Gryphaea incurva Sow.
(G. arcuata Lam.) is abundant in the lias.
                                                                    divisions

        Mr. Meikle on   the (Economy of the Stea?n-E?igine,     213
divisions are supposed to be general,     and geologists expect to
meet with cornbrash in China, much mischief ensues, and much
valuable time and talent is wasted in endeavours to prove that
the whole surface of the world is minutely the same as any given
quarry, province, or even kingdom.
   It does not seem irrational to infer that such minute divisions,
characterised by peculiar fossils, can only be traced over com-
paratively small areas, unless we are to suppose that the same
animals and vegetables existed over the whole surface of the
                           —
globe at the same time, that these were suddenly destroyed
—  imbedded 10, 20, 100, or 400 feet deep, as the case might be,
—  that then there was a new creation,     —  then a total destruc-
tion, and so on.
   So far as respects the limited area of which we have been
treating, there do appear to have been certain general or nearly
similar causes in operation. Consequently, though many species
of shells &c. are not strictly confined within the small limits
usually assigned them, still in the oolitic series taken as a mass
there would appear to be a general resemblance in organic cha-
racter.
   Belemnites seem to have been equally abundant in the lower
parts of the series everywhere. The Gryphsea incurva is found
under similar circumstances in Scotland, England, and France;
and the same may be said of many other shells. Ichthyosauri
of the same species occur in similar situations in Germany,
England, and the North of France.
   It therefore    would appear   that, during the deposit of the
oolitic series, the geographical distribution of the animals, whose
remains we now find entombed in its various beds, was not
widely different throughout the area treated of in these Notes.
It also would appear, although some animals may have existed
in one place and not in another, and although these remains
may occur in various beds in one locality and be confined to
one bed in another, that the organic character of the mass is
similar in Scotland, England, and France.

 claiming for our countrymen the invention of whatever is va-
 luable in the steam-engine, is no less industrious in bringing
 forward the important discovery that steam is preferable to
 other vapours in an ceconomical point of view.         By turning
 to the Philosophical     Magazine for July 1826, page 41, it will
be seen that   if this idea be still new to Mr. Ainger, who is un-
commonly well versed in every minutia connected with the hi-
story of the steam-engine, it is by no means new to the public
particularly, so far as regards the vapour of alcohol, which
next after steam had been so much oftener proposed than any
other, that the consideration of its case was quite sufficient in
starting the subject the same mode of comparison being so
                        :
obviously applicable to other vapours.
   I am, however, very much at a loss to see the need of such
a complicated calculation as Mr. Ainger has employed.         The
method which I followed is incomparably more simple. It is
evident that if we know what rises can be produced in the
temperature of a certain mass of cold water, by the condensa-
tions of known quantities of different vapours having equal
tensions, we have the main datum for making the comparison,
so far as regards the expense of heat.         The rest is too ob-
vious to require any remark.
   It will be found that some of the numbers on page 41,
line 27, have not been correctly copied from Dr. Ure; as I
had put down 42° and 49 0, 5 in place of 42°*5 and 49°. For-
tunately this oversight has scarcely any influence on the re-
sult.
   MM. Dulong and Petit, in stating their results, place in
one column a series of temperatures and opposite to these, in
                                         ;
another column, the dilatation. This undefined dilatation is
understood by some to signify the expansion for one degree
at the temperature opposite      ; by others, the mean expansion
for one degree of the interval between the temperature oppo-
site and the temperature next before it     ; both of which senses
are generally far from what the authors meant. Whoever takes
the trouble to examine thoroughly the memoir of Dulong and
Petit, will find that they reckon all their intervals from the
freezing point up to the temperature opposite the dilatation
and that such dilatation is the mean for one degree of the
whole interval. The quotations from Dulong and Petit in
most of our English authors are tainted with these mistakes
but as it is some time since I attended to this, I can only men-
tion at present the quotations from Dulong and Petit in those
very useful works, Dr. Ure's Dictionary of Chemistry, and the
Library of Useful Knowledge; many of which will be found
very incorrect, particularly where they state the expansions

  F.R.S.'F.G.S. %c. on Mr. LyelPs "Principles of Geology."
                      To Richard   Taylor, Esq.
       Mr. Editor,
 T  HAVE just received from my bookseller a geological work,
-*-
     which appears to me (while yet 1 am in very many points
compelled to hesitate, if not to differ, as to its conclusions) of
the first merit and importance; I mean the " Principles of Geo-
logy," recently published by one whom I feel happy to be pri-
vileged to call my friend, Mr. LyelL The great interest of this
treatise seems to me to arise from its necessary tendency to
force the current of scientific attention (so far as this subject
is concerned) to certain points of theoretical inquiry, for the
investigation    of which the science has been for some time
growing more and more mature, from the gradual accumula-
tion of facts by observation and description; though, as I still
think, very much still remains to be done in this humbler path
of induction, before a foundation of evidence sufficiently am-
ple to support securely the superstructure of theoretical system
can be considered as fully laid. Insufficient, however, as they
may be to lead to anything like final conclusions, the real na-
ture and value of our present materials can only be fairly ap-
preciated by so classing and arranging them as to show the
 exact bearing of each upon the points of theoretical inquiry.
 This labour has certainly been too much neglected of late
 years, although it is only during this period that observation has
 been sufficiently extended to enable us even to commence the
 task with any prospect of utility.      Now Mr. Ly ell's work is,
 above any others that I have seen, calculated to open this field  ;
 but it is evident that it can be cultivated only by free discus-
 sion.   At first the induction must of necessity be often incom-
 plete, and the application incorrect mutual, open and candid,
                                       :
                                                                yet

yet friendly explanations of the opposing conclusions, to which
the varying views of the phenomena presented to different
minds give rise, can alone advance the progress of truth. It
is in this view that I myself regard the occasionally strong
expressions of Mr. Lyell, concerning the views of the school
of geologists which he opposes ; such for instance, as " They
are not content with disregarding the analogy of the present
course of nature when they speculate on the revolutions of
past times, but they often draw conclusions concerning the
former state of things directly the reverse of those to which a
fair induction from facts would infallibly lead them."    When
I confess myself to have been led generally to adopt the opi-
nions of the school thus condemned, by the estimate which
the constitution of my own mind has forced me to form of all
the phaenomena which my own limited means of observation
have enabled me to investigate, I trust he will view with the
same indulgence my endeavours to retort, as well as I may,
the charge of false analogy and incorrect induction.
   If you, Mr. Editor, are therefore willing to open your pages
to the prosecution of the subject, I shall be happy to avail
myself of them, to endeavour to lay open my views, as to the
precise arrangement and classification of the geological facts
hitherto ascertained, which seem to me best calculated fairly
and fully to generalize them, and to dispose them in such an
order as to form the basis of a sound inductive process, — a task
as yet, I think, very imperfectly performed ; and an attempt
to execute which must, if conducted with the least ability,
point out the extent to which our present materials are defec-
tive, and suggest the inquiries requisite to supply those defi-
ciencies.   It is thus that, in the words of Leonardo da Vinci,
" theory is the general, and experiments" (or in this case
observations) " the soldiers." Theory will always become ne-
cessary at a certain period in the progress of every science
"to generalize and consolidate" (as the writer who quotes
the above axiom in a late able and interesting Life of Galileo
well observes) " past observations, and thence to conjecture
the course of future observation most likely to reward his
assiduity."    It is theory which indicates what experiments or
observations may justly deserve the title of luciferous in the
                                  —
age to which I have alluded, that of Kepler and Galileo.
Astronomy had exactly arrived at the stage of progress to re-
quire and repay this combination of theory and observation;
and the station which geology has now assumed, appears to
me in most of its circumstances very similar. The favourite
maxim of the Geological Society, as cited with apparent ap-
probation by Mr. Lyell, has indeed hitherto been, " That the
                                                             time

             on Mr. Lyell's "Principles of Geology."          217
 time was not yet come for a general system of geology, but
 that all must be content for many years to be exclusively en-
gaged in furnishing materials for future generalizations."
    Mr. Lyell has now, however, himself given a tolerably strong
 indication that in his opinion the present season requires a
bolder line of research and as I am inclined, for the reasons
                         :
just stated, to coincide in that opinion, I do not hesitate to
throw myself by the following slender contribution, on the field
he has so ably opened ; although my inclination, as well as a
just conviction of the limits of my own powers, have hitherto
confined me almost entirely to the humbler and more cautious
path of what I may call Descriptive Geology, as opposed to
 Theoretical Geology.
   For the present I must confine myself to a very few pre-
liminary observations, reserving for a future Number (if you
shall be willing to admit it) the detailed analysis on which
I propose to enter of geological phenomena, so arranged
as to exhibit correctly their bearing on theoretical inquiry      ;
convinced that no real steps can be gained otherwise than
by proceeding in a course of induction thus regularly, minutely,
and patiently commenced.
   While I fairly admit that much new and important light has
been thrown on many particular facts by Mr. Lyell's book,
and that it evinces throughout both a sagacity of observation
and an activity of intellect, which will entitle it to the most
serious attention; yet as I remain after that attention alto-
gether unconvinced of the correctness of his general conclu-
sions, it were merely affecting a false humility to dissemble
that I record those conclusions only to show that my own in-
terpretation of the phenomena would lead to their direct
contradictories. Now whether his interpretation or mine shall
eventually prove to be correct, an open and manly discussion
can alone lead to any satisfactory result.
   The general object of Mr. Lyell's book seems to be, by a
constant employment of the expressions " existing causes"
and " the uniformity of nature" (expressions on which I shall
shortly have a few observations to offer), to maintain —  that all
the geological phsenomena with which we are acquainted
may, and indeed must if we reason philosophically, be ac-
counted for by the agency not only of natural powers still
existing, but also by the agency of those powers, under ex-
actly the same modification of circumstances in every respect
in which they are actually placed, and with exactly the same
degree of general energy which still subsists;    —  that we are
 authorized to predict the future occurrence of such cata-
 strophes as the deluge of one large continent, and the elevation

to consider the ages which have elapsed since the occupation
of the planet by man has given rise to historical record as a
period of comparative repose;        —  that the earthquakes which now
ravage Calabria and America are as violent as any which for-
merly disrupted our strata (tearing them thousands of feet
asunder, evidently at a single stroke*), and which raised our
continents and their mountains, and want only a little more
time to reproduce the same effects           ;
                                               — that it is altogether un-
philosophical to suppose that any causes can have tended
to exhaust or diminish the power of these disturbing forces;
there being, perhaps, some canon in Mr. Ly ell's logic or physics,
with which mine is unprovided, to the effect, that a force which
has ever acted with a given power must always continue to
act with the same power.
    I hope it will not be considered as an invidious remark, but
merely as expressing the general impression which the book
has left on my mind, that it is an expanded commentary on
the celebrated Huttonian axiom, that " in the oeconomy of the
world no traces of a beginning or prospect of an end can be
discerned."        Now I would not doubt for a moment on the
unfounded (as I am most willing to own) moral objections
which have been urged against this axiom ; but considered
purely as it ought to be philosophically, I have ever regarded
it, and I continue to regard it, as one of the most gratuitous
and unsupported assertions ever hazarded.
    At present I will only further trespass on your space to
add a few words on the phrases " existing causes" and "the
uniformity of nature," so often employed. Mr. Lyell has many
acute and useful observations on the prejudices which have
impeded just reasoning on the subject. Wishing him every
success in his chivalrous encounter with these idola spems,
I only regret that he seems to spare with some partiality one
of the tribe; I mean, mistaking words for things, and philo-
sophical expressions for philosophical arguments. I will ven-
ture on an illustration, which may exhibit how far these
phrases are really available in the argument            :
                                                          — Infants grow at
the rate of some inches a-year; but there is a popular persua-
sion, evidently erroneous,         according to the canons of Mr.

Bushmen     existed even long before Europeans visited South Africa,
and that they had possibly been coeval with the Hottentots them-
selves.    He mentions that communities or families, of a character
similar to what we understand by the term " Bushmen," inhabit all
the barren wastes of Great Namaqualand, and conduct themselves
towards' the Hottentots and Damaras in their vicinity, exactly as those
immediately in advance of our frontier do towards the colonists.
It was then stated, that the majority of them are decidedly of the
genuine Hottentot race and, after some details in regard to their
                             ;
mental character, external physiology, and modes of living, hunt-
ing, conducting their depredations, &c. the paper concluded with
" an earnest recommendation to such members as may have been
in   the habit of observing our savage tribes, to embody their re-
marks    for occasions like the pi*esent," as tending to personal and
general benefit.
    Sept. 30.— Read, "Sketches ofthe'Botany of South Africa," No. 2.
                  —
By Mr. Bowie. The author stated, that the number of plants indi-
genous to South Africa was unknown, but, to his practical know-
ledge, the Cape colony contained more species of phaenogamous
plants than have been allotted to the whole of Africa by the most
complete though conjectural calculations on record.            He con-
tinued by observing, that however careful the botanist might be in
his researches, he would find, by visiting the same grounds in the
corresponding seasons of different years, many plants which had
hitherto escaped his notice altogether; and, in conclusion, furnished
a list of 244 plants belonging to 99 genera, which might be expected
to flower in the Cape District during the months of October and
November.

            —
  Mr. Gill. The hordes ofPato, Zambi, Henza, and Vosanie, came

 a detailed account of the character of the country over which he
  travelled.    The latter he illustrated by a plan, showing the direc-

           ALTERATION OF COLOUR IN WOOD BY OXYGEN.
         MARCET has observed that the wood of certain trees, and espe-
       •  cially the elm, becomes of a more or less intense red colour when
exposed    to the air.  He  has found, by a great number of experiments,
that the alteration does not occur, if at the moment in which the
branch is transversely cut it be placed in a perfect vacuum, or in a
gas which contains no oxygen ; and, on the contrary, that the colour
is more intense in oxygen gas than in atmospheric air.          If the wood
after being cut is immersed in water, it always becomes red, even
when it is immediately afterwards introduced into a vacuum, or into
a gas which contains no oxygen. Elm-wood which had acquired a
yellow colour, yielded it gradually to water ; and this water being
evaporated to dryness, the residuum, when examined, exhibited all the
characters of pure tannin.        As the result of his experiments, M.
Marcet attributes the colouring of elm-wood to a kind of oxygenation
which the tannin suffers at the moment of exposure to atmospheric
air.
   It is to be remarked, that in the experiments here described., the
branches of the elm were always cut transversely ; for if the bark be
simply detached, the alteration of colour is much less distinct.        Bib.

                          DURABILITY OF STONES.
   When     the felspar of the granite rocks contains little alkali, or cal-
careous earth, it is a very permanent stone ; but when in granite, por-
phyry, or syenite, either the felspar contains much alkaline matter, or
the mica, schorl, or hornblende, much protoxide of iron ; the action of
water, containing oxygen and carbonic acid, on the ferruginous ele-
ments tends to produce the disintegration of the stone. The red granite,
black syenite, and red porphyry of Egypt, which are seen at Rome in
obelisks, columns, and sarcophagi, are amongst the most durable com-
pound stones 3 but the gray granites of Corsica and Elba are extremely
liable to undergo alteration      :  the felspar contains much alkaline
matter, and the mica and schorl much protoxide of iron. A remark-
able instance of the decay of granite maybe seen in the hanging
tower of Pisa whilst the marble pillars in the basement remain
                  :
                                                                    scarcely

scarcely altered, the granite ones have lost a considerable portion of
their surface, which falls off continually in scales, and exhibits every-
where stains from the formation of peroxide of iron. The kaolin or
clay used in most countries for the manufacture of fine porcelain or
china is generally produced from the felspar of decomposing granite,
in which case the cause of decay is the dissolution and separation of
the alkaline ingredients.    Water is capable of dissolving in larger or
smaller proportions most compound bodies ; and the calcareous and
alkaline    elements of stones are particularly liable to    this kind of
operation.
   When water holds in solution carbonic acid, which is always the
case when it is precipitated from the atmosphere, its power of dis-
solving carbonate of lime is very much increased ; and in the neigh-
bourhood of great cities, where the atmosphere contains a large pro-
portion of this principle, the solvent powers upon the marble exposed
to it must be greatest. Whoever examines the marble statues in the
British Museum, which have been removed from the exterior of the
Parthenon, will be convinced that they have suffered from this agency ;
and an effect so distinct in the pure atmosphere and temperate climate
of Athens, must be on a higher scale in the vicinity of other great
European cities, where the consumption of fuel produces carbonic
acid in large quantities.    Jameson's Journal, April 830.

           PREPARATION OF BROMINE AND           ITS  HYDRATE.
   The mother-liquors containing bromine      are to be evaporated to a
fourth of their volume in iron pans, and then left for several days ; in
which time the larger part of the chloride of calcium crystallizes. The
supernatant liquor, being diluted with water, is to be mixed with
sulphuric acid as long as a precipitate is formed.     The liquid portion
being separated, and the solid residue pressed, all the fluid is to be
mingled and evaporated to dryness, and then redissolved, that a cer-
tain quantity of sulphate of lime may be removed.         On acting upon
the solution by sulphuric acid and peroxide of manganese, and then
distilling,  bromine is obtained.

perature of from 39° to 43° Fahrenheit, by making the vapour of
bromine pass into a tube moistened with water j in about a quarter

   M.  Balard's process for the detection of iodine, which consists in
mixing the fluid to be examined with starch, sulphuric acid, and
chlorine, is the most delicate that is known.
   M. Casaseca has remarked, that when the quantity of hydriodate is
very small, the blue indicating ring cannot be seen at the part where
the solution of chlorine is in contact with the water containing the
starch and acid ; then the whole should be strongly agitated and left
for a while, when the starch acquires a distinct violet colour.      One
part of hydriodate of potash was dissolved in two parts of distilled

 FRESH DISCOVERY OF THE CHROMATE OF IRON IN SHETLAND.

 active search after it, as the following extract of a letter, dated the
 27th of January 1830, sufficiently shows. It is addressed to Dr. Hib

             ON ULMIN (ULMIC ACID) AND AZULMIC ACID.
    M.    Polydore Boullay has published a memoir, in the Journal de
 Pharmacie for April last, on the above subject, the results contained
 in which have led to the following conclusions         :
    1   Ulmin, discovered in the products of the exudation from the elm,
 and since met with in turf and various other bodies, and artificially
 produced by M. Bracconot, also from the colouring matter of un-
 bleached flax, occurs also in soot and vegetable matters incompletely
 distilled.   It is also one of the usual products of the action of sul-
 phuric and muriatic acids upon vegetable matters such as wood, starch,
 sugar, and alcohol.
    2.  Ulmin, when    all its  properties are considered, and especially   its
 power of saturating bases, ought       to be called ulmic acid. It appears to
 differ from the product which results from the action of air or oxy-
 genated bodies upon extracts, tannin, gallic acid, and the gallates, on
 account of its colour and solubility in alcohol.
    3. The composition of ulmic acid, which is equivalent to

 is  the  same  as that of gallic acid, given by Berzelius,     viz.

 but the saturating power of the ulmic acid is much weaker, the
analysis of its salts showing it to be less in the proportion of 1 to 5.
 The small saturating power of this acid, which appears to be an ex-
 cellent manure, shows how it may be plentifully conveyed to plants,
by means of a very small quantity of alkaline base.
    4. Notwithstanding the analogy which exists between the com-
position of these acids, the gallic cannot be converted into the ulmic
by means of sulphuric acid. The product of their mutual action
appears, on the contrary, analogous to that which results from the
action of oxygenated bodies upon gallic acid and extracts.
    5. The carbonaceous product which results from the spontaneous
decomposition of hydrocyanic acid, does not appear to be a carburet
of azote, as M. Gay-Lussac had supposed, but an hydrogenated
compound, capable of combining with salifiable bases analogous to
hydrocyanic acid itself.
    6. The same compound appears to be reproduced, when animal
matters are submitted to reactions analogous to those which convert
vegetable matters into ulmic acid ; such is the action of potash upon
gelatin.    We  may, therefore, according to this analogy, which occurs
also in the physical and chemical properties of these two bodies,
designate it by the name of azulmic acid, which expresses the dif-
ference of their chemical nature.
    7. Azulmic acid results net only from the spontaneous decompo-
sition of hydrocyanic acid, but from that of hydrocyanate of ammoniaj
cyanogen dissolved in water, from the reaction of this gas or bases ;
and in a word, it occurs with all the compounds of cyanogen.
    8. Pure hydrocyanic acid, by its spontaneous decomposition,
appears to be converted into hydrocyanate of ammonia, and azulmic
acid;   —  a simple result, which according to M. Boullay is easily ex-
pressed by the following formula        :
         6 (HC 2 AZ)    =HC    2
                                 AZ + Hs AZ     . .  .  + HsOAZ*.
The     result of calculation agrees perfectly with the analysis of azul-
mic    acid, which is stated to be one volume of hydrogen, five volumes
of carbon and two of azote, in dividing by 2 the formula which
represents it, or by weight of
                     AZ 2 Azote                     47'64
                       C* Carbon                     5067
                       H   Hydrogen                     1-69
                                                   100-00
    9.   The  action of weak nitric acid upon cast-iron, that is, upon
the very divided carbon which it contains, gives rise to an azotized
matter which possesses the principal properties of azulmic acid.
    10. Azulmic acid appears to combine with concentrated nitric
acid, which dissolves it; and there is reason to believe that artificial

tannins are merely compounds of this body with         nitric acid, or at
least that they contain a very analogous product.
              NEW PROCESS FOR OBTAINING             LITHIA.
   M.   Quesneville jun. gives the following as his method of separat-
ing lithia. " I take one part of triphane, levigated, and mix it accu-
rately with two parts of powdered litharge : I put the mixture into
a crucible, and expose it to a white heat. In about a quarter of an
hour the mass is perfectly fluid ; I then cool it and powder it finely
I afterwards act upon it by nitric acid, the silica separates in a very
divided state ; I precipitate all[the nitrate of lead by sulphuric acid,
and evaporate to dryness to expel all the nitric acid. I afterwards
treat it with water and precipitate the alumina and other metallic
oxides by ammonia, and then add carbonate of ammonia to preci-
pitate the lime and magnesia ; the solution is then filtered and eva-
porated to dryness. The mixture is to be strongly calcined to expel
all the ammoniacal salts ; this operation must not be performed in a
platina crucible, as it would be acted upon ; I use a porcelain one.
The calcined residue is to be treated with water, and all the sulphuric
acid precipitated by barytes ; the filtered liquor when evaporated
 gives pure lithia."   Journal de Pharmacie, April, 1830.
                ANALYSIS OF A BILIARY CALCULUS.
   M. Henry was      supplied with this calculus by Dr. Bally of the
Hotel-Dieu    at Paris  ; it was taken from a patient who died there ; it
consisted of

It  was enveloped in a glairy, yellowish viscid substance, which con-
sisted of albumen, with traces of cholestrine, and probably also of
mucus, salts, and green fatty matter of the bile. Ibid.
                    ON POWDERING PHOSPHORUS.
   M.   Casaseca remarks, that the method of pulverizing phosphorus,
 mentioned by all chemical authors, is that of agitation for some time
in water, in a well-corked bottle : but, he observes, the powder
 obtained by this method is very imperfect whereas if alcohol at 36°
                                              ;
 be used instead of water, a powder of the utmost fineness is produced,
 which has a crystalline appearance, and on agitating the liquid in
 the sun, the bottle appears to be entirely filled with a light brilliant
 powder. Ibid.
                              FORMIC ACID.
    This acid is obtained in a state of great purity by distilling alcohol
                                                                     with

 with sulphuric acid and peroxide of manganese ; but in order to
 prevent the formation of sulphuric aether, it is proper to employ
 weak alcohol or common brandy ; for if the alcohol is concentrated,
there is formed not only sulphuric aether, but also formic aether,
which not only diminishes the quantity of formic acid, but occasions
it to give a difficultly crystallizeable and coloured salt, with lead.
Acetic acid treated in the same manner does not yield formic acid ;
 the fibrin of blood yielded some, but it was very impure.       Ann. de
 Chimie, Feb. 1850.
              BI-IODATE AND TRI-IODATE OF POTASH.
   M.   Serullas finds that there are two acid iodates of potash, —  a bi-
iodate of potash formed of 2 atoms acid and 1 atom base, and a tri-
iodate, consisting of 3 atoms acid and 1 atom base.          The first is
produced by the incomplete saturation of chloride of iodine by pot-
ash, in the form of a double crystalline compound, which being
separated, dissolved, and crystallized, gives the bi-iodate.
   The other results from the action of one of the following acids :
sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, muriatic and silicated fluoric upon the
neutral iodate of potash ; sulphuric acid is to be preferred ; or it may
be prepared by supersaturating potash with iodic acid.
   During the incomplete saturation of chloride of iodine by potash,
and consequently under the influence of excess of muriatic acid,
there is formed a double compound, well crystallized and in definite
proportions, of chloride of potassium and acid iodate of potash. No
acid iodate or chloriodate of soda appears to exist in order to ob-
                                                       ;
tain iodic acid, soda may be precipitated from the iodate by means
of silicated fluoric acid, the excess of which is volatilized during the
operation. This process M. Serullas prefers to Davy's by means of
oxide of chlorine and iodine. Ibid.
POWER OF METALLIC RODS OR WIRES TO DECOMPOSE WATER
   AFTER THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE GALVANIC PILE IS
   BROKEN,
   In the experiments which    I undertook  in 1806-7,   in company with
Mr. Hisinger, we had found that rods of metal which were employed
to decompose water by means of the galvanic pile continued to deve-
lope gas after their connection with the pile had ceased,    — a circum-
stance which seemed to indicate a continuance of electrical state,
though these rods showed no action upon any other portion of liquid,
even of the same kind, than that in which they had been placed du-
ring their contact with the pile. This observation, which I had al-
most forgotten, has been lately confirmed by Pfaff, who has also
added to it several others of a similar kind.   We  might suppose such
effects to be produced by a residual polarity, both in the liquid and
the metal, showing itself, as long as it continued, by a continuance
of chemical action ; but some of Pfaff's experiments seem to oppose
this idea, for he found that the addition of ammonia to the liquid, by
which all its internal polarity was destroyed, did not deprive the
                                                                    wires

  wires of their effect.   The metals which acquire this property in the
  highest degree are zinc and iron, next to which is gold.      He attempts
  to explain the phenomenon by supposing that the continued passage
  of the electrical stream had brought the elements of the water nearer
  to a state of separation, so that a very slight influence was sufficient
  to destroy their union.      It must be confessed, however, that we
                                                               —
 cannot at present advance a satisfactory explanation. Berzelius,

   DETECTION OF ALLOY IN SILVER BY THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE.
    Oersted has made an ingenious and novel application of the mag-
 netic multiplier.    He finds that if a good electro-magnetic multiplier
 with double needles be suspended by a hair or a thread of unspun
 silk between two pieces of wrought silver, differing only one per cent,
 in the quantity of copper they contain, so sensible an effect is pro-
 duced upon the needle as to render this a more accurate method of
 proof than the common touch-stones.         Small trial-plates are made of
 different degrees of purity, and the piece to be tried is compared with
 them in the following way A thin piece of woollen cloth is dipped
                               :
 in muriatic acid, and laid upon the trial-plate, after which the piece
 to be tried is brought into contact with the acid and the wire of the
 multiplier. The deviation of the needle shows which contains the
 most alloy, and another trial-plate must be employed till the needle
ceases to be affected, when both are of equal fineness.          In coming
 to a conclusion on this point, however, several circumstances are to
be taken into consideration. Wrought silver goods are generally
deprived of a portion of their copper by the action of acids, so as to
render the surface finer than the inner part of the metal ; the proof-
plates, therefore, must be prepared in the same way.        Another source
of error in the indications of the needle are the unequal polish and
size of the two pieces of metal ; the latter of these is especially dif-
ficult to overcome when the surface of the metal to be proved is not
plain.    When, instead of muriatic acid, a dilute solution of caustic
potash is employed, and the result is unlike, it is shown that copper
is not the only alloy, but that brass is present; and the potash solu-
tion renders that which contains brass so positive, that it seems con-
siderably purer than the trial-plate.      This is the case also in a very
high degree when the alloyed metal contains arsenic, for example
when what is called white metal has been used for an alloy. This
mode of proof is exceedingly interesting in a scientific point of view,
and cases may occur in which it can be employed with advantage j
but the sources of error can scarcely be ever so completely done away
with as to make it a practical instrument in the hands of the silver-
smith, as Oersted seems to expect.      —  Berzelius, Arsberdttelse, 1829,

    "  The   recent honour conferred on Sir James South originated
with His late Majesty. It is well known amongst Sir James's imme-
diate acquaintance, that he contemplated a removal to France,
where he intended to transport his splendid collection of instru-

         Dear   Sir, — The demise of His    late Majesty,    and the extraor-

me to defer a communication which I should otherwise have made
to   you at an earlier period.
    " • Shortly before the death of the late King, His Majesty signified

anxious that the country should bear some portion of the enormous
expense which Sir James had incurred in pursuing his researches,
not (as he says) with a view of depriving Sir James of the honour
and reputation which such services insured, but < to relieve the
country from the charge of perfect indifference to subjects of a
scientific nature.'
             TRIBUTE OF RESPECT TO BARON CUVIER.
   The lovers of Natural History in London, anxious to do honour
to a man pre-eminently distinguished in the ranks of science, gladly
availed themselves of the opportunity which the visit of the Baron
Cuvier to our country has afforded, by obtaining the pleasure of
his company at an entertainment given at the Albion Tavern, on
the 10th of August, in honour of his arrival among us. At a season
of the year when so great a portion of our men of science are not
resident in the metropolis, it was highly gratifying to such as were
within reach to be called together on this interesting occasion.
Dr. Fitton, the late President of the Geological Society, was re-
quested by the company to fill the chair; and on his right was
placed their illustrious guest. There were present, Mr. Broderip,
Dr. Roget, Mr. Greenough, Rev. Dr. Goodall, General Hard-
wicke, Dr. Maton, M. DeCandolle, Mr. Robert Brown, Dr. Paris,
Mr. Children, Mr. Charles Bell, Mr. H. Mayo, Mr. Joshua Brookes,
Mr. Lowe, Mr. J. Smith, Rev. Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Horsfield, Mr. J.
Bennett, Dr. Wallich, Mr. Clift, Mr. Forshall, Mr. J. F. South,
Mr. T. E. Gray, Mr. Houston, Mr. Wood, Mr. Yarrell, Mr. E. T.
Bennett, Mr. Thos. Bell, Mr. R. Taylor.
   The day was passed most harmoniously. All were happy to ren-
der a tribute of homage to this distinguished man, who took occa-
sion to express himself very handsomely as to the part which our
country had taken in the promotion of Natural History. The com-
pany quitted the dinner-table early for the drawing-room, where
the evening was passed most agreeably in general and scientific
conversation.

           THE MINERAL SPRINGS OF CALDAS DA RAYNHA.
       To   the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     Gentlemen,
    The town of Caldas in the kingdom of Portugal is situated four-
teen leagues to the north of Lisbon, and about two leagues distant
from the sea. It appears that several mineral springs abound in
the vicinity, but the most celebrated of these are called Caldas da
Raynha, a few feet elevated above the level of the Atlantic Ocean.
Judging from the specimens in my possession, the geological struc-
ture of the rocky range of this district combines primitive with
transition limestone.       The former possesses a highly crystalline
structure, and emits on collision of fragments a foetid odour like
brimstone,     — a characteristic of some great marbles, as for instance
the Pentelican.       The latter is lucullite, belonging to the secon-
 dary series.
    These mineral waters appear to be thermal, and evolve a con-
stant vapour visible at some distance, and have from time imme-
morial been resorted to in inveterate rheumatism, and syphilitic
and scrofulous cases, and even used internally as a tonic, with re-
puted success.
    This mineral water is sent in considerable quantity to the Brazils,
&c. in opake bottles corked and sealed.
    I am indebted to the kindness of the Chevalier de Mascarenhas,
 Consul-general for Portugal, &c, for a specimen of the Caldas da
 Raynha spring, which though in quantity insufficient to determine
 its chemical proportionals, was yet enough to indicate the consti-
 tuents  ;   a succinct summary of which, from their interesting cha-
racter, I have presumed might not be altogether foreign to your
 pages, nor unacceptable to many of your readers.

                     "S      and Miscellaneous    Articles.
    This specimen had been carefully preserved by the Chevalier
 nearly two years, being hermetically sealed at the spring, in a
 dark glass bottle, scarcely sensible to the transmission of the rays
 of light. Its foetid odour gave sufficient proof of the presence of
sulphuretted hydrogen       — the chief gaseous principle; there was no
 sediment deposited, and the water was clear and crystalline. Saline
 solutions of tin, lead and mercury, corroborated this evidence by
 their several dark-brown shades, while it was insensible to litmus,
 Brazil, and turmeric papers ; hence the absence of free acids and
 alkalies was inferred as well as that of the predominance of either
 the acid constituent or the alkaline base of any salt.       The several
 tests for iron were inefficient in detecting the presence of that
 metal, but lime was indicated by oxalate of ammonia; magnesia by
 phosphate of soda a muriate by nitrate of silver, and a sulphate
                        ;
 by nitrate of baryta.
     A portion of the water, evaporated to one-fourth the former vo-
 lume, was divided into equal parts a few drops of sulphuric acid
                                         :
 having been added to one of these, supplied instant and complete
 evidence of the presence of iodine, silver-leaf being tarnished,and
 starch assuming a deep violet tint; while a stream of chlorine passed
 through the other, imparted a reddish-yellow hue to it, and this
 being subsequentlyagitated with sulphuric aether separated bromine,
 which imparted to the supernatant stratum of sether its peculiar
 hyacinthine colour.
    The constituents of this interesting mineral water, which may per-
 haps challenge competition with the most celebrated springs on the
 continent of Europe as to its healing virtues, appear to be sulphu-
 retted hydrogen, sulphates of lime, &c, muriates of soda and mag-
 nesia, with hydriodate and bromide of potassa, the presence of the
 latter alkali being determined by the reagency of nitromuriate of
 platinum. The first or gaseous constituent and penultimate of
 these are its most valuable ingredients and the iodine appears to
                                              ;
 be so abundant, as to promise curative success in bronchocele and
 other morbid glandular affections, even when applied externally as
 a lotion.     I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, yours, &c.
    Feb. 16, 1830.                                         J.  Murray.
    P.S. I may   observe, that I have found the test of nitrate of silver,,
as proposed by Dr. John Davy, very sensible as a reagent in the
detection of animal matter in water.
           OCCULTATION OF ALDEBARAN BY THE MOON.
    On  July 15th, at 23' 44 m apparent time, Aldebaran was observed
                          1
here to disappear behind the Moon's enlightened limb, about two
degrees to the left of her vertical point, and reappeared on the 16th
at 31 m 20 s apparent time, a little below the centre of her western
limb.    Aldebaran as usual advanced upon the Moon's enlightened
limb at least four seconds of time, where it was distinctly seen before
it disappeared.    The refraction of the atmosphere alone, it is supposed,
is not sufficient to account for this phsenomenon.        An interesting
                                                               explanation

                  Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.        235
explanation of    it by M. du Sejour may be seen  in Vinee's  Astronomy,
vol. i. p.  388.
   What renders this occultation of Aldebaran peculiar, is its having
occurred at noon ; yet with the best power of an achromatic telescope
the immersion and emersion were distinctly observed.
   The apparent time at Greenwich of the disappearance and reap-
pearance of Aldebaran, as given in White's Ephemeris and Moore's
Almanack, is nearly two minutes too fast ; so that the time deduced
from what are considered accurate astronomical computations, does
not in this instance, and indeed it seldom does, agree with the time of
observation.
                          THE PLANET MERCURY.
   The   planet Mercury was seen here (Gosport) with the naked eye
soon after sunset in the evenings of the 12th, 15th, 16th, 18th, 23rd,
24th, and 26th instant, and on each evening his scintillation was at-
tended with pretty strong rajs of light, particularly on the 18th, when
the twinkling was not much inferior to that of /3 Tauri, which star
was about four degrees distant from him, and of the same apparent
magnitude. From the twinkling appearance of this planet, it is diffi-
cult to trace him out accurately among the fixed stars of the same
apparent size, when at or near his greatest western or eastern elon-
gation, without the aid of a telescope and then he shines like the
                                           ;
other planets, with a steady light, and with a whitish and nearly
dichotomized disc.                                               W. B.

                 Meteorological Observations for July 1830.                                   239
    General Observations.         —  To the 12th the weather continued showery,
windy, and cold, for the height of summer, so much so as to cause serious
apprehensions for the fate of the corn crops; but from that time to the end
of the month it was fine and dry, and on several days hot and sultry. This
providential change in the state of the atmosphere has in a short time
wrought wonders, it having stopped the growth of the straw, and matured
the wheat so as to make it fit for the sickle ; indeed the harvest com-
menced here on the 30th of July, and was in active operation the first week
in August.
    The trite assertion that it will be "all straw and no corn," is an egregious
              —
falsehood; a great quantity of straw there certainly is, but the wheat,
barley, and oats, in this and the adjoining counties will turn out full average
crops ; and in most grass-land places good second crops of hay are about
to be taken in.       The only fear of a successful harvest is about the con-
tinuance of favourable weather, which it is sincerely hoped may hold up
till all the crops are secured.           The weather, however, in changeable seasons
like the present one, should be studied, meteorological instruments often
referred to, and every favourable opportunity be eagerly seized by those
whose prosperity depends on it.
    The last eight days and nights were warm ; and on the 29th Fahrenheit's
thermometer in the shade rose to 84°, and to fever heat in the sun's rays,
—   the hottest day since the 27th of June 1826. After the heat of the day,
much sheet-lightning emanated from the clouds from sunset till one o'clock
A.M. ; and also on the following evening.
    The mean temperature of the external air this month is three-quarters
of a degree under the mean of July for many years past.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one solar halo, eight meteors, two rainbows,
and eleven gales of wind, namely, one from the North-east, two from the
South-east, one from the South, three from the South-west, three from
 the West, and one from the North-west.

XXXVIII.        Further      Observations on the Obliquity of the
   Ecliptic.   By William Galbraith,            Esq. M.A.
   To  the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
      Gentlemen,
T N my    paper published in the Phil. Mag. for July last, I en-
*•  deavoured to show that the difference of the values of the
obliquity of the ecliptic, derived from observations made at the
summer and winter solstices, arose almost entirely from a small
error in the latitude and in the tables of refraction employed
in reducing the observations.         The conclusion accorded well
with the observations made at Greenwich, and published in
Dr. Pearson's "Astronomy" till about the year 1820. Since
that time, however, the subjects of the latitude and obliquity
have been again discussed in the Greenwich Observations for
1826 and 1827. I have already shown that from the former
the latitude should be 51° 28' 38"*5 N., which is confirmed by
Bessel.    From some observations which I reduced by means
of Ivory's refractions some years ago, it came out to be 51° 28'
38'H N. It appears that Mr. Pond prefers the use of Bradley's
refractions in reducing his observations ; and consequently all
his deductions must partake of the slight error attending the
application of these refractions.        He therefore makes the co-
latitude of Greenwich 38° 31' 21", and the latitude51° 28' 39"N.
being that derived by Bradley's refractions from the Obser-
vations of 1826, page     4«   of the results from October, Novem-
ber, &c.
   This  result is half a second     more than what I have adopted
as the correct one   from our best tables of refractions, and would
produce a difference of 1" between the summer and winter
obliquities.
   N.S. Vol.   8.  No. 46.    Oct. 1830.         2 I            The

242          Mr. Galbraith's further Observations on             the
    The error arising from the use of Bradley's refractions would
produce 1"*22 more, or 2"-22 in all. Now in the Greenwich
Observations for January &c. 1827, page 13 of deductions,
the mean of 15 determinations from 1812 till 1826, and re-
duced to 1820, gives

     Now    this conclusion,     agreeing so nearly with our previous
 results, seems almost decisive of the question.               There can be
 little doubt that the discordances between the observed ob-
 liquity at the summer and winter solstices are attributable, al-
 most entirely, to an erroneous table of refractions for deter-
 mining both the latitude and the obliquity.
     To deduce the true mean obliquity from those recorded in
 the Greenwich Observations of 1827, it will be necessary to
 apply the small corrections which have been just pointed out.

     The accordance between           the results is now apparent; and
  it is not brought about by design, but by detailing fully the
  principles upon which it has been obtained.                   Had the lati-
  tude been 51° 28' 38"*4,        —  that which I deduced from Ivory's
  refractions,    (which, so far as     I have been able to judge from
  what comparisons       I  have made, are among the most accurate
  tables of refractions now to be found,)        — the accordance would
  have been still closer, the summer coming out 23° 27' 46"*50,
  and the winter 23° 27' 46"*55, the mean being the same in
  both cases, or 23° 27' 46"*525. This result has been derived
   from numerous observations on different years, reduced to
   1820, and by that means may be presumed to be very cor-
   rect.
      It may now be proper          to deduce the annual diminution in
   the same manner.

  This result is confirmed by those of Brinkley, who makes
 it   23° 28' 17"'54; and of Bessel, who gives 23° 28' 17"'65.
 The mean of all these three would be 23° 28' 17"'66, almost
 the same as Bessel's.              Since Bradley's determination was
 23° 28' 18", agreeing exactly with Mayer's, and Lacaille's alone
 1" more, perhaps the mean of the whole, or 23° 27' 17"*66,
 might be safely adopted, as the respective differences from this
 scarcely exceed a tenth of a second ; more especially, if Brad-
ley's alone were adopted, to which the corrections above pro-
 perly apply, it would be 23° 28' 17"'45, still deviating little
from the mean which we, on the present occasion, are                       in-

      From the above table it appears that the deviation of
theory from observation is considerable for the observations
made about two centuries ago. As the instruments employed
 in making observations by the early astronomers were very
 rude, and could not be depended upon nearer than a fourth
 or fifth of a degree, and as no allowance was made for refrac-
 tion, because it was then unknown, such discrepancies may
 naturally be expected.
      The first four observed obliquities deviate most consider-
 ably from the computed ; but all who are aware of the state
 of astronomy, and of the rude manner of making observations
 with very imperfect instruments at those times, will not be sur-
 prised at such a circumstance. From the time of Albategnius
 to that of Tycho Brahe, the discrepancies are all much less,
 being within a minute of each other, which is as much as can
 be expected, since all the observations were made with in-
                                                                  struments

struments having plane sights,           till after the time of Tycho,
when      telescopic sights   began to be introduced.
    Before the year 1700, Azout and Picard applied telescopes
to astronomical instruments, which have given such precision
to modern observations.          Accordingly it has been found that
from this time observations began to possess an accuracy
formerly unknown and the differences between our theory
                          ;
and the observations are diminished.
    By analyzing all the foregoing observations, and introdu-
cing expressions involving the squares and higher powers of
the time from the assumed epoch, a formula would be ob-
tained so as to represent all the observations with tolerable
correctness.        It is evident, however, that although it might
represent the more early observations better, it would not re-
present the modern ones so well ; and as the former cannot
be allowed to possess great accuracy,           it has been thought un-
necessary to attempt to investigate such a formula, as it can
be comparatively of little value when obtained. Besides, it is
known from the investigations of Laplace, that the obliquity
is a quantity which varies between certain limits not exceed-
ing 3°, and as the times of maximum and minimum when the
variation is nothing, are unknown, it is evident that the varia-
 tion itself must be a variable quantity, and consequently it is
 not the same now, in all probability, that it was some thou-
 sands of years ago, or what it will be some thousands of
 years hence ; nor have we any means of ascertaining its se-
 cular change with any degree of precision. Astronomers must
 therefore, in a great degree, be contented with the most ac-
 curate annual variation within a moderate number of years
 since the use of well-constructed instruments, and accurate
 methods, of reduction, have been introduced ; reserving the
 discussion of the formula of variation for distant periods, till
 the lapse of ages and an accumulated mass of observations
 afford the means of investigating this subject with advantage.

  XXXIX. On the           Occultation of Aldebaran on July 16th, 1830;
       and on   the Accuracy   of the computed Times of it given in cer-
       tain Almanacks.       By Mr. Thomas        Squire.
       To  the Editors   of the Philosophical   Magazine and Annals.
          Gentlemen,                                Epping, Sept. 14, 1830.
    ["  BELIEVE         the occultation of Aldebaran by the moon on
   *    July the 1 6th of the present year, was not (on account of
   clouds) very generally observed in this country. Nevertheless,
                                                                        I was

 246 Mr. Squire on the Occultaiion of Aldebaran on July       16th,
 I was so fortunate as to get a good observation of the im-
 mersion at this place; and which happened at ll h 56 ra 36 s, 3
 mean solar time, or ll h 50 m 59 s, 4 apparent time. Now the
 latitude of Epping is 51° 41' 41"*6 N., longitude 25 s -l E. of
 Greenwich ; hence the apparent time of observation for the
 meridian of the latter place is ll h 50 m 34 s, 3, but the com-
 puted time in Moore's Almanack is stated at ll h 50 m 26%
 making the absolute time of immersion at Epping later than
 at Greenwich by about 8 s and this is very nearly the quan-
                               ;
 tity that would arise from the change in the lunar parallax.
 So that the computed results in White's Ephemeris and
 Moore's Almanack agreed (as usual) with the heavens to a
great degree of exactness.         I regret that clouds prevented
 my seeing the emersion, as I have no reason to doubt that the
 same happy coincidence in the computed and observed times
 would have been found to take place in this case as at the
 immersion, always relying on the general accuracy of the
computations in the above and other Almanacks published
 by the Stationers' Company. You will, Gentlemen, judge my
surprise at the concluding remarks of your Gosport corre-
spondent W. B., where, at page 234 of your last Number, he
gives what he calls the observed times of the immersion and
emersion of Aldebaran in this occupation and then unac-
                                                   ;
countably comes suddenly to the conclusion, that " the ap-
parent time at Greenwich of the disappearance and re-ap-
pearance of Aldebaran, as given in White's Ephemeris and
Moore's Almanack, is nearly two minutes too fast; so that
the time deduced from what are considered accurate astrono-
mical computations does not in this instance, and indeed it
seldom does, agree with the time of observation."
    Now, W. B. makes the observed time of immersion at Gos-
port to be July 15th at 23 h 44 m ; and that of emersion, July
] 6th at 3 l
             m 20 s ! But from a little consideration relative to this
phaenomenon, I am confident that one, and probably both, of
these observations is incorrect.          However, let us see how
these numbers will stand the test of the most scrupulous com-
putation.      For that purpose I will take the latitude of Gos-
port, as stated by Dr. William Burney,           =   50° 47' 45" N.
and the longitude      = 4 m 28 s W. of Greenwich, from which,
after a proper reduction of the latitude, and the moon's hori-
zontal parallax for polar compression, with other necessary
data, &c, I find that the immersion tookplace there July 15th
23 h 44 ra 6% and the emersion July 16th, h 34 m 16 s apparent
time, according to that meridian, instead of 23 h 44 m and 31 m 20 s
respectively, as given by your correspondent.           So much for
the accuracy of W. B.'s observations made with the best
                                                               power

                 and on     the computed  Times of it.           247
power of    his achromatic telescope      !  By changing the above
computed     instants into     Greenwich time, it will be seen that
the variation in the moon's parallactic angle caused the abso-
lute time of immersion at Gosport to be l m 52 s earlier; and
that of emersion l m 3 s later than at Greenwich, which, from
the visible position of the moon with respect to the star, &c,
must eventually have been the case.
    For the sake of further comparison I will here give another
example or two. The emersion of Aldebaran, December 9th,
1829, P.M., was observed at Greenwich to take place at
6 h 46 m 49 s apparent time, and the computed result, according
to Moore's Almanack, is 6 h 47 m 7 s ; difference 18 s .         The
immersion was not observed.
    Again; on January the 6th, 1830, A.M., Aldebaran was
observed at Greenwich to disappear behind the dark part of
the moon at 3 h 37 m 34 s *5 apparent time, but the computed
immersion in Moore's Almanack is 3 h 37 m 26 s , differing from
the observed time only 8£ s .         Clouds prevented the emersion
being observed.
    I wish I could have added more examples, but the above
may suffice to show that the computations in White's Ephe-
meris and Moore's Almanack are much nearer the truth than
 W.   B. would seem disposed to allow. On the 6th and 15th
 of October opportunities may again offer for          W.  B. to try
his hand in this way and in order to avoid errors in future,
                          ;
let me advise him not only to use his best pcnoer; but also his
 best clock, as correct time is allowed on all hands to be of
 consequence in observations of this kind       !
    At Epping the immersion was observed with an achro-
matic, and a power of 50 only ; the star seemed to rest upon
 the moon's disc some seconds before it disappeared.
    It is to be hoped that astronomers will pay attention to the
 occultation of Aldebaran on the 6th of next month, which
 will be visible in the S. and S.W. parts of England; as good
 observations on this important occultation, if made in places
 whose situations are accurately established, may afford some
 useful data for determining the true figure of the earth.         If
 micrometrical measurements of the moon's diameter could be
 taken at the time, they would be of use.
    I take this opportunity of observing that the d in iR of
 Aldebaran and the moon, on July 15th, as given in the Nau-
 tical Almanack, is not correct instead of 23 h 21 m 4 s , it should

XL.       Narrative of an Excursion to the Summit of the 'Peak
    qfTeneriffe on the 2.3rd and ZMh of February 1829. By
    Robert Edward Alison, Esq.
                              [Continued from page 200.]
  A    FTER           resting an hour on the top of the Peak, we
^*      descended the cone in the short space of five minutes,
although it had cost us 30 in the ascent and in about an hour
                                                       ;
we reached the Estancia. From the clearness of the atmo-
sphere there, we found the sun very hot, and although only
half-past eleven in the morning, the thermometer in the shade
stood at 76°, and in the sun at 97° but this heat was greatly
                                               ;
owing to the local situation of the Estancia, as an hour and a
half afterwards it was only 62°, at which point it generally
stood on the way back, till on entering the lower region of
the clouds it suddenly fell to 52°, and after to 49°, where it
remained until we left our cold and wet companions behind
us and six hours after leaving the Estancia we arrived safely
     ;
at the town of Orotava.
    It appears to me that the difficulty of the ascent to the top
of the Peak, has been greatly over-rated                   :  from the great
steepness of the cone, and the loose nature of the surface, it
may present greater obstacles than the ascent of most of the
Andes ; but an excursion to the top of it, even at the unfavour-
able time of the year that I made it, cannot be compared to
the danger and fatigue of an ascent of Mont Blanc. Although
the extreme rarity of the air at first produced a slight feeling
of sickness, a considerable quickening of the pulse, and a slight
difficulty in breathing, yet these symptoms all went off after
I had been a few hours on the mountain. The greatest incon-
venience        1 felt   was from a total want of appetite, and an in-
tolerable thirst         which it appeared impossible to allay, for no
sooner had I taken any liquid, than it immediately returned.
    It has been mentioned by some authors, that the heat of the
atmosphere decreases more rapidly the further you are re-
moved from the surface of the earth others contend that the
                                                 ;
                                                                  decrement

      Summit of    the Peak of Tcneriffe in February 1829.      249
decrement     is in arithmetical progression :  but these opinions
I think will    be found to be incorrect.
   From various observations made during expeditions to the
Peak, it appears, that the decrease of temperature is more
rapid in the inferior strata of the atmosphere, and slower in
the superior, but at a certain high elevation (which possibly
varies according to the latitude) the thermometer in the sum-
mer season is almost stationary throughout the twenty-four
hours and that even in winter, during the middle of the day
        ;
at the same elevation, the temperature is nearly similar to
what    it is in summer, and in Teneriffe      the height of this
stratum of air is from nine to eleven thousand feet.
   If the decrease be uniform, the mean heat of a certain eleva-
tion will be found by a thermometer placed between the lower
and upper stations but this is not the case and from the
                       :                           ;
tables which I have subjoined, it will be seen that the error is
much greater when the decrease is taken in arithmetical, than
in geometrical progression.      In this country, the temperature
of the atmosphere is said to diminish, in proportion to the
height above the level of the sea, at the rate of one degree of
Fahrenheit for every 270 feet of ascent. If the temperature
fell in the same ratio at Teneriffe, there ought to be a difference
of about 45° between the temperature of the coast and the top
of the Peak, whereas the maximum difference which I ex-
perienced was only 18^°. It is true, that it is impossible to
know the exact temperature of any point by a single passing
observation, as the thermometer must vary every moment ac-
cording to the presence of the sun, the interposition of clouds,
a strong wind, or a calm a local fog may occasion a refrigera-
                            :
tion in that part of the atmosphere where the instrument is
situated, which the rest of the air may not partake of; and any
of these accidents may occur at the precise moment of obser-
vation.     These can all be allowed for to a certain degree of
correctness but the immense difference between the supposed
               ;
and observed decrement of heat, from the sea-coast to the top
of the Peak, cannot be attributed to the effect of local causes,
but must be ascribed to the incorrectness of the theory and   ;
although it may never be submitted to accurate calculation,
from the variety of disturbing causes, yet it may be brought to a
 near approach to truth.
    It is much to be desired that some learned Society would
pay attention to this problem, and resolve it by direct expe-
riment, by establishing on the Peak a set of observations. It
 would be easy to find men courageous enough to undertake it
 although it is covered with snow every year for the space of six

 or eight months, yet the cold is considerably less than at the
 polar regions, where our hardy navigators were not afraid to
 pass the winter in the midst ot the horrors of a frozen sea.
    By means of a balloon, the experiment could occasionally
be made, and with it they have not to fear so many of the
causes of local influence, which are always difficult to de-
 termine.
    In choosing a time perfectly calm, the aeronaut could raise
himself almost perpendicularly, and with a velocity which he
could moderate according to his wish, by having a cask of water
furnished with a stop-cock, instead of bags of sand, which are
generally used. The balloon might be observed from several
points of its course, to be able to represent it by an equation
which would enable its observers to compare the movement of
the fixed thermometers with those which the aeronaut carried.
   I do not know of any mountain that has been so frequently
measured as the Peak of Teneriffe, and with results so dif-
ferent ; which circumstance, I think, is caused by its peculiar
local situation.
   Although barometrical admeasurement has been brought to
great perfection by the labours of Shuckburgh, Lindenau,
Biot, llamond, the immortal Laplace, and others, yet it is
sometimes affected by certain influences, which destroy the
fundamental supposition. The theory supposes the different
strata of the atmosphere to be in the regular order of their
density, the air to be in perfect equilibrium, and the decrease
of temperature to be uniform as the weight of the atmosphere
                                :
decreases as you recede from the centre of the earth, and is
proportional to the square of the distance, any particular
pressure near the surface will destroy this regularity.
   Barometrical observations show that a particular accumula-
tion of atmosphere is above the Canaries; this is probably
caused by a current existing in the upper regions which is
opposed to a lower one. Baron Von Buch, in a memoir upon
the climate of the Canaries, mentions that most travellers to
the summit of the Peak have taken notice of a strong west
wind blowing there so violently as hardly to allow them to
stand, whilst a north-east wind prevailed below.       I have fre-
quently observed this current from the town of Orotava, when
the clouds were nearly at the same elevation as the summit of
the Peak, where they would accumulate in a dense body on
the south-west side, whilst on the opposite point they would
be broken into small parcels, which reunited after they had
passed a short distance ; at the same time, in the lower regions,
the vapours and wind were all from the north-east.           It is
                                                         therefore

therefore probable that this partial pressure, which only exists
in the    lower regions, may be the cause of the difference of the
following admeasurements of the Peak.

XLI. Proposed Improvements                in the Construction of the Cy-
    linder Electrical     Machine and accompanying Apparatus. By
    Mr. G. Dakin.
    To   the Editors    of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
  f  HAVE        sent you a drawing of some improvements which
-    I  have lately made in the cylinder electrical machine for
medical purposes, and which would also be found well adapted
for the usual routine of electrical experiments.               There is one
very great drawback in the study of electricity and that is,;
that many persons who are possessed of large cylindrical ma-
chines are unable to produce the effects of others of perhaps
not half the size the fact is, that all glass is not fit for this
                       :
purpose, most probably owing to a slight excess of alkali in its
composition. Some of the most refractory cylinders will re-
quire to be warmed, greased, and well excited with a large
piece of silk or a coarse towel.                Now as the common black
glass, such as wine bottles are made of, appears to be well
adapted for this purpose, I would recommend that cylinders,
plates, jars, and rods, should be made of this sort of glass,

252 Mr. G. Dakin's proposed Improvements              in the Construction
and immediately lined and covered with shell-lac, as this sub-
stance stands the very first on the list of electrics and insula-
tors*.     This practice, it appears to me, would be much better
than that of insulating the cylinder, as the glass rods are so apt
to get loose or broken. The cylinder represented in the figure is
mounted in the usual way but instead of terminating with the
                                 ;
small wheel, there is a round projecting part with a bayonet catch
on it, and the same on the multiplying-wheel. The crank is
formed hollow like the handle of a bayonet, and fits both these;
so that incase of the catgut breaking, it can be immediately fixed
to the cylinder.       Thus the advantages of the crank- and mul-
tiplying-wheel machine are combined ; for when the amalgam
is first applied, the friction is much too great for the catgut to
overcome without stretching or breaking and then it must be
                                                    ;
tightened, or the second string must be applied and in cases ;
of suspended animation it causes a serious interruption, even
if this is at hand.      The rubber is made in the usual way but        ;
instead of a chain the communication with the earth is made
with wire, and two balls, which are in contact when the
prime conductor is positive, and separate or entirely removed
when the negative conductor is used. With respect to the
silk flap, my observation goes no further than this;           —  that I be-
lieve the varnished silk will keep a machine longer in mo-
derate action in a damp room, but that unvarnished silk will
adhere closer, and produces a greater effect in a dry room.
The bottom of the machine should be continued the whole
length of the conductor, as it contributes so much to the
steadiness of the whole of the apparatus, that a person who
has once been used to it would never tolerate any other. Be-
sides, it does not take so much material to make it; for there
is no necessity for a stand for the conductor, a bottom for
   * In the Phil. Mag. and Annals, vol. v. p. 171, will be found an account
of a globe electrical machine of uncommon power, constructed of black
or green bottle-glass by the Rev. J. B. Emmett. In chemical operations,
instruments and vessels of this kind of glass would be more useful even
than in electricity, but the existing provisions of the Excise Laws do not
permit their use we add a paragraph on this subject from Mr. Faraday's
                  :
" Chemical Manipulation," in the hope of assisting to draw attention to it,
and of promoting by that means such alterations in the laws as may en-
able the cultivator of science to obtain apparatus formed of this useful
material.    Mr. Faraday observes, p. 226, " It is much to be regretted that
the chemist cannot obtain glass retorts and other vessels which have
to resist high temperatures, of green bottle-glass, and of all the forms and
sizes he requires.   Large glass retorts, for the purpose of concentrating
sulphuric acid, are made of it ; but much smaller ones, from two pints to
an ounce in capacity, are required in the laboratory of research. Even
green glass tubes are rarely to be procured, and are not permitted to be
made without the special leave of the Board of Excise." Edit.
                                                                          the

the packing-case, or a bottom for the universal discharger.
Another advantage is, that it is always ready for action at a
moment's warning, as there is nothing to do but to lift the
case off, and every thing is in its place.   In Nairne's, or the
most approved construction, the negative conductor is always
in the way, whether it is wanted or not and the positive con-
                                          ;
ductor is not placed in the most convenient position.
   As in case of charging a battery it is proper to have a
small conductor, and in giving strong sparks it is necessary
to have a large one, and as a negative conductor is sometimes
required, the following arrangement will be found to answer
for all these purposes.    The best form for the conductors is
oblong, of about the size of the rubber ; by this construction
these parts form very convenient stands of themselves the   :
fork and round end next the cylinder may be dispensed with,
as the upper part of the positive conductor is cut with a Van-
dyke edge. The negative conductor is made a little smaller, so
as to fit within the positive when not wanted.    When fixed at
right angles on the positive conductor, it nearly doubles the
power of that; and when fixed on the rubber, it forms the
negative conductor.     One of its ends fits on loose, and has a
shank to it: this end forms the large ball for taking strong
sparks, when the small conductor is fixed vertically on the
large one.     The charger passes through the ball at the end
of the conductor, and is fixed at any height by a screw:
it also   connects the negative with the positive conductor.
This precludes the necessity of using the tops, balls, wires, and
chains of all the jars, and they are better without them it    :
also connects the positive conductor with the earth.       At the
end  is a female screw to secure the   wood and    coated points,
                                                            plate,

254-  Mr. G. Dakin's proposed Improvements       in the Construction
plate, balls, &c.     When fixed at the end of the upper con-
ductor,    it will bring the wooden points, &c. forward into the
room, and obviate the employment of the insulated handle
and chain.
   The    discharger consists of a ball with a short rod and ring:
at right angles to this    is a ferule to fit the glass rod   :  at the
other end of the rod is a ferule with a female screw.              The
stand is made of brass, with a large hollow edge turned up
smooth. It answers three distinct purposes well, and does
away with the discharging rod, which is a dangerous thing to
use with a battery in the dark, and is of little use unless it
be to take the residuum out of jars set also with Lane's dis-
charging electrometer, which when fixed on the top of the
jar is extremely cumbrous and liable to be broken.              I have
seen this latter fitted up with a micrometer screw the ab- :
surdity of this must be evident to any practical electrician,
especially if there should be the least dust in the room; in
fact, the eye is quite capable of judging of any distance that
is required to proportion the strength of the shock.               The
third purpose it answers is that of the upper plate and handle
of the electrophorus this is generally made so short, that if
                         :
the operator has a moist hand it is almost useless.             When
used as a discharging rod, the hand is applied to the lower
ferule, and the whole is moved up to any part of the conduc-
tor.    When used as Lane's discharging electrometer, there
is a slit and screw to fix it at any required distance      :   by this
means it is more secure than the latter, as the twitching of
the patient is apt to increase the distance of the balls without
the operator being aware of it, which has often produced un-
pleasant consequences. When used as the upper plate of
the electrophorus, the upper part is taken off, the stand also
screws into the charger, and forms the upper plate for char-
ging as tratum of air, the dancing figures, &c. By this ap-
paratus all discharges are safely and conveniently made in the
dark, whether of battei'ies, jars, or spiral tubes, &c. ; and there
will be no occasion to attach to the latter either balls or stands,
if they have two hooks, one to hang in the ring and the other
to touch the bottom.
   The show jars of the shops are generally taken to make
the Leyden jars of, the thick bottoms of which are reckoned
as coated surface, though they are known to receive only
weak charges. Now if this almost useless part was forced
upwards so as to form an inverted jar, and the middle of this
back again, as shown in the engraving, (how often this may
be repeated must be left to the glass-blower,) we should have
a jar that would have at least twice the power of an ordinary
                                                                   jar,

 and vice versa, a single jar might be made to have the power of
 an ordinary battery and until something like this has been ac-
                           ;
 complished, the use of powerful batteries must remain in the
 hands of the opulent, and those of scientific bodies, lhaveheard
 of a battery of plates in the shape of a quarto volume; but
 however well this shape may answer on account of its porta-
 bility, it is not well adapted for the purpose, as the insulating
 edge must go all round but if we bend one of these plates
                                  ;
 into the shape of a cylinder, and put a bottom in, there is but
 one edge left to keep clean, and the other three are added to
 the coated surface, independently of the bottom, besides being
 of a much more convenient shape.            A metal jar maybe made
 and coated with sealing-wax, and the latter with tin-foil but    ;
 how far this method could be carried by inverted jars remains
 to  be tried.
     The  first    Henley's universal discharger that I made had
 two insulated      wires, in the usual way; but if I had been asked
 the use of the second insulation, I should have been at a loss
 what to answer, as a jointed wire answers every purpose,
 and is much less in the way. The lower plate of the electro-
 phorus is formed with a smooth round edge it is filled with
                                                      :
 shell-lac.     It forms the table of the universal discharger
 when inverted and set on a drinking-glass, and a chain hooked
 on, it forms the lower plate for the dancing figures, &c.
 without the chain, it forms the insulated stand. The I'esinous
 side will do to form Professor Lichtenberg's figures upon.
 The glass itself will form a jar with moveable coatings, and
 will do for the dancing balls, &c.
     What is called the electrical pistol is a mortar or howitzer,
 which has to be filled with inflammable air, and fired by a se-
 parate Leyden jar a real electrical pistol may be easily made.
                         :
 Take a pistol-stock and fix an ivory barrel on it with an in-
 terrupted circuit in it then bore a hole through the stock.
                               :
 Take one of the smallest Leyden phials, and fit a brass tube
 as an outside coating       ;   solder a wire to the coating, insert it
 in the hole and bend the end of the wire to form the trig-
 ger then put a cork with a particle of fulminating silver into
      ;
  the barrel charge the phial, and fire it at a mark in any part

     Another advantage (independent of the cheapness attend-
 ing coated green glass) is that the stools and chairs would
 look like common ones ; I have seen nervous patients thrown

         determine the form of the solid which                    attracts a      body
 *     on the surface with the greatest force.
     The  attraction of each particle of the solid              must be resolved
into   two   parts,    and that part rejected which is not towards
the centre of gravity of the solid                 ;  and the solid is such that
every point of its surface attracts the body equally towards
the centre; otherwise the sum of the attractions might be in-
creased by removing that portion which attracts least, and
placing it beside that which attracts most.
     Let A (fig. 1.) the body attracted, be a point on the surface
of the solid.                                                Fi.<r.  1.          B

                          [Continued from   vol. vi. p. 464.]
       E   redeem our pledge, and proceed to lay before our
         readers an abstract of the 7th volume* of Treitschke's
continuation of Ochsenheimer's Schmetterlinge von Europa,
published towards the end of 1829. This volume contains
ten genera, from Uerminia to Ennychia inclusive, almost the
whole of which were comprehended by Linnaeus in the divi-
sion Pyralis of his great genus Phalcend; "and indeed," says
our author, " so closely allied are the species of that division,
that only in very few instances can any doubt exist of the
propriety of the place assigned to them." Linnaeus only enu-
merates 18 species of Pyralis (Syst. Nat. edit. 12ma, Holmise
1767). Gmelin swells the list to 83.
   Treitschke gives the following characters of the Pyralides.
Palpi distinct           body slender         posterior feet long         wings
   slender, the anterior when at rest deflexed and forming a
    triangle.
Larvce small, with 14 or 16             feet      body thickest in the mid-
   dle, generally       somewhat verrucose and            hairy.
Pupa long and         slender.
Metamorphosis        in   a slight web, above ground.
      Genus     107.       HERMINIA,           Ochs., Treitsch.—Latr.
                  Crambus, Fabr. Ent. Syst. Suppl.
                  Polypogon, Schrank, Stephensf.
Palpi long, straight. Antennce pectinated in the male. An-
   terior wings broad, with the posterior margin ciliated, and
   slightly repand.          Body rather stout. -Larva with 14 or 16
   feet,   slightly       pilose;   hairs short,        sub- verrucose; warts
   minute    %.
  * The   sixth vol. consists   of only two parts. —  TV.
  f Treitschke    rejects Schrank's     name Polypogon for this genus, in con-
sequence of  its having been previously adopted in botany : Stephens, how-
ever, has restored   it.
   %  The number of      feet of the larva3 of the Pyralides has  not been suffi-
ciently attended to   : this genus might probably be divided into two sections
—                                                                 —
   one consisting of those species whose larva; have 14 feet the other of
those whose larvae have 16.

    § Treitschke has altogether omitted Hiibner's Pyralis lucemalis, which
 he says is certainly not an European species. Haworth gives it as a
 Pyralis of his section albidalcs, but with great doubt if it be " an inhabitant
                 —
 of Britain." The specimen he describes, he purchased as an English one,
 of a London dealer ; " but it is possible he might have been mistaken."
 Haworth, Lep. Brit. p. 384. No. 27. As Stephens has not only admitted
 the species, but even formed a new genus, Diaphania, on it, we suppose
 he has positive proof that it is British, and consequently that Treitschke's
 assertion is erroneous.        By the asterisk immediately after the specific
 name lucemalis, it seems that Stephens believes the insect to have been
 captured within 25 miles of St. Paul's, though the mark is accompanied
 by a note of doubt. Tr. —

XLI V.         Additions to the Theory of Eclipses, and the Methods of
                              calcidating their Results*.
 [1.]     "C^OR       calculating the results of eclipses two methods,
          *     founded on different principles, have been hitherto
employed. The first follows up the phenomenon in the man-
ner in which it presents itself to the observer. It requires,
therefore, the calculation of the apparent distances of both
the eclipsing and the eclipsed bodies from the pole, as also of
their apparent semidiameters, in order to find, by means of
the former together with the distance of the centres resulting
from the apparent diameters, the angle at the pole; it requires
besides the calculation of the change of this angle produced
by parallax, in order to deduce, by applying it to the angle at
the pole, the corresponding angle which would be observed
in the centre of the earth              ; this method finally gives from the
magnitude of this angle and the rate of its change as deduced
from the tables of both objects, the time elapsing between the
moment of the observation and that of the conjunction of
both bodies, by which the latter expressed in time of the place
of observation is derived. This method is very old Kepler               ;
has already explained it in modern times it has been deve-
                                      ;
loped by Lalandef, and more completely and accurately by
Bohnenberger \. Both adopt for the pole that of the eclip-
tic    ;  Gerstner §, however, refers all the calculations which the
method requires              to the pole of the equator.           Carlini  ||

case of the eclipsed body being a fixed star, not for the centre
of the eclipsing body but for the point of the limb where the
occultation or emersion takes place, that is to say, for a point
whose apparent place is the same with that of the star, in con-
sequence of which, instead of the apparent diameter the true
one is introduced into the calculation, and the calculation of
the former as well as of the true longitude at the time of the
observation is avoided.       This method has called forth the
various attempts to find more convenient formulae for the effects
of parallax: I do not deem it necessary to give an account of
the numerous essays written with a view to this purpose."
   The second method, on the contrary, does not take notice
of the single parts of the phaenomenon ; but consists in making
the apparent distance of the celestial bodies, expressed by
their geocentric places and those of the place of observation,
equal to the sum or the difference of the apparent diameters
of the bodies (according as the external or internal contact
has been observed), thus producing an equation whose un-
known quantity is the time of the conjunction.            We are in-
debted for    this method   to  Lagrange*, in whose memoir on
this subject the   unknown quantity of the equation is the mo-
ment in which both bodies have the same longitude. This
method has been less frequently applied than the other; but
its influence has extended far beyond the theory of eclipses,
and has given a new form to the problems of astronomy in
general.    Clausen (in an excellent paper printed in the Astr.
Nachr. No. 40) has chosen for the unknown quantity the time
of the shortest geometrical distance.
   [2.] The object of all calculations of observed phasnomena of
this kind is either to find the corrections required by the ele-
ments of the calculation taken from the astronomical tables, or
the difference of the meridians of the places of observation.
    With regard to the second object, the first method has not
yet been completely developed, as the geocentric distances of
the celestial bodies from the pole, and their horizontal paral-
laxes at the time of observation at a place whose difference of
meridian is unknown, are assumed to be known. The error
 arising from this circumstance is of practical importance only
 as far as it affects the latitude (or declination) of the moon;
 but it may be easily corrected. If we denote the time of con-
junction resulting from the calculation by t, and the change
 which will be produced in it by a correction x of the difference
 of meridians (d) assumed in the calculation, by a x, the true
 time of conjunction will be r + a x, the corresponding time for

the former meridian               = —  r   d— x-f a x. This value for the
time compared to another (t') resulting from observations at
places whose meridians are known, will give

    If,   as usual, the effect of a          change   AS of the latitude (or
declination) on the time of conjunction has been calculated
and found equal             to m A     8, and if the change of  § in a second
of time be denoted by             (3,  we have a = m /3. It is clear, there-
fore, that in the usual manner of calculating in respect to the
ecliptic, where /3 may amount to 0""055, it may not unfre-
quently happen that the time hitherto neglected may amount
to the tenth part of the error of the assumed difference of me-
ridians.        For nearly central occultations         this neglect is of no
consequence but in cases of occultations of short duration
                     ;
the whole result may be rendered illusive by it.
    The second method, on the contary, does not suppose the
difference of meridians to be known, but determines it by the
solution of an equation which is obtained by successive ap-
proximations, the first of which even may be made independ-
ent of an approximate knowledge of the difference of the me-
ridians.        I shall demonstrate that this advantage is not the
only one which the second method possesses over the first,
but that it likewise leads to the end proposed by a more easy
calculation.           This is obtained by introducing as an unknown
quantity, besides the corrections of the elements of the calcu-
lation, the difference           of the meridians of the places of observa-
tion   itself,    instead of taking as such the time of conjunction.
Indeed the time of conjunction may be considered as an aux-
iliary quantity, the calculation of which is only interesting as
far as it affords a means of determining the errors of the tables.
If these errors are determined directly, without using the time
of conjunction, the knowledge of the latter becomes entirely
superfluous:           if it  be still required, it maybe found without
difficult}' after        the errors of the tables have been ascertained.

      I have here adopted the relations to the equator ; those to
the ecliptic might as well have been taken, and, more generally.,
any point of the sphere may be chosen, and the great circle
of which that point is the pole, may be substituted for the equa-
tor, and any point of that great circle may be substituted for
the point from which the right ascensions are counted.                                                     The
calculation being the same for all assumptions, it is unneces-
sary separately to develop it for each case.

     This equation             is   the proper foundation of the analysis of
 eclipses    ;  it is perfectly developed, as all the quantities which
 it contains refer to the centre of the earth only.                                 It is suscep-
 tible of innumerable transformations ; for either the position
 of the pole and the point of commencement of the angle at the
 same, may be arbitrarily assumed, or the sum of the three

     [4.] The most simple case of an eclipse is that in which 7r'
 and     R   are   =   0, or where the body eclipsed is at an infinite
 distance and appears as a point ; this is the case of fixed stars.
 I shall first develop this case, and use for this purpose the
5th equation of my former paper (Astr. Nachr. vol. vi. No. 145.
 Phil. Mag. Nov. 1829, p. 338).                          This equation maybe de-
rived from the general equation (2) either by transferring the
pole to which 8,           D     ... refer to the circle of declination of the
fixed star at the distance of 90° from the same, and counting
the angles at this pole from the star, or by writing                                      D   and   A
in place of the arbitrary quantities u and v of the preceding
section.        The latter substitution gives immediately (without
applying any formulas of spherical trigonometry),

&c. which results from the observation.                                     The coefficients

in relation to the elements of the calculation «, 8.
    [5.] Let us suppose that the required time of the first me-
ridian, viz. the meridian whose time was employed for cal-
culating a, 8 ... consists of two parts                      T   and T', and let P be
 = +P p'T'         ;  Q= +     q       q' T', where p and q denote the values
 of P and      Q     for the time T.                If the variations of P and                  Q
were proportional to the time, p' and q' would be constants ;
but in reality they depend on the second and higher differ-
 ences of P and Q, which, however, if T' does not exceed some
hours, have only such a small effect that the variations of p f
and   q',   compared with the                 variations of P and             Q themselves,
may be       considered as quantities of a higher order.                             On this
 circumstance rests the solution of the equation (4) by successive
 approximations which rapidly converge to the truth. If we
 introduce in place of the corrections of the elements two new
 quantities dependent on them, so that

    In order to apply        this solution,      T' and thence p' and q' are
assumed as accurately as the existing knowledge of the dif-
ference of the meridian of the place of observation allows
the approximate determination of T' thereby obtained, is then
employed for obtaining a second approximation, and so on.
I observe, however, with a view to prove the adequacy of the
method, that it is not necessary to suppose an approximate
knowledge of the difference of the meridians, but that in the
beginning the value of            T   may be supposed equal to the time
of the conjunction as given by the tables, this supposition be-
ing always in unison with the supposition of the convergency
of the results on which the calculation is founded. When T'
has been found,         T  + T' will be equal to the time of observa-
tion less the difference of meridians t— d, to be taken positive
if easterly, consequently d           = — —

    [6.]    I shall  now   further develop the calculations required
in the application of this method.                  Although it converges
quickly to the result even if T' amounts to some hours, yet
the smaller the value of T' the more convenient will be
calculation, for the convergency itself will approach the
nearer to       its maximum, and           a small T' may be more accu-
rately determined        by   its  logarithm, than a greater one.         It is
therefore advisable to adopt for                T  a time which is as near
to the mean of the times of the observations which are to
be calculated, as this can be effected by multiples of tens of
minutes of time, or generally by such parts of the day as ad-
mit of a more easy calculation from the tables or ephemerides
of a, 8, 7r than such as are expressed by higher numbers. The
sort of time in which          T    is to be expressed, ought to be that
for which «, 8, n can be most easily found, consequently mean
time, if these values are calculated from the tables, or from
Encke's Ephemeris, which perfectly supplies their place; and,
on the contrary, apparent time, if the columns for the moon
in the Connaissance des Tems or the Nautical Almanac are
to be applied.        The values of «, 8, tt are to be calculated for
                                                                           the

or the parts of which they are composed, viz. p,p',q,q' be-
come dependent on          T  and a, b, c ... ; the formulas by which
they are expressed, shall be given when their application will
be required. In this manner p' and q' are found in parts of
an hour    ; the formulas (5) and (6) suppose, therefore, the same
unity of time.       It is, however, more convenient to express d
in seconds of time.         This is obtained by multiplying formula
 (6) by such a number of seconds of that kind of time in which
the observation is given, as is equivalent to the hour here
assumed; this number I will generally denote by s. Then
t  —T     will be expressed in seconds of the same time, or                    T
denotes now that time (uniformly expressed with t), for
which a, b, c have been calculated. It is therefore not ne-
cessary to convert the times given by the observers into that
 sort of time in which         T   has been fixed, but the process is
quite the contrary. Besides saving some trouble, we shall then,
not even for converting one time into another, require any
 approximate value of the unknown difference of the meridians.
 For the sake of completeness I observe in this place that as
 the sidereal time, on which the u involved in the expression
 for u and v depends, corresponding to an observation given
 in solar time of an unknown meridian, cannot be calculated
 before the difference of meridians is known, it becomes neces-

 A   Treatise on Poisons, in relation to Medical Jurisprudence,   Phy-
    siology, and  the Practice of Medicine. By Robert Christison,
    M.D. F.R.S. E. fyc. Sfc, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence and
    Police in the University of Edinburgh. In one vol. 8vo, 698 pages,
    price 16s. published by Adam Black, Edinburgh, and Longman
    and Co. London.
 WE        have for some time purposed drawing the attention of our
         readers to this work ; for though many of the details which
 it embraces are too professional for insertion in the Philosophical
 Magazine and Annals of Philosophy, it contains much chemical
 information, which is both new in itself and important in its appli-
 cations.    The object of the author is to supply a systematic work
 on Poisons, adapted as a guide to practitioners in medicine. Not-
 withstanding the great and increasing importance of the subject,
 this is the first original work of the kind which has appeared in the
 English language since the beginning of the present century; nor,
 considering the qualifications required for success in such an un-
 dertaking, do we feel surprise that it has not hitherto been at-
 tempted. The production of a work of this kind demands a com-
 prehensive, and in many instances a very minute knowledge of all
 the principal branches of the medical profession.      It requires the
 aid of the practice of medicine in order to distinguish the sym-
 ptoms produced by poison from those of natural disease ; of phy-
 siology, to explain the mode by which poisons act on the animal
 ceconomy and of pathology, to discriminate between the morbid
             ;
 appearances produced by poisonous substances and those arising
 from diseased action independent of poison. It is likewise neces-
 sary, as the reader of this treatise will speedily perceive, to be fa-
 miliar with continental writers, not merely with the labours of the
 French in toxicology, but with the numerous important facts and
 cases recorded by the Germans,— a mine of wealth in this depart-
 ment, of which no previous English author has fully taken advan-
 tage.   Lastly, a qualification rarely combined with learning and
                             —                           —
 experience in medicine a knowledge of chemistry is essential.
 We   do not mean such theoretical knowledge as suffices to under-
stand a chemical work ; but that combination of sound theory and
manual skill, which enables the possessor to detect the real fallacies
of a process, and to devise and perform others which are effective.
The praise of having brought these qualifications to bear on his
subject may justly be awarded to Dr. Christison; and, besides great
industry in collecting the opinions and facts of others, he may
claim the merit of contributing much original matter of his own.
His style is clear and unaffected ; and his classification and mode
of treating his subject are guided by that practical good sense
which renders the work convenient and agreeable for consultation.
In fact, Dr. Christison has supplied a work that was much wanted,
and has performed it in a manner which reflects credit both on
himself and on the University with which he is connected.
                                                                   Dr.

                Dr. Christison's Treatise on Poisons.                  277
   Dr. Christison has divided his work into two principal parts ; the
first of which treats of poisoning in general, and the second of
individual poisons.     His object in the former, is to consider the
physiological action of poisons, and to lay down those principles
relative to the management of cases of poisoning, which apply ge-
nerally to the subject. The individual poisons are considered under
the three classes of Irritants, Narcotics, and Narcotico-acrids.       The
first divison comprehends those poisons, the principal action of
which is to excite inflammation in the parts where they are applied
the second, such as act solely or chiefly by producing disorder
in the nervous system      ; and the class of narcotico-acrids includes
those which possess a double action, the one local and irritating,
and the other remote, consisting of an impression on the nervous
system. The subjects discussed in the first part are too exclusively
medical for our pages we shall extract from the history of the
                          :
individual poisons such portions as will serve both as specimens of
the work, and convey useful, and in general new information to the
reader.
   Arsenic. —  As very incorrect notions prevail respecting the taste
of arsenious acid, we extract Dr. Christison's remarks on this sub-
ject.   " It has long been almost universally believed to be acrid,
and is described to be so in most systematic works, and in many
express treatises: but in reality it has little or no taste at all. The
reader will find some details on this point in a paper I published
lately in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal.              In the
present work it is sufficient to observe, that 1 have repeatedly made
the trial, and seen it made by my request by several of my scien-
tific friends ;  and that after continuing the experiment as long and
extending the poison as far back as we thought safe, we all agreed
that it had hardly any taste at all,    — perhaps towards the close a
very faint sweetish taste. I have hitherto found only one authority
who has made the observation that arsenic has no taste, namely, —
Dr. Addington, the chief Crown witness on the trial of Miss Blandy
a few others, and more particularly Hahnemann, Dr. Gordon, and
Mr. Walker, a witness on a late trial, have said that it is sweet but;
all the other authors I have consulted mention that it is acrid, and
one of these, Professor Fodere, even says that a grain causes an
indescribable and insupportable metallic taste.        It is impossible to
make with safety satisfactory experiments on its taste, when it
reaches the back of the palate but we may rest assured that it
                                   ;
often makes no impression at all, as it has been swallowed unknow-
ingly with articles of food.     This fact it is essential to remember,
as many ignorantly believe that when swallowed, even in moderate
quantity, it must cause a sense of acridity.        I have not been able
to find any actual case where this sensation was perceived ; and it
is therefore probable that the mistake, which the present remarks
are intended to rectify, has arisen from the impression in the act of
swallowing having been confounded with the inflammation in the
throat subsequently developed along with the other inflammatory
symptoms. And so Navier remarked, that the solution has at first
                                                                  a bland

<278                 Notices respecting  New   Books.
a bland taste like milk, but in a few minutes excited a sense of
roughness (aprett), and soon after the usual effects of burning."
   We need not stop to describe Dr. Christison's method of de-
tecting the presence of arsenic, as his views are already before the
public.   On the odour of arsenic, as a test, we may, however, ex-
tract the following comment.      " This test should be altogether dis-
carded. It does not always detect arsenic when present and the;
alliaceous odour is not an infallible proof that it is present.     Zinc
powder projected on burning fuel emits the same odour. Phos-
phorus, phosphoric acid, and the phosphates give out a similar
odour ; and I have frequently remarked one very like it from burn-
ing paper.    What is of more consequence, however, a very small
portion of vegetable or animal matter, present in the matter sub-
jected to trial, obscures the alliaceous smell entirely.   This I have
often observed, and the same thing was stated long ago by Pyl and
Hahnemann. If any one should nevertheless wish to have re-
course to this test, the proper way to try it, is to breathe gently
with the nostrils into the tube immediately after the metal has been
sublimed, and then to smell it."
   In speaking of the detection of arsenic by means of the ara-
moniacal nitrate of silver, and of the obscurity occasioned by the
presence of sea-salt, the following simple method is given for
avoiding uncertainty arising from this source. " The best way of
getting rid of this difficulty is to use in the first instance, not the
ammoniacal nitrate, but the nitrate of silver as long as any white
precipitate falls down, to add a slight excess of that test, and then,
after subsidence, to drop in ammonia.       No arsenic is thrown down
by the first steps of this process but if any be present, it is thrown
                                    ;
down in the form of the rich yellow arsenite of silver, on the sub-
sequent addition of ammonia. This very simple mode of getting
rid of the chloride of sodium has been lately suggested by Dr.
Forbes, Professor of Chemistry, Aberdeen." The same principle
has been since applied by Dr. Christison, for removing animal sub-
stances, as preparatory to the precipitation of arsenic by sulphu-
retted hydrogen    ;  a preparation which should never be omitted
 when much animal matter is present, as it is very apt to adhere to
 the sulphuret of arsenic, and prove troublesome in the process of
 reduction.   This difficulty is avoided by adding nitrate of silver as
long as any precipitate falls, when all the animal matter is thrown
down in combination with oxide of silver, and arsenious acid re-
mains in solution, provided care is taken that no uncombined alkali
is present.   The excess of silver is subsequently removed by mu-
riate of soda, and the arsenic thrown down as usual by sulphuretted
hydrogen. It is important, however, to neutralize the free nitric
acid before transmitting sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the li-
 quid since otherwise the sulphuret of arsenic would be mixed
      ;
 with free sulphur, the presence of which renders the reduction by
 black flux both difficult and uncertain.
   As the action of water on orpiment is important and not ge-
 nerally noticed in systematic works on chemistry, we extract the
                                                                following

                Dr. Chnstison's Treatise on Poisons.              219
following passage.     " It has been stated by Hahnemann in his ela-
borate work on arsenic, that the pure sulphurets are somewhat so-
luble in water,— that the native orpiment is soluble in 5000 parts
of water with the aid of ebullition, and that the artificial orpiment
by precipitation is soluble in 600 parts of water. Hahnemann,
however, was mistaken in supposing that the water dissolved these
sulphurets.     It does not dissolve, but decomposes them.        Very
lately M. Decourdemanche has found that, by slow action in cold
water, and much more quickly with the aid of heat, the arsenical
sulphuret is decomposed by virtue of a simultaneous decomposition
of the water, sulphuretted hydrogen being evolved, and an oxide
of arsenic remaining in solution.      And he has further remarked,
that this change is promoted by the presence of animal and vege-
table principles dissolved in the water."
    Much difference of opinion has prevailed regarding the influence
of arsenic over the putrefaction of the bodies of persons who have
been poisoned with it. Till lately the prevailing opinion was, that
the putrefactive process is accelerated ; and in some instances this
really appears to have been the case.        But others maintain that
arsenic sometimes proves powerfully antiseptic; and several re-
markable cases, in proof of this opinion, are quoted by Dr. Christi-
son from German writers, by whom the subject has of late been
much discussed. That arsenic acts as an antiseptic on the parts with
which it is in contact, is clearly established by the following evi-
dence   :
    " Arsenic  is a good preservative of animal textures when it is di-
rectly applied to them in sufficient quantity.      This is well known
 to stuffers of birds and beasts, was experimentally ascertained by
 Guyton Morveau, and has          also come under myl own observa-
 tion.    I have kept a bit of an ox's stomach four years in a solu-
 tion of arsenic, and, except slight shrivelling and whitening, I could
 not observe any change produced in it."
    " Dr. Kelch of Konigsberg, buried the internal organs of a
 man who had died of arsenic, and whose body had remained with-
 out burial till the external parts had begun to decay and on ex-
                                                           ;
 amining the stomach and intestines five months after, he found that
 the hamper in which they were contained was very rotten but      ;
 that ' they had a peculiar smell, quite different from that of putrid
 bowels, were not yet acted on by putrefaction, but as fresh as when
 first taken from the body, and might have served to make prepara-
 tions.   They had lost nothing of their colour, glimmer, or firmness.
 The inflamed spots on the stomach had not disappeared and the;
 small intestines also showed in some places the inflammatory red-
 ness unaltered.'
    " In the case of the girl Warden, which has been several times
 alluded to, the internal organs were also preserved somewhat in
  the same manner. The body had been buried three weeks; yet
  the mucous coat of the stomach and intestines, except on its mere
 surface, was very firm, and all the morbid appearances were conse-
  quently quite distinct. Nay, three weeks after disinterment, ex.
                                                                    cept

 280               Notices respecting   New   Boohs.
 cept that the vascularity had disappeared, the membranes and the
appearances in them remained in the same state. A similar case
has been recorded by Metzger. It is that of an old man who died
after six hours' illness, and in whose stomach three drachms of
arsenic were found.    The body had been kept ten days in February
before burial, and was disinterred eight days after that yet there
                                                            ;
 was not the slightest sign of putrefaction anywhere. A parallel
case was described by myself in the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical
 Transactions."
   In a case of poisoning with arsenic examined by Dr. Borges,
 Medical Inspector at Minden, fourteen weeks after death, " the
stomach and intestines were firm, of a grayish-white colour, and
contained evident crumbs of bread, while all the other organs in
the belly were pulpy, and the external parts adipocirous."      So also
in a case which happened at Chemnitz in ] 726, " the skin was every-
where very putrid, but the stomach and intestines were perfectly
fresh.   In the case of Warden, the appearances were precisely the
same. Three weeks after burial the Dundee inspectors found the
external parts much decayed ; and three weeks later, the stomach
and intestines were found by myself in a state of almost perfect
preservation.    A striking experiment performed by Dr. Borges on
a rabbit will likewise illustrate admirably the fact now under con-
sideration.    The rabbit was killed in less than a day with ten grains
of arsenic, and its body was buried for thirteen months in a moist
place under the eaves of a house. At the end of this period it was
found that the skin, muscles, cellular tissue, ligaments, and all the
viscera, except the alimentary canal, had disappeared, without
leaving a trace ; but the alimentary canal, from the throat to the
anus, along with the hair and the bare bones, was quite entire."
   But it is also maintained by some German writers that the pre-
servative influence of arsenic is not confined to the parts actually
in contact with it, but sometimes extends to the whole body ; and
Dr. Christison has quoted instances of the whole body, in animals
poisoned with arsenic, manifesting an unusually small tendency to
decay. But this point is not decided. The facts already men-
tioned show that the body often decays as usual, while the parts to
which arsenic had been actually applied are preserved ; nor are
those cases, in which the whole body remained entire, sufficiently
numerous to prove that the preservation was really produced by
arsenic, and not by accidental extraneous causes.        Dr. Christison
closes his account of the subject with the following remarks        :
" Whatever credit is given to the opinion of the German medical
jurists, in favour of the preservative power of arsenic, the English
medical jurist will not lose sight of the fact, that in many instances
the body in this kind of poisoning has been found long after death
in so perfect a state as to admit of an accurate medico-legal in-
spection, and a successful chemical analysis.      In one of his cases
Dr. Bachmann detected arsenic in the stomach fourteen months
after interment; and Dr. Borges had no difficulty in detecting it in
an animal after thirteen months."

                 Dr. Christison's Treatise on Poisons.               281
    Mercury.  — Dr. Christison   introduces his remarks on the detec-
 tion of corrosive sublimate in   mixed fluids, by referring to the ex-
periments of Berthollet, Orfila, Boullay, and Taddei, on the de-
composition of this poison by many organic substances. It is now
ascertained that various vegetable solutions convert corrosive subli-
mate into calomel, some producing the change rapidly, and others
after an interval of hours or even days.       Strong tea immediately
becomes turbid from this cause, when mixed with a few grains of
the poison, while infusion of galls acts only after the space of some
hours. Many animal principles produce the same change, some
acting instantaneously, and others slowly. Of the soluble animal
substances, albumen, curd, osmazome, and gelatine, possess this
property in an eminent degree, especially the former, which is
hence employed as an antidote to the effects of corrosive sublimate.
Fibrin, coagulated albumen, membranous surfaces, and generally,
the soft solids both in the dead and living animal, produce a similar
effect ;  and, in fact, the corrosive power of this poison depends on
the chemical action here alluded to.      Owing to this cause, death
may be occasioned by corrosive sublimate, and yet none of the
poison be found either in the stomach or in the substances ejected
from it. The chemist has therefore to search for decomposed as
well as undecomposed poison, the former existing in the state of
calomel in combination with organic matter.
   We    have premised these particulars in explanation of the pro-
cess recommended by Dr. Christison in cases of poisoning by cor-
rosive sublimate, in all of which cases the poison is necessarily
more or less subject to the decomposing agency of organic sub-
stances.    Dr. C. remarks that he " has experienced considerable
difficulty in fixing on a satisfactory process for detecting corrosive
sublimate, when it exists in mixtures of the kind now described,
and in such minute proportions as the medical jurist will generally
have to search for. I have satisfied myself that none of the me-
thods in common use are sufficient in these circumstances       ;
                                                                  — even
the otherwise well designed processes of Professor Orfila being in
some essential respects defective.       On the whole, the following
plan has appeared to me the most simple and the most generally
applicable.     It is a double process, of which sometimes the first
part, sometimes the second, sometimes both, may be required. The
first removes the corrosive sublimate undecomposed from the mix-
ture, which may be accomplished when its proportion is not minute;
the second, when the proportion of corrosive sublimate is too small
to admit of being so removed, separates from the mixture metallic
mercury; and the analyst will know which of the two to employ by
using protochloride of tin as a trial test in the following manner."
   "  A  fluid mixture being in the first instance made, if necessary,
by dividing all soft solids into small fragments, and boiling the mass
in distilled water, a small portion is to be filtered for the trial.   If
protochloride of tin causes a pretty deep ash-gray or grayish-black
colour, the first process will probably be successful if the shade
                                                         ;

   required is not deep, that process may be neglected, and the second
   put in practice at once."
      First branch of the process.   — In order to remove the corrosive
   sublimate undecomposed, the mixture, without filtration, is to be
   agitated for a few minutes with about a fourth part of its volume
   of sulphuric aether ; which possesses the property of abstracting
   the salt from its aqueous solution. On remaining at rest for half a
   minute or a little more, the aethereal solution rises to the surface,
   and may then be removed with a pipette. It is next to be filtered
  if requisite, evaporated to dryness, and the residue treated with
  boiling water upon which a solution is procured that will present
                  ;
  the properties characteristic of corrosive sublimate in its dissolved
  state.
                                     —
      Second branch of the process. If the preceding method should
  fail,  or shall have been judged inapplicable, the mixture is to be
  treated in the following manner.      In the first place, all particles of
  seeds, leaves, and other fibrous matter of a vegetable nature, are
  to be removed as carefully as possible.       This being done, the mix-
  ture, without undergoing filtration, is to be treated with protochlo-
  ride of tin as long as any precipitate or coagulum is formed.         This
  precipitate, even if it contains but a very minute proportion of mer-
  cury, will have a slate-gray tint.      It is to be collected, washed,
 and drained on a filter from which it is then to be removed with-
                            ;
 out being dried and care should be taken not to tear away with
                      ;
 it any fibres of the paper, as these would obstruct the succeeding
 operations.
     " The precipitate is next to be boiled in a moderately strong so-
 lution of caustic potash contained in a glass flask, or still better in
 a smooth porcelain vessel glazed with porcelain ; and the ebullition
 is to be continued till all the lumps disappear.        The animal and
 vegetable matter will thus be dissolved and on the solution being
                                              ;
 allowed to remain at rest, a heavy grayish-black powder will begin
 to fall  down in a few seconds. This is chiefly metallic mercury,
 of which, indeed, globules may sometimes be discerned with the
naked eye, or with a small magnifyer." The powder should then
be washed and sublimed in a tube, so as to obtain the metal in a
perfectly pure and characteristic state.
     " The second branch of this process is very delicate. I have
detected by it a quarter of a grain of corrosive sublimate mixed
with two ounces of beef, or with five ounces of new milk or porter,
or tea made with a liberal allowance of cream and sugar.             I have
also detected a tenth part of a grain in four ounces of the last mix-
ture, that is, in 19*200 times its weight."
    In a subsequent Number, we shall extract Dr. Christison's ac-
count of the action of natural waters on lead.

    Davenport's Supplement to " The Amateurs Perspective." 283
tourists, male and female and their published travels contain an im-
                            ;
mensely greater display of sketches and descriptive plates than here-
tofore and their private portfolios, of elegant drawings. The utility
        ;
of this practice is not ill appreciated in society; and the pleasure it
affords to the tourist and to the reader is very generally acknow-
ledged.    It is therefore somewhat surprising that the study of Per-
spective should prevail so little. Is it the fault of the books, the
teachers, or the scholars ? Is it the fear of the undertaking, or want
of perception of its value, that indisposes amateurs to undertake
this study ?     It must be acknowledged that some of our first mas-
ters have been careless of Perspective up to a certain degree ; but
the neglect appears in general in the subordinate parts only of their
pictures : still their inattention, even in this degree, has left an ex-
ample, which, being on the indolent side, is too readily followed by
artists of inferior talent ; and it deceives the eye and habituates it
to incorrect representation.
   Notwithstanding, however, this unperceived morbid habit, good
Perspective is always pleasing.      The untutored eye catches the ef-
fect, and perceives unexpectedly the resemblance to nature.        Who
is not delighted by the magic of the Dioramas ? But (without more
than mentioning those specimens of the art) who does not feel
pleased with a true representation of even the simplest scene, where
the surface of a road-side pond appears level and flat,     — where the
street in a country town appears to open to the spectator as though
he could trot along the hard ground where the boy's hoop seems ba-
lanced as it runs en the pavement? While, on the other hand, how-
ever finely a picture may be coloured, or however beautifully pen-
cilled a drawing, how lost is the effect when the artist has not taken
the pains to consider where his horizontal line is, or has not known
to what points his vanishing lines should tend    ! The spectator feels
at once, though he may not know why, that the figures appear not to
                        —
stand on the ground; that the two sides, whether of a cathedral or
of a cottage, look like one long face ;   — that the water slopes ; —  or
that even a round tub appears bigger on one side than the other.

   Perspective is the first requisite the sine qua non of picture.
Picture is the representation of space and bulk on superficies. It con-
sists in form, light and shade, and colour ; but form comes first,
Drawing. Now the form of one and the same object varies infi-
nitely, in the infinite variety of positions in which it is viewed; and
the representation of that form, according to that position, is Per-
 spective ; which, therefore, is the first essential of picture.
    The work to which the publication before us is called a Supple-
 ment, was noticed in the Phil. Mag. and Annals, N. S. vol. v. p. 127,
 with extracts from the Preface, giving an idea of its nature and de-
 sign, together with its table of contents.     A main part of the pro-
 fessed intention of the work appears to be to encourage the study
 of Perspective, by showing,   — that previous knowledge of geometry is
 not necessary to convince amateurs that the study requires no more
 knowledge or talent than is necessary to one who studies a map,
 tracing positions by the lines of longitude and latitude; and that not

 only the £$ec£ of their sketches but the facility b£ the time saved in
 taking them, will soon overpay the time employed in acquiring the
 theory and the practice  ; — that the hours spent in.the study will soon
 be compensated by the hours saved in the field by means of the

 possession of principles, and the knowing what to aim at.         In the
 conclusion of the former part, the author expressed himself as un-
 willingly breaking off, while some parts of his subject remained but
 partially treated of; leaving the intention of continuing the work,
 dependent on the reception his volume should meet with.
   In the Introduction to the present Supplement, he says, " Without
waiting for the result, he has considered such parts to be essential
 to the theory, and the work incomplete in its plan without the in-
 troduction of them."
    The Supplement begins with the Field of Vision, of which the
author gives a more complete theory than in the first volume, stating
more particularly the ground of its limits; and that those limits do
not subsist where other writers have placed them;        — showing also
why pictures, when reduced for the purpose of engraving, or other-
wise, will not produce the same perspective effect in the larger ori-
ginals, although the same proportions may be exactly maintained and  ;
showing also why, in small diagrams, the Perspective, though true,
will strike the eye as distorted. In the chapter on the Horizon-line,
he examines and in some measure opposes the theories of for-
mer writers, and maintains that the height of the horizon in the
picture " has no more to do with the height or width of the picture,
than it has with the thickness of the wood-frame in which the pic-
ture is placed."    He then illustrates his theory in a very clear man-
ner, by a series of wood-cuts, representing sea and ships with the
same outline and on the same scale, but as viewed from different
heights, and therefore with different positions of the horizon-line;
adopting a new term, and making a distinction between a high hori-
zon, and an enlarged sub-horizon or low base      ; and vice versa : and
this hitherto irregularly discussed theory, he appears to us to have
placed on a footing from which it is not likely to be removed. Mr.
Davenport afterwards contends, against the authority of almost all
his predecessors on this subject, that the prime vertical line must
be placed equally distant between the two sides of the picture; and
gives his reasons why the " prime vertical must cut the horizon-line
in its centre, though it is not necessary that it should itself be inter-
sected by that line in its own centre." He endeavours to give a phi-
losophical rationale of the causes of these and other apparent ano-
malies, and of the difficulties and deceptions that occur in pictorial
representation; such as the difficulty of dovon-hill views    ; — the de-
ceptive magnitudes of objects on very high edifices, as compared
with those at equal horizontal distances and, contrary to the most
                                            ;
generally received estimation, criticizes what he calls the deceptive
flfo-proportions of St. Peter's at Rome. He also gives some further
problems principally for the finding of distant vanishing points,
and notices the effect of the refraction of the atmosphere, of reflection
from the surface of water, &c. but we think that some examples

be desirable additions ; for althoughJt is divided into chapters, with
a title to each, and a running title at the top of the page, yet from
the necessary connection of the heads of the theory, reserved for
this volume, the details of the subject are introduced more than
once in some different points of view, and the reference from one to
the other    is not so easy as it ought to be.
    We subjoin, from the    Preface,  some remarks on the scientific cha-
racter of the late   Dr. Wollaston, which will, we think, be interesting
to our readers :
    " In a paragraph on mechanical aids, the inventor of the Camera
Lucida was alluded to in friendly jocularity. No recollection of him
can now occur without lament. A copy of the book was sent to him
from the country by the Author, who anticipated a smile at their
next meeting; useful criticisms on the treatise, and assistance in the
part that remains.      Indeed, one motive the Author had for pausing
where he did, was the hope of being thus furnished with more concise
demonstrations, and happier illustration of his theory.          Alas the
                                                                       !
days of his friend's smiles were past, and the hours that remained
were too valuable to be employed in the perusal of a work of such
minor importance. He is no more. He has vacated a department in
the philosophical world, which probably no man living can supply.

the things concerned ; and others, into Corollaries from the rest.
That which declared that the whole is greater than its part, has been
omitted as amounting only to an identical proposition, that the great-
est is greatest.'     And on the attempt to solve the vexata qaestio of
Parallel Lines, it is added, that the use made of motion or moving
                                    '
magnitudes in the 11th and 12th Books of Euclid, has been con-
sidered as sufficient for the introduction of a straight line that moves
along another straight line keeping ever at right angles to it without
                                                                 ;
infringement of the assertion in the title-page, that no new principle
has been introduced. But if this should not be conceded, the impu-
tation is still only on the correctness of the title-page.'
    The process by which the establishment of the Theory of Parallel
Lines is sought, is by demonstrating that if at the extremities of any
straight line, two other straight lines be drawn towards the same
side, equal to one another and making equal angles with the first
straight line or base, and their extremities be joined, the angles
opposite to the base shall be equal to one another, and the side op-
posite to the base shall be parallel to the base ; and subsequently
 endeavouring to prove, that if the angles at the base are right angles,
 the angles opposite to the base shall also be right angles.         After
 which, it would be easy to establish the equality of the three angles
 of a triangle to two right angles, and all the properties of parallel
 lines.
    The way    in   which this demonstration is pursued, is by trying to
 establish, first,   That if the equal angles at the base of the quadri-
 lateral figure are greater than right angles, the angles opposite to
 the base shall be less.     And this is done, by placing a number of
 such quadrilateral figures side by side so that their bases join, and
 proving that if these bases be severally produced, they shall cut off
 greater and greater portions in succession from the side of the first
 quadrilateral figure, and consequently, if the number of quadrilateral
 figures be increased, some of them shall meet the series of lines
 formed by the sides of the quadrilateral figures which are opposite
  to their bases  ;  from which, (and its having been previously estab-
 lished that in each of the quadrilateral figures the side opposite to
  the base is parallel to the base,) it is inferred that the sides opposite
  to the bases of the quadrilateral figures are not in one straight line,
  but make with each other an angle that is less than two right angles.
     It will be perceived that this contains the principle which was
  brought forward by M. Legendre in the 7th Edition of the ' Elements
  de Geometries for the purpose of proving that the three angles of a
  triangle cannot be greater than two right angles, and was subse-
  quently withdrawn in consequence of the imperfection of the proof
  of the other point required, viz. that they cannot be less. The only
  difference is, that the principle was there applied to triangles and;
  here it is applied to quadrilateral figures. The coincidence is noted
  in the Preface ; but with an intimation that the application to quadri-
  lateral figures was completed many years before the author had the
  opportunity of being acquainted with the other demonstration. And
  as the proof of this particular portion of the subject has been for a
                                                                        long

 long time before the public without being called in question, (the
 publication by M. Legendre being believed to have been as early as
 1815,) it may probably be set down as what there is no reason to
 dispute.
    What   is left  then to be determined, is whether the last author has
 been successful     in getting over the remaining step       ; or proving that
 it the equal angles at the base of the quadrilateral figure
                                                                    aveless than
 right angles, the angles opposite to the base (provision always in-
 cluded that the sides do not meet) shall be greater than right angles.
    With this view, his proceeding is directed to establish, that if two
 equal finite straight lines terminated in the same point, make any
 angle that is less than the sum of two right angles, and this angle
 be bisected by a straight line of unlimited length which may be
 called the axis ; and at the outward extremity of each of the two
 equal finite straight lines be added another straight line equal to the
first, having its extremity also terminated in the extremity of the
other, and making with it an angle equal to the first-mentioned angle,
and on the same side of the line; and at the outward extremity of
each of these, be added another straight line as before, and so on
continually and the extremities of every two equal straight lines so
               ;
successively added at one and the same time at the two ends of the se-
ries, be joined by a straight line or chord; each of these chords shall
make the angles at the two cusps, where it meets the equal straight
lines, equal to one another and (so long as none of the equal straight
                                 ;
lines meets the axis) the several chords shall in succession make
greater and greater angles at the cusp, each than the preceding.
This is done by the help of the inferences previously established
with respect to quadrilateral figures, and by joining the extremity of
one chord cross-wise with the extremity of the next, so as to make
one zigzag line which demonstrates almost by inspection the suc-
cessive enlargement of the angles. This is followed by a Scholium,
warning against the mistake of supposing that because it has been
proved that the angle will continually increase, it can therefore be
concluded that it will ever arrive at a certain specified magnitude
for evidence of which, reference is made in the Notes, to the well
known instance of the series        ^+^+ +  \ &c, in which the magnitude
of the sum goes on perpetually increasing, and yet never arrives at
being equal to double the first term. But this is stated to form no ob-
jection to examining the consequences which must result, if the
angle is ever found to arrive at a certain magnitude that may be
specified.
    The next     Proposition  is   to prove, that in a series of equal straight
lines like the last-mentioned, if the angle at the         cusp be ever equal
to, or greater than, half the      angle made by   the two  first equal straight
lines ; the angular points shall lie in the circumference of a circle,
whose centre is in the axis, in the part of it which is cut off by the
chord ; and the series, being continued, shall at length meet the
axis.    The demonstration, though lengthy when given with all the
forms, is such as will be easily supplied by any person in the habit
of geometrical solutions.
                                                                            The

288                  Notices respecting    New   Books.
   The next step is directed to demonstrate, that in a series of equal
straight lines as before, if a straight line of unlimited length both
ways, be moved along the axis in the direction which removes
it from the vertex, keeping ever at right angles to the axis ; such
straight line shall never quit or cease to meet the series, without the
series  having previously met the axis.       And the proof is rested on
the fact, that whenever this moving straight line passes through
the extremities of two of the equal straight lines of the series,
there must always be two more of the equal straight lines, making a
smaller angle with the chord on the side which is towards the axis,
than in the case that last preceded; and consequently the only possi-
bility there is for the moving line escaping from the series by finding
no more of the equal straight lines over which to pass, is by some of
these equal straight lines either making no angle at all with the last
chord, or falling on the other side of it. But to do either of these, the
angle at the cusp must previously have exceeded the magnitude which
has been held forward as involving the necessity of the angular points
lying in the circumference of a circle, whose centre is in the axis at
a point between the travelling line and the vertex. And as this tra-
velling line cannot have quitted or ceased to meet the series before
it has passed the point in which the series meets the axis; it is con-
cluded that if it be ever found to have quitted or ceased to meet the
series, the series must have previously met the axis.
   To these preliminaries, succeeds the Proposition, that if the angles
at the base of the quadrilateral figure be less than right angles, the
angles opposite to the base shall be greater than right angles. And
the process for proving this, is by taking a quadrilateral figure of the
kind in question, producing one of its equal sides in the direction op-
posite to the base for an axis, and placing on each side of it a num-
ber of such quadrilateral figures side by side, whose bases will form
a series of the nature described in the previous Propositions. After
which, the proceedings are directed to establish, that if a straight
line of unlimited length be supposed to move along the axis till it cuts
it in a point beyond the side of the quadrilateral figure which was
produced to make the axis, and thence be still further moved forward
in the same direction, it must do one of three things.      It must either
fall in with two of the angular points of the series, and there make
an angle at the cusp less than half the angle at the vertex or than
one of the angles at the base of one of the quadrilateral figures; or it
must make an angle at the cusp equal to or greater than this angle;
or it must be found to have ceased to meet the series altogether,
in which event it has been shown thn.t the series must have previously
met the axis. In the first of these cases, the demonstration is directed
to show, that the angles opposite to the bases of the quadrilateral fi-
gures cannot be right angles, because then the sides opposite to the
bases would be in one straight line, and there would be two straight
lines at right angles to the axis, meeting each other, which is impossible j
and that they cannot be less than right angles, because then they must
all lie on the other side of a perpendicular to the axis, and a fortiori
could never meet the other line.       And in the other two cases, refer-
                                                                       ence

                 Thompson's Theory of Parallel Lines.                    289
 ence is made to the preceding demonstrations to show, that the se-
 ries being continued must meet the axis, and the angular points lie in
 the circumference of a circle ; whence it is inferred, that the sides
 opposite to the bases of the quadrilateral figures must also meet the
 axis, and form an interior polygon to the series formed by the bases.
 From which it is concluded, that these sides cannot make with each
 other, angles equal to two right angles, for then they would be in
 one straight line, and this straight line, with the axis, would inclose
 a space j and, a fortiori, as before, they cannot make angles less
 than two right angles; wherefore they must make greater, or the an-
 gles of the quadrilateral figures which are opposite to their bases must
 be each greater than a right angle. In a Note, some reasons are
 advanced for believing, that the third of these cases, or that where
 the moving line is supposed to quit the series, might be got rid of by
 demonstrating, that the moving line must always pass through at
least one pair of cusps after passing beyond the extremity of the side of
the quadrilateral figure which was produced to make the axis j and con-
sequently that the other two cases may be made to include all that
in reality are possible.
   If all this is considered as established,   it is manifestly an easy step
to the demonstration that     if the equal angles at the base of the quadri-
lateral figure are right angles, the angles opposite to the base must
be also right angles ; and thence, that the side opposite to the base
must be equal to the base. After this it may be shown, that the
angles of any right-angled triangle must be equal to two right angles j
by completing a quadrilateral figure, which shall have the angles at
the base right angles.       And the same may be proved in any other
triangle,   by selecting a side that lies between two acute angles, and
drawing a perpendicular to it from the angular point opposite ; which
will divide the triangle into two right-angled triangles.
   If all this is supposed to hold good, the Proposition on Parallel Lines
commonly known as the Twelth Axiom, may be established in the
case where one of the angles is a right angle, by drawing a per-
pendicular from any point in the line which makes the angle less
than a right angle, to the line which intersects the two; and thence
establishing successive ranks of quadrilateral figures, of which all
the opposite sides may, from the past Propositions, be proved equal,
and all the angles right angles ; and showing that their diagonals
taken in an oblique succession shall all lie in one straight line, and if
the number of quadrilateral figures is continued, shall of necessity
cut the other line.     After which, the remaining case, or that where
neither of the angles is a right angle, may be solved by the assistance
of the first.
   As is intimated in the Preface, it is probable that Ihese demon-
strations, if no flagrant fallacy should be detected in them, may be
found capable of concentration and abridgement.

   That its decided utility in conferring just and distinct notions of
the physical and political relations of our globe must be obvious to
every one   ;  and is the more enhanced by this species of knowledge
being attainable without much difficulty, while at the same time it
affords a copious source of rational   amusement.
   That although there    is a vast store of geographical information ex-
isting in Great Britain, yet it is so scattered and dispersed, either in
large books that are not generally accessible, or in the bureaus of the
                                                                    public

public departments, or in the possession of private individuals, as to
be nearly unavailable to the public.
   The objects, then, of such a Society as is now suggested would be,
   1. To collect, register, and digest, and to print for the use of the
Members, and the public at large, in a cheap form and at certain in-
tervals, such new, interesting, and useful facts and discoveries as the
Society may have in its possession, and may from time to time acquire.
   2. To accumulate gradually a library of the best books on geo-
                                                            —
graphy—a selection of the best Voyages and Travels a complete
collection of maps and charts, from the earliest period of rude geo-
graphical delineations to the most improved of the present time ; as
well as all such documents and materials as may convey the best in-
formation to persons intending to visit foreign countries ; it being of
the greatest utility to a traveller to be aware, previously to his setting-
out, of what has been already done, and what is still wanting, in the
countries he may intend to visit.
   3. To procure specimens of such instruments as experience has
shown to be most useful,, and best adapted to the compendious stock
of a traveller, by consulting which, he may make himself familiar with
their use.
   4.  To prepare  brief instructions for such as are setting out on their
travels ;
           pointing out the parts most desirable to be visited j the best
and most practicable means of proceeding thither ; the researches most
essential to make ; phenomena to be observed; the subjects of na-
tural history most desirable to be procured ; and to obtain all such
information as may tend to the extension of our geographical know-
ledge. And it is hoped that the Society may ultimately be enabled,
from its funds, to render pecuniary assistance to such travellers as
may require it> in order to facilitate the attainment of some particular
object of research.
    5. To correspond with similar societies that may be established in
different parts of the world ; with foreign individuals engaged in
geographical pursuits, and with the most intelligent British residents
in the various remote settlements of the empire.
    6. To open a communication with all those philosophical and
literary societies with which Geography is connected; for as all are
fellow-labourers in the different departments of the same vineyard,
their united efforts cannot fail mutually to assist each other.
    The Meeting then proceeded to nominate a Provisional Committee
to consider and propose resolutions to be submitted to a General
Meeting.

   The Chairman then addressed the following observations to the
Meeting, explanatory of the general views of the Society         :
   The Geographical Society of London being now established, the
Provisional Committee cannot close its proceedings without advert-
ing to the gratifying fact of there being enrolled, on the List of its
Members, within so short a space of time, considerably more than
                                                                       four

                        Geographical Society.                      293
four hundred names.       From this great and increasing number,
and still more from the general character of the subscribers, it is
fair to conclude that a favourable opinion has been formed of the
utility likely to result fron* the labours of such a Society.      The
degree of utility, however, which will be really effected, the Com-
mittee deem it almost unnecessary to observe, must depend on the
attention and assiduity which the President, the Vice Presidents,
and the Council may bestow on its concerns, quite as much as on
the stock of knowledge they may bring to the consideration of the
several subjects that will come before them.         And not on the
Council alone will depend the extent to which the useful labours
of the Society are expected to be carried, but in a very great degree
also on the assistance which they may receive from the many indi-
viduals eminent in the arts, sciences, and literature, and from the
distinguished officers of the army and navy, whose names appear on
the List of Members.
   The many opportunities that are afforded to officers of the army,
while on service abroad, and the promptitude and ability with
which they avail themselves of them, (as the office of the Quarter-
Master-General and the Board of Ordnance so amply testify,) are
the best pledges of what may reasonably be expected from that
quarter and the more so since the Committee has had the satisfac-
         ;
tion to witness the readiness with which so many distinguished of-
ficers of the Royal Artillery and Engineers have come forward to
join the Society.
   With the same confidence the Committee look for aid from the
officers of the sister service, who on their own peculiar element
in particular, will, it is hoped, be assisted by other experienced
navigators, whether of and belonging to the Corporation of Trinity,
the East India Company, or to any other maritime service.           On
the exactitude of the minutest details of hydrography must always
depend the safety of commerce and navigation. Numerous dangers
unquestionably exist in various parts of the ocean, that have not
yet been ascertained ; while others that have no existence still figure
on our charts, to the dread of navigators. It has been well ob-
served, that " the man who points out, in the midst of the wide
ocean, a single rock unknown before, is a benefactor of the human
race;" and scarcely less so is he, who, after careful examination, is
able to decide that a rock or shoal, which appears on a chart, is
either misplaced, or has no existence.   —  These, it is true, may not
be ranked among brilliant discoveries; but the smallest obstruction,
whether rock or shoal, that exists in the ocean, may have been, and,
so long as its exact position remains unascertained, is still likely to
be 3 the cause of destruction to life and property. It may also be
noticed that many practical observations are still desirable on the
prevailing winds and currents, and more particularly on tides, of
which there are various peculiarities among the islands and along
the different coasts of the ocean, concerning which facts and ob-
servations are still wanting, for establishing one general theory that
shall be found applicable to every part of the globe.
                                                                 Every

294                     Geographical Society.
   Every accession, therefore, to hydrographical knowledge, a real —
                    —                                  —
danger discovered, a fictitious one demolished, or a peculiarity
ascertained, — must be of great importance to navigation, and a fit
object- for promulgation by the Society.
   The Committee, however, are also willing to hope, that many
valuable contributions on geographical subjects will be received
from other individuals, whether on the List of Members or not, than
those who are thus professionally qualified and invited to furnish
them particularly from such of their countrymen as have permanent
       ;
residences abroad, from the various public authorities in the British
colonies, and from those who have travelled, or may yet travel, in
foreign countries.   It is not for the Committee to specify in detail
the various points of information which should engage the attention
of the traveller; but they may observe that every species of infor-
mation, connected either with physical geography or statistics, if it
have only accuracy to recommend it, will be acceptable; and in
cases where the stock of information, generally, in the hands of any
individual, is not of sufficient magnitude or importance to form a
volume for publication, if sent to the Society, it will be made avail-
able, in some form or other, in its Transactions.         The routes, for
example, which travellers may have pursued through portions of
countries hitherto but imperfectly known, or inaccurately described,
—  the objects of natural history that may have presented themselves,
—  the meteorological and magnetic phaenomena that may have been
observed,  — the nature of the soil and its products, of its forests, rivers,
plains, mountains, and other general features of its surface; but
above all, the latitudes and longitudes of particular places which the
resident or traveller may have had the means of determining to a
                                              —
degree of precision on which he may rely; such notices of detached
portions of the earth's surface, when regular surveys cannot be held,
are of extreme importance, as furnishing the only means by which
anything approaching to correctness in our general maps can be
attained.    And the Committee cannot, therefore, entertain a doubt,
that it will constitute a part of the Transactions of the Society to
publish such detached pieces of information bearing on such of these
points, as may be thought of sufficient interest and importance to
be communicated for the use of its Members, and of the public at
large.
    There are many other means besides those now mentioned by
which geography may be advanced, but which are too numerous to
be here specified at length. In addition to the few, however, which
have herein been noticed, as well as in the printed prospectus al-
ready circulated, the following points may be briefly stated, as being
among the most important that will probably engage the attention
 of the Society :
    1. The composition of maps, illustrative of particular branches
 of geographical knowledge, more especially those relating to orology,
hydrology, and geology.
     2. The establishment of new divisions of the" earth's surface,
 formed upon philosophical principles, and adapted to different de-
                                                                  partments

                        Geographical Society.                         295
 >artments of science more especially as regards those divisions which
                      ;
 ire founded on physical and geological characters, on climate, and
on distinctions of the human race, or of language.
   3=  A  more uniform and systematic orthography than has hitherto
been observed, in regard to the names of cities and other objects;
and a more precise and copious vocabulary, than we at present pos-
sess, of such objects.
   4. The preparation and improvement of road-books for different
countries, of gazetteers, and of geographical and statistical tables,
and all such matters as are of general utility.
    The Committee cannot take upon itself to pronounce to which, of
so many important considerations as have been enumerated, the at-
tention of the Society should bejirst directed ; the order of prece-
dence must obviously, in some measure, depend on the means
rather than the wishes of the Council ; but the Committee are will-
ing to hope that, sooner or later, most or all of the subjects mentioned
will engage that attention of the Members to which they appear to
be fairly entitled ; and that the range of investigation will in no re-
spect be less comprehensive than the title of the Society implies.
   In making these observations, which have reference chiefly to facts,
the Committee wish, however, to guard themselves against any sup-
position, that might be entertained, of their being hostile to theory;
or of recommending to the Society to limit the reception of com-
munications to such only as are the result of actual observation and
experiment. On the contrary, they are fully aware that great benefits
have been, and may yet be, derived from speculative geography.
Theories that do not involve obvious absurdities or impossibilities,
but are supported by reasonable probabilities, may serve as guides
to conduct to important discoveries ; by exciting curiosity they sti-
mulate inquiry, and inquiry generally leads to truth. Reasonings
and suggestions, therefore, in regard to parts of the world deserving
of minuter investigation, which are little known, or of which no good
account has yet been given, the routes to be observed in examining
them, the chief subjects of inquiry, and best modes of overcoming
the probable difficulties that may occur in the research,      — all these
 will form proper subjects for admission into the proceedings of the
 Society.
    And lastly, The Committee having reason to think, that at no
 great distance of time, the Society will be able to obtain suitable
 apartments for the reception of books, maps, charts, and instruments,
 <hey would venture to suggest, that donations of such materials
 is may tend to the elucidation and extension of geographical science
would afford facilities to the attainment of its views. And they are
 willing to hope that, aided by such means, a library of books and
 manuscripts on geographical subjects, with a collection of charts and
 maps, may be formed, that will not be undeserving of public appro-
 bation and patronage.

 brown's microscopical observations on the particles
                              of bodies.*
MUNCKE, of          Heidelberg, finds the following a simple and easy
        mode  of showing the motions of particles    : — Triturate a piece of
gamboge, the size of a pin's head, in a large drop of water on a glass
plate; take as much of this solution as will hang on the head of a pin,
dilute it again with a drop of water, and then bring under the micro-
scope as much as amounts to half a millet-seed      :  there are then obser-
vable in the fluid small brownish yellow, generally round (but also of
other forms) points, of the size of a small grain of gunpowder, in
distances from one another of 025 to 1 line.            These points are in
perpetual slower or quicker motion, so that they move through an
apparent space of I line, in from 0*5 to 2 or 4 seconds. If fine oil of
almonds be employed in place of water, no motion of the particles
takes place, while in spirit of wine it is so rapid as scarcely to be
followed by the eye.     This motion certainly bears some resemblance
to that observed in infusory animals, but the latter show more of
voluntary action. The idea of vitality is quite out of the question.
On the contrary, the motions may be viewed as of a mechanical na-
ture, caused by the unequal temperature of the strongly illuminated
water, its evaporation, currents of air, and heated currents, &c.          If
the diameter of a drop is placed at 0*5 of a line, we obtain, by magni-
fying it 500 times, an apparent mass of water of more than a foot and
a half the side, with small particles swimming in it ; and if we consi-
der their motions magnified to an equal degree, the phenomenon
ceases to be wonderful, without, however, losing anything of its in-
terest.   Jameson's Journal, Julv 1830.
 VEGETABLE MILK OF THE HYA-HYA TREE OF DEMERARA.
   Dr. Christison has lately analysed this substance. Its principal
properties are the following : In the state in which it arrived in this
country, it consisted of a small portion of a clear watery-like fluid,
and a white concrete, cellulated substance, not unlike pressed curd,
which filled nearly the whole bottle. It had an odour somewhat like
that of cheese, with a slight peculiar aroma and scarcely any taste ;
the watery portion appears to contain a little acetic acid.         The con-
crete matter is of snowy whiteness, brittle and pulverizable when cold,
but easily softened by an increase of temperature. At 100° Fahr. it
becomes ductile and viscid, and does not recover its original firmness
and hardness for more than a day. At high temperatures it becomes
more fluid, the vapour is combustible with much flame and smoke.
Water cold or boiling has no action on this substance ; heated alco-
hol acts slightly on it.   Sulphuric aether dissolves it rapidly, leaving
only four per cent, of a soft viscid mass.
   From the preceding and other experiments, Dr. Christison con-
cludes that the juice of the hya-hya tree consists of a small portion

 of caoutchouc and a large proportion of a substance possessing in
 some     respects peculiar properties, which appear to place it interme-
 diate between caoutchouc and the resins, to the latter of which it
 bears the greatest resemblance. Dr. Christison suspects that it is not
 nutritive, and he observes that it differs totally from the juice of the
Palo di Vaca described by Humboldt as supplying the vegetable milk
 of the province of Caraccas in South America, as well as from the
juice of the papaw tree ; the solid contents of the former, from a late
analysis by Boussingault and Mariano di Rivero, appear to be a large
proportion of a substance analogous to fibrin, and a little wax and
sugar, while from the experiments of Vauquelin the juice of the
papaw tree contains two principles analogous to albumen and casein.

  PRECIPITATE OF CHLORIDE OF IODINE BY SULPHURIC ACID.
     Chloride of iodine (chloriodic acid) is, as is well known, very so-
luble in water    ;  but it was not till lately observed that it is readily
precipitated from solution by sulphuric acid this occurs when a great
                                                  :
excess of the acid is poured into the solution, and the chloride of
iodine precipitates unchanged.        M. Serullas, who made this experi-
ment, also mixed muriatic and iodic acids in proper proportions; and
he observed, that on pouring sulphuric acid into the watery solution of
this mixture, the iodine and chlorine precipitated in the state of chlo-
ride of iodine, whilst the other elements of the acids combined to form
water.
     It may perhaps be thought, from this experiment, that the solution
of chloride of iodine in water is a simple mixture of muriatic and
iodic acid ; but this opinion is inadmissible, because it is well known
that by means of aether all the chloride of iodine may be separated
from water,— Journal de Pharmacie, April 1830.
      BUTYRIC ACID IN URINE. EXISTENCE OF LACTIC ACID.
     M. Berzelius has informed M. Chevreul, that by treating urine
with sulphuric acid he has succeeded in separating butyric acid from
it :   he has also stated that lactic acid, which some chemists were in-
clined to consider as acetic acid combined with a peculiar matter, is
really a peculiar acid.     One of the experiments on which this opinion
is founded, is, that when ammonia is combined with lactic acid, and
the product is distilled, no acetate of ammonia is obtained, which
ought to happen if lactic acid were a combination of acetic acid.

                           FUMING NITRIC       ACID.
     In his laboratory, at the temperature of 14° Fahr.,   M. Mitscherlich
heated several pounds of fuming nitric acid, slowly, in a retort, the
neck of which and the receiver were cooled by a mixture of muriate
of lime and snow ; no gas was evolved, but the acid condensed in
the receiver consisted of two layers, the separation of which took
place after every mixture by agitation.        The lighter fluid boiled at
82 0, 4 Fahr. retaining that temperature until the last portion had eva-
porated ; its specific gravity was 1*445 ; it decomposed when mixed

properties of the    compound     of nitric   and nitrous acid discovered by
M. Dulong.
   The heavier fluid being     heated, its boiling point rose gradually from
S2 0, 4  to above 259° Fahr. as the distillation proceeded.
   This fluid is of an intense red colour like common fuming nitric
acid j it becomes colourless when about half of it has been distilled.
The product consists of equal quantities of a light and heavy fluid the   ;
latter has a sp. gr. of 1"539.        Common fuming nitric acid presents
similar results.
   It   appears from these experiments that fuming nitric acid is a solu-
tion of hyponitric     [hyponitrous ?] acid in nitric acid ; the latter is
capable of dissolving only about half its weight        ;   so that when com-
 mon fuming nitric acid is distilled, there are obtained a heavy fluid,
which is a saturated solution of nitrous acid in nitric acid, and a
lighter one, which is hyponitric [hyponitrous ?] acid.           Ann. de Chim.

                PREPARATION OF SUGAR FROM STARCH.
    M.   Heinrich says, that from one to two parts of sulphuric acid for
each 100 parts of potato starch is sufficient, if the heat applied be a
few decrees above 212° Fahr. and also, that then two or three hours
                                    :

 ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID UPON ZINC, AND CAUSES PRO-
                           DUCING ELECTRICITY.
    M. Arago    read a letter, dated May 9, to the French Academy, from
                                            1
 M. Auguste      Delarive of Geneva. This letter relates to the different
 subjects above named.
    " I had," says the author,      " been singularly struck with the enor-
 mous    difference which exists   between the action of diluted sulphuric
 acid upon the zinc of commerce, and the much less rapid solution
 which occurs when the zinc is purified by distillation. Having suc-
 ceeded by means of a very simple apparatus in measuring the quantity
 of hydrogen gas evolved in a given time by the action of diluted acid
 upon zinc, I endeavoured to determine what were the circumstances
 which rendered the evolution more or less rapid. The temperature of
                                                                            the

                 Intelligence   and Miscellaneous    Articles,         299
the liquid,   its degree of concentration, and the nature of the zinc, ap-
peared to me to be the three most important circumstances and after
                                                                 ;
having studied them minu-tdy, I arrived at the following results           :
1st, That the proportion of water and sulphuric acid, which occasions
the production of the greatest quantity of hydrogen gas by acting upon
zinc, is that in which acid of sp. gr. 1 848 constitutes from 30 to 50
per cent, by weight of the solution.         2ndly, That this same propor-
tion is that which, put into the voltaic circuit by means of a double gal-
vanometer, is the best conductor of electricity. 3rdly, That the dif-
ference observed to exist between distilled zinc and that of commerce,
appears to be owing to the foreign substances which are mixed with
the latter, and particularly iron, which occurs in greater or smaller
quantity. 4thly, That the influence of these heterogenous substances
appears to have an electrical effect, resulting from their mixture with
the  more oxidable     particles of the zinc."
   "  I  have made many experiments with different mixtures of dis-
tilled zinc, and filings of iron, lead and other metals, and I have al-
ways found that the distilled zinc, into which I had thrown one or two
per cent, of iron filings while it was melted, was of all, that which gave
the strongest evolution of hydrogen with diluted acid ; the zinc of
commerce alone produced as much under the same circumstances, the
chemical analysis of which showed that it contained a quantity of
iron perfectly similar to that of the artificial mixture.    That the influ-
ence of   this iron was   electrical, appears to be proved by many circum-
stances ; such as the relation which exists between the electrical con-
ductibility of the diluted acid and its action upon the zinc, the nature
of the action which the diluted acid exerts upon every mixture of zinc
and other metals ; and lastly, even the manner in which the effect of
these molecular currents may be excited, by inserting in the surface
of the distilled zinc a great number of small platina points, instead of
mixing it with other filings. 1    '
   " It appears to me, therefore, that there occur on the surface of the
zinc acted upon, a great number of molecular currents, which going
from each particle of zinc to each heterogeneous particle occurring in
the metal, traverse the acidulated water, and decompose it with the
greater facility as its conducting power is good, and produce that in-
crease of temperature which always results from the passage of elec-
tric currents through aliquid.        The order of the electromotive powers
of the different mixtures of zinc and heterogeneous metals, and the
intensity of the currents to which they give rise, form a series of facts,
serving to confirm the preceding explanation.''
    As to the causes which produce electricity, M. Delarive observes " I:
 have ascertained that contact alone, unconnected with any efficient
 cause, cannot by itself occasion electricity, either in the form of cur-
 rents or in that of tension. Independently of the processes which I have
 already described, I have employed others, such as using condensers
 of different kinds, and condensers placed in different media; and if
 by this last process I have arrived at results which differ frum those of
 M. Pfaff, it is, as I have ascertained, because the smallest quantity of
 moisture remaining in the air or in a gas, occasions a chemical action

upon    the zinc surface of the condenser, and consequently produces
(whatever M. Pfaffmay say) an electrical effect, the nature of which
always corresponds with what ought to occur, according to the che-
mical theory.       I have not confined myself to negative experiments,
although their number and agreement gave me the utmost confidence
in them    ;  but 1 have endeavoured also to discover such as would yield
positive results.     In this way I have obtained signs of electricity,
under circumstances in which according to the theory of contact I
ought not to have procured the slightest trace. 1 will give an example
of this  :   In each end of a cylinder of wood from ten to twelve centi-
metres long, and from one to two in diameter, I inserted a plate of
zinc terminated externally by a brass end, which was soldered to it ;
holding in my hand the brass end of one of these plates, I touched the
condenser (also of brass) with the brass end of the other. According
to the theory of contact, I ought not to have obtained any sign of
electricity, the two plates of zinc with brass being opposed and united
by an insulated piece of wood, serving as a conductor from one to the
other.      Nevertheless, one of the ends of the wooden cylinder being a
little more damp than the other, I obtained signs of electricity, the na-
ture of which always agreed with the slight chemical action arising
from the contact of the well cleaned zinc with the damp wood. These
signs were positive, if I held the brass end of the plate inserted in
the least damp end of the wood.         In order to succeed in the experi-
ment, the wood must be slightly moistened         ; the humidity which it
acquires in moist air is quite sufficient ; care must be taken to keep
one of the ends drier than the other. It appears to me impossible, as
I have endeavoured to show in my memoir, to reconcile this fact, when
carefully    examined in all its details, with the theory of contact."
   M.   Delarive, while he denies that the contact of two heterogeneous
substances can be the cause of developing electricity, admits that it
may   often be a necessary condition.      As to the real cause, it is always
either
    Physical, as heat.    M. Becquerel   has given, he observes, a complete
and satisfactory analysis of   this cause in his last memoir upon thermo-
electrical currents;    —  or
   Chemical. M. Delarive has already shown in his preceding memoirs,
how he regards this kind of action ; or  —
   Mechanical. There still remains, the author observes, much to be
done, in arranging according to general principles the mechanical
processes for exciting electricity, such as friction and pressure.        He
has already had occasion to make a considerable number of observa-
tions relating to friction.    When rubbing, he says, a very dry finger,
a cork, or a piece of wood, upon a piece of metal, of a cubic form, for
example, placed upon a condenser, electrical appearances of astonish-
ing intensity are developed, which are sometimes negative and some-
times positive.      The nature of the electricity depends upon the kind
of metal, its figure, temperature, the manner in which it is rubbed,
whether upon an edge or a face ; the nature of the rubbing body,
which should always be an imperfect conductor, has but little influ-
ence.     M. Delarive states, that in all his experiments he carefully
                                                                      avoided

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.          301
avoided placing the metal in immediate contact with the condenser,
putting a very thin plate of ivory between them.
    M. Delarive has also announced an important fact. He has ascer-
tained that the transmission of electricity from one conductor to an-
other varies sensibly, according to the direction of the current that is
                                                                   ;
to say, for example, that positive electricity passes more readily from
copper to zinc, than from zinc to copper. The discovery of this fact
serves to explain many phenomena hitherto regarded as anomalous.
The author states that lie was led to this discovery by the obser-
vations of M. Fourier relative to the passage of heat through sub-
stances according to the order in which they are arranged.       Le Globe,

                      ATMOSPHERIC CARBONIC ACID.
    M. Thdod. De Saussure      has made numerous experiments to deter-
mine the variations of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, and published
them in the memoirs of the Physical and Natural History Society of
Geneva. The following results are extracted from the Bibliotheque
 Universelle for June 1830.
    The carbonic acid was absorbed by barytes water, and the carbo-
nate precipitated was estimated to contain 22 per cent, of carbonic
acid.     The experiments were made at Chambeisy, about three quar-
ters of a league distant from Geneva, and 16 metres above the level
of the lake;      10,000 volumes of air contain 4*15 of carbonic acid, as
the mean of 104 experiments made day and night and at all seasons
of the year; the air was taken four feet above the ground ; the great-
est quantity of carbonic acid was 5*74, and the smallest 3*15.
    An increased quantity of rain appears to diminish that of the car-
bonic acid, either by dissolving it or in causing the soil to do so ; a
litre of fresh rain-water, which did not render lime-water turbid, gave
in summer, by an hour's boiling, 20*5 cubic centimetres of air, which
contained 13 46 of azote, 673 of oxygen, and 0'31 of carbonic acid
                 -
                                                                           :
and it appears from a very elaborate set of experiments, that the quan-
tity of carbonic acid is generally larger as that of the rain is smaller ;
—   thus in June 1827, the quantity of rain was 9 millimetres, and that
 of the carbonic acid 5- 1 8, in 10,000 of air; while in September 1829,
the rain was 254 millimetres, and the carbonic acid only 3"57 volumes
 in  10,000 of air.
    It  was found that during the night the quantity of carbonic acid
was greater than that of the day in the proportion of 4°32 .to 3*98
but if the wind be strong, then scarcely any difference occurs. The
 greater quantity of carbonic acid occurring in the night is attributed
 to the want of decomposition which occurs by vegetation during the
 day.
    A   short frost and which does not penetrate the earth to more than an
 inch, does not appear to cause   any variation in the quantity of carbonic
 acid but when the frost continues long, the dryness which it occa-
       ;
 sions increases the proportion.     In the beginning of January 1829,
 the ground was lightly covered with snow, and the quantity of carbonic
 acid increased to 4    57; towards the end of the month      it thawed  for
                                                                     several

                           *&     and Miscellaneous    Articles.
several days, and the acid was then reduced to427. At the beginning
of February the frost recommenced, and in the middle of the month
 the ground was frozen to the depth of eight inches      ; the carbonic acid
 rose to 452, it then thawed and the acid was reduced to 3*66.
    The mean result of numerous experiments showed that the quantity
of carbonic acid in 10,000 of air was less when taken over the lake of
Geneva than at Chambeisy in the proportion of 4*39 to 4*60.
    It was also found that the variations in the quantity of carbonic
acid dependent    upon season and night and day, occurred also in the
air  taken over the lake.
    On comparing the quantity of carbonic acid found in the air of Ge-
neva with that of Chambeisy, the former was found to be greater in
the proportion of 4*68 to 4*37 ; these were the mean results of many
experiments. It was also found that the quantity of carbonic acid is
greater during day in the city than in the country, that the variations
occasioned by the seasons are analogous, and that the quantity of
carbonic acid increases more by the influence of night in the country
than in the town.
    On comparing the quantities of carbonic acid found in the air of the
plains with that of the mountains, it was observed that the latter con-
tained the most this difference is explained by the consideration that
                  ;
the decomposition of the acid occurs principally where vegetation is
most abundant, as it is in the plains, and that the gas is absorbed by
the earth there, because it contains more rain-water.        It appears also
that the night has but little influence in increasing the carbonic acid
of the   mountain    air.
                        ARSEN1URETS OF HYDROGEN.
   M. Soubeiran     concludes from his experiments on these compounds,
that in  the present state of science only two arseniurets of hydrogen
are  known   ; one   is  solid, and is composed  of
                         Arsenic                97 416
                          Hydrogen                2-584
                                               100-
These proportions are considered by M. Soubeiran as equivalent to
1 atom arsenic + 2 atoms hydrogen          ; but if the atom of arsenic be
38 and that of hydrogen 1, then it will be constituted of one atom of
each this is the hydruret of arsenic. The other compound is gaseous,
       ;
and is composed, according to M. Soubeiran, of 1 atom of arsenic-f 3
atoms hydrogen     j   or
                         Arsenic                  96*18

                                                100-
   If however the atom of arsenic be reckoned 38, then arseniuretted
hydrogen gas consists of 2 atoms arsenic 76, and 3 atoms hydrogen 3.
   This gas is always the same by whatever process it may have been
procured, except an admixture of hydrogen. It is best prepared and
with the greatest certainty by acting with acids upon arscniuret
                                                                          of

of zinc prepared by fusion.           The  alkaline oxides, especially in the
state of hydrate, are converted       by arsenic into hydrogen, metallic ar-
seniuret, and into arseniate or arsenite.         The deposit formed by the
slow action of the air, or that of chlorine on arseniuretted hydrogen,
is not hydruret of arsenic as has been supposed, but metallic arsenic
when the arseniurets of tin and zinc are treated with acids, no hydru-
ret of arsenic is formed, but they leave a residue of super-arseniuret,
unattackable by acid.        Journal de Pharmacie, June 1830.
               PREPARATION OF BICARBONATE OF SODA.
    M. Creuzberg      has found a ready mode for the manufacture of this
salt, in   the circumstance that the dry alkalies absorb carbonic acid
much     more quickly than when in solution. Carbonate of soda is there-
fore deprived of     much    of its  water by efflorescence, and  is then sub-
jected to a current of carbonic acid gas until the bicarbonate is formed ;
the time when this takes place is rendered evident by the evolution of
heat,   and the exhalation of water, which is deposited in drops upon
the interior of the vessel.        Bibl. Univ., Roy. Inst. Journ.
           ANALYSIS OF MUSTARD-SEED. BY M. PELOUZE.

existence of sulphur in the essential oil of mustard.             MM. Henry
jun. and Garot found among other principles a peculiar acid, which
they called sulpha- sinapic acid.
    After showing that the substance upon which these chemists ope-
rated, could not be pure on account of some atomic discordances
in the compounds it is stated to have formed with various bases,
M. Pelouze maintains that the acid is merely the hydrosulphocyanic

that the sulphur which the seed contains does not exist entirely in this
 state, but also uncombined ; for when the seed is boiled with potash,
 acetate of lead shows the presence of sulphuret of potassium.
     Hydrosulphocyanic acid (or rather sulphocyanic acid) may be ob-
 tained from the seed by the direct action of dilute sulphuric acid upon
 strong decoctions of it, but the quantity is small. The following is
 given by M. Pelouze, as the composition of mustard seed :

      ON SALICINE.        BY MM. PELOUZE AND JULES GAY-LUSSAC.
     Salicine, a peculiar vegetable      compound obtained from the bark of
 the willow, is a perfectly white body which crystallizes in acicular
  prisms. Its taste is very bitter, and partakes of the aroma of the bark
  itself. One hundred parts of water at 68° Fahr. dissolve 5-6 parts. In
                                                                            hot

hot water its solubility is much greater, and in boiling water it ap-
pears to dissolve in any quantity.        It is also soluble in alcohol ; but
aether and the essential oils do not dissolve it, except perhaps the oil of
turpentine.
   Sulphuric acid poured upon salicine, assumes a very fine red colour,
perfectly resembling that of bichromate of potash ; with nitric and
muriatic acids it forms colourless solutions. It is not precipitated from
its solution in water by tincture of galls, by gelatine, acetate or sub-
acetate of lead, alum, or tartarized antimony.
   When boiled with excess of lime water, it does not saturate it.
Oxide of lead is not dissolved by it. At a few degrees above the tem-
perature of boiling water it melts, and on cooling becomes a crystal-
line mass; it loses no water during this operation.            If the heat be
much greater than that of its melting point, it becomes of a lemon
yellow colour, and as brittle as a resin.

a gas entirely absorbable by potash. The mean of two careful analyses

   SULPHATE OF BARYTES FORMING A VEIN IN CANNEL COAL.
       To  the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
          Gentlemen,
   1 was a few weeks since presented with a mineral composed of
sulphate of barytes and carbonate of lime, found in a cannel pit, on
the estate of the late Duke of Bridgewater, known by the name of
Water-gate Pit ; which is situated in the township of Middle Hulton,
about two miles south-west of Bolton, Lancashire.
   This mineral is found running through the cannel in the form of a
vein, about an inch thick    :  it is crystallized sulphate of barytes, irre-
gularly mixed with transparent crystals of carbonate of lime ; to the
outides a quantity of iron pyrites is attached ; its specific gravity
varies  :  some fragments, when freed from pyrites, are of the specific
gravity 4'63, others are as low as 4*19.
                                                                       I have

                       LAW OF PATENT INVENTIONS.
Extracts from the Evidence taken before the Select Committee of the
   House of Commons, on the Law relative to Patents for Inventions,
    1829 ; being the Statement made by Mr. Farey respecting Mr. Woolfs
   and Mr. Watt's Patents for Steam-engines; with Additional Facts
    in Support of that Statement.
                        [Continued from   vol. vii. p. 157.]
    (P.  32 of the Report.)     Do you   consider that the term of fourteen
years is sufficient in all cases?   —   By no means. In the case of Mr.
Woolfs invention of working steam-engines by high-pressure steam
acting expansively, (either in one or in two cylinders,) there was no
profitable exercise of that invention for at least ten years out of the four-
teen ; and there was so much loss incurred at the first, that the profit
made during the last four years did not repay the loss during the first
period. (P. 33.) The extension since given to that invention is so im-
portant, that the existence of deep mining in Cornwall at this moment
 depends upon it. The difference in cost between the quantity of coals
 consumed by the engines now in use (which are all on Mr. Woolfs
 system), and by an equal force of engines such as were in use before he
 went into Cornwall in 1813, would absorb the profit of all the deep
 mining that is now carried on in Cornwall. I think Mr. Woolf is
 more entitled to a public reward for the services he has rendered,
 without any recompence, than any inventor who has ever been re-
 warded by Parliament.
     (P. 136.) It would be a very good measure to reserve a portion of
 the revenue derived from the granting of patents, to accumulate and
 form a fund for the purchase of valuable secret inventions, like Mrs.

Knight's, which are not likely to be disclosed by the inducement of
any patent law however complete 3 and also to reward individuals
like Mr. Woolf, whose inventions have not come into use during the
terms of their patents, but have afterwards become of national im-
portance.
    Would you     not in the latter case rather   recommend an extension
of the term of the patent    ? — Not  in all  cases.   If the inventor has
brought his invention to such perfection, that others, by merely copying
what he has done, can practise it as well as himself, it would be best
to throw it open. Mr. Woolf's was such a case ; the engines made on
 his system by others, since the expiration of his patent, have performed
 as well as those made in the same interval by himself, and have even
 obtained a preference in some places      :  hence the public would pro-
bably have gained nothing by confining it longer in his hands ; but
now that he is seen to be left quite unrewarded for his long exertions,
the circumstance, added to others of a similar nature, is very discou-
raging to men capable of making similar improvements ; and I am of
opinion that the public would gain by giving him a handsome reward.
 In other cases where there are not many persons capable of taking up
 the new subject, its progress will be greatly promoted by continuing
 the patent, because that compels the patentee to continue his exer-
 tions to extend the practice.     That was Mr. Watt's case. If he had
 abandoned his engine to the public at the time his first patent would
have expired, there was then no other person competent to go on with
 it, and give it that additional perfection which he attained during the
prolongation of the term.
     (P. 140.) Do you believe that many useful inventions would never
 have been prosecuted to the public advantage, if they had not origi-
 nally been worked under a monopoly ?     —  Mr. Watt's steam-engine may
 be quoted as a great example. At the time Mr. Watt made his inven-
tion in his own mind, in 1765, he was not a maker of steam-engines ;
 and none of the makers of that day had sagacity enough to see the
 value of his discovery before he had made an engine ; nor would any
 of them have prosecuted his plan before it was proved, even if he had
 made them a present of the invention, much more to give him any
 thing for it hence he had no means of making any profit from his
              :
 invention, or any prospect of repayment for the great expense and
 labour necessary to bring it to bear in practice, unless he could have
 secured it to himself for a long term. (P. 141.) The history of Mr.
 Woolf's invention is very similar, with the difference that Mr. Watt
 having through Mr. Boulton obtained an extension by Act of Par-
 liament, he acquired a large fortune during the prolongation. Whereas
 Mr. Woolf's patent expired before the actual outlay had been re-
 payed ; so that he is left a real loser by his invention. The previous
 inventors of steam-engines, Mr. Savery in 1698, and Mr. Newco-
                                      —
 men in 1710, were similar cases; they lost money.
     (P. 174.) Mr. Watt's invention, and the perfection he gave to it
 during the operation of this Act of Parliament, has proved of more
 value to the nation than can be calculated ; probably as much as the
                                                                 inventions

 inventions of Lord Dudley for smelting iron by pit-coal in 1619, or as
 those of Hargrave, Arkwright and Crumpton, for spinning machinery,
 about the same date as Mr. Watt.         Dudley and Hargrave were not
 encouraged, but were persecuted, and their works destroyed by mobs           :
 after Dudley's death his process lay dormant during a century,
 probably for want of support to him. These great inventions have
 had a close connection, and each one has promoted the progress of
 the other very greatly.
    (P. 191.) Mr. Watt's     is the most striking case amongst that very
 few where the inventor has been protected in his patent rights, for an
 adequate length of time, to enable him to perfectly establish his in-
 vention, and consequently recompense himself from the use of it.
The great perfection which Mr. Watt attained, and the very general
 use into which he brought his steam-engines, for a great variety of
applications, was entirely owing to that protection ; and it is certain
 that the public would not have been benefited anything like so much,
if his patent had not been prolonged by Parliament.           Messrs. Boulton
and Watt realized large fortunes by the patent. In addition to their
profits as engine-makers, they took one-third of the annual savings in
fuel made by their engines, compared with Newcomen's atmospheric
engines performing the same work          ; that produced them a great
revenue from Cornwall, where coals are dear, and the engines for
draining mines very large and numerous.
   The steam-engine is an invention from which the nation has de-
rived immense wealth during the last century, and increasing means
of wealth for the future.      After the enunciation of the principle of
action had been made by De Caus in 1615 and by Papin in 1690,
the real inventors of the engine have been, Savery in 1698, Newco-
men in 1712, Watt in 1769, Trevethick in 1802, Woolf in 1804,
and Fulton, in America, in 1807. Of these Mr. Watt is the only one
amongst us who has derived any adequate advantage or recompense
for his labours.    Mr. Woolf 's failure of a recompense was entirely
owing to the want of protection by an extension of his term ; for his
engines came into very general use in Cornwall soon after the expira-
tion of his patent, in place of Mr. Watt's engines ; and with such great
advantage in economizing fuel, that Mr .Woolf would hav been amply
recompensed if his term had been made as long as Mr. Watt's was.
           Additional Facts relative   to Mr. Woolf s Invention.
   The specification to Mr. Woolf's patent of 1804 * claims the im-
provement of working steam-engines by high-pressure steam, acting
expansively, either in one or in two cylinders, and describes the
structure and mode of operation of engines of both kinds.            It was at
   * Printed in the Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxiii. p. 335. The system of
working expansively with steam of the ordinary atmospheric elasticity was in-
vented by Mr. Watt, who had a patent for it in 1782 ; he proposed to do it
in one cylinder, and executed it with success.      Mr. Hornblower proposed
to do the same in two cylinders, and had a patent in 1 784 ; but that plan did
not in practice prove so advantageous as Mr. Watt's with one cylinder, and
never came into use.

that time quite a    new      proposal, but the general opinion of engineers
was very unfavourable         to it.
    In the course of four or five years, Mr. Woolf made a few small
rotative engines in London, some with two cylinders, others with one,
but he met with no encouragement, and lost much money ; until 1811,
when he had brought his small rotative engines, with two cylinders, to
such perfection, that on a well attested            trial of a nine-horse engine
 and corn-mill, it ground \7\ bushels of wheat by the consumption of
 one bushel of coals      ;    and on a repetition of the trial, nearly 20^
 bushels.      Mr. Watt's rotative engines of that power will not do
 half so much.
    From that time there has been a demand for Mr. Woolf's rotative
 engines with two cylinders, and a great number have been made ; they
 have answered very well, and on an average consume only half as
 much fuel as the average of Mr. Watt's engines, exerting the same
 power. About 1813 Mr. Woolf obtained encouragement in Corn-
 wall, and went to reside there          :  his partner Mr. Edwards continued
 the business by himself in London. In 1815 Mr. Edwards took out a
 patent in France, and sent over some engines, which were so much ap-
 proved that he was induced to remove to Paris, where he has since
 made a great number of Mr. Woolf's engines. Also about the time
 that Mr. Edwards went to France, Mr. Hall began making Mr. Woolf s
 rotative engines with two cylinders, at Dartford, and has executed a
 great many excellent engines ; most of them have been sent to France,
 where Mr. Woolfs engines are very common, and are greatly pre-
 ferred to any others. Mr. Hall continues the business on an extensive
 scale.
    Mr. Woolf's first engines for pumping water from mines were set
 up by him in 1814 at Wheal Abraham and at Wheal Vor mines in
  Cornwall they had each two cylinders
             ;                                        : their performance far ex-
 ceeded that of any steam-engines ever made before.                   In the latter
 half of 1815, the two engines raised on an average 48 million pounds
 of water one foot high, for every bushel of coals they consumed.

 of its performance were made by Mr. Farey, with the steam kept up to a
 greater elasticity than usual, and acting with a greater extent of expansion
 than usual ; it then raised 65-22 millions, on the average of two trials of
 eight hours and six hours each       : that was the greatest effect ever produced
 by steam, until November 1827, when Woolf's engine at the Consolidated
 mines raised 67" 10 millions, on the average of the month's working.
     The steam cases for the cylinders of these engines were exposed to the

    To  estimate the improvement thus effected by Mr. Woolf, by him-
self alone,   without aid from any other engineers, and whilst he was
opposed by many, the performance of the engines previously used in
Cornwall must be examined.
    Mr. Watt first introduced his engines into Cornwall in 1/78, in
place of Newcomen's atmospheric engines, which had been introduced
there about fifty years before, but had never raised more than eight
or nine millions. Mr. Watt did twice as much with his first engines,
and three times as much, after he had applied his method of working
expansively, for which he had a patent in 1782.           It consists in stop-
ping the supply of steam from the boiler to the cylinder, when the
piston has only moved through a portion of its course, leaving it to be
impelled through the remainder, by the expansive action of the steam
already admitted into the cylinder, without any further expenditure
of steam from the boiler.
    Mr. Watt proposed in 1782 to work his engines by stopping the
supply of steam when the piston had only moved one-fourth of its
course, leaving three-fourths of the course to be performed by the ex-
pansive action   ;  and although the force exerted by the steam during
that expansion must continually decrease, nevertheless 2-^ times
more power would be exerted on the whole than would be exerted
by the same steam, if it acted without expansion. But it was found
 that such an extent of expansive action could not be realized in prac-
 tice, because the steam used by Mr. Watt, when expanded to fill a
 quadruple space, becomes too feeble to impel a piston with effect.
     Mr. Watt never retained the steam in his boilers much above the
 pressure of the atmosphere ; they were always supplied with water
 through upright pipes, open at top to the atmosphere, and the lower
 ends immersed beneath the surface of the water in the boilers ; the
 open ends of the feeding pipes being only eight feet high above that
 surface, the steam could not by any chance be retained in the boiler
 beyond 3-£- pounds per square inch more elastic than the atmospheric
 air  : that was Mr. Watt's practice, and his successors in business at
 Soho still continue it. The term low-pressure steam can only with
 propriety be applied to the steam produced by such boilers.
     Mr. Watt's engines with such boilers cannot be made to exert a
  competent power to drain deep mines, unless the supply of steam to
 the cylinder is continued until the piston has run through more than
  half its course ; and on an average in practice, low-pressure steam is
  only expanded so much as to fill one and a half time the space it
  occupies in the cylinder, at the moment when the supply was cut off:
  even with that moderate extent of expansive action, the steam will
  exert nearly one half more power than would be exerted by the same
  steam acting without expansion, as it must do if the supply from the
  boiler to the cylinder were continued until the piston terminated its
  course.

310              Intelligence     and Miscellaneous    Articles.
   Mr. Watt's engines, well constructed and well managed, will raise
twenty-five millions for an average.            They are still the only engines
used in London for water-works, and in many districts for draining
mines    ;  they were the only engines used in Cornwall in 1814, when
Mr. Woolf set up his first engines there. Under favourable circum-
stances, such as having little work to do, keeping up the steam as
strong as can be retained in the boiler without overflowing the feeding
pipes of eight feet high, and working with the utmost extent of ex-
pansive action that those circumstances will allow, using good coals,
clean water, plenty of cold condensing water, and the boiler, cylinder
                                                  —
and steam-pipes being properly clothed, a well constructed engine
of Mr. Watt's may raise thirty-two millions          ; but that is the utmost,
and cannot be maintained in regular working. On the other hand
a number of engines working incessantly at deep mines, under ordi-
nary management and average circumstances, will not reach twenty
millions, as is shown by the following account of the average per-
formance of the engines in Cornwall in 1813 and 1814, when they
were all worked on Mr. Watt's system of low-pressure steam acting
expansively in one cylinder.

   In 1813 the highest performance attained by the best engines on
Mr. Watt's system        did not reach thirty millions, and the performance
of  all the engines averaged less than twenty millions          ;   but in 1829,
when     all  the engines were worked on Mr. Woolf's system of high-
pressure steam acting expansively in one cylinder, the best of those
engines averaged seventy-six millions, and the whole number (being
more than twice as many as in 1813) averaged forty-one millions.
   The great cause of the superiority may be thus explained Mr.             :
Woolfs engines are worked by high-pressure steam, which is retained
in the boiler to      an elasticity of between twenty-five and forty-five
pounds per square inch more than the atmospheric air. Steam of
that elasticity may be expanded to fill between five and eight times
the space      it occupied   when     first admitted from the boiler into the
cylinder    ;  and yet it  will   have a sufficient force to impel the piston
with as much effect, during all that great extent of expansive action,
as can be done in Mr. Watt's engines when the expansion is only
from one space into two         :  hence Mr. Woolf's system renders the ex-
pansive action available to a greater extent than can be done in Mr.
                                                                           Watt's

Watt's system.          There are other concurrent causes          for the great
superiority, but that      is the principal cause.
   In his specification of 1782, Mr. Watt proposed to use steam equal
to the atmosphere, with a far greater extent of expansive action than
he or his successors have been able to realize in practice ; and so Mr.
Woolf in his specification of 1 804 proposed to carry the expansion of
high-pressure steam to a far greater extent than has ever been exe-
cuted by himself or others*.
   When Mr. Woolf began, it was a             common    notion that mere varia-
tion in the elasticity of the      steam employed could no way affect Mr.
Watt's invention of expansive working, and that the use of high-
pressure steam, as proposed by Mr. Woolf, could never be advan-
tageous. Such notions continued current, until he proved their fallacy
by the great performance of his engines but he did not attain that
                                                   :
proof without exertion ; for the difficulties of carrying his invention
into effect were very great, and cost him some years of uninterrupted
labour and great expense to overcome them.                He encountered much
active opposition from those who had made up their minds on his first
proposals ; and their unfavourable opinions prevented him from getting
orders for any large engines until 1813.
    The value of the improvement which Mr. Woolf made in the per-
formance of engines, before his system was adopted or countenanced
by other engineers, may be stated as follows. In 1814 the average
performance of the twenty-nine engines that were reported, was
20-37 millions, and their consumption of coals was 100,2563 bushels.
The   price of coals being at that time \4~cl.         per bushel, the cost of
coals   was £60,570 per annum, or £2088 per annum               for each engine,,
 on an average.
    The average performance of Mr. Woolf's engines at Wheal Abra-
 ham and Wheal Vor, during the three years and a half above cited,
 was 42 08 millions, or more than double the average of all Mr.
           -
 Watt's engines in 1814 hence if all those engines had been replaced
                               :
 by engines such as Mr. Woolf had then made, more than half the ex-
 pense of coals would have been avoided, being a saving of £29,300
 per annum to the mine adventurers            ; or at the rate of full £1000 per
 annum saved in working each engine, on an average of the whole
 number, each engine exerting about forty-horse power.
    The expense and complication of Mr. Woolf's engines with two
 cylinders being found objectionable, he altered an old Watt's engine
 at Wheal Abraham in 1816, to work by high-pressure steam, with an
 increased extent of expansive action, in one cylinder              ; and the im-
 provement in its performance proved that two cylinders are not
    * If it is represented as a failure, that Mr. Woolf did not accomplish all
 that he anticipated in 1804, still that is no reason for overlooking what he
 did accomplish by himself in 1811 and 1815, or how much he then surpas-
 sed all that had been done before nor can any such imputation of failure
                                        :
 justify the omission of his name by those writers who undertake to state
 the extension that has been given to Mr. Watt's discovery of expansive
 working, by using high-pressure steam ; for that extension is not due to Mr.
 Watt   in   any part, but to Mr. Woolf   entirely.
                                                                         essential

essential to the successful practice of his system*.    He altered another
old engine at  Wheal   Unity, by adding a small cylinder to it ; the per-
formance was improved in about the same degree as that of the old
engine with one cylinder.
    In 1816 an entire new engine was made at Dolcoath mine, by
Messrs. JefFery and dibble, to work with high-pressure steam acting
expansively on Mr. Woolf's system, in one cylinder of seventy-six
inches diameter ; it answered extremely well, although it never did so
much as the engines with two cylinders had done, whilst they were new
and in good order but as they materially fell off in 1 SI 7 and 1818,
                     :
when they got out of order, and as the Dolcoath engine kept up to a
steady performance of about forty millions, the use of one cylinder for
Mr.Woolf s system obtained the preference and in a short time after
                                                ;
Mr. Woolf's patent expired, most of the old Boulton andWatt's engines
in Cornwall were altered to work by high-pressure steam on his sy-
stem some few had an extra cylinder added, but commonly the old
        :
cylinder was retained. The advantage of the change from low-pres-
sure to high-pressure steam, on Mr. Woolf's system, was manifest
 in all cases ; but it was greater or less, according as the steam was
 used stronger, and with more or less expansive action.
    All the new engines since erected in Cornwall have been made ex-
 pressly to work on Woolf's system, and always with one cylinder,
 excepting one instance of two cylinders.        In 1820 Mr. Woolf made
 two engines for the Consolidated mines, each with one cylinder ninety
 inches diameter   ; but as neither of those, nor the Dolcoath engine,
 ever did so much as the engines with two cylinders had done at first,
 Mr. Woolf still felt inclined to prefer his original plan. Accordingly
 in 1824, having undertaken to make two large engines at Wheal
 Alfred, he prevailed on the adventurers to go to the expense of
 making one of them with two cylinders, of forty and seventy inches
 diameter, the other engine being the same as those at Consolidated
 mines, with one cylinder ninety inches diameter ; both engines were
 worked with high-pressure steam. The performance in 1825 aver-
 aged 4001 millions with two cylinders, and 42*15 with one cylinder:
 this was considered decisive against two cylinders f and no engines
                                                           ;
 have since been made in Cornwall either by Mr. Woolf or others,
 except with one cylinder, to work on his system.
     The performance of those engines was very slowly and gradually
  increased, as appears by the following annual averages of the highest
 performances that are to be found amongst them each month. Until
  1826 their performance remained below that of the first engines with
  two cylinders in 1816, which then averaged46*97 millions. Previous
     * The same fact had been ascertained years before, in respect to Mr.
  Watt's system of working expansively by low-pressure steam; for Mr.
  Hornblower, who practised that system in two cylinders, did not succeed so
  well as Mr.Watt himself, who only used one cylinder.
     f The engine with two cylinders had boilers on a complicated plan which
  did not answer well, and the other engine had very good boilers. If both
  engines had been worked with equally good boilers, the two cylinders would
  have made the best performance.

   The advance made in 1827, and since that time, has been effected
by good management of the engines, chiefly by clothing all the steam
vessels, and thus preventing any needless waste of heat by radia-
tion, also by using better boilers *$ but the engines are strictly accord-
ing to Mr. Woolf's system of high-pressure steam acting expansively
in one cylinder.
   Great credit is due to Captain Samuel Grose, who began the race
of improvement in management            ; first in an engine which he made at
Wheal Hope in 1825, and still more in another which he made the
next^year at Wheal Tovvan, with an eighty-inch cylinder ; in 1827
it averaged 58* 18 millions, its highest being 62*22 in July.
   At the end of 1827 Mr. Woolf removed the ninety-inch engine
before mentioned at Wheal Alfred (that mine having ceased work-
ing) to the Consolidated mines, and by good management and
clothing it raised 64*42 millions on the average of the last three
months, the highest being 67' 10 in November.
   In 1828 Captain Grose brought the annual average performance
of Wheal Towan engine to 77*29, the highest being 87*05 millions
in April f.     Mr. Woolf's engine averaged 62*57, and its highest was
67*56 millions in May. These striking examples stimulated the ex-
ertions of all the Cornish engineers to take the same care in manage-
ment, and with such success that the average of all the engines in
1829 was 41*22 millions; although in 1814, before Mr/Woolf's
system was begun, it was only 20*37, or less than half. The number
of engines and the power exerted by them is more than doubled,
whilst the quantity of coals       consumed by them is sensibly lessened.
   The importance        of such  an increase of power from the same fuel,
to the success of mining in Cornwall, may be estimated by the follow-
ing account of the Consolidated and United mines, which are worked
by one company of adventurers, and form the largest mining esta-
blishment in existence.
   The United mines are worked to a loss, and are only kept drained

 to about one-third of their depth, in order to cut off      some water which
 would otherwise flow into the Consolidated mines. These mines have
 been more productive during the last seven years than the average
 of mines in Cornwall.       The following particulars are collected from
 the accounts which have been printed annually in a series of reports
 by Mr. John Taylor, and from the monthly reports on the engines.
    The Consolidated mines recommenced working in 1819, after ly-
 ing drowned for fourteen years, and £65,000 was advanced by the
 new adventurers to bring them into operation. During the years 1819,
 1 S20 and 1821, the expenditure exceeded the returns by £74,078
but during the years 1822, 1823 and 1824, arprofit of £51,561 was
made.
    At the end of 1824, £10,000 more was subscribed to continue
 the United mines, which were given up by their original proprietors.
The   capital to be repaid to the adventurers at the beginning of 1825,
including interest then due upon the several advances, was £55,382.
During the last five years, the Consolidated and United mines together
have produced a profit of £63,604, whereby all the capital subscribed,
together with interest upon it, has been paid off, and an actual gain
was made in 1829, in addition to the value of the stock of materials
on the mines.
    The total expenditure in all the eleven years, has been £824,585,
and the returns £865,672       : hence the profit beyond the repayment of
the capital subscribed has been £41,087 in eleven years ; or interest
at five per cent, per annum being allowed on the sums subscribed until
the periods of repayment, the clear gain is stated in the printed ac-
counts to be only £10,244 to the adventurers*.
    The expense of draining the water from both mines, as stated in
the annual accounts of the last five years, has been decreasing each
year from £\7,776 to £1 1,958 per annum ; although the monthly re-
ports on the engines show that the number of engines has been in-
creased from four to eight, and the power exerted by them increased
from 432 to 513 horse power. The cost of drainage has averaged
£13,826 per annum. The average performance of the engines has
been improved from 31 04 to 5 1 '81 millions, during the last five years,
averaging 39*36 millions, being more than double 19*38 millions,
which was the average performance of Mr. Watt's engines in 1813,
when Mr. Woolf went into Cornwall j therefore if such engines were
now used at the Consolidated mines, the expense of drainage might
be expected to average (£13,826 X 39-36 -~ 19 38 =) £28,100 per
annum, or £ 4,274 more than it has been and it is that saving which
              1                                   •
has constituted the whole of the profit made during the last five years.
    During the last five years the mines have produced 73,561 tons of
    » This does not include any valuation of the materials in use in the
mines although the cost of all materials is included in the amount of total
       ;
expenditure. The materials would sell for a large sum, but that can scarcely
be reckoned as a part of the profit, because from the uncertainty of mining
prospects a mine cannot be given up in time to realize it     : the working is
usually continued at a loss until a debt is incurred, and when the adventurers
become too much discouraged to make further advances, the mine is given
up, and the materials sold to pay the debt.
                                                                        copper

 copper ore, which on an average has yielded about 9^ per cent, of copper
 and36| tons of tin ore. The ores have been sold for £548,872, of which
one twenty-fourth has been paid to the lord of the soil as rent. T lie-
 total cost of working the mines has been £462,444 ; leaving a clear
profit of £63,604.
    The above is but a limited view of the advantages arising from the
 use of Mr. Woolf's engines for if the mines had been begun in 1819
                                 ;
 with Mr. Watt's engines, the loss during the first years would have
been considerably greater than it was, and the mines would have
continued to be unprofitable for a longer time than three years ; also
the subsequent profit would have been so much smaller than it has
been, that it would not have repaid the previous loss (and interest
upon the capital advanced) for a long time to come, beyond the present
date, supposing the mines to continue to yield ore.             In fact if these
mines could have been worked with profit by Mr. Watt's engines,
they would not have been given up as they were, twenty-five years
ago, when they were not worked out so deep, or so extensively, as
they are now.

   The last column of the table shows the saving that has been made
by the use of Mr. Woolf's engines, or the increase in the cost of
drainage that would have been incurred by using Mr. Watt's engines,
raising twenty millions, instead of the engines actually used           : those
savings are included in and form part of the profits ; and without them
the extra expense would have absorbed more than all the profit in
1825, 1826 and in 1829        ; so that instead of profit, the adventurers
would have lost £5655 in 1825, £689 in 1826,and £2863 in 1829.
Or taking the whole of the last five years, no profit would have been
made ; and it would have been more advantageous to the adventurers
to have broken up their establishment, and sold the materials, than
to have continued working.
    In conclusion, it may be safely asserted that the saving in fuel re-
sulting from the general use of Mr. Woolf's system of working steam-
engines by high-pressure steam acting expansively (instead of Mr.
Watt's system of working them by low-pressure steam acting expan-
sively), constitutes the present profits of deep mining in Cornwall.

                                     AURORA BOREALIS.
    In the evening of the 20th, between 8 and 9 o'clock, a bright light
appeared in the northern horizon, and continued to rise and fall till
 twenty minutes past 9, when it occupied a space of 75 degrees;
 and  at this time the first           column of light, being thin and of a flame-
 colour, rose from       its   ba^e nearly under Polaris, and was followed by
 many other columns from half to 3 degrees in width, some of
 which ascended upwards of 30 degrees. About 10 o'clock the
 greatest display of coruscations happened, when eight or ten distinct
 columns of light, nearly equidistant from each other, appeared at one
 view, and several small meteors showed themselves above the aurora,
whose approach was indicated immediately after sunset by a fine rose-
colour in the northern horizon, the same as the last was on the 19th
 of last April.      During its continuance for three hours, the sky was
                         At immersion,        in or  under the horizon.
                                                                                           perfectly

                Meteorological Observations for August 1830.                                        319
    General Observations.           — The      first part of the month to the 8th was fine
and dry, and the latter part alternately dry and showery. From the 8th
to the loth the weather was generally wet, which retarded the wheat
harvest in this neighbourhood for a few clays ; but it was afterwards got in
well, and all the barley and oats will be carried in the first week of Sep-
tember. From a perusal of the reports from all parts of the country re-
specting the harvest, it appears that the wheat crops in general have
turned out excellent in quality and abundant in quantity beyond the most
favourable expectations ; and the barley and oat crops that have been
carried in the southern parts of England, have yielded to the growers an
extraordinary quantity, and are far superior in quality than for several
years past. The same cheering account holds good with respect to Ireland
and Scotland, which is somewhat surprising when we reflect upon the
low temperature, and the uncommon vicissitudes of weather we have ex-
perienced this year         :
                              — but what necessary benefits cannot an All-bountiful
Providence confer on man in clue season ?
   Sheet lightning occurred in the evenings of the 4th, 17th, and 18th;
and a thunder-storm passed over at 2 P.M. on the 13th, with forked light-
ning, which in the black nimbus, on which the sun shone brightly, had a
grand appearance.
   Early in the mornings of the 20th, ^21st, and 30th, slight hoar frosts
appeared in the grass-fields, which is rather unusual in August.
   The mean temperature of the external air this month is about 3| de-
grees under the mean of August for many years past.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one lunar and three solar halos, nine meteors,
an aurora borealis; and eight gales of wind, cr days on which they have
prevailed, namely, one from the South-east, six from the South-west, and
one from the West.

XLVI1I.         On the Problems of the Calculus of        Variations.
     By Hugh Ker Can k hi en, Esq. M.A. Trin.            Coll.  Cam-
    bridge.*
HPHERE          are few students who do not find difficulty in the
 •*-
       study of the calculus of variations.     This does not arise
so much from their want of familiarity with the notation made
use of, since this is nearly the same as that of the differential
calculus, but rather from their not having a distinct view pre-
sented to them at the outset, of the necessity for, and the ob-
ject of, the several operations performed.         It will hardly be
denied that this is a fault of the method of Lagrange, when
applied only to the solution of the more simple problems.
His investigation contains the solution of the difficult as well
as the easier problems, and consequently a great part of the
process is unnecessary for the solution of the latter. For these
reasons it is here attempted, with the assistance to be derived
from M. Poisson's solution of the problem of the brachysto-
chron, contained in the first volume of his treatise on Me-
chanics, to give first a solution of the easier problems, -and
then to show how far this solution is applicable to the more
difficult, and in what way the solution of these may be com-
pleted.
     The object proposed is to investigate the relation which
the variables involved in a proposed function must have to
one another, in order that a definite value of this given func-
tion shall be a maximum or minimum.             The most common
form in which this function is proposed, is the integral taken
between limits of an expression containing the variables
themselves and the differential coefficients of one of them
considered as a function of the other.        The limits are some-

322                Mr. Cankrien on              the Problems           of
times invariable, and sometimes variable the problem of the     :
brachystochron is an instance of one or other of these two
classes of problems, accordingly as we investigate the line of
quickest descent from one given point to another given point,
or from one given curve to another given curve.                                  .
   If then  Y=f(x, y         9 p,   q, r,  &c.) where       p     =   -£. ; q  -.JL ;r
 = -—; &c. U = ;           «  +fdxY',           « being an arbitrary constant;
and   U/— U    ;/
                   be the value of            U  between the limits x ty t \ x uy           tl
                                                                                               :
our object   is   to find the relation           between x and j/, which ren-
ders U, —     y/
                  a maximum or minimum either when xt yft xu yu

are invariable, or when they are variable and connected by
given equations yt         =    <J> (*,), y u   =  ty (x„).
   Now it is to be observed, that if we can determine the form
of the function F (x) in the equation y                    —    F (#), which renders
U,— \Jj! a maximum or minimum, when the limits are invari-
able ; we can also find it by the same process, when the limits
are not assigned, but when equations only are given connecting
them: for we may suppose that the symbols x^^ x n yjft which
represented the limits which are supposed invariable in that
process, now represent those values of the variables in the
equations y /    =   <p (.r,), y n    =   rj/ (x^) which must be taken as the
limits of the integral in order that                  U— /         /;
                                                                       shall be a maxi-
mum    or minimum.              The only difference in the results we
shall obtain in the two cases will be this                    :   when the limits are
assigned, we can substitute their given values for the symbols
Xj Vm x n y lP and thus find determined values for one or more
of the constants in the equation y                 =   F (x) ; whereas when we
have not the values of the limits assigned, those constants
which may be expressed in terms of these symbols will con-
tinue arbitrary, unless we have some method of determining
the values of the limits.               We      will then for the present con-
sider the limits of the integral not to change.
   We   supposed        U=        u  +fdxY          when the function of x re-
presented by y is involved in V: if y                  =                       U—
                                                              F (x) then / \Jn is
the maximum or minimum value oifdx V when taken between
the limits x / y / and x u yu .           Let u be any function of x which
vanishes when xt or x n is substituted in it for x ; and letk be
a very small constant quantity ; also let                   W     be the value of a +
fdxY when y + k u           is   substituted in      V for y.          Then    W —W;         7/
is greater or less than \J / —JJ // according as                           U —U
                                                                             ;       rj
                                                                                         is  a
minimum or a maximum, whatever be the function u.                                      Now,
when y + h u       is  substituted for          y in p f
                                                           it   becomes p      +   k  —=

   This equation contains one arbitrary constant |S and if the           :
order of the highest differential coefficient in V be n, there will
in general be 2 n arbitrary constants in the primitive equa-
tion between x and y.               These are to be determined by means
of the limits and other data which, according to the case,
must be granted for that purpose. But if the limits are not
given, the constants which are expressed in terms of the
symbols representing them, must remain arbitrary, as was
observed above.               Our object then, in order to complete the
solution in this case, must be to determine the actual values
of the limits which these symbols represent.

their being involved in                    U, and partly in consequence of the
change of x into x t and x a respectively wherever x occurs

U, and then substituting x + 8 x for x, and afterwards chang-
                                       t
ing x and 8x into xl and 8 a;, in the result.                                      In like man-
ner we may find a> //} or the value, of U,, when x/ + dx / and

in U, and then substituting x + 8x for x, and afterwards
changing x and 8 a? into x n and lx /t                           .    All these substitutions
are to be made not only where x / and x u occur alone, but
likewise where they occur involved in the functions y t and y n                                  .
In like manner since the operation of substituting x                                   +  8 x for
x in    U   is equivalent to the substitution of x / + 8 a, for x /9
when a? / is obtained ; and equivalent to the substitution of
x n + lx u for x JP when <ojj is sought; it is evident that in one
case y must be considered as the same function of x that yt
is of x)\ and in the other y must be considered the same
function of x that y n is of x u                         .
   Since we only want those terms which are multiplied by the
first powers of 8 a;, and \x

what follows only to that extent.                                We      will also use 83/, to
denote the term multiplied by 8 a:, in the new value of 3/, ob-
tained by substituting a;, + 8 a;, for x, in it.                                In like manner
ly n denotes the term multiplied by 8 a;,, in the new value of
yu when a*,, + 8 a;,, is substituted for x u in y n and ly denotes           \
the corresponding term when a; + 8 a; is substituted, for x                                  my

   Now, if         U    contain x / y / x n y lfl and we substitute x / -f 8 x/
for a:, and a;„-f 8a;„ for a;,,, the new value of                         U    thus obtained is

XLIX. Remarks             on a Passage in Dr. Thomson's " Outline of
   the Sciences of Heat         and Electricity " London, 1830. By the
   Rev. B. Powell, M.A. F.R.S., Savilian Professor of Geo-
   metry, Oxford.*
   N   looking into the volume lately published by Dr. Thom-
    son on Heat &c, my attention was immediately drawn to
the chapter on radiant heat, as being a subject on which I
have been particularly engaged. And I cannot but feel in-
debted to the distinguished author for the notice he has been
pleased to take of my researches on this subject: though at
the same time I trust he will allow me to make a few remarks
on the mode in which the mention of them is introduced.
The passage referred to is as follows
   "The conclusions from the observations ofDela Roche
have been called in question by Mr. Powell.                          He admits
that when a hot body becomes luminous it gives out heat
capable of passing directly through transparent screens. But
this new heat acts more on a smooth black surface than on
an absorptive white one. From this he concludes, that it is
different from common radiant heat.                     We    have no evidence
that it is the same as light.            It is great from red-hot metals,
though the light be feeble.                 It exists in the solar rays,
and is what produces the photometrical effect in Leslie's
Photometer.          But this ingenious explanation of Mr. Powell
has, I think, been obviated by a very happy and instructive
experiment of Mr. Ritchie," &c. &c. p. 156. Then follows a
description of Mr. Ritchie's experiments in detail.
   Now to a reader not previously acquainted with the sub-
                           *  Communicated by the Author.
   N.S. Vol.     8.    No. 47. Nov. 1830.                   2  U            ject,

330 Rev. B. Powell's Remarks on a Statement by Dr. Thomson
ject, it would certainly appear, from this whole passage, as if
my investigations    had consisted merely in making objections
 to De la Roche's    conclusions, and suggesting another expla-
nation of his facts; and that this explanation had been sub-
 sequently opposed by the experiments of Mr. Ritchie, and, in
the opinion of the author, invalidated by them.
    Such, it appears to me, is clearly what the language of the
passage would imply. And if so, I must be permitted to say,
 the impression conveyed is very erroneous.
    In the first place, as to my own researches, I have only
 to hope, that, in order to form a fair judgement of them, the
 reader will take the trouble of referring to the Phil. Trans.
 1825. Part i., and 1826. Part iii., where he will perceive that
 my conclusions are advanced as the result of experiment, and,
 as such, bear the character of demonstrated fact. If they are
 to be refuted, it must be by pointing out some fallacy in the
 experiments, or by exhibiting others more accurate and satis-
 factory in opposition to them ; and this, as far as I am aware,
has not yet been done. If the facts be admitted, the explana-
 tion of De la Roche's results, and indeed of numerous others,
follows as a necessary consequence.
    I was very much surprised, that, in the passage referred to,
 the experiments and conclusions of Mr. Ritchie should be de-
 scribed as contradictory to mine, and invalidating my explana-
 tion of De la Roche's   ;  when in fact, they do not even refer to
 the same subject as mine, except only on one subordinate point
and that, one which has no reference to De la Roche's re-
 searches.
    In the main portion of my experiments, what I have stated
respecting glass screens is certainly proved only for screens
 of ordinary and sensible thickness.        If an exception were
 found when an extremely thin screen is employed, it would
 not interfere with the conclusion in other cases.
    Such an exception has been contended for by Mr. Ritchie,
 on the ground of some very delicate experiments. I failed
in verifying his conclusion.      He objected that my trial was
not sufficiently delicate; and adopted the ingenious variations
upon his method which Dr. Thomson has described, confirm-
ing his original conclusion.      Here this subordinate question
rests.    We   have at present only to state the general law of
non-transmissibility, with this single exception in the case of
infinitely [indefinitely ?] thin screens.

        cently appeared, in a " Selection of Facts," illustrative of
the Geology of Devonshire, which has been inserted in the
Rev. T. Moore's new " History and Topography" of that

lication, will necessarily limit the circulation of that work to
certain classes of readers and many persons who may take an

interest in the natural history of Rock-basins, might not ex-
pect to find a discussion upon it in the pages of a County
History.        On these accounts, the author ventures to repub-
lish his inquiries on the subject, in the form of a separate
memoir, with such corrections and additions as subsequent
reflection and reading have suggested.
     Mr. Moore, in a chapter of his work which is allotted to
the subject of the original population &c. of Devonshire, has
entered at large into the history of Druidism, as having been
the religion of the Danmonii who were either the aborigines
                                     ;
or the early Belgic invaders of the south of Devonshire.           In
commencing this history, he enters into an examination of
the proofs " that the Druids abounded in Devonshire, and
were particularly conversant with Dartmoor and its vicinity,"
which have been conceived to be found in the existence of
the Cromlech, Logan-stones, Rock-basins, and similar ob-
jects, upon Dartmoor and in the surrounding tract.              After

332                Mr. Brayley,       Jun., on the alleged
thus supposed to be afforded, he makes the subjoined remarks
on Rock -basins:
    " Some of the rock -basins may be excavations produced by
natural causes, but the form of others is much too regular,
and affords indications of design which leave no room to
doubt of their being artificial ; nor is it easy to imagine from
what their origin could be derived, if not from Druidical su-
perstition.      The notion of Dr. Macculloch and others, that
rock-basins have been formed by the action of water, air and
frost on the softer parts of the stone in all instances, seems
to be entirely unfounded; for, if such were the case, how
comes it to pass that they are found only on the tops of the
tors, and sometimes on the logan-stones? This, if the writer
is not mistaken, is a singular fact, and tends to strengthen the
 idea that these tors and logan-stones were appropriated by
the Druids to their religious rites.           If the basins were exca-
vations produced by natural causes, why are they not found
on numerous other rocks and in different situations? This
circumstance, in conjunction with their regularity and the pe-
 culiar form common to many of them, seems to leave little
 room   for scepticism*."
    An   impression, however, had been made upon the mind
of the present writer, by Dr. Macculloch's arguments on this
subject f, and confirmed by the observations he had enjoyed an
opportunity of making on the very spot regarded by Dr. Bor-
lase as having been the grand centre of Druidical worship,
                                     —
 Carnbrea Hill, in Cornwall which was left unshaken by the
perusal of the foregoing remarks.              He conceived, therefore,
that he should be liable to the charge of indifference to the
interests of scientific truth, were he to refrain, when mention-
ing the Rock-basins of Devonshire, from stating and con-
 firming the conclusions at which Dr. Macculloch had arrived.
 While, on the other hand, to leave those remarks unnoticed,
 might have seemed culpable inattention to the opinion of his
 friend and coadjutor Mr. Moore.               Accordingly, in a section
 of the work allotted to the mineralogical characters, struc-
 ture, and external configuration of the granite of Dartmoor,
 he introduces the following examination of Mr. Moore's views,
 succeeded by some further remarks on the geological history
 of the subject.
     The regularity of form of the rock-basins, which is ad-
 duced, by Mr. Moore, as a proof of their being artificial, is

                  Artificial Origin     of Rock-Basins.                     333
a consequence of the tendency of the action which produced
them, to extend itself equally in every direction; which " the
uniform texture of the granite" (to which, merely, it is ascribed
by Dr. Macculloch,) would necessarily permit it to do*. Mr.
Moore also brings forward, as militating against the truth of
Dr. Macculloch's explanation, the facts that the rock-basins
" are found only on the tops of the tors, and sometimes on the
logan-stones :" and, resuming this argument, he inquires, " If
the basins were excavations produced by natural causes, why
are they not found on numerous other rocks and in different
situations ?"      In reply to this it may be stated, that, in the
granite of the Scilly Islands, and in the millstone-grit of Ash-
over in Derbyshire, (which is associated with the coal-mea-
sures, and belongs, consequently, to a very different group of
rocks,) these basins do actually occur on the perpendicular
sides of the rocks.         That they should be sometimes found on
the logan-stones, is also a consequence of their origin from
natural causes; since the same action of the elements, which,
operating on the angles and edges of the blocks of granite,
                                  —
has produced the logans which Mr. Moore had before cor-
rectly remarked " are clearly inartificial,"           —  operating on their
exposed surfaces, has formed rock-basins. Hence, it w ould                T
be remarkable indeed, if rock-basins were not sometimes found
upon logan-stones.
    An instance has already been cited of the occurrence of
rock-basins on other species of rock besides granite.                   It may
be mentioned, in addition, that there are deep cavities of this
description on the horizontal and on the slightly-inclined sur-
 face of the magnificent mass of schorl-rock at Roach, in
 Cornwall     ;  in many of which the present writer has found
 grains of quartz and fragments of crystallized schorl, resulting
 from the action that produced them; which is a circumstance
 parallel to that related of the rock-basins in granite, by Dr.
 Macculloch. It may also be useful to remark, in further ex-
 planation of the process by which these cavities, in whatever
 rocks they occur, appear to have been formed, that, on the
 declivities of Roach rocks, where the water could not lodge,
 it has worn deep channels, instead of producing basins.
    * The tendency of the action which has produced rock-basins, to extend
 itself equally in every direction, might, it is true, be counteracted, in direc-
 tions perpendicular to the sides of a cuboidal block of granite, upon which
 basins were forming; by a varying resistance to disintegration, originating
 in an internal concentric structure in the rock.         But this counteraction
 would merely have the effect of preventing the depth of the basins from
 being equal to their diameters ; and would tend, rather, to increase, than
 to diminish the regularity of their form.      Further remarks on this subject
 will be found in p. 336.
                                                                            How

    How   far the   Druids, or other sacerdotal orders among our
more remote      ancestors,    may have appropriated these results
of atmospheric action to their own purposes,              —  how far it may
be true of the officiating Druid, that,
                   "                   to wondering crowds
                And ignorant, with guileful hand he rocked
                The yielding Logan"    —
is a  distinct  question   ;  and one into which it is unnecessary
here to enter.
    But the writer has found that other antiquarian friends
are unwilling to resign, altogether, that notion of the origin
of these excavations, which, in the hands of Dr. Borlase and
his compeers, has given rise to so imposing a pageant of the
ceremonies of Druidism They are still desirous of attributing
                                :

          That  crest the grove-crowned    hill  he scooped, to hold
          The  lustral waters."f
 It may   not be out of place, therefore, to state briefly the re-
 sults  of an examination, made in the autumn of the year
 1825, of the rock-basins upon the tors or earns which crown
 the summit of Carnbrea Hill, near Redruth, in Cornwall
 the granite of which is part of the same formation as that of
 Dartmoor.
    This examination         verified every part of Dr. Macculloch's
 statement, with the exception that the sides of the basins did not
 appear to be crumbly ; while several minor facts were ascer-
 tained, which, though not adverted to in Dr. Macculloch's pa-
 per, are nevertheless entirely confirmatory of his opinion. Thus
 it was found that wherever the form of the cavity, and the di-
 rection and inclination of the surfaces of the rock, were such
 as to have admitted the water to remain for the longest space
 of time, in those situations the basins are always deeper than
 in others ; and that where the water has escaped from one
 basin to another situated below it, a passage has been worn,
 which in some cases has nearly converted the two basins into
 one.    In one instance, the thickness of an immense slab of
 granite, much resembling that which Borlase calls the " Sa-
 crificing  Stone," having on its upper surface six or seven
 rock-basins, has been cut through in several places; and the
 continuation of the process which formed the basins will
 eventually divide the slab into several blocks.                In this man-
 ner many of the basins have been destroyed, by the process
  which originally produced them.               The   side of one basin has

 been completely perforated, while its edge has been left entire,
 forming an arch which extends over the aperture. Basins of
 every size, and of every stage of formation and destruction, may
 be found on almost every earn. The water, collected from the
 rains, in the basins on the so-called " Sacrificing Stone," as
 it flows from the upper into the lower cavities, is manifestly
 wearing for itself a course which, in process of time, will com-
 pletely unite all the basins into one great irregular cavity.
    These circumstances are clearly indicative of the natural
 process, still going on, by which these curious excavations
 have been produced, and by which also they will eventually
 be destroyed. But perhaps the most palpably-undeniable
 evidence that they cannot have been artificially formed, ma}'
be found in the circumstance, which Dr. Macculloch has not
mentioned, that many of the rock-basins on Carnbrea are
 crossed by the veins of porphyry and porphyritic granite
 which traverse the earns; and which, offering a much greater
resistance to the action of decomposing agents than the gra-
nite itself, have been left in the basins, in the form of ridges*
their edges only having been rounded by the action of the
elements.      This fact is obviously conclusive; since the Druidi-
cal sculptors, who must have possessed the skill required to
render some of the basins accurately spheroidal, if they were
indeed the artists of them would not have left these unsightly
                                 ;
ridges in other basins *.
    The " indications of design," stated to be afforded by " the
peculiar form" of these cavities, are all, when strictly ex-
amined, evidences that they were produced by the natural
process which has been described by Dr. Macculloch, and il-
lustrated in the preceding remarks.                This is also the case
with every particular among those which have been so elabo-
   * It may be added, in further confirmation of the natural process here
maintained to have exposed these veins, that similar ridges of porphyry,
several inches in height, project from the smoothed surfaces of many of
the earns where there are not any rcck-basins, having manifestly been
denuded by the same process of weathering ; and that, in some positions,
the granite decomposes in a direction perpendicular to the planes of the
veins which intersect it, when they become exposed, in such a manner, as
to form the face of the rock.
   The writer purposely refrains, in this place, from designating, more parti-
cularly than as above, the material of these veins ; (although he is fully
aware of the importance and interest of the subject, in the present state
of our knowledge and of geological speculation, on the relations of granite
to the incumbent rocks, and the origin of elvan dykes, &c.;) because it is
not described in the notes from which the observations on rock-basins
have been derived, and the specimens collected at the time of making
them are not at present accessible to him ; his memory alone, furnishing
uierely a general impression of their nature.

notes to that ingenious work, vol.      iii. p. 170   et seq.
    Nothing remains     to be said, in this place,       on the alleged
 Druidical origin of rock-basins ; but the writer is unwilling
to quit so interesting a subject, regarding it in a scientific
point of view, without adverting to some inferences connected
with it, which have recently occurred to him, drawn partly
from the researches of Dr. Macculloch and other geologists,
and partly from his own very limited observations respecting;
the internal concretionary structure ascribed to the granite of
 this formation.
    Dr. Macculloch has attributed the " even and rounded
concavity" of the rock-basins, to the " uniform texture of the
granite;" and agreeably to this opinion, it has been attributed,
in the foregoing remarks on Mr. Moore's objections to the
equality of action permitted by this uniformity; as being, per-
haps, the more strictly accurate mode of stating the fact. But
may not this figure, which, in some instances, Dr. Macculloch
has remarked, is as " regularly spheroidal internally as if they
[the basins] had been shaped by a turning lathe," be, in reality,
principally owing to that concealed spherical or rather sphe-
roidal structure, the existence of which, in the same granite,
has been rendered so highly probable by that eminent geo-
logist? For it appears to be obvious that the same variation,
in some given ratio from the centre, of the resistance to disin-
tegration of a mass of granite, which has led to the separation
of the granite of this formation into prismatic and cuboidal
blocks, will, when one surface only of the rock is acted upon,
and that only at certain points, give rise to cavities having a
figure which is precisely that of the rock-basins. And in-
deed it would appear that some further cause than the equality
of action permitted by the uniformity in texture of the granite,
must in reality operate in the formation of these regular sphe-
roidal basins; for if that only were the cause, the granite
should be as much acted upon in a direction perpendicular to
its surface, as in those directions which are parallel to it;        so
that the depth of the basins ought always to be equal to their
diameters, or nearly so; which, so far as the writer's knowledge
extends, is seldom, if ever, the case. The occurrence of the rock-
basins on the vertical faces of the granite at Scilly, would seem
to be a further corroboration of this idea; for it is difficult to
conceive how the action of water could produce such cavities
in this situation, unless it were aided by the tendency of the
                                                                  rock

  rock to disintegrate more easily in certain directions, with re-
  spect to the planes of its surfaces, than in others.
      The form and appearance of the rock-basins on the hori-
 zontal summits and ledges of Roach rocks, and the deep chan-
 nels on their highly-inclined surfaces, may perhaps be men-
 tioned as affording some degree of support to the foregoing
 conjecture.        Here the basins are very deep, and their outline
 is    comparatively irregular         ; while the channels which the
 water has worn on the declivities, do not, so far as has yet
 been described, occur upon granite, under the same circum-
 stances. Now, supposing the form of the basins, as they exist
 in granite itself, to be connected with the concentric-sphe-
 roidal structure of the rock, the facts just mentioned are what
 we might have expected to find, in a mass of schorl-rock like
 that of Roach.         For although a process of disintegration has
undoubtedly taken place with it, and is still proceeding, it
 tends to produce rather angular and pyramidal, than cubic
and spheroidal blocks. From observation, therefore, we ap-
pear to have no evidence of the spheroidal structure of this
particular mass of schorl-rock            ; and this negative result may
be confirmed from theory; since the felspar, on the predo-
minance of which, in granite, all the phenomena attendant
upon and immediately succeeding its presumed original state
of igneous fluidity, must have been greatly dependent, is al-
most entirely wanting in this rock, which is unusually uni-
form in constitution, consisting merely of quartz and crystals
of schorl, intersected by a few veins of the former mineral *.
                                                                       Another
    * It is referable, with little exception, to the first variety of schorl-rock
described by Professor Sedgwick, in his memoir on the formations asso-
ciated with the primitive ridge of Devonshire and Cornwall ; viz. " gra-
nular quartz-rock, with deeply striated prismatic crystals of schorl, of a
coal-black colour, and without regular terminations, uniformly disseminated
through the mass." Trans, of Camb. Phil. Soc. vol. i. p. 106. The summit
of the eastern rock, only, at Roach, consists of the fourth, or porphyritic
variety, described by Prof. Sedgwick, from which, however, the imbedded
crystals of felspar have disappeared, leaving the rock in a state resembling
a scoria.
    If the concretionary spheroidal structure, in granite, shall be found, here-
after, to have resulted from the continued action of heat upon the rock
subsequently to its consolidation, as Dr. Macculloch has shown to have pro-
bably been the case with the corresponding structure in the trap-rocks,
and almost demonstrated to have been so with the columnar iron-stone of
Arran, the prismatic sandstone of Rum, and the columnar sandstone of Duu-
bar, then the inference, in the text, grounded on the presence of felspar in
granite, and its absence in the schorl-rock of Roach, will become nugatory.
For although the predominance of felspar, (or that of its constituents,)
would certainly have exercised an important influence, in the phsenomena
of crystallization, which must have taken place at the consolidation of the

338            Mr. Brayley,      Jun., mi the Connection of
    Another circumstance in the history of rock-basins appears
deserving of further inquiry. Although it is very true that
rock-basins do occur on the highly-inclined and even vertical
surfaces of granite, in some places, yet by far the greater num-
ber of them, in Cornwall and Devonshire at least, are found
either on horizontal or on gently-inclined surfaces,                 Has this
fact any connection, it may be asked, with the structure of the
rock? and does it indicate any determinate relation between
rock  ; we  have no reason to think that its presence would materially in-
fluence the production of the concretionary spheroidal structure, by the
means just described ; since a very perfect concentric structure, radically
spheroidal, has been produced, in all probability by this species of action,
at Dunbar, in a rock quite devoid of felspar.
   It will be perceived that the foregoing qualification of the text has been
suggested, by a view of the origin of the structural phaenomena presented
by granite, somewhat different from that which is derivable from the in-
ferences of Dr. Macculloch, as given in his original paper on the subject.
The train of argument employed in that paper (" On the Granite Tors," &c.)
leads to the conclusion, that the interior spheroidal structure of granite
resulted from the process, of crystallization, by which the fluid, consisting of
the ultimate elements of that rock, in a state of igneous fusion, became
solid ; and in which, also, those elements were so associated together, as to
form the minerals of which granite is an aggregate.
   The facts and arguments, however, which Dr. Macculloch has subse-
quently brought forward, in his papers " On the Concretionary and Crystal-
line Structures of Rocks," and " On a Prismatic Structure in Sandstone in-
duced by artificial Heat," &c, some of which have already been mentioned
in this note, point to a modification of the conclusion just stated ; although
Dr. M. has refrained, in the latter paper at least, from extending his in-
ferences beyond the formation of prismatic trap, and has not connected the
subject, theoretically, with granite.
   From these facts and arguments, then, we should be disposed to infer,
that, while the crystalline-granular structure of granite— the crystallization
of its constituent minerals, their interference with each other's forms, and
the variety of relative proportions in which they are mingled,  —  has resulted
                                                            —
from the crystallization of the fluid while slowly cooling the internal con-
centric-spheroidal structure, indifferently affecting all those minerals, is a
merely concretionary one resulting from the continued action of heat upon
the rock, subsequently to its consolidation.
   Jn concluding, for the present, this part of the subject, candour, how-
ever, requires a cautionary remark.      Dr. Macculloch, in the two papers
last mentioned, has only once alluded to granite in connection with it, when
hinting, at the end of his account of the concretionary and crystalline
structures, that " the granitic laminae of the Alps.... have been produced
by a concretionary arrangement analogous [only] to crystallization." The
present writer, therefore, is alone accountable for the foregoing deduction
 from the facts adduced by that gentleman; and if there be any error in
 the extension of these views to the formation of granite, it is his only :
while if that deduction shall be found to throw any new light upon the, at
present, obscure history of that rock, the credit of it will be due, entirely,
to Dr. Macculloch, of whose arguments it is a mere application ; such as
the mind of every geological student, it is probable, would be disposed,
spontaneously, to make, after perusing the three memoirs which have been
quoted.
                                                                           the

   Rock-Basins with the Spheroidal Structure of Granite, $c. 339
the direction of the axes of the spheroidal structure and any
of the surfaces of the beds composing the masses of granite?
Dr. Macculloch observes, (Classification of Rocks, p. 227,)
that "the great lamina?, or beds of granite, are often vertical,
as well as horizontal or inclined           ;  and it thus presents con-
tinuous smooth precipices laterally, while, above, it terminates
in sharp peaks."       Now the beds of granite in Cornwall and
Devon are horizontal, or inclined ; and we find the rock-
basins on their upper surfaces, which are parallel to the direc-
tion of the beds    : — are the granite beds of Scilly, presenting
basins on their perpendicular faces, placed in a vertical posi-
tion* ?
   If we view these rocks on the grand scale, and consider the
schorl-rock merely as a local modification of granite, which,
in  a strictly geological sense, is undoubtedly the truth, we
may   infer that the appearances at Roach,            —  which have been
regarded, in a former paragraph, as indicating the absence of
the spheroidal structure in that mass of rock,              —  are merely
the consequences of the vertical position of its constituent beds;
and the general aspect of these rocks gives indeed some weight
to this supposition, agreeing as it does with the character, de-
scribed, in the foregoing quotation, as resulting from that dis-
position of the beds.        But in this case, the conjecture that
the form of the rock-basins in true granite is connected with
the spheroidal structure of that rock, will perhaps derive still
further support, from the difference of form in the rock-basins
at Roach, which must, under this view, be regarded as ex-
cavated in the summits of the vertical laminae while the      ;
channels have been worn in their edges and sides.                        Still
further would it seem, from this view, that the position and
nature of the rock-basins, is connected, in some manner, with
the direction of the axes of the spheroidal structure, existing
in the rock.
    In relation to this part of the subject, it may be well to
make a remark, on the occurrence of rock-basins in the mill-
stone grit of Ashover, mentioned near the beginning of this
paper.     If the conjecture, that the form, and the topical situa-
tion, of these cavities, are connected with the internal struc-
ture of the rocks on which they occur, be correct, some other
indications of this structure, either in the obvious external con-
figuration of the rock, or in the mode of its decomposition, may
   * One obvious reason why rock-basins should be more frequent on hori-
zontal than on vertical or highly-inclined surfaces, is the greater aptitude
of horizontal surfaces to retain water    ;   but the form and disposition of
the basins seem to indicate a further and structural cause for this fact,

spot. The immediate vicinity of trap, points out a cause for the
existence in it of such a structure reasoning on the analogy

of the case with those of the sandstones of Rum and Dun-
bar, as described by Dr. Macculloch*.               It may also be ob-
served, in accordance with the phaenomena exhibited in those
localities, that the same denudation, which has exposed, at
Ashover, the millstone-grit and the shale, with the subjacent
limestone and toadstone, may have removed masses of the
rock last named, which may have been in contact with por-
tions of the millstone-grit, now also removed, and thus have
imparted, through their medium, a concretionary structure, to
the masses of grit which still remain and with which they
                                                 ;
were once continuous. The writer, however, is unacquainted
with the particular features and history of this denudation;
nor are the authorities on the subject, at present, accessible
to him; he merely throws out these suggestions, therefore,
for the consideration of those geologists, who may have in-
vestigated the phaenomena presented by the valley of Ashover,
or who can refer to the authorities alluded to.
    Since the publication of the paper On the Granite Tors of
Cornwall, in which Dr. Macculloch first developed his views
respecting the interior spheroidal structure of granite, as in-
dicated by the manner of its decomposition, he has pursued
the subject much further, in the course of his admirable and
profound researches into the history of our unstratified and
crystalline rocks.       He has ascertained some important limita-
tions to the validity of the inferences, which geologists had been
disposed to draw, from the desquamation, in concentric crusts,
of masses of granite and of trap.              He has shown, that,
while the mode of decomposition in question is in many cases
indubitably the result of an internal concretionary structure
in the decomposing rock,        —  in others it is utterly independent
on any structure; being produced, solely, by the action of
the atmosphere, by means, however, hitherto inexplicable
and that, in other instances, as in those, for example, from
 which the spheroidal structure of granite had principally
been inferred, it is impossible to discover, from which of
 these causes the process of desquamation in reality results f.
 Since, however, in many cases, as just mentioned, the depend-
 ence of the process on the interior structure in question, is

 Rock- Basins 'with the Spheroidal Structure of Granite, fyc. 34
manifest, and since it is impossible, in those from which the
inferences had at first been drawn, to decide which of the two
causes of desquamation has operated, Dr. Macculloch's ori-
ginal deductions appear to be unshaken by this subsequent
discovery.
    It is to be observed that no facts have been adduced, which
prove the absence of the spheroidal structure, in those masses
of rock, whether granite or trap, which desquamate in a man-
ner evidently unconnected with structure, and depending only
on some unknown effect of the weather. In pursuing the
inquiry, therefore, it will be interesting to ascertain whether
rock-basins are formed in such masses of granite, or not.        If,
however, the opinion expressed in this paper, that the phas-
nomena of rock-basins are connected with a concentric struc-
ture in the rocks on which they occur, be well founded, it will
afford the means of determining, whether, in those cuboidal or
prismatic blocks of granite, in which desquamation takes place
 " all round the surface, respecting some imaginary point or
 centre, and promising, in the progress of time, to reduce the
 whole to a smaller and more spheroidal mass*," to which of
 the two assignable causes the process must be referred. Thus,
 since the granite of Cornwall and Devonshire is characterized
 by this mode of decomposition, while it is also abundant in
 rock-basins, we should infer, that the concentric desquamation
 it undergoes, is really dependent on the internal concretionary
 structure to which it had originally been referred.
     To conclude, for the present, these remarks on the geolo-
 gical history of rock-basins     :
                                    — Mr. De la Beche, in the expla-
 nation of his " Sections and Views illustrative of Geological
 Phenomena," lately published, after quoting Dr. Macculloch's
 paper On the Granite Tors, as explaining the Views taken from
 it of the Vixen Tor, the Cheesewring, and the Logan at Castle
 Trereen, observes, " Looking at these drawings, and taking
 into consideration the comparatively little waste which the
 objects they represent now suffer, it would seem to require a
 long lapse of time to produce the effects we here witness."
  In this opinion every one must agree; but the present writer
  would suggest, from a few observations of his own, that more
  rapid, though far less extensive changes, are effected by that
  particular species of action, which has produced, and is now
  producing, as well as destroying, rock-basins and the effect
                                                         ;
  of which, in dividing masses of granite, and changing their
  figure, is well exhibited in the Tors of Carnbrea.

 LI.   On   the Discharge     of a Jet of Water under Water.       By
                            R. W. Fox, Esq.
    To  the Editors   of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     AM not     aware that    it has been before noticed, that a jet
     of water discharges the same quantity, in water, as in air, in
 a given time, without reference to the depth or the motion of
 the water ; at least within certain limits.
    Thus when the experiment was tried with a head of water
 six feet high, the same orifice discharged equal quantities in
 equal times in air, in still water, and in a rapid stream, mov-
 ing at the rate of about six feet in a second       ; the jet having
 in one case been turned with the current, and in another
against it: and when by lengthening the tube, the aperture
was submerged to the depth of fifteen feet, the effect was the
same as at the surface, under the pressure of an equal co-
 lumn above it.
    These results have been obtained by my brother Alfred
                       —
 Fox, and myself; and you may, perhaps, think them de-
serving a place in your Magazine, if they should appear to
you to be new.
    We    sometimes coloured the water, when the jet appeared
to pass unbroken to a considerable distance under the water.

[7.]  HPHE calculation        of an occultation of a star can now be
       *   performed, after the preparatory operations explained
in the preceding section, in two different ways. The first sup-
poses that the same value of T is to be applied to all obser-
vations which are to be calculated, in which case p and cj cor-
respond to the value a in the arrangement above given. On
                                                                 this

time   T+     T', are obtained          by  this    formula

consequently, p' and         q'  by    this formula
by which      N     and log n are found. If, however, several ob-
servations are to be calculated at the same time, it is more
convenient at once to calculate the values of                      N  and log n for
different values of T'; they are obtained by putting for n sin
N  and n cos       N   these expressions        :

   For every single observation               M     and log    m    are then to be
calculated by the formulae

in which    p and       q are the known values of P and                  Q  for the
time T; at last the sixth formula is to be calculated.                        A  se-
cond approximation is not necessary if the value of T'                            =
t — —d     T, or the assumed difference of meridians employed
in the first is correct within some minutes of time, which may
always be supposed. Such an approximation would, how-
ever, cause little trouble, as the calculation of formu1a(6), only,
would be affected by the alterations. A second way of per-
forming the calculation would be to calculate by interpolation
(7) from the values of P and                Q   corresponding to T,         T  + 1,
&c. those values of these quantities which belong to the time
of observation, reduced to the first meridian by an assumed
difference of meridians, and to use these values instead of
p and q and their differential quotients, instead of p' and q',

be obtained. If it should be preferred at once to find N and

  The remainder      of the calculation is as above.
      This second manner of conducting the calculation, supposes,
  therefore, the determination of p and q by interpolation, while
  the former one constantly proceeds from the same values of
  these quantities.     But it has the advantage of a more easy
  calculation of the term      (6)

 correction of the assumed difference of meridians, and which
  is, of course, commonly very small; its convergency to the
 truth is likewise the greatest possible, and the error of the
 first approximation arises only from the moon's motion during
 the. interval between the supposed and the real difference of
 meridians being taken as it would be at the beginning, or at
 the end of this interval of time, while it ought to have been
 taken for the middle of it.        For the observatories of Europe,
 whose meridians are very nearly known, the square of
 n (T'+ i) might even be neglected, and the equation to be re-
 solved might thus be reduced to one of the first degree. But
 all  these advantages of the second       method of calculating ap-
 pear to   me  to be insignificant in comparison to the trouble of
 the interpolation for finding p and q.         I therefore prefer the
 first.   In the application of these formulae, however, the in-
 terpolation will never require to be carried beyond the se-
 cond differences, and consequently three values of P and                   Q
 will  be sufficient.
     [8.] The method here explained leaves it to the choice of
the calculator, whether the quantities a, S, shall refer to the
equator or to the ecliptic.         In the result of the calculation
there is nothing referring to either of these great circles, and
they serve only to denote the relative situation of the various
points of the celestial sphere referred to in the problem. The
former is, however, always more easy, if the places of the
moon in relation to the equator are contained in an ephe-
meris ; and even if this should not be the case, whenever se-
veral observations are to be calculated at the same time. But
when there are few observations, and when the places of the
moon are to be derived from the tables themselves, or are to be
be taken from an ephemeris containing the moon's longitude and
latitude, the preparatory calculations required in finding the
                                                                  quantities

                 and the Methods of calculating                  their Residts.            345
  quantities referring to the equator                  become more troublesome
  than the calculation of the longitude and latitude of the zenith:
 in that case the ecliptic deserves the preference.                            The tables
 give the longitude, latitude, and parallax of the moon for the
 time T, and likewise their variations for the preceding and fol-
 lowing-hours. These three longitudes and latitudes are to be
 converted into right ascension and declination, if the equator
 is to be used.        This trouble is saved if we calculate with longi-
 tude and latitude ; but, on the contrary, in using right ascen-
 sion and declination we dispense with the calculation of the
 longitude and latitude of the star and the zenith.                             If, there-
 fore, in the case that the places of the moon in relation to the
 equator are unknown, only two or three observations are to
 be calculated, the ecliptic appears to deserve the preference.
 If a single observation is to be compared with the epheme-
rides or the tables, it is more advantageous to calculate p' and
 q' from the hourly variations of a, 8,                   71-,   than to derive them
from the three values of P and Q. In this case it will be
most convenient to assume for T, the time of the observation
reduced to the first meridian, by applying an approximate
value of the difference of meridians, and to calculate for this
moment P and Q,              as also their differential quotients p'                and q\

    [9.] It now remains further to develope that part of formula
(6) which is dependent on the corrections of the elements of
the calculation.           The result obtained by the method here ex-
plained, is not so much the difference of the meridian of the
place of observation, as the relation between it and the ele-
ments used in the calculation, and by the combination of se-
veral observations one 'or more of the elements of the calcula-
tion are eliminated, and the result is thus made partly or en-
tirely independent of the tables.

 LI 1 1.    Notes on the New Red Sandstone of the County of Dur-
    ham, below the Magnesian Limestone. By Wm. Hutton,
    Esq. F.G.S*
 PROF. SEDGWICK, in an elaborate paper just published
        in the Transactions of the Geological Society, has         been
 the   first to point out the true relations of a bed of sandstone,
 found underlying the magnesian limestone and conformable
 to it, but unconformable to the coal measures.
    This sandstone had before been observed by Smith, who
 figures it in his Geological Map of Yorkshire (published in
 1821), as the Pontefract rock; but he mistakes its true nature
and value, and classes it with the coal sandstones. Professor
 Sedgwick corrects this error, and very satisfactorily, upon a
 general view of the whole formation, from Nottingham to the
 banks of the Tyne, proves it to be a bed of new red sand-
stone subordinate to the magnesian limestone, and also points
 out its analogy with the " rothe-todte-liegende" of the Ger-
man geologists thus adding another link to the chain connect-
                    ;
ing the formations of this country with those of the continent,
and one which is of the more importance, as it serves to clear
up many doubts and difficulties which have hitherto existed,
in the comparison of our strata with those of Germany.
    In treating of the situation of rocks on a district of great
extent, it is absolutely necessary to consider the formations or
usual groupings of certain beds, under their general and more
prominent characters      :
                            — in this way, of course, Professor Sedg-
wick has considered the strata under review, and has, in a
very clear and comprehensive manner, pointed out their ge-
neral relations but when we examine the geology of a small
                   ;
district, the different beds composing the formations cannot
be marked too minutely ; and this more especially, when these
beds possess any local interest, or ceconomical value. The
sandstone beneath the magnesian limestone, besides being a
member of our strata, with which we were not before ac-
quainted, is one of considerable importance to all the owners
of property where it exists, particularly to all those who may
have any intention of working coal beneath it. Considering
it in this view to deserve our attention, I beg to lay before the
Society the following details of an examination of its edge,
throughout the whole of the county of Durham, and the ideas
that have suggested themselves by the survey; and this I do
with the greater confidence, having had the advantage of the
   * Read before the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham,
and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, April SO, 1830, and published in their Transac-
tions.
                                                                   skill

Mr. Hutton's Notes on    the  New Red Sandstone of Durham. 349
skill and professional experience of my friend, Mr. Francis
Forster, along the whole of the line.
   The beds composing the lower new red sandstone vary con-
siderably both in mineral character and thickness       : one great
division may, however, be satisfactorily established, viz. an
upper and a lower bed.
 „The upper bed is generally a running sand, occasionally it may
be considered as a sandstone, but it never possesses coherence
enough to be of use as a building material; it has interspersed
through it, rounded grains of white quartz, which occur very
irregularly, but are often arranged in lines parallel to the
planes of stratification  ;  the prevailing colour  is  a very light
buff.   Between this and the lower bed, which is more con-
solidated, and of a red colour, the division is generally well
marked, but sometimes the two pass into each other insen-
sibly, the sand gradually changing its hue, becoming com-
pact and micaceous.         The colour of the lower stratum is a
character which varies exceedingly it is at all times, more
                                        ;
or less, red, sometimes purple ; but almost every quarry fur-
nishes beds, which, when taken alone, have little in their
aspect to distinguish them from a common coal grit; some-
times it is light yellow, or nearly white, with zones or bands
of deep red, and frequently the colouring matter is in veins
and spots. The characteristic colour of this rock appears to
arise from oxide of iron disseminated through it, but this is
frequently united with a clayey matter, forming nodules of
" ruddle," which are irregularly embedded in the stone. The
state in which iron exists in this formation is different from
that of the coal measures generally;    —  in no instance were we
able to discover a nodule of clay ironstone, in the different
beds composing it. The texture of the lower bed also varies
considerably, it being sometimes of a fine even grain, and
compact enough to be worked as a building stone; at other
times it is coarse and uneven, from the quantity and size of
the embedded grains and nodules of quartz.         It is always mi-
caceous, and some of its beds so much so, as to split into thin
laminae of a bright red colour, which are very prone to de-
composition.
   A conspicuous character of this lower stratum is, the false
bedding of the stone, which may be seen in every quarry; but,
perhaps, the best character of all to distinguish it from a coal
grit, is the total absence of vegetable organic remains.
   This sandstone, in the course of its outcrop, follows gene-
rally that of the magnesian limestone, but occasionally pro-
jects beyond, where it is hard and of considerable thickness.
    For the sake of perspicuity in the following remarks, we
                                                               shall

 350     Mr. Hutton's Notes on      the New Red Sandstone of
shall designate the upper bed as the Yellow Sand, from its pre-
vailing character, and the lower as the Red Sandstone ; but
without in the least wishing them to be considered in any other
light than as different members of the same formation.
   When     the magnesian limestone first enters the county of
Durham from        the south, its course is so little marked for se-
veral miles, from the lowness of the level at which it runs, that
the beds beneath it cannot easily be examined          :
                                                         —
northward, however, it begins to rise into those round-top-
                                                           proceeding
ed hills which form the general character of its edge through-
out the county ; the red sandstone keeps its course near the foot
of these hills, and was first met with on the side of the road
leading from Legs Cross Toll Bar, towards Heighington;
about a hundred yards beyond, the well-known Cockfield Dyke
crosses the road      ; the basalt, which has been woi-ked for a
road-stone, is seen cutting through the yellow sand.
   Park House Quarry, on the hill side, one mile west of
Heighington, is worked entirely in the red sandstone it has   ;
been lately opened out the stone is of a close texture, and is
                            ;
used for gate-posts, &c. the limestone is not seen in the
                              ;
quarry, but it forms the capping of the hill above, and is ex-
tensively worked about three hundred yards to the east.
   At Brusselton, near the top of the hill, close by the turn of
the road, the yellow sand is visible on the road side.           In the
great quarry beneath the tower, there is a very fine display
of the red sandstone in all its variety of colour and texture,
having beds or seams of a hard, light blue, siliceous shale,
running through it in the most irregular manner; the bed
must be here of considerable thickness, as the quarry has been
worked    at least fifty feet deep.
   In Thickley Quarry, by the side of the Darlington railway,
the same kind of stone is extensively worked, as is found at
Park House Quarry and Brusselton. The upper bed is a
slaty limestone   ;  a light blueish white clay occurs here in irre-
gular seams.      It was in a quarry a little to the east of this,
by the   side of the railway, that the curious deposit of fossil
fish occurred, which is described by Professor Sedgwick in
his Memoir ; they were found in a slaty limestone bed, very
near the sandstone.
   At Eldon, the limestone forms the top of the hill, and pro-
ceeding northward towards Howlish Hall, although the red
sandstone does not appear at the surface, yet there is suffi-
cient evidence of its existence beneath, in the deep rich red
colour of the soil on the slope of the hills immediately under
the limestone.
   At Cowndon, a fault, running nearly north and south,
                                                                throws

    the County  of Durham, below the Magnesian Limestone. 351
throws down the limestone, so as to make it abut against the
coal measures.
   On the slope of the hill rising towards Westerton, near a
well, in the middle of a large pasture field, the red sandstone
comes to the day. At the top of the hill the true relations of
the rocks are not easily understood the east end of the vil-
                                         ;
lage is upon limestone, but there is a sandstone at the surface,
in the road about one hundred yards to the westward, which
is no doubt caused by a fault.       This sandstone may be seen
in a small quarry at the west end of the village     ; but whether
it belongs to the red sandstone, or to the coal measures, is
difficult to determine   ; it had large coarse grains of quartz in
it, apparently rounded by attrition.
    The limestone forms the top of the hill above Quarrington,
below it is the yellow sand, and beneath this the red sand^
stone, which is here thin, and of the very micaceous variety.
The upper part of the yellow sand is hard, apparently from
 the infiltration of calcareous matter from the limestone.
    Heugh Hall Hill is principally of limestone, but near the
bottom of its northern slope, the sand makes its appearance
having bands of a red colour in it, marking the planes of
 stratification ; in a field at the foot of the hill called " Red
 Brae Bank," the red sandstone has been lately bored through
 in search of coal.
    On the slope of the hill above Pittington, both members
 of this formation may be seen cropping out beneath the lime-
 stone, but of inconsiderable thickness    ; the sandstone is of the
 micaceous variety, splitting into thin leaves.
    Near a limestone quarry on the hill between Pittington and
 Moorsley, a thin bed of the same red micaceous shaly sand-
 stone appears, having above, or in it, a seam of blueish-white
 unctuous clay. The quarry here is extensively worked in the
 slaty limestone   ; a kiln is built upon the yellow sand, which,
 at its upper part, has hard beds of a calcareous nature alter-
 nating with it.
     The same light-coloured clay is visible on the side of the
 footpath leading towards Moorsley, and still further on, about
 half a mile short of that place, the yellow sand again appears
 beneath the limestone.
     At Moorsley, a new pit has been sunk by Mr. Russell,
  which was begun upon the yellow sand, and immediately be-
  low the limestone. The sand is here about sixteen feet thick,
  and the red sandstone three fathoms, having a shale bed be-
  neath it.
     In sinking the old pit, at Hetton, below the yellow sand,
  the red sandstone was found, between three and four fathoms
                                                              thick

   352      Mr. Hutton's Notes on       the New Red Sandstone of
   thick  ;  this  bed  is here well known and calculated upon by the
   sinkers, as      unconformable to the coal measures, it having
   been proved by borings in search of coal, in many places
  in the neighbourhood.
       In the Downs Pit, at Eppleton, the sinking was through a
  dry yellow sand, about six fathoms, and the red sandstone
  three fathoms.
      The    quarry in      Rough Dean,      near Houghton-le-Spring,
  displays the slaty limestone much mixed with seams of a yel-
  low clay, resting upon the sand, sometimes in a very uneven
  line, the limestone appearing to bend round and conform
  itself to the inequalities of the sand, which is of a light colour,
  having many hard veins of a calcareous nature in it, and also
  seams of clay. It appears about twenty feet thick; there is
  at its lower part a bed of white-coloured unctuous clay, pre-
  cisely similar to that observed between Moorsley and Pitting-
  ton, and in the quarry at Thickley.             The general character
  and appearance of the red sandstone, which is worked here as
  a building material, agree exactly with that of the Thickley,
  Brusselton, and Park House quarries.
      The old quarry at the foot of Houghton Hill, which is
 worked down to the sand, is, at its lower part, slaty, having
 thin layers of a brown clay alternating with the limestone.
 In a bed about five feet from the bottom of the quarry, a few
 impressions of fish have been lately found, very well pre-
 served, having their scales remaining perfect; the yellow sand
 is  here at least sixty feet thick.
      The new pit, sunk by Lord Durham, at the foot of the hill,
 was begun upon the sand, and beneath it was a thin bed of
 sandstone, of a brick-red colour, of a rough grain, and having
 white earthy felspar disseminated through it.
     At Newbottle, in consequence of a fault, the limestone is
thrown down, and made to abut against the red sandstone at
the south end of the village; on the hill side, proceeding
northward, a quarry is just opened in the sandsto ne.
     From this point towards Pensher Hill, although the rock
is nowhere visible, the situation of the sandstone is suffici-
ently marked, by the belt of red ground, formed at its out-
crop, which may be thus easily traced by the eye beneath the
limestone *.
    *  The  colour of the soil over the outcrop of the lower new red sand'
stone,   which  is more conspicuous in some parts than others, is a character
to be observed generally ; thus pointing out its situation, although the
rock itself be not visible, and no doubt in this character have originated
the names of several places upon the line ; as Red-worth, Red-house, Red-
brae-bank, &c.
                                                                   Pensher

       the County  of Durham, below the Magnesian Limestone. 353
      Pensher Hill is well known as the most conspicuous point
   upon the edge of the magnesian limestone formation; the yel-
  low sand appears, exhibiting all its usual characters, on the
  northern face of the hill, about half-way down.
      Clack's Heugh presents a very bold cliff of limestone, rest-
  ing upon the yellow sand, here forming a bed of immense
  thickness the coal measures are made to abut against the
             ;
  limestone by a fault which traverses the eastern end of the
  cliff; and a portion of the red sandstone has also been forced
  up, so as to form the uppermost bed.     This is the only point
  at which I have observed it on the south bank of the Wear,
  although I am informed it exists higher up, near to Hylton
  Ferry ; on the opposite side, however, it forms a most con-
  spicuous object, being there of great thickness, and generally
 of a dark reddish-purple colour, the yellow sand forming its
 upper member. Above Burn's Quay is a quarry where it is
 worked for fire-stone ; it is close-grained, but not very hard,
 and of a pretty even texture.
     In the great Pallion Quatry the limestone is worked more
 than sixty feet thick; the lower slaty beds are of a blueish-
 gray colour, and being found to make good lime (probably
 from the absence of magnesia), they are worked entirely away:
 they are found to rest upon what the quarrymen call " black
 stone;" a tough brown shale about seven feet thick; and be-
low this the yellow sand occurs to an unknown depth. It was
 in the lower beds of the limestone, in this quarry, that the
fossil fish occurred, which is figured in the fourth volume of
the Geological Transactions, plate II.
    In the little dell running up from the Wear towards Hyl-
ton Castle, the yellow sand may be observed beneath the
limestone, of considerable thickness.
    At Down Hill, near West Boldon, we again have the sand
it cannot be seen in the quarry, but makes its appearance, at
each end of the escarpment, beneath the slaty beds of the
limestone; a single fossil fish has occurred in this quarry.
    In West Boldon, limestone is worked on the hill, below the
church; in the quarry the yellow sand is not visible, but it
appeared in cutting the foundations of a house below, and
a well not far from the gate of the rectory was begun in it;
this bed must here be of inconsiderable thickness, as the red
sandstone was immediately come upon, and was sunk into to
the depth of twenty-nine feet; the upper part was micaceous,
splitting into thin layers, but the stone became more compact
as the operations were carried deeper.

house called Brinkburn House the red sandstone occurs, and

354              Remarks on Mr. Babbage's Work
I am informed by a gentleman well acquainted with the neigh-
bourhood, that some years ago the yellow sand was worked
in a pit near to Harton Toll Bar, on the turnpike road from
South Shields to Sunderland. At the mouth of the above-
mentioned Deans, near a brewery, a sandstone of the'coal mea-
sures is visible, on the western side of the burn; rising to
the top of the hill, on the opposite side, we find the new red
sandstone, in Mr. Fox's Quarry, which has been extensively
worked for a building stone; it may be again seen in the Col-
liery Quarry, on the road side leading to Westoe.          The mag-
nesian limestone, which forms the capping of the hill, being
also worked in an adjoining field.
   In a quarry at Lay Gate, near South Shields, the red sand-
stone forms the upper bed, and rests upon a white sandstone,
which is evidently, from its general characters, a coal grit,
having abundance of vegetable remains in it. This quarry
was the last point at which the red rock was observed south
of the Tyne but on the north side it occurs again, forming
               ;
the cliffs below the Spanish Battery.          Here neither the lime-
stone nor the yellow sand appear, but on the other side of
Tynemouth Haven the limestone forms the uppermost bed in
the Castle Cliff, and at its lower part alternates with the yel-
low sand the latter is upwards of twenty feet thick, and is
            ;
seen resting upon the red sandstone, which forms the whole
of the lower part of the cliff on its south and eastern faces.
   A well-known basaltic dyke here cuts through the red
sandstone, and the yellow sand; but is not seen in contact with
the limestone.     In the eastern face of the cliff, several faults
appear traversing and affecting alike the whole formation.
   At the base of the cliff, on the northern side, in Percy
 Haven, a coal sandstone makes its appearance, rising rapidly
towards the north-west, being surmounted by the superior
formation both members of which may be traced all round
             ;
this haven, and extending to a point a little short of the Two-
 Gun Battery, where they are cut out by the rising of the beds
 of the coal formation.

LIV.     Remarks on Mr. Babbage's Work " On the Decline of
         Science in England."       By A Correspondent.
    To  the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
      Gentlemen,
 TN    looking over Mr. Babbage's late publication "On the
 *   Decline of Science in England," I regret much to see that
 so able a man as he is, and one who has hitherto been distin-
                                                             guished

            " On the Decline of Science in England"            355
guished for candour and urbanity, should have thought fit to
make a severe attack on the Royal Society, to which, as a
man of Science, he owes much good-will and to cover this,
                                              ;
which appears to be the main object of this work, by a title
which communicates little of its real nature and design. The
harshness of his strictures he represents as absolutely neces-
sary to cure the deep-rooted maladies of that body; but yet
the discipline employed by him, very much resembles that of
an ardent and inexperienced son of Galen, who, in his eager-
ness to display a supposed manual dexterity, overlooks, en-
tirely, the constitution with which he has to deal, and the
mode by which a permanent cure is most likely to be ef-
fected.
   It is not dignified in Mr. Babbage, to decline in his title-
page, the designation of Fellow of the Royal Society. It is much
beneath him to affect to despise a title, which his friend Wol-
laston invariably employed; and which it is not very likely
that he would have ventured to put aside, during the life-time
of that great man.     This is a petitesse unworthy of Mr. Bab-
       —
bage: it is only, however, a petitesse; but his charge against
the Secretaries of the Royal Society, of wilfully suppressing an
important document of the Council; and his fancied detection
of their guilt, involve his candour, or his judgement, in a way
which has excited much surprise. The circumstances of this
charge have been sufficiently discussed by Dr. Roget and
Mr. Babbage, in some of your former Numbers ; and I would
now ask, whether it was consistent with the usual courtesy of
society, to bring forward a serious accusation, in the face of
the world, without taking the trouble to inquire of the ac-
cused party, whether there was any ground for mistake, or
misapprehension, on the subject ?
   In the privacy of the study, a man may come to an unim-
peachable conclusion, in the exact sciences, from his own in-
ternal resources.    But in the affairs of the world, and parti-
cularly in matters involving character, he must recollect, that
there are two sides of a question and that, in determining
                                      ;
guilt, there is not only a necessity of rigidly ascertaining facts
but also the animus connected with them, on which alone
their real tendency depends.
   Mr.Babbage's criticisms on the mode of entering the minutes
of public meetings may to a certain degree be in point ; and
would, I have no doubt, have received respectful attention,
if submitted in a friendly manner ; but to think of founding,
as he has done, a charge of bad faith on any thing which he
has been able to elicit, relative to the transaction in question
to consider himself justified in applying innuendoes of tam-

356             Remarks on Mr. Babbage's Work
pering with written documents, to honourable men, for whose
personal character he represents himself as entertaining a high
value, is uncourteous, uncandid, and unjust.
    Mr. Babbage is anxious for a reform in the Royal Society;
so he is in the Universities but he sets about the accomplish-
                             :
ment of his wishes, in a way, which the least knowledge of
the world might convince him, was sure to defeat his object.
 His efforts, like those of many other sticklers for innovation,
by attempting too much, and too speedily; viz. preferring the
tone of acrid and vituperative censure, to that of mild and
manly expostulation, run the risk of preventing the adoption
of those moderate views of improvement, in which judicious
 and temperate men would all be disposed to join. He seems
to mis-time his motions, and appears to be grievously offended
that an ancient establishment does not at once consider his
suggestions for its improvement, as mandates to be obeyed,
not advice to be examined.         The monarchical influence of
 which he complains, is not of modern date, it has existed in
 the Society for a long series of years; but it would be well to
 recollect, that much may be done, in no very long period, by
 temperate and well-timed counsel; and that in the policy of
 Societies and States, as well as in that of domestic life, a little
 blindness to faults, and a little kindness to virtues, are among
the most agreeable and efficient, as well as the best established
maxims of good government.
    The Society Utopist may with advantage attend to the ad-
 vice of the great Bacon, when he says, " that it were good
 that men, in their innovations, would follow the example of
time itself, which indeed innovateth greatly, but quietly, and
 by degrees scarce to be perceived for otherwise whatsoever
                                       ;
 is new, is unlooked for; and ever it mends some and pairs
 others."
    Mr. Babbage is very liberal in his application of terms of
 reproach to the Royal Society, which he represents as being in
 a " second childhood," and as being viewed " with contempt
 in this country, and ridicule in others."    At what time its de-
merits arose to this fearful extent, it is difficult to conjecture;
but I presume they have been of long standing, since they are
                                                                  :"
traced to " years of misrule, to which it has been submitted
and yet Mr. Babbage has, in several instances of late years,
thought it not beneath him to communicate materials to the
 Society's Transactions ; and even at a still later period, to sit
down at the Board with the junto, whom he is at so much
pains to expose.
   The faults of the Royal Society are visited upon the pre-
sent President and Secretaries, by Mr. Babbage, with nearly
                                                                 as

as singular a severity as those of the lamb by the wolf in the
fable ; and the misrule of years is blazoned, on the present
occasion, just as if it could with justice be laid at their door.
The Royal Society is erroneously represented as having, in
turns, given " the most determined opposition" to the esta-
blishment of the Linneean, the Geological, and the Astrono-
mical Society. The most active supporters of each of those
Societies, were, however, fellows of the Royal Society and  :
with regard to the first-named of them, the Linnaean, it is
well known, that Sir James Smith had the most important and
effectual assistance of Sir Joseph Banks, in its formation.    So
far, even Sir Joseph is free from any discredit on the subject.
But with regard to the Geological and Astronomical Societies,
though Sir Joseph personally disapproved of them, it could
not fairly be said that they were discountenanced, either by
the Royal Society, or its Council.    —   Dr. Wollaston was an
early member of theGeological Society, though one of the most
constant, efficient, and distinguished members of the Royal
Society's Council; and the present President, as is well known,
has long given it his hearty support and not a great while
                                        ;
ago successfully employed his influence with Sir Robert Peel,
to transfer the present apartments of the Geological Society,
from the Royal Society, to that body. Mr. Davies Gilbert
was likewise an early and active member of the Astronomical
Society; so were Mr. Pond, the astronomer-royal; Sir        Wm.
Herschel ; Mr. Herschel his highly-gifted son ; Dr. Wol-
laston; Mr. South; Mr. Groombridge; Dr. Roget the pre-
sent Secretary, and many others, who, like those just men-
tioned, from being more or less frequently on the Council of
the Royal Society, were, according to Mr. Babbage, more or
less worthy of being held up to public odium, as having sub-
mitted to be under the undue influence of the President.
   The habits of obedience and command, which attach to the
military character, are adduced as reasons why Captain Sabine
could not be expected to act with " the perfect freedom which
should reign in the Councils of Science " and yet the ardour
                                            :
with which it appears that men of Science are embued for
" loaves and fishes ; " the patronage represented to be exer-
cised to " staunch supporters of the system " the disposition
                                                 ;
which we learn has been so generally exhibited in the Council,
to divide " all the good things " among the members of their
coterie, — required not, surely, the introduction of a military
officer into that body, to exhibit an example of implicit obe-
dience.
   It will hardly be gratifying to the world of Science, to have
it held out to them, that Dr. Wollaston, Sir Humphry Davy,
                                                              and

and Dr. Young, among the dead and Mr. Herschel among
                                      ;
the living, not only condescended to be the humble and obe-
dient creatures of a president of the Royal Society, as mem-
bers of the Council; but to receive, as its Secretaries, the wages
appropriated generally to his most staunch supporters ; and I
cannot myself but regard it as somewhat mortifying, that a
gentleman, a man of education, and one who deservedly enjoys
the high dignity of filling a chair once occupied by Newton,
should have brought forward imputations, which seem neces-
sarily to lead to those conclusions.
    That there are many things which require change in the ma-
nagement of the affairs of the Royal Society, I am quite willing
to admit and harsh as has been the conduct exercised by Mr.
          ;
Babbage towards that body, I trust that his plan of improve-
ment, and the various other topics embraced by him, will be
considered with candour.
    One of the first measures requiring alteration, is relative to
the house list.   That this list should be determined on by the
retiring Council, as was the case on the last occasion, is
highly expedient and a president need not fear an undue in-
                   ;
terference with his prerogative, or entertain any apprehensions
that his real and substantial weight, either with the Society at
large, or the Council, will be diminished, by dividing the
responsibility of such list, with the other members of the Coun-
cil.   The Society owes much to Dr. Roget for having, for the
first time, registered the house list, as an act of the Council.
    Another circumstance of importance, I would also take the
liberty of suggesting, which is, that it would be advantageous,
for the Society at large, and not the Council alone, to have the
power of making and repealing the bye-laws of the Society.
In no other institution is this power, as far as I know, with-
held from the body at large and the inconveniences which
                                 ;
might be feared from the proposed change, could readily be
guarded against. Indeed the power of occasional appeal to
the general body, is a sort of safety valve in the proceedings
of a Society, which allows discussions to be held, and angry
feelings to evaporate, without the necessity of giving them fur-
ther publicity.
   The first is, however, the most important of the changes
required ; and as it is of immediate practical application, I trust
that it will be invariably acted upon in future.         Much, no
doubt, depends on the talents and public estimation of the
Council, for the proper and satisfactory government of the
Society's affairs; and it will be unfortunate, and not quite
creditable, if such men as have it in their power to benefit the
Society by their talents, should withdraw themselves from of-
                                                              fice,

fice, because their peculiar views are not immediately under-
stood and adopted.           A gentleman of conciliatory manners,
with judgement, independent feelings, and energy, need not fear
the accomplishment, in time, of every worthy object which he
may have in view, relative to the concerns of any institution, with
which he may be connected.
    The paucity of high mathematical knowledge in this coun-
try is well known ; and none of the few gentlemen who possess
it, can well be spared from the Councils of the Royal Society.
Let us hope, therefore, that they will do what they can (and
they can do much), to encourage the taste for such pursuits, by
their personal exertions to increase the value of the Society's
Transactions.        Let us flatter ourselves, that the philosopher
will condescend to be the man of the world in his associations
with others and that he will aim at effecting, gradually and
              ;
unobtrusively, solid and practicable improvements in the con-
cerns of the Royal Society, to which good sense, and regard to
the feelings, and even the prejudices of others, will enable him
very largely to contribute.         This last, it will not be beneath
him to exercise and he can well afford to employ it.

 LV. An Examination of            those Phenomena of Geology, which
    seem to bear most directly on theoretical Speculations.         By
    the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, M.A. F.R.S. F.G.S. $c.
                        [In Continuation from p. 219.]
    To  the Editors    of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
 1 N pursuing      the design, proposed in my last communication,
 -*  of endeavouring to class and arrange the geological phe-
 nomena bearing more immediately on theoretical investiga-
 tion, I am especially anxious that I should not be so far mis-
 taken as to be supposed to write only, or chiefly, with contro-
 versial views.       It is true, indeed, that the late work of Mr.
 Lyell has principally suggested to me these remarks, and
 that I believe the conclusions which I shall elicit, will be, in
 many respects, opposed to those which he has adopted but        :
 I trust that my sole desire is impartially to follow the argu-
 ment whithersoever it may lead; and that I shall be much
 better pleased when I shall be able to acquiesce, than when
 I feel constrained to differ.
    •In the first place, a question of method presents itself; for we
 may, First, commence with the effects actually resultingfrom the
                                                                causes

  360    Rev. W. D. Conybeare on the Phenomena of Geology.
 causes still in operation and acting with their present power;
 and thus taking our departure from circumstances with which
 we  are familiarly acquainted, we may proceed to the consider-
 ation of the geological changes produced at former periods,
 hoping to illustrate them by the light elicited in the course of
 this progress from the known to the unknown.         This is the
 method which     it is apparently the intention of Mr. Lyell to
 adopt  ; as the portion of his work as yet published is confined
 to the present order of things, or, as Brongniart in his late
 Treatise somewhat affectedly calls it, the Jovian, as distin-
 guished from the Saturnian period. I hope I have fairly stated
 the advantages which this method appears to offer. The other
 method is, Secondly, to survey the geological phenomena, in
 what may be called a chronological order 5 beginning with those
 which appear to have taken place at the earliest periods, class-
 ing, as completely as we can, the effects which have been pro-
duced in the successive geological epochs in a regular order,
of which the effects still in progress at the present time will
of course form the last term ; and finally, comparing the whole
together, with the view of observing whether they all indicate
a uniform and constant operation of the same causes, acting
•with the same intensity, and under the same circumstances ; or
rather evince that there has been a gradual change in these
respects, and that the successive periods have often given rise
to such new circumstances, as must have in a very great de-
gree modified the original forces.
    This second method, appearing to me more strictly philoso-
phical, I shall at present adopt; but I would here for once
observe, that the geologists whose cause I advocate, seem from
the frequent employment of the phrases " existing causes" and
"the uniformity of Nature" to lie under a misconception in Mr.
L.'smind; as though they speculated on causes of a different
order from any with which we are acquainted, and almost
reasoned on the supposition of different laws of nature
Whereas I conceive both parties equally ascribe geological
effects to known causes, viz. to the action of water, and of vol-
canic power    : only those with whom I class myself maintain,
that much which has resulted from aqueous action, e. g. the
excavation of many valleys, indicates rather the violent action
of mighty diluvial currents, than effects which do or can result
from the present drainage, by the actual rivers, of the waters
descencing from the atmosphere in rain, &c. to which Mr.
Lyell looks exclusively. As I shall hope to show, that on every
possible geological hypothesis, which either Mr. L. or any one
else can embrace, it must be allowed that such violent currents
must have swept over our continents, as it is probable, at several
                                                         periods

                 bearing on theoretical Speculations.           361
 periods  ; the only question, I must confess, appears to me to be,
 whether we prefer embracing an adequate or an inadequate cause.
 In like manner as to volcanic agency, we are both of us
 equally ignorant as to the cause of this power; but surely
 whatever that cause may be, there can be nothing unphiloso-
 phical in supposing that it might have been capable of acting
 with greater energy, when the materials constituting the crust
of the earth were only beginning to be deposited, than at
present, when the whole weight and resistance of the actual
solid crust opposes it. Whatever were the muscular power of
 Atlas, he was probably capable of more violent exertion
in his unfettered state, than he was after Jupiter had buried
his limbs beneath the mass of iEtna, the " column of the
heaven."
   I shall now, then, enter on my proposed examination of
those phaenomena of geology which seem to bear most directly
on theoretical speculations, stating each as shortly as possible,
and then appending (under each article) the observations
which it appears to me to suggest.
   I. The phenomenon which may claim our earliest atten-
tion is the general form of the terraqueous globe as a sphe-
roid of rotation.     This undoubtedly appears to indicate, that,
at the time when it assumed that figure, the mass must have
been (at least in great measure) in a fluid state.
   Observations.  —  If so, there will remain before us only the
following possible alternative; at present, either the globe does,
or it does not, retain this original fluidity.    I will say a few
words on either branch of this alternative.
   If it shall be considered as most probable that the globe
has now lost the fluidity which once pervaded a sufficient
portion of its mass to account for this figure, the whole
argument must surely at once be conceded in favour of those
geologists who maintain that the causes which produced the
geological convulsions acted under circumstances essentially
different from the present; for nothing can well be more dif-
ferent than a fluid and a solid globe.
   But it may be maintained, on the other hand, that the flu-
idity of the central mass still remains, on which the crust of
the surface floats; and it may be argued that the extensive
oscillations of earthquakes, often affecting such vast portions
of the surface, afford countenance to this idea.      On this sup-
position we may inquire whether this fluidity be igneous, or
aqueous; but that it cannot be the latter, the ascertained spe-
cific gravity of the planet seems to demonstrate    : allow it then
[argumenti causa) to be igneous; we shall thus have a central
nucleus in a state of igneous fluidity, which has been gradually

we possibly suppose that the physical circumstances were at
all  similar at the earliest period, before a single deposit had in-
crusted this igneous mass; and at present, when it is buried
beneath an accumulated crust of such vast thickness, which
at once offers so great a resistance to any action of the sub-
jacent igneous fluid ; and must also in its formation have been
accompanied by so great a refrigeration of the surface?

LVI. Some Remarks on the Advantages which might be expect-
    ed to be derived from the Formation of Artificial Climates in
    this Country ; showing their Value to a numerous Class of
    Invalids, the Conditions which should determine their Shape,
    Size, Locality,   Arrangement and Structure, their first Cost,
    annual Expense, and, the 'probable pecuniary Benefit which
    would result to Persons embarking Capital in such a Specu-
    lation.   By Mr.    J. S. Langton.*
 FT    is universally admitted that the English climate is too se-
-*    vere and too changeable for persons of delicate constitu-
tions having a tendency to consumption or decline; hence the
expediency of such invalids resorting to warmer climates, a
remedy which in most cases is only to be obtained either by
a total separation from all kindred and acquaintance, or by
causing a whole family to leave their country, perhaps for-
saking an estate, or relinquishing a business, for the exclusive
benefit of one of its members. The fatigues of a long journey
or voyage have to be encountered, medical advice has for a
time to be suspended, and when renewed has to be procured
from one who       is a stranger to the constitution of his patient.
 If therefore a possibility exists of offering to invalids so cir-
 cumstanced a climate equally mild and salubrious to that of
 Italy, in the midst of their relatives and friends, and within
reach of their accustomed physician, it must be presumed that
 many would gladly avail themselves of such a blessing.
    In proceeding to show how such a desideratum is to be ob-
 tained, it is obvious that to mitigate the severity of winter, or
 to regulate the variable temperature of other seasons, a space
must be inclosed, and the separation of the air occupying that
space from the external atmosphere must be so effected, that
nothing injurious to health may be occasioned, either by the
inclusion of noxious vapours, or by the exclusion of such por-
tions of light and air as are conducive to health. And as the

more spacious      the volume of air thus inclosed is, the more
pure   it will be,  and the less subject to sudden variations of
temperature, it    would appear to be the interest of a number
of families to unite in having a large inclosed space common
to them all ; thus not only affording themselves ample room
for exercise, but rendering their habitations more cheerful, by
presenting opportunities for social intercourse without a ne-
cessity for transgressing the bounds of their favoured retreat.
   This leads to the consideration of what form such an esta-
blishment ought to assume. If difficulties and expenses of ex-
ecution were not an object, perhaps a circle would be the best
which could be devised the difficulties, however, and waste in
                          ;
the construction of buildings on a circular plan are so great,
and the disadvantages in furnishing them so manifest, that a
square would appear on the whole to be the most convenient
form that could be adopted. As to size, it should be suffici-
ently large to admit of a drive, that carriage exercise might
be taken by those who were unequal to greater fatigue.
   Three hundred feet square appears to be the least space
that would afford that advantage, and also allow a small
shrubbery to be appropriated to each house for seclusion and
for amusement. A larger space would be desirable but it must
                                                       ;
be remembered that-not only the first outlay, but a permanent
annual expense is proportioned to the size of the inclosed area,
these disadvantages being increased not in proportion to the
length of a side, but to the square of that length. It is obvious
that such a mass of buildings could only be erected where
there is an uninterrupted space of at least five hundred feet
square, not subject to any thoroughfare.        The situation for
such an establishment should be dry and airy, and placed in
that neighbourhood where it might be expected the majority
of the friends and relatives of its inmates should reside, that
the greater chances might be afforded them of receiving the
visits and attentions of their friends ;  it should also be conve-
nient for the attendance of the first medical practitioners.
Fulfilling these conditions will fortunately in   London produce
another advantage hardly less essential, viz. a comparatively
clear atmosphere, from the prevailing winds blowing from the
south-west, and consequently not being contaminated with
the smoke and dirt of the place until after they have passed
over the dwellings of those residing westward.
   In arranging a new and experimental establishment of this
nature, it would be politic to have it so laid out that persons
of different degrees of wealth might be able to avail them-
selves of its advantages, lest the risk should be incurred of
portions of it being unoccupied if it included only the largest

 description of houses for it must be borne in mind that a con-
                        ;
 siderable sum must be annually expended in maintaining the
 required temperature in addition therefore to the occasional

 suspension of rent, common to all building speculations, the
 proprietor would here have his quota of the general expendi-
 ture thrown upon him, aud at a time when he is least able to
 afford it.   The society must be preserved select, not so much
 by heavy expenses as by well regulated by-laws, to which all
 the proprietors and inmates of the establishment must be sub-
ject, and without which it would be absolutely impossible for
 a community so circumstanced to exist. To obtain the above
 object without interfering with the strength or simplicity of
 the construction, it would be expedient that only two sizes of
 houses should be adopted, and that two of the smaller should,
 with their party wall, only equal the internal size of one of
 the larger; the larger being placed about the middle of each
 side of the square, as the most enviable site, and the smaller
houses being situated towards the angles. This very great
disproportion in size would fix about thirty-two feet, exclu-
sive of strong party walls, as the most desirable length of
front for each large house; a longer front would seem to occa-
sion their being unnecessarily large, a shorter would too much
contract the fronts of the smaller houses.       The external an-
gles of the square might be either wholly cut off from all com-
munication with the interior, or they might be hotels or sets
of chambers communicating with it only by passages, and
subject to special restrictions.      The external sides of the
square would form streets, affording access for carriages to
every house, that a carriage access to the interior of the
square might be exclusively confined to its inhabitants the ;
public being either wholly shut out from the interior, or ad-
mitted on such terms, and under such regulations, as a due
regard to the comforts and interests of its inhabitants should
dictate.
   As to construction, the houses should be firmly built, that
the lateral pressure occasioned by the action of a strong wind
on the vast extent of the interior roof should not disturb their
stability ; they should be also fire-proof, that the whole esta-
blishment may be secure from the annoyance and danger
which the destruction of a single house would otherwise occa-
sion ; and as it is proposed that the interior should be filled
with the choicest collection of foreign fruit-trees and other
exotics, it is obvious that a violent heat might destroy plants
in a single hour, which it had been the work of even centu-
ries to bring to maturity.
   The method thus proposed of heightening the interest of
                                                              the

the place by blending the works of nature in their rarest and
most beautiful forms with those of art when devoted to that
purest and noblest of all worldly purposes,    —  the alleviation of
human suffering, would occasion a necessity for keeping the
ventilation of the houses wholly distinct from that of the area
or garden, that no air which had been deprived of any por-
tion of its salubrious properties, either from the action of ve-
getable life, or the decomposition of dead vegetable matter,
should be inhaled, except when the enjoyment of exercise
would render such a circumstance unavoidable, and when the
doing so, to an extent not necessarily otherwise than infinitely
trifling, could hardly even in theory be deemed disadvanta-
geous.     In roofing over this inclosed space, such materials
should be used as admit of offering the least obstructions to
light and ventilation airiness of effect should be gained with-
                       ;
out sacrificing strength, and cheapness without decreasing
durability   : these conditions obviously suggest iron as a fit
material to be largely employed, especially for all columnar
supports, as being cast hollow they would also serve as
spouts for conveying down the rain-water; and their slight
variations of length from alternations of temperature, instead
of being a disadvantage, might on the contrary be used as a
self-acting means of regulating the quantity of ventilation, by
having many of the glazed frames swing on their centres, and
firmly connecting the short arms of levers attached to them
with the bases of the columns by long rods of wood or other
material not subject to practical variations of length by mode-
rate changes of temperature the difference of length thus ob-
                               :
tained in the present case would be about one hundredth of an
inch for every three degrees by Fahrenheit's thermometer, a
maximum of height is obtained by this material with a mini-
mum of diameter. As regards lateral connections for the pur-
pose of giving sufficient stability to the roof to resist winds, it
would be desirable to form them either of timbers fixed hori-
zontally in right lines and crossing each other at right angles,
the extreme ends abutting against the party walls of each
house, or of iron ribs so curved as to admit of their acting
like springs, in so adjusting themselves by extension or con-
traction that the distances between their ends should not vary
with the temperature.       Iron thus employed would unques-
tionably admit of more elegant forms in detail than any other
material to be procured at any reasonable cost and in such a
                                                    ;
construction what would be most beautiful in detail would be
the most likely to produce the best effect as a whole.       If iron
was the material exclusively adopted, the roof of a glass-house
in Messrs. Pellat's establishment, designed by the late Mr.

 Tredgold,   is admirably calculated for showing the principle
to be borne in    mind in contriving the manner of connecting it
 together. The vast length, however, of the sum of each series
 of ribs, and the considerable variations of bulk to which iron
is subject from changes of temperature, would present most
formidable difficulties in endeavouring to obtain stability with
long connected lines of that material, particularly if those con-
nections must be confined at each end there would be re-
                                            ;
quired not only such minute accuracy as to dimensions, but
also such exquisite nicety in rendering all corresponding parts
exactly the same in point of flexibility and elastic power, for
securing the whole from general derangement of stability by
any partial excess of strength, that such a task would be hope-
less in theory, and extremely doubtful as to its result in prac-
tice.
   The   best arrangement would appear to be to connect firm-
ly all the tops of the  columns with each other, and with the
party walls of the houses, by timbers something similar in
form to the yards of ships; their transverse sections should
be elliptical in about the proportion of fourteen inches to thir-
teen, and their greatest diameter placed horizontally stiffness
                                                        ;
might be thus most effectually and ceconomically gained, as
the bearings of such beams would be divided by suspension
from the roof, and their own weight would prevent them from
curving upwards when acted upon by a compressing strain
their suspension should be adjusted horizontal when the tem-
perature was at a mean elevation. Upon the tops of columns
thus firmly retained in their places, there would be no more
difficulty in placing a number of detached roofs of iron or
other material, additional labour and scaffolding excepted,
than there would be in placing such roofs on the ground be-
neath.    The glass roofs would range on a level with those of
the houses, except that it might be desirable to have an addi-
tional story on the north side, to prevent the warmed strata of
air being quite so rapidly carried away from the surface of
the glass in the coldest weather. Each division of roof would
be about thirty-three feet six inches square, and in form would
be two roofs intersecting each other at right angles, thus giv-
ing to each house an avenue to the one opposite.          For the
skeleton framing of each division of roof, cast-iron, jointed at
the ridges and points of intersection, might be appropriated
in exceedingly elegant forms, with the unusually concurrent
advantages of durability and cheapness. The glazed frames
might be either of iron or wood the former material would
                                    ;
admit of their being so made as least to obstruct the light, and
is the most durable; wood, however, possesses a great advan-

               Mr. Langton on   Artificial Climates.          367
tage for this purpose, from being so bad a conductor of heat
the annual expenses of keeping up the required temperature
would from this circumstance be reduced about eight per cent
by using wood in preference to iron for this purpose.
    In estimating the cost of such an establishment, it appears
quite unnecessary to calculate the expense of building the
houses, that expense having no reference to the peculiar ex-
penses of the place, except their being fire-proof, which cir-
cumstance, from cast-iron being at present so remarkably
cheap, and from such quantities of exactly similar castings
being required, would add extremely little to the cost of con-
structing houses of the same class without the advantage of
that protection to life and property.      The first expenses pe-
culiar to this establishment would be a glazed roof, if three
hundred feet square, of rather more than two acres, its fram-
 ing and supports, and a very extensive apparatus for keeping
 up an artificial temperature. The extent of glazed frames
 would not exceed one hundred thousand superficial feet; this
 at two shillings per foot for labour and materials would make
 the glazed framing amount to ten thousand pounds.             The
 pillars, with the extending beams and skeleton frame of roof,
 might a little exceed five thousand pounds and the apparatus
                                               :
 for warming and ventilating the area would rather exceed
 five thousand pounds more.        The total cost therefore, when
 painted and finished, may be expected at the outside not to
 exceed twenty-five thousand pounds, or about seven hundred
 pounds for each double house and this sum would doubtless
                                  ;
 allow a sufficient surplus with which to stock the ground, at
 least with vines, which intwining themselves up the columns
 and crossing the spaces above, would afford shade by their
 foliage as well as refreshment by their fruit.    As for plants of
  rarity and value, it may be found that individual liberality
  may   render the application of capital for their purchase whol-
  ly uncalled for,  nor should the means be wanting of perma-
  nently recording acts of that nature.
     The annual expense of keeping up the required tempera-
  ture will usually be in London about fourteen hundred pounds;
  each foot of glazed surface requiring about one-fourth of a
  bushel of coals per annum.        This calculation assumes the
   temperature to be kept up to about fifty-two degrees Fah-
  renheit during the winter months it also supposes that no
                                        ;
   more ventilation is allowed in very cold weather than what
   escapes between the laps of the glass when well fitted, more
   ventilation being only allowed for in mild weather; while in
   hot weather most of the roof might be opened. The total ad-
   ditional expense, including interest for money sunk, may
                                                           therefore

 therefore be estimated at about seventy-five pounds per an-
 num on each double house, a sum but trifling when compared
 with the money at present sacrificed in obtaining that degree
 of warmth and regularity of temperature which the establish-
 ment above described may be        anticipated to supply.   It may
 also be fairly expected that such an inclosed space       would be
 capable, under good management, of producing fruit to no
 inconsiderable amount ; and the privacy of the houses would
 be so secured by the appropriation of a small shrubbery to
 each, that, without materially detracting from the comfort of
 the place, a considerable revenue might be derived both from
 persons in the vicinity taking annual tickets for the privilege
of promenading there       m  severe weather, and from the admis-
sion of strangers for the gratification of their curiosity.
    Persons embarking capital in such a speculation, would, if
successful, possess a description of property endowed with
such peculiar advantages as it would be impossible to com-
pete with by their extension to any house property already
erected; while even assuming that from prejudice or some
cause not capable of being anticipated it should be deemed
expedient to uncover the interior, they would still possess a
delightful square, surrounded by excellent houses, having its
grounds perfectly retired, and secure from those violent cur-
rents of wind to which squares laid out in the usual manner
are so peculiarly liable.       Nor is it to be supposed that Go-
vernment would look with apathy upon a speculation, which
would not only be a convenience to the public, but which, as
far as it was carried, would have a direct tendency to decrease
the number of absentees.         There is probably no speculation
to which the Government would be more disposed to grant
assistance in the way of a charter, particularly as it would be
in perfect accordance with the prescribed rule which restricts
charters to those undertakings which cannot be conducted
with advantage by individual enterprise.

      In some cases the name given on our globes to a single
 star is the    Arabic name of the whole Constellation, as a An-
 dromedae, Alpherat, a corruption of Al Pharas, the Horse,
 the name for the constellation Pegasus; a Ursas Majoris,
 Dubbe, from Al Dub, the Bear. In other instances the names
 are so much corrupted that it is difficult to trace their origin
 as a. Orionis, of which the Arabic name is Jed Al Gjauzd Al-
 Jumna, the Right Hand of Orion, and which is called on our
 globes Betelgeur, in the Alphonsine Tables Beldelgenze.
     Of some of the names on the globes we are unable to trace
 the origin, as Mesartim, Albireo; and the meaning of some of
the interpretations given by Hyde, is not very clear.
     " The Arabic names of the stars are to be differently con-
sidered according as they are more or less ancient.         The less
ancient are the names of signs, and parts of the same, such as
the limbs of the animals and the like, which have been trans-
planted into the Arabic from the Greek.          But the more an-
cient are the names of some conspicuous stars occurring
here and there in many of the constellations, which have not
been received from the Greeks, but were devised and given
originally and in remote antiquity by the Arabs themselves.
Of this kind also are the names of the lesser constellations
which are found in the greater ones, as Awwd in the Virgin,
Benat Al Na'sh in the Great Bear, Al Himarein in Cancer,
and many others, which were altogether unknown to the
Greeks." Hyde, Comment, p. 5. Some of the names appear
to have reference to Astrology, as Sa'd Al Homdm, Fortuna
Herois, &c.
     The Arabic names of the constellations in Ulugh Beigh's
Catalogue are translations of the Greek names in Ptolemy: in
one instance, however, they appear to have fallen into error
by supposing Bootes to be cwro tou £o«j>, a clamando, wherein
they call this constellation Auwd} Vociferator.

Flora Devoniensis': or    A descriptive Catalogue of Plants, growing wild
   in the County of Devon, arranged both according to the Linncean and
   Natural Systems, with an account of their geographical distribution,
   8(c.   By the Rev. J. P.  Jones and   J. F.  Kingston.
UNDER         this title we have to introduce to the notice of our readers a
      Flora of one of the most interesting of our English counties, dis-
tinguished, as it is justly observed, " by the extent of its coasts, the
variety of its soils, and the diversity of its surface."   We  extract from
the Preface a passage which will best show the nature of the under-
taking  :
   " The work    is divided into two parts ; the first exhibiting the Lin-
nsean,the second the Natural method of arrangement under the latter,
                                                         :
the different orders of the cryptogamous plants will be found care-
fully distributed according to the latest investigations and discove-
ries       A minute attention has been paid to the essential characters
of the genera and species, and any thing like repetition or superfluous
observations studiously avoided. The references have also been
limited as much as possible to a few of the best and most accessible
works on the subject, and have only occasionally been increased
where any confusion or discrepancy in the names or descriptions seems
to have obviously required it ; so that we trust the arrangement of
the whole has been rendered as simple and concise as it could well
be, without incurring the charge of deficiency or obscurity.
   " To complete the subject, the relative proportions of the different
natural families and their geographical distribution in the county
have been added at the end of the second part."
   In addition to this we may add, that the localities of the different
plants appear to be very full and precise, and to have received all the
attention that so important a feature in works of this sort requires.
   A  good clear outline of the extent and geological character of the
county, and summary views of vegetable geography generally, and
that of Great Britain in particular, are introduced, as well as a com-
prehensive statement of the number of species in each natural family
included in the County Flora, and the relative proportions they bear
to each other ; thus clearly illustrating the vegetable character of the
county, and showing its riches and deficiencies ; whilst at the same time
useful data are given for instituting more general comparisons and
drawing more comprehensive deductions.
   We   could have wished that the authors of this work, as they follow
Sir James Smith in their general arrangement, had consulted his last
work, " The English Flora :" but we do not perceive a single reference
to this performance, nor to his new genera or species.           We   would
not have quarrelled with them if they had rejected his alterations after
due examination ; but we really fear they have not looked into his
more recent labours, and that they have contented themselves with
" English Botany," and some early edition of his " Compendium."
   We   think too they have not acted discreetly in printing twice over
the specific characters and habitats of the phsenogamous plants in
                                                                       order

   order to present the reader with the natural arrangement. The
   whole book indeed is printed far too expensively for a local Flora] and
   the authors probably would have done themselves, as well as the pub-
   lic, more justice, if they had condensed their matter within a smaller
   compass. It is the extensive diffusion of science that will do good to
   the present generation ; and to effect this, the spirit of a book should
   not be diluted too copiously.
       But after all, we may venture to recommend this work to those
   lovers of  Nature who are resident in Devon, and to the numerous
   visitors that its   romantic and picturesque scenery and genial climate
   are constantly attracting to      its shores.

     [In the Phil. Mag. and Annals, N.S. vol. iv. p. 372, we gave the
  characters of six new species of Unio, as described by Mr. Lea in
  a former paper we shall now present to our readers the characters
                     :
  of the shells described by this zealous conchologist in the memoir
  before us,    prefacing them with an extract from his introductory
  remarks relating      to the arrangement and groups of the Naiades.']
     It is the opinion of some eminent conchologists that the family of
  the Naiades possesses but one genus, and that the genera into which
 it is at present divided are only species, and the species varieties.
 Were we to adopt this division, we should be in a worse dilemma
 than before ; for we can scarcely imagine bivalves more different from
 each other in form than are some of our trans-AUeghany species of
 Unio.
     How totally different is the rectus of Lamarck from the irroratus?
 (nobis).     The first is four times the width of its length, whilst the
 latter is longer than broad. The one is broad rayed, in fine specimens;
 the other possesses dotted lines universally.           The triangularis of
 Barnes is entirely dissimilar to the nasulus of Say, as is also the
 circulus, herein described, from the lanceolatus (nobis) ; and the same
 may be said of plicatus and pictorum. Two species could be scarcely
more unlike than the smooth and radiated siliquoideus of Barnes and
 the beautiful tuberculated lacrymosus (nobis) ; and the same remark
 may be applied to the cylindricus and alatus of that excellent con-
chologist Mr. Say.          Many other species could be thus contrasted,
but I deem the above sufficient, upon examination, to prove the just-
ness of my remarks, and the necessity, in the present state of our
knowledge, to retain the species, whatever maybe the changes in the
genera*.                                                             7.  Unio
    * In a letter addressed to     me by William Cooper, Esq., an intelligent

 subject to certain variations, but permanent within fixed limits, seems to me
 the most rational opinion, although some of our most judicious naturalists
 think otherwise. Your account of the animal of the U. irroratus affords a
 strong argument in favour of this belief; for it proves that to be, beyond
 doubt, as distinct a species as any in any class of animals. Yet this may
 always be known with certainty by the shell, which, though so well charac-
 terized, is not, however, more different from the rest of the genus, than they
 are from each other, and frequently still less so. If, therefore, this difference
 is found to be constantly indicative of a species in one instance, it must also
 be in others. I believe that our lakes and rivers contained the same form of
  shells at the creation and ever since that they do at this day. If they are
  hermaphrodite per se, as is said of them, it could not be otherwise ; and if
  the contrary were admitted, natural history would not deserve the name of
  a science."

   Remarks. Objections will most likely be made to the introduction
of a new genus into a family acknowledged already to be in great
confusion, and presenting many and various difficulties.           The forma-
tion of the genus Symphynoia, it is hoped, will rather be conducive
to a diminution of that difficulty, by a division which all must acknow-
ledge to be as natural as any of those of the family. The distinctive
characteristic of this genus is the testaceous connection of the two
valves of the shell above the hinge.            I therefore remove from the
existing genera all the connate shells without regard to the forms of
their teeth, believing, that should this family be hereafter remodelled,
it will present only two natural genera; one having a testaceous con-
nection of the valves, the other dispossessed of it. The difficulties
attending the adopted genera of the Na'iades> viz. Unio of Bruguiere,
Hyria, Anodonta, Iridina, Castalia* of Lamarck, Dipsas of Leach,
and Alasmodonta of Say, have been mentioned by two eminent En-
glish conchologists, W. Swainson and G. B. Sowerby, as well as in
America by P. H. Nicklin. Mr. Sowerby (Zool. Journ. vol. i. p. 55.)
has reunited them under the name of Unio, of which he makes two
great divisions.      1. Without teeth.       2. With teeth; and these are
each subdivided into " winged" and " not winged ;'" which are again
divided into the various forms of teeth, or the " hinge line." The
evident objection to this arrangement is the difficulty of deciding
upon the passage from the "not winged" to the "winged." Thus
we do not find the Anodonta trapezialis and Anodonta glauca, which
Lamarck describes as " compresso-alata,'' mentioned among the
                                                    1
"winged," while we have " Anodon alatus of Swainson and La-
marck," which is not described in the " Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans
Vertebres f."
   It is evident that the apparatus for depositing the calcareous and
epidermidal matter on the elevated and connected wing must be differ-
   * This genus was placed by Lamarck in the family Trigoncea, certainly
with no propriety. It has been placed by Sowerby and Latreille among the
Naiades, and here must be considered as a species of Unio, and not a genus.
The observant M. de Blainville has placed Castalia and Hyria among the
 Uniones, and Iridina and Dipsas among the Anodontce. Castalia ambigua is
undoubtedly a fiuviatile shell, and approaches most closely to the U. trian-
gularis.   The teeth are those of the Unio, and it differs only in its longi-
tudinal furrows from the general characters of the Unio.
   f Sav describes his An. gibbosa as being alated.

ent from that of the inhabitant of free valves, to which it has been
denied by Nature.
   Lamarck and Barnes both mention in their description of the U.
alatus of Say, that M. Le Sueur thought this shell should constitute
a new genus. Since that time so many connate shells have come to
my notice, that I feel satisfied the science of conchology will be sub-
served by the institution of this natural genus, which will embrace, in
all probability, several others, viz. Hyria of Lamarck, Dipsas of Leach,
and Cristaria, Prisodon, and Paxyodon of Schumacher, all of which,
when they shall be found perfect, will most probably turn out to be
connate shells. Lamarck suspected his Hyria to be connate, like the
 U. alatus ; for when describing that species, he says, " Nos Hyries
auraient-elles une pareille reunion a la carene de leur corselet ?"
Indeed the fact can scarcely be doubted.

         CHARRING OF WOOD AT LOW TEMPERATURES.
         Charles May, chemist of Ampthill, has sent me some
MR.mens of wood converted                                           speci-
                                  into nearly perfect charcoal, at a very
low but long continued heat. The pieces, he informs me, are part of the
bottom of a tub, which held about 130 gallons, and which had been in
use in his laboratory about three years and a half, and almost constantly
worked for boiling a weak solution of common salt, generally with an
open steam pipe, and sometimes, though rarely, with a coil the tem-
                                                                :

perature was seldom higher than 216 or 220°, and the vessel was
lined with tin rolled into sheets about 1-1 6th of an inch thick, and
nailed to the inside ; the joints, however, were not so good as to pre-
vent the liquid from getting between the metal and the wood.           Mr.
May states also, that he had long since remarked, that on making
extracts with steam of very moderate pressure, all the apparent effects
of burning might be produced, but that he was not prepared to find
so complete a carbonization of wood by steam        ; the vessel was made
partly of fir and partly of ash, the former of which was most perfectly
reduced to the state of charcoal.                                  R. P.
                       LIMITS TO VAPORIZATION.
   A  paper on the above-named subject by Mr. Faraday was published
in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1826       ; when the expe-
riments therein mentioned were published, others relating to the same
subject were arranged, but which required great length of time for
the development of their results.     After a lapse of four years the ex-
periments were examined, and the results are now stated.

 384              Intelligence    and Miscellaneous     Articles.
    In September       1826, several stoppered bottles were made per-
 fectly clean,   and several wide tubes close     at one extremity so as to
 form smaller vessels capable of being placed within the bottles, were
 prepared.     Then selected substances were put into the tubes, and so-
 lutions of other selected substances into the bottles      :  the tubes were
 placed in the bottles so that nothing could pass from the one sub-
 stance to the other, except by way of evaporation. The stoppers were
 introduced, the bottles tied over carefully and put away in a dark safe
 cupboard, where, except for an occasional examination, they have
 been left for nearly four years, during which time such portion of the
 substances as could vaporize have been free to act and produce
 accumulation of their specific effects.
    In this way it was found that neither sulphate of soda nor muriate
 of barytes were volatilized ; the same was the case with solution of
 nitrate of silver   and chloride of sodium     ; diluted sulphuric acid   and
 common     salt ;  solution of potash and arsenious acid in pieces        and
 powder ; diluted sulphuric acid and muriate of ammonia ; solution of
 persulphate of iron and ferrocyanate of potash in crystals ; solution
 of potash and fragments of calomel ; solution of iodide of potash, and
 chloride of lead ; solution of muriate of lime and crystals of carbonate
 of soda ; solution of persulphate of copper and crystals of ferrocya-
 nate of potash;   — from these experiments it would appear, Mr. Faraday
observes, " that there is no reason to o believe that water or its vapours
confer volatility, even in the slightest degree, upon those substances
 which alone have their limits of vaporization at temperatures above
ordinary occurrence, and that consequently natural evaporation can
produce no effects of this kind on the atmosphere."
    From other experiments, Mr. Faraday concludes that "nitrate of
ammonia, corrosive sublimate, oxalic acid, and perhaps oxalate of
ammonia, are substances which evolve vapour at common tempera-
tures."     Journal of the Royal Institution, October, 1830.
                     COMPOSITION OF GUNPOWDER.
   Dr. Ure has analysed various samples of gunpowder, and the follow-
ing are the results of his investigation      :

   " The process," observes Dr. Ure, " most commonly practised in
the analysis of gunpowder seems to be tolerably exact.            The nitre is
first separated by hot distilled water, evaporated and weighed. A
minute    loss of salt may be counted on from its known volatility with
boiling water. I have evaporated always on a steam bath.            It is pro-
bable that a small proportion of the lighter and looser constituent
of gunpowder, the carbon, flies off in the operations of corning and
dusting.     Hence analysis may show a small deficit of charcoal below
                                                                           the

 the synthetic proportions originally mixed.             The residuum of char-
 coal and sulphur      left   on the double filter-paper being well dried by the
heat of ordinary steam, is estimated as usual by the difference of
weight of the inner and outer papers. This residuum is cleared off
into a platina capsule with a tooth-brush, and digested in a dilute so-
lution of potash at a boiling temperature.            Three parts of potash are
fully sufficient to dissolve out one of sulphur.         When the above solu-
tion is thrown on a filter, and washed first with a very dilute solution
of potash boiling hot, then with boiling water, and afterwards dried,
the carbon will remain ; the weight of which deducted from that of the
mixed powder will show the amount of sulphur."
   Dr. Ure says that he has tried other and more direct modes of es-
timating the sulphur, but with little satisfaction       ;  such as dissolving it
by means of hot oil of turpentine, its conversion into sulphuric acid
by the use of nitric acid and chlorine, &c.
   " If we inquire," says Dr. Ure, " how the maximum gaseous volume
is to be produced from the chemical reaction of the elements of nitre
on charcoal and sulphur, we shall find it to be by the generation of
carbonic oxide and sulphurous acid, with the disengagement of nitro-
gen. This will lead us to the following proportions of these consti-
tuents   :
      1 prime equivalent of nitre                 102      75*00 per cent.
      1     do.       do.           sulphur.... 16          11-77
      3 do.           do.           charcoal ..    18       13-23
                                                  136    100-00
   The     [acid of the] nitre contains five primes of oxygen, of which
three,  combining with the three of charcoal, will furnish three of car-
bonic acid gas, while the remaining two will convert the one prime of
sulphur into sulphurous acid gas. The single prime of nitrogen is,
therefore, in this view disengaged alone.
   The gaseous volume, on this supposition, evolved from 136 grains
of gunpowder, equivalent in bulk to 75 grains of water, or three-tenths
of a cubic inch, will be, at the atmospheric temperature, as follows          :
                                                Grains.         Cubic Inches.
           Carbonic oxide                         42       =       141-6
           Sulphurous acid                        32       =        47*2
           Nitrogen                                14      =        47°4
being an expansion of one volume into 787*3. But as the temperature
of the gases at the instant of their combustive formation must be in-
candescent, this volume may be safely estimated at three times the
above amount, or considerably upwards of two thousand times the
bulk of the explosive solid."           Ibid.
                       PURPLE POWDER OF             CASSIUS.
   M. Buisson      states that in preparing this substance, he found that
the solution of gold always contains the same muriate, though it may
be mixed with more or less acid ; but he observes, that the solution of
tin, even when well prepared, contains two different muriates, and it
is upon their co-existence, within certain limits, that he conceives the

goodness of the solution to be owing. The experiments upon which
this opinion is founded are the following.
   1st. The solution of protomuriate       of tin, as neutral as possible
when mixed with a solution of gold,        gives a maroon, brown, blue,
green or metallic precipitate, according to its concentration and pro-
portion, but the colour is never purple.
   2nd. Pure permuriate of tin, whether acid or not, produces no
change in the same solution of gold, whatever be the proportions em-
ployed.
   3rd. A mixture of one part of protomuriate, nearly neutral, and
two parts of permuriate of tin, with one part of muriate of gold, in-
stantly occasions a fine purple colour.       Founded on these facts, M.
Buisson gives the following process for obtaining the purple powder    :
   4th. Dissolve about 15 grains of granulated tin in muriatic acid,
either with or without heat, taking care that the solution is neutral.
   5th. Prepare a solution of permuriate of tin by dissolving about 30
grains of tin in a sufficient quantity of aqua regia, composed of three
parts of nitric acid and one part of muriatic acid ; taking care that the
solution  is neutral, and free from protomuriate, which is determined
by  its giving no precipitate with a solution of gold.
   6th. To prepare the solution of gold, dissolve about 108 grains of
gold in aqua regia, composed of one part of nitric acid and six parts
of muriatic acid ; the solution should be nearly or quite neutral.
   Dilute the solution of gold, so that a pint of it contains about 15
grains of the metal.      Pour in the permuriate of tin and mix them
well, then add drop by drop the protomuriate, till the required tint
is produced, remembering that the protomuriate causes a brown,
and the permuriate a violet colour, and intermediate proportions give
a red. Wash the precipitate as quickly as possible, that no action
may take place between the salts of tin and the precipitate, which
alters its colour.

found in commerce and MM. Latour de Trie and Lefrangois, students
                     ;
in pharmacy, have lately detected it in a salt used in the Canton of
Sezanne, in the Department de la Marne. It appears to have occa-
sioned serious accidents ; and was submitted to examination, which
showed that the salt contained a quarter of a grain of deutoxide of
arsenic in an ounce.     The authors purchased salt in various parts of
Paris, but did not detect arsenic in any one sample.        Ibid.
                     PHOSPHURET OF SULPHUR.
   When   the protochloride of phosphorus      is exposed to the action of
sulphuretted hydrogen, heat is evolved, and there is formed a solid
yellow substance, without any apparent crystalline form, and adhering
strongly to the glass.     This is a phosphuret of sulphur. At common
temperatures it decomposes water, and at length disappears in it,
forming sulphuretted hydrogen and phosphoric acid. Its atomic con-
stitution is probably
                2 atoms phosphorus     +   3 atoms sulphur.

  AMMONIACAL DEUTOCHLORIDE OF TITANIUM. BY M. ROSE.
   When dry ammoniacal gas is passed over deutochloride of titanium,
there  is strong action, accompanied with the evolution of heat, and a
brownish red powder      is formed.    This powder combines with the por-
tion of deutochloride which remains unacted upon, and is not further
attacked by the ammoniacal gas         •
                                         the mixture is to be well shaken,
and when the ammonia, as detected by the smell, is in excess, the

ON AN ALLEGED ERROR IN THE CALCULATIONS OF THE LATE
                          ECLIPSE OF THE MOON.
      To   the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     Gentlemen,                Bristol, Small-Street Court, Sept. 28, 1830.
   L  take the liberty of troubling you with the following letter,
which is a copy (or nearly so) of one sent to the Literary Gazette,
which the editor declined inserting. I submit it to you for inser-
tion or rejection, as you may think fit.
   The occasion of it was briefly as follows. The late eclipse of
the " labouring moon" had given birth to a couple of articles in
the Literary Gazette, one by C. H.Adams of Edmonton; the other
by J. T. B. of Deptford, both complaining of great inaccuracy in the
calculations of our almanacs in relation to that eclipse, and re-
flecting discredit on the science of astronomj' itself.              The latter
gentleman says (Literary Gazette, 11th of September), after al-
luding to the unfavourable state of the weather on the evening of
the eclipse, " The only observation made was at 10 h 15 m , at which
time a portion of the western limb of the moon was distinctly seen
to be illuminated.   — 27'4 m after the time predicted for the beginning
of total darkness." ..." It is, however, due to the Nautical Al-
                       .
manac, and other British astronomical works of a similar nature,
to state that the times of the phenomena of this eclipse, as given by
them, agree nearly with those in the Connaissance des Terns and
Encke's Berlin Ephemeris, both of which are deservedly held in the
highest estimation." He then quotes from the computations of the
                                                                           three

              Intelligence  and Miscellaneous    Articles,             389
three Almanacs, to     show how very slightly they differ from each
other.   I  accordingly addressed the following to the Editor of the
Literary Gazette; viz.
      « Sir,                                    Bristol, Sept. 18, 1830.
   " The charges alleged against the accuracy of the Nautical Al-
manac, by your correspondents C. H. Adams of Edmonton, and
J. T. B. of Deptford, are of so serious a nature, as would be suffi-
cient, if properly substantiated, to destroy all future confidence in
the calculations of that work.
   " From the observations of both these gentlemen on the late
eclipse of the moon, it would seem that the actual commencement
of total darkness was at least half an hour later than the Almanac
had predicted and the close agreement between the calculations
                ;
of our Greenwich astronomers, and those at Paris and Berlin, must
indicate either that a typographical error had crept into all the
copies of the astronomical tables employed at those three Obser-
vatories, or that the science of astronomy itself, even in its pre-
sent advanced state, does not enable us to foretel the time of a con-
junction or opposition of the sun and moon to within half an hour
of the truth.
   " The first of these suppositions is easily refuted, by comparing
together, for a few days before and after the eclipse, the moon's
longitudes, as given in the Nautical Almanac,               which being
computed for every noon and midnight, afford a check on each
other, by forming a series of terms wherein an error, either
in the tables or the calculations, amounting to a few seconds
only, may be immediately detected, by the interruption occasioned
in the series, when examined by first, second, &c. differences.          I
have in this way compared the computations of the moon's longi-
tude for a day or two before and after the '2nd of September, and
find them perfectly consistent with each other.        The times of the
opposition also, and of the duration of total darkness, I find to be
correctly deduced from the series of the daily longitudes, &c. of the
sun and moon.
   "If, therefore, the assertions of these observers are to be depended
upon, we are reduced to the humiliating alternative of pronouncing
our best astronomical tables, with all their boasted accuracy, insuffi-
cient to determine the moon's place within a quarter of a degree
so that, had a ship's captain attempted to determine his longitude
at sea by the Almanac and lunar distances on either the 1st, 2nd,
 or 3rd of September, he must have been thrown out in his reckon-
 ing at least four hundred geographical miles     !
    " Happily, however, for the credit of astronomy, and the conso-
 lation of sea-faring men, I am able to contradict the whole of these
 statements by my own observations, made during the eclipse; pro-
 bably under a more propitious state of the atmosphere than these
 gentlemen were favoured with at Deptford and Edmonton. In
 order to verify the computations of our almanac-makers, I pro-
 cured an excellent compensated watch, and set it a few hours be-
 fore  commencing my     observations, by  my  friend  Mr, Jones's astro-
                                                                   nomical

nomical clock in this city, which is regulated by a transit instru-
ment, and compared the watch again on the following morning.
The clouds prevented my seeing any thing of the moon until about
11 o'clock; at which time, though still in the real shadow, she was
shining with comparative brightness, by the refracted light of the
earth's atmosphere.       Precisely at 18 minutes past 11, she began
to emerge from this partial illumination into the direct rays of the
sun; and allowing 10 m 20 s for the difference of longitude between
Bristol and Greenwich, we find the time of the emersion at Green,
wich to be 1 l h 28*3 m agreeing with the Almanac almost exactly.
                        ,
   " The refracted light thrown on the moon while in the earth's
shadow was so strong as to surprise every beholder and this light,
                                                          ;
no doubt, was the ignis fatuus which led your correspondents so
far astray.
   " Leaving, however, these gentlemen to explain their mistake in
the best manner they can, I may safely assert, without the smallest
fear of contradiction, that the predicted time of the emersion, at
least, was quite correct, several other persons present agreeing with
me as to that part of the phenomenon, and the same being further
confirmed by two scientific gentlemen, with whom I conversed on
the following day. I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
                                                   " Thos. G. Bunt."
   In his " Notices to Correspondents," the editor of the Literary
Gazette has acknowledged the receipt of another letter from a
Mr. Smith of Newry, confirming the truth of the predictions of the
Almanac in reference to the eclipse, and accounting for the mis-
take of Mr. Adams and J. T. B. in the same manner as 1 have done
above.
SOME REMARKS ON THE BUSHMEN OF THE ORANGE RIVER*.
    BY LEWIS LESLIE, ESQ. ASSISTANT SURGEON, 45TH RJEGT.
   In that neighbourhood f and along the Hornberg, purer exam-
                               ,
ples of that extraordinary race are perhaps nowhere to be found;
and whatever follows, regards only them, and may differ from any
account of other portions of the tribes along the African frontier.
Small in stature as the Hottentot race is, they are, in the quarter
mentioned, less than any where else, seldom exceeding five feet,
but of the most perfect symmetry they are active in their move-
                                         ;
ments, but indolent in disposition their colour is dark, but is ren-
                                       ;
dered still darker by filth ; their features are peculiarly forbidding,
on account of the great distortion of the bones of the face; and
the facial angle approaches considerably to that of the monkey.
The Bushman will seldom submit to coercion and restraint, if he    —
does, he becomes the Boor's most wretched menial, and perhaps is
worse treated than any slave in the world. In the state of liberty,
they dwell in kraals, under the authority of a chief, whose rank is
among them hereditary. The number in one kraal seldom exceeds
   * From  the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal.
   T The  writer refers to a military post, which was situated on a branch
of the Orange River, known by the name of Nurgariep, or Black River,
and close to the country inhabited by the Tambookies.
                                                                    thirty

thirty — men, women,       and children. Their dwellings are formed of
mats,  if in the plain, just large enough to creep into but they often
                                                           ;
reside in a high and ridgy mountain, under some projecting ledge
of rock, the approach to which is narrow and difficult. If attacked
there, they seldom flee.       They have no fear of death and, if pos-
                                                              ;
sessed of a more powerful weapon, might defy the attacks of the
Boors, make them less frequent, and more fatal. Nothing but the
privations they suffer would make any one of them submit to the
cruelty of the farmers; and, living as they do on locusts, ants, and
some farinaceous roots, there can be no better proof of the insuffi-
ciency of their tiny bow, and of the general inertness of their ce-
lebrated poison yet they are themselves impressed with the con-
                    ;
viction of its strength, and they have been able to impress their
enemies with a dread of its effects, if not of its fatality. I have
never been able to procure one well authenticated relation of death
produced by it in man. I have known some cases of horses and
dogs dying from the insertion of the arrow into the leg ; but some
of them seem to die rather from the effect of violent inflammation
in the limb, than from any specific power in the poison itself. In one
instance of a dog, however, the animal became stupid and insensi-
ble in a few minutes, and died in twenty. Some colonists who have
been wounded, assert that they are subject to periodical attacks of
insanity, under certain states of atmospherical influence; but I be-
lieve this to be, like most of their tales, quite unworthy of credit.
The poison of the Bushman of the Hornberg is extracted from
plants, and from plants only, so far as I have been able to learn.
In that quarter, they use no mineral poison, nor the venom of
snakes.     Two specimens of plants used by them accompany this
the bulb is a species of Hcemanthus ; but never having seen the
other plant in flower, I have been unable to learn its name. Its
leaf exudes a milky juice, and, cut up and bled, forms a tenacious
extract, which is spread on the arrow, to some thickness. There
is another plant which they use likewise, either alone or with the
other two ; which, together, forms the strongest they procure its       ;
name is "mountain poison." Growing on the stony hills, and very
rarely to be found, I have never got a specimen of it.
   Their dexterity in the use of their bow is remarkable, and the
distance they can shoot, with such a light arrow, is astonishing.
They will throw the arrow upwards of a hundred yards, and with
great correctness ; but, as might be expected, it will seldom wound
at such a distance ; and I have known a cavalry cloak protect a
soldier at twenty paces.        The bow is not brought to the eye in
shooting.     They fix their eye upon the object, grasping the bow
with the left hand, while the arrow passes through the fingers on
the right side,  —    a mode of shooting 1 believe peculiar to them.
   Their treatment of a wound made by a poisoned arrow is truly
scientific.   It is laid freely open, the poison cleaned out, and a horn
applied in the manner of a cupping-glass, exhausted by suction at
the small extremity.       This, as far as I could learn, is the only treat-
ment they adopt, never making use of any herb as a specific. The
                                                                      Boors

392          Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.
Boors consider gunpowder and urine as very efficient, and pre-
scribe those in every arrow-wound, and in every case of snake-bite.
Cupping would seem to be the Bushmen's favourite treatment of
every complaint accompanied with pain, and so frequently do they
resort to this, that by the time they are full grown they appear scars
all over.
   The length    of time a   Bushman can    live  without food  is sur-
prising, often living for three  and four days without a mouthful
and the quantity they can devour after such abstinence is equally
remarkable, one man having been known to eat an African sheep
(thirty pounds) in a single night.     When unable to procure food,
a belt round the body is tightened as the craving increases, and
they resort to the smoking of dalcka (a species of chanvre or hemp),
which produces intoxication. The narcotic effects of this plant
no doubt produce much of that shrivelled appearance which is
observable in all of any age. When possessing plenty of their
dalcka, they can smoke and sleep for several days and nights with-
out eating.
   A Bushman has no    idea of the perpetuation of property; I might
say,  no notions of a prospective existence. He is wholly depend-
ent on nature or on man he will neither imitate the Caffer nor the
                           :
Boor, will neither grow corn nor breed cattle.
   The figures drawn by them on the rocks are often remarkable
for the correctness of the outline; they hit the attitude of the ani-
mal, but seldom care about truth in the colouring      : speaking phre-
nologically, they have the organ of form, but not of colour.     I have
never seen any animal resembling the unicorn among their paint-
ings, but such an animal is said to exist beyond the Orange River.
They   are fond of music and dancing, but their musical instrument
is  rude, and without power or variety, consisting of one string
stretched upon a bow, whose vibrations are produced by the breath,
with great exertion.
   The Bushman's conception of a Supreme Being is, that he is an
evil deity ; and their notion of futurity, that there will be an eter-
nity of darkness, in which they will live for ever, and feed on grass
alone.    They imagine that the sun sends rain, and when he is
clouded, they hold up burning wood, in token of disapprobation.
They believe that the sun and moon will disappear, to produce the
darkness they anticipate.
   The Bushman's bow is made of a peculiar tree, called the Blue
Bush, whose branches are almost moulded by nature to the artificial
form.    The sinews of the quagga yield powerful bow-strings, and
the arrow is formed of a slender reed, headed with antelope's horn,
and pointed with a small triangular piece of metal, which they pro-
cure from the Caffers.
                         AURORA BOREALIS.
   In the evening of the 7th this interesting meteoric phenomenon
was observed at Gosport, from fifteen minutes before till a quarter
past nine o'clock, when the moon rose, and her light overpowered it.
                                                                   The

             Intelligence  and Miscellaneous    Articles.           393
The aurora was rather faint, and it only extended from the N. to
the N.W. point of the horizon, yet there rose from its base about
twelve columns of light with other coruscations and one meteor
                                                      ;
appeared over it. There was also a faint appearance of the aurora
the following evening, but large black clouds intervened.        In the
evening of the 17th the Northern Lights again appeared, from eight
till a quarter past nine o'clock : during the first half-hour, many
bright flame-coloured columns rose in slow succession, some of
which attained the same altitude as the star Benetrasch in Ursa
Major, and were two degrees in width. Four meteors occasionally
appeared over them. The aurora then settled into a segment of
mild light, and extended from N. by E. to W. The heavy dew
and low passing cirrostratus clouds were unfavourable to its con-
tinuance.
                    ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS.
    The  eclipse of the moon in the night of the 2nd of September was
visible here only in its effects, in consequence of the interposition of
thick strata of clouds, through which only an undefined light was
seen.    At a quarter past nine, however, a partial opening in the
clouds showed for a few seconds of time, by means of a telescope,
that the moon was nearly half eclipsed.
    The planet Mars, on fine evenings this month, has been a very
conspicuous and interesting object in the S.E. quarter of the heavens,
having come to an opposition with the sun at midnight of the 19th ;
and from his comparative nearness to the earth, has on several
evenings, before and after his opposition, appeared to surpass Ju-
piter in splendour and magnitude : he will continue to be conspi-
cuous in the evenings during the remainder of the year, but will
gradually decrease in brilliancy and apparent magnitude, and lose
his circular form as he passes to a conjunction with the sun.
   Mercury, at his greatest elongation in the evenings of the 17th
and 18th, was scarcely perceptible with the naked eye, and had but
a faint appearance through a telescope, although the sky was clear,
owing to his position in south declination.
    Georgium Sidus or Herschel planet, is creeping along the neck of
the Goat, and is now (October 1st) on the meridian one minute
and twenty seconds after a Cygni, and 34 degrees distant from,
and immediately under, a Delphini, at 8 o'clock in the evening so   ;
that good opportunities may occur during the month for observing
it with a powerful telescope.

 398          Meteorological Observations for September 1830.
      General Observations.— This month has been generally wet and windy,
 but most of the rain fell in the night-time. From the 8th to the 24th it
 rained every clay more or less, frequently accompanied with boisterous
 equinoctial gales.
     Hoar     frost  appeared      in the grass-fields early in the mornings of the 22nd
 and 26th.         At    11  A.M. on the 28th, a greater number of swallows con-
 gregated over Gosport and its neighbouihood than has been seen for
 many years; perhaps there were not less than 1200 or 1500 at one view,
 flying leisurely in all directions, and intermixing with each other                           : after
 making a few circular flights for ten minutes, they rose three or four hun-
 dred feet in height, and then departed in a southerly direction, except a
few young ones ; making their stay here twenty-three weeks and two days.
     The mean temperature of the external air this month is four degrees
under the mean of September for many years past.
     The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observation this month, are one anthelion, one parhelion, twenty-six me-
teors, four rainbows, three aurora? boreales, lightning in the evening of the
20th, and thirteen gales of wind, cr days on which they have prevailed,
namely, one from the South, eight from the South-west, two from the
West, and two from the North-west.

LXI. An Examination of those Phenomena of Geology,                   which
   seem to bear most directly on theoretical Speculations.              By
   the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, M.A. F.R.S. F.G.S. $c.
                      [In Continuation from p. 362.]
    To  the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
II.^T^ROM          the organic remains included, &c.         we   are sure
          that far the largest proportion (say T9yths) of the strati-
fied rocks (viz. all from the lowest transition strata upwards,
now forming      the surface of our continents,) were deposited gra-
dually and slowly through a long series of time beneath the
sea ; and afortiori, the inferior rocks must have been so situ-
ated  :  ergo, originally the whole mass of our continents was
beneath the sea.
    III. Interposed among and breaking through these strata
are certain intrusive and unstratified masses, which from the
phaenomena connected with them are now generally allowed
  * I here shortly recapitulate the principal phaenomena of the subject,
however obvious and little disputed, as it may be convenient in the course
of the ensuing argument frequently to refer to them: and for the purposes
of that reference the numerical arrangement seems convenient.
   I have also to correct an erratum in my last, p. 361, where I must have
written Atlas instead of Typhon;    —  the classical reader will pardon the
confusion when he recollects that, besides the celebrated passage in Pindar,
a picturesque description of " this overwhelmed and inefficient bulk
pressed beneath the roots of iEtna," occurs in a speech in the Prometheus
                                                       —
of iEschylus intermingled with the fortunes of Atlas. While on classical
subjects, I would just remark how much I am gratified by finding every
quotation in Mr. Lyell's able remarks on the attention of the ancients to
geology, identical with those previously given in my own Outlines, with the
single exception of the passage from Strabo, to which, however, I have
given a reference although certainly partial and imperfect: as there is not
a word of acknowledgement, of course this coincidence is accidental.

402     Rev. W. D. Conybeare on the Phenomena of Geology
 to have     been of ancient volcanic origin the greenstone and
                                                  :
 other trap rocks are now almost universally thus considered
 and the granitic rocks have so many points of analogy with
 these, that they can scarcely be referred to a different origin.
    Observation.   —  It would be a useless expense of space here
 to enter into the detail of the phenomena thus referred to, as
 they are universally familiar, and the inferences from them
 generally allowed.
    IV. The disturbances which the strata appear to have suf-
 fered subsequently to their original formation (as shown by
faults, the inclined and contorted positions of beds which
 must have been deposited horizontally, &c.) prove that they
 must have undergone very extensive mechanical dislocation.
    Observation.   —  Of course it is natural to look to this mecha-
nical dislocation as the proximate cause of the elevation of the
 continents, by which they have emerged from their original
subaqueous position (sect. I.); and further, we seem in the vol-
canic agency indicated in No. II., to find a cause adequate to
produce this dislocation.          Of course we must conceive this
volcanic agency to have affected the surface with greater or
less violence at different periods, in proportion as we find the
strata more or less dislocated at those periods.
    V. In all the countries hitherto examined, we find these
dislocations affecting the oldest formations in the most violent
manner, and to a degree beyond all comparison greater than
those of newer deposition.           Thus we find the transition for-
mations universally and most violently disturbed ; the carbo-
niferous series very generally and very greatly so the new     ;
red sandstone and all the superior rocks in most countries
comparatively very little deranged        ;
                                            — although faults, &c. still
occur, and prove that the same disturbing causes were still
in action, though with an energy much diminished. In parti-
cular localities however, (but these of very limited extent com-
pared with the entire surfaces of our continents, as far, that is,
as hitherto explored,) these disturbances extend even to the
tertiary formations. Jt generally* appears that these localities
are in the neighbourhood of the most lofty mountain chains it           :
seems indeed established, that the height of these chains bears
a general proportion to the geological period during which
   * I say generally,' because our own Southern coast in the Isle of Wight
           '
and Dorset, presents an example of exception, namely, of violent convul-
sions having affected the chalk and lowest tertiary beds without producing
any mountain chain. I stated originally the above law as to the height of
mountain chains, with relation to the periods of disturbance, in the Num-
ber of the Annals for January 1823, pp. 3 and 4, exemplifying it with re-
ference to the Alps and Pyrenees. I believe the idea was at that time
original ; it seems since to have occurred also to Elie de Beaumont.

the strata of the vicinity appear to have been subjected to the
violent action of disturbing forces.   Lastly, In the actual geo-
logical period, including the whole time which has elapsed
since the continents assumed their present general form, the
violent action of the disturbing forces has been confined to
the districts of active volcanic vents districts, however, ex-
                                         ;
tensive if abstractedly considered, yet bearing    no conceivable
proportion to the universal prevalence of these forces in the
earliest formations   : in the same manner as the utmost con-
vulsions actually produced, though often considerable if
viewed in this isolated manner, yet sink into perfect insignifi-
cance if compared with the ancient disturbances effected in
our  strata.
   Observations. —  I would now examine rather more in detail
the principles thus generally enounced in doing which, I shall
                                           ;
be enabled to point out both what may be considered as al-
ready ascertained on the only sure foundation of patient ob-
serviition, and to indicate how much further those observations
must be extended, and in what directions they must be pro-
secuted, before we are in possession of sufficient data for any
thing like a complete Theory on all the points considered in
this article.
   First, then, I  would state the general principle of the in-
vestigation.   Suppose any number of stratified masses a, b, c, d
superimposed upon each other in the above order {a being
the lowest), and disturbed by dislocating forces.        Suppose
them all to indicate the effects of these forces.
   It is evident that this may result from two different modes
of operation of those forces: for either, 1st, they may have
acted frequently during the formation of each of the affected
strata; or, 2ndly, they may have acted once only in a single
general convulsion subsequently to the formation of all the
strata.   Now it is obvious, that in order to authorize any spe-
culation as to the prevalence of the disturbing forces at parti-
cular geological periods, we must first endeavour to ascertain
which of these cases has taken place. The only method by
which we can accomplish this, is to ascertain whether the strata
be conformable or unconformable ; for it is clear that the strata
which are conformable can alone be supposed to have been
affected by a single convulsion for instance, a shock affecting
                                 :
«, b, c, d at the same time would probably incline them all in
the same direction ; but, on the contrary, if a shock affected or,
before the formation of b, &c, it is clear that the latter could
not conform to the dislocations produced by that shock.

404    Rev.W. D. Conybeare     on the Phenomena of Geology
is,  therefore, obviously of the very first importance towards
enabling us to theorize on the seras of the geological disturb-
ances. With regard to the greater aggregates constituting for-
mations, this investigation has been prosecuted to a certain
extent; but very much remains to be done even in this de-
partment and in order to enable us to push the inquiry to
            :
its full extent, not only aggregate formations but individual
beds should be similarly examined in every case of disturbed
strata.   We   ought in this manner to ascertain the exact limits,
                                                           —
and thence to infer the geological asra of the disturbance; but
in what instances has this yet been done?       Enough, however,
has I conceive been accomplished to authorize the general
conclusions enounced in the above article.       The disturbances
of the transition formations appear to be universal they are
                                                       ;
well exhibited in the coasts of Devonshire and Cornwall, and
St. Abbe's Head, Berwickshire.        I have, indeed, never seen
these rocks exhibited in a single locality, or read any descrip-
tion of such, where they did not appear to have suffered the
most violent derangements.
    The period of a great part of these disturbances appears
to have been antecedent to the formation of the carboniferous
formations (although of course the transition rocks must have
been affected by the subsequent convulsions which acted on
the strata also)  ; for we find a want of conformity, and the
planes of the transition rocks appear to have been greatly
contorted before the application of the planes of the carboni-
ferous series of strata upon them. There is, indeed, some de-
gree of difficulty in making the requisite observations, because
the graywacke rocks have generally a false cleavage, not
parallel to the true lines of stratification, which can only be
 observed by tracing the junction of heterogeneous beds, e.g.
graywacke and transition lime, &c. In this manner the non-
conformity of the transition rocks of the English lake district,
and the superincumbent carboniferous strata of the Cross-fell
chain, has been observed. The same non-conformity of the
 South-Welsh carboniferous and transition strata may be ob-
 served along the north edge of the coal-field.
    In Somersetshire the junction is altogether connected by
the overlying new red sandstone.          The Scotch coal-fields
have not yet been examined with this view nor, as far as I am
                                              ;
aware, any of the continental depots.        In Ireland the car-
boniferous rocks of the Connaught and Leinster coal districts
rest unconformably on the' older formations; and a similar po-
sition is often noticed in Weaver's excellent Memoir on the
South-east of Ireland.
                                                             The

                   bearing on theoretical Speculations.               405
    The carboniferous strata are very much and very generally
disturbed, but yet considerably less so than the subjacent
transition formations.        Thus the strata of the Cross-fell chain
and the Durham coal-field seldom deviate by more then ten
degrees from the horizontal line, although often traversed
by very considerable faults, sometimes effecting dislocations
of nearly 1000 feet.          The same remarks may be applied
to the Derbyshire coal-field.         The South- Welsh coal-field is
very unequally disturbed nothing can exceed the derange-
                                :
ments of the Pembrokeshire portion (see the sections in De
la   Beche's memoir, Geol. Trans, second series, vol. i. In
Glamorganshire, the northern portion of the coal tract ge-
nerally presents but a low angle of inclination (about 12°):
but here occur several considerable faults, in connection with
which the strata become vertical and much contorted. In the
Southern portion the disturbance is more general, and the
angle varies from 45° to 70°.
    In the Somersetshire coal-field the disturbance is very con-
siderable, especially towards the Mendip chain, where the
limestone is often nearly vertical, and the superincumbent
coal beds thrown quite over, and doubled into zigzags.               Near
Clevedon also a large tract of limestone covered with coal-
measures appears to have subsided to such an extent, that
near the line of fracture the subsided strata crop out three
miles to the west of the main chain with which they must orii
ginally have been continuous.
    On the Continent, the coal-measures about Valenciennes
and throughout the district of the Meuse exhibit the most re-
markable contortions and derangement (see Oeynhausen and
Decken's excellent Be7nerJcungen): such also appears to be ge-
nerally the case in Germany (see H. de Villefosse, RicJiesse
Minerale de la Westphalie).
    These convulsions of the carboniferous beds           are clearly all
referable to one single geological period       ;
                                                  — that, namely, of the
formation of these deposits ; for they do not extend * to the
next superincumbent formations of magnesian limestone and
new red sandstone, which, on the contrary, repose on them in
beds nearly horizontal so that an eminent geologist, Omalius
                            ;
d'Halloy, assumes as the general division of the rocks of
which he treats 1st, inclined formations; viz. transition and
                     ;
carboniferous    :  and, 2ndly, horizontal, including all the super-
strata. Nor, in fact, can we consider the principal period of
convulsion as having been coextensive with the whole period
   * There are indeed some faults which, as we shall presently see, affect
the coal rocks and the superstrata in common : but these do not bear to
the dislocations peculiar to the former, the proportion of 1 to 1000.
                                                                        of

406     Mr. R.   Phillips's Analysis    of a peculiar Submuriate
of the formation of these deposits, but restricted within much
narrower limits, towards the very close of the epoch of these
formations   ; as we find all the coal-measures, even the very
newest beds of the formation, equally affected by the same dis-
locations.
   Now the geological period thus limited cannot surely be
magnified (except by the optics of a very convenient faith)
into a series of ages of indefinite extent.        I would then only
request any person at all acquainted with the subject, or in
the least competent to form an opinion, to compare these vast
and general convulsions of our coal-fields, with all the utmost
effects which the volcanic forces of the present period have
been capable of producing for the 3000 years of which we
possess historical information     ;
                                     —  the most favourably coloured
view of these actual convulsions may undoubtedly be found
in Mr. Lyell's work, and to this I most willingly refer.            I will
only ask, whether these actual convulsions can be considered
as bearing any sensible proportion to those of the carboniferous
formations.     If therefore we suppose that the disturbing forces
are still acting with the same degree of energy as formerly, we
must make large draughts on time, to enable the frequent re-
petition of the minor dislocations to produce aggregate effects
equal to the greater and thus we shall have the following
                        :
proportionals, As the actual convulsions are to those of the
coal-fields (which may be taken almost as         =    : infinite), so is
3000 years (the actual historical period) to the single geologi-
cal epoch of the very close of the coal formation.            I can only
add that he who can believe this geological epoch to have
been many million times 3000 years, must possess a some-
what larger imagination than I can lay any claim to.

LXII. Analysis of a peculiar Submuriate of Iron, and of some
          other Subsalts.    By R.    Phillips, F.R.S.      fyc.
 TTAVING         occasion for a solution of peroxide of iron,
* -*   that should contain as little excess of acid as possible,
I mixed such quantities of muriatic acid and moist precipi-
tated peroxide, as would form a compound of an atom of
each. I preferred the muriatic acid to all others, on account
of the facility with which it dissolves peroxide of iron in every
state of aggregation.       I was surprised to find that the acid
took up much more of the oxide than I had anticipated ; and
after repeated additions of      it,  I  procured a very deep red-
                                                                 coloured

                 of Iron, and of some other     Subsalts.          407
coloured solution, which had but         little of the well known cha-
lybeate taste, and     its specific gravity   was 1*017; this solution
is  not decomposed either by the admixture of water, or the
application of heat, unless it be evaporated to dryness the      ;
alkalies readily decompose it, but the ferrocyanate of potash,
instead of a deep blue, gives a dark brownish green precipi-
tate; when more oxide is added to the acid than it is capable
of dissolving, the excess, or a portion of it, combines with the
submuriate already formed, and the acid and oxide are totally
precipitated, forming another, but an insoluble submuriate of
iron.
    One     of the most curious properties of the soluble submu-
riate,   and   in which it differs from all other binary salts with
which I am acquainted, is its decomposition by an addition
of its acid. To a quantity of the solution which contained
nearly 7 grains of peroxide, I put 25 drops of muriatic
acid ; it occasioned immediate precipitation, and 3 grains of
submuriate were throw n down when however the solution
                               r
                                       :
is heated with excess of muriatic acid, no precipitation oc-
 curs.
    To determine the composition of the solution of specific
gravity 1*017, a thousand grains of it were boiled with a so-
lution of potash ; the precipitated peroxide of iron, after
washing and drying, weighed 15*5 grains; the solution from
which the oxide had been separated, was saturated with nitric
acid, and treated with nitrate of silver, by which 6 grains of
chloride were obtained these experiments were repeated, with
                             :
very slight variations in the results.
    As 146 grains of chloride of silver are equivalent to 3 7 grains
of muriatic acid, 6 denote 1*5 grain as the quantity of acid
 combined with 15*5 grains of peroxide of iron, consequently
 37 (one atom) of muriatic acid combine with 382 of peroxide
 of iron, which divided by 40, the atom of peroxide, shows
that one atom of acid is united with 9*5 atoms of peroxide.
 If however the peroxide had amounted to 16*3 instead of
 15*5 grains, then the atomic constitution of the salt would
have been 1 atom of acid           +10   atoms base; and this I am
 induced to suppose is its real composition but it would re-
                                                      ;
 quire an extremely nice adjustment of the constituents to ob-
 tain it, for, as already stated, any excess of the peroxide of
 iron decomposes the soluble submuriate.
    The submuriate which I have now described, is remark-
 able on several accounts as far as I know, it is the only sub-
                                 ;
 salt which is largely soluble in water, except the subacetate
 of lead nor do I remember any one which contains so small
          ;
 an atomic proportion of acid ; there is not, perhaps, any other
                                                                binary

  408    Mr. R.   Phillips's Analysis  of a peculiar Submuriate
 binary    compound which       is  decomposed by the addition of
 either the acid or base ; and the last-mentioned circumstances
 show, that there are two submuriates of peroxide of iron, in
 addition to that now described, and differing from it in being
 insoluble in water.
     Another subsalt which I have examined, is the submuriate
 of antimony: this compound has been long known and em-
 ployed by the name of Powder of Algaroth, yet I have not
 found an analysis of it in any chemical author.
     To ascertain its composition, 100 grains were boiled in a
 solution of 200 grains of crystallized carbonate of soda, by the
 action of which, the muriatic acid is perfectly separated the  ;
 protoxide of antimony obtained, weighed 92 grains; the solu-
 tion was slightly supersaturated with nitric acid, and by this,
 0*5 of a grain of oxide, which had been dissolved by the car-
 bonate of soda, was precipitated. To the solution, nitrate of
 silver was added, which gave 31*6 grains of chloride, equiva-
 lent to 8 of muriatic acid.        On repeating this experiment,
 92*4 of oxide and 30 of chloride were procured, giving 7*6
 as the proportion of acid.
     The mean of these experiments shows that submuriate of
antimony is composed of
             Protoxide of antimony                   92*4-5
             Muriatic acid                            7*80
                                                    100-25
 Estimating the atomic weight of protoxide of antimony at 52,
and that of muriatic acid at 37, it appears that submuriate of
antimony is constituted of
   Nine atoms of protoxide of antimony 52 x 9      =  468 or 92*67
   One atom    of muriatic acid                    =   37      7-33
                                                      505 100*00
    Subnitrate of bismuth, as occupying a place in the London
Pharmacopoeia, is a salt of some importance. I have met with
only two notices of its composition one, confessedly theore-
                                         ;
tical, is in Mr. Brande's Table of Proportionals, and the other
is given by Mr. Reid, in his Elements of Chemistry, in the form
of a diagram ; these authors both represent the salt in ques-
tion as a dinitrate: this I shall presently show is not the
case; indeed, according to Dr. Thomson, the dinitrate is a
crystalline salt.
    In the Pharmacopoeia this subnitrate is directed to be pre-
pared, by dissolving an ounce or 480 grains of bismuth in a
fluid  ounce and    half,  or about 680 grains of strong nitric acid
diluted with half     its bulk of water. This proportion of acid
                                                                   is

              of Iron, and of some other Subsalts.          409
is considerably too large, and the excess prevents the preci-
pitation of a large portion of the subnitrate    by water: thus
when 480 grains of the metal were dissolved as above directed,
water threw down only 257 grains of subnitrate; a solution
of common salt precipitated afterwards 307 grains of sub-
muriate, and ammonia then gave 27 grains more of the latter
subsalt.
   It will be observed, that the subnitrate precipitated by
water is to the submuriate thrown down by common salt, only
about as 100 to 120 and that this deficiency of subnitrate is
                       ;
occasioned by the great excess of acid, is found by using cry-
stallized nitrate of bismuth  : in this case the subnitrate ob-
tained by water was to that of the submuriate procured by
common salt, nearly as 100 to 33, instead of 120. To ana-
lyse subnitrate of bismuth, 200 grains were boiled in a solu-
tion of soda; taking the mean of several experiments, 81*92
per cent of oxide of bismuth were left: to determine the pro-
portion of nitric acid, a similar quantity was heated in water
with excess of lime; after filtering the solution, carbonic acid
gas was passed into it, until the carbonate of lime formed be-
gan to redissolve; the excess of carbonic acid was expelled
by ebullition, and the nitrate of lime being decomposed by
carbonate of soda, 17 per cent, of carbonate of lime were ob-
tained as the mean of two experiments, which quantity is equi-
valent to 18*36 of nitric acid.
   According to these experiments, this subsalt consists of
                 Oxide of bismuth             81*92
                 Nitric acid                  18*36
                                             100*28
    The atom   of oxide of bismuth being 80, and that of nitric
 acid 54, it appears that subnitrate of bismuth is constituted of
         Three atoms of oxide 80 X    3  = 240   or 81*64
         One atom of acid                = 54       18*36
                                            294    100*00
    I have also subjected the submuriate, formerly called ma-
 gistery of bismuth, to examination ; it was prepared by adding
 a solution of common salt to one of nitrate of bismuth.       In
 analysing this salt, I adopted a similar process to that em-
 ployed with the submuriate of antimony ; viz. ebullition in a
 solution of soda, saturation with nitric acid, and precipitation
 by nitrate of silver.
    One hundred grains treated in this manner gave 87 grains
 of oxide of bismuth, and 54 of chloride of silver, equivalent

    Dr. Thomson found that the carbonate of bismuth is a tris-
carbonate, similar in constitution to the subnitrate and sub-
muriate as above stated.
    It is well known that the oxide of bismuth is of a yellow
colour and this I have always found to be the case when it
         ;
is procured by decomposing the subnitrate by an alkali          ;  but
when the submuriate is employed, the colour of the oxide
frequently differs exceedingly sometimes it is yellow like that
                                    ;
from the subnitrate, frequently grayish black, and I once ob-
tained it of a deep bluish black colour.
    The cause of these variations of colour I have not been
able to discover, nor is there any circumstance occurring be<-
fore the actual decomposition, which gives any indication of
what colour the oxide will be. I have used portions of the
same solution of nitrate of bismuth in preparing the sub-
nitrate and submuriate       ; and equal weights of the salts ob-
tained, one by water and the other by common salt, were
boiled in similar quantities of the same solution of soda;
the subnitrate gave the usual yellow oxide, and the oxide
from the submuriate was yellowish at first, but it soon be-
came grayish, and finished by being nearly black.
    In other cases when using bismuth taken from one mass,
and dissolving and precipitating as before, the submuriate
has, like the subnitrate, yielded a yellow oxide.            The only
 circumstances which appear to be constant are, that the sub-
nitrate always gives a yellow oxide;         and any one portion of
submuriate always yields a dark coloured oxide, though, as
 already observed, the submuriate obtained at different times,
even when using portions of the same mass of bismuth, gives
 very different results.
    I could not detect any impurity in the bismuth indeed had
                                                        ;
 this or the accidental action    of sulphuretted hydrogen black-
 ened the oxide of the submuriate, it must have produced a
 similar effect upon the oxide from the subnitrate, which how-
                                                                  ever

 ever did not occur, though both were decomposed together on
 the sand heat.
    If the black precipitate be dissolved in nitric acid, nitrate of
 silver does not indicate the presence of any muriatic acid; in-
 deed whether the oxide was yellow or black, there was no
 material difference in the quantity of chloride of silver yielded
 by the decomposition of the submuriates nor was there any
                                                 :
 greater variation, than usually occurs in the results of ex-
 periments, between the proportions of yellow or black oxide,
 procured from equal portions of the submuriate.
    When the black oxide is dissolved in muriatic acid, water
 occasions a precipitation of submuriate of the usual whiteness;
 a portion of the black oxide heated to redness on a piece of
 platina lost neither weight nor colour, but by melting it be-
 came yellow and the last-mentioned circumstance is the only
                ;
one which affords even a guess as to the cause of the varia-
 tions of colour, and that is the state of aggregation of the par-
ticles : but why it should not occasionally occur with the sub-
nitrate does not easily admit of explanation       ; and it is, per-
haps, still more difficult to account for the uncertainty which
attends the results of different portions of submuriate, ob-
tained from one mass of bismuth.
LXIII. Notes on the New Red Sandstone of the County of Dur-
   ham, below the Magnesian Limesto?ie.          By Wm. Hutton,
    Esq. F.G.S.
                        [Concluded from p. 354.]
  A T the south    point of CullercoatsHaven, the great, or ninety-
"*•*-
      fathom dyke, as it is called, again brings down the mag-
nesian limestone and the yellow sand.         The dyke may be seen
in the cliff, near the south point of the haven, where a coal sand-
stone and a bed of shale form its high or southern cheek, and
the yellow sand (here a soft sandstone) the northern.           The
dyke hades, or underlies about 38° to the north, and its di-
rection is N. 87° W. Its course towards the sea may be traced
without difficulty, at low water, for a considerable distance
eastward, the well-known sandstone rock, called the " Bear's
Back," forming its southern side, and the yellow sand having
many thin beds of magnesian limestone alternating with it,
the northern.      These alternating beds of limestone and sand
show marks of considerable mechanical force, being bent and
contorted near the edge of the dyke.          Within the bay a bed
of shale is exposed to view, which here forms the southern
cheek of the dyke, in consequence of the action of the sea

412         Mr. Hutton's Notes on the New Red Sandstone of
 having removed the whole of the yellow sand, except at the
 south-eastern point, where the curved beds of limestone may
 be again seen alternating with the sand, as well as in the cliff
 below the Fisherman's Beacon*.
      From the appearances at this point it cannot be doubted that
 the dyke has thrown down the magnesian limestone,asProfessor
 Sedgwick observes and it also follows, as a matter of course,
                          ;
 that the limestone at Whitley Quarry, upon the course of the
 dyke, is similarly affected.       A close examination of the quarry
 last autumn convinced me that such was the fact; the opera-
 tions of the quarrymen had removed, in one spot, the whole
 of the limestone, and laid bare, for a considerable distance,
 the southern cheek of the dyke, which was here, as in the
 Haven at Cullercoats, a bed of shale, having a hade or dip, at
a considerable angle, towards the north.                  On the southern
 side of the quarry, in several places where the stone has been
 worked near the line of the dyke, marks of mechanical action
are visible, particularly near the rail-way, on its eastern side.
     The general opinion is, that this patch of limestone over-
lies both edges of the dyke, and that it has been deposited not
 only after the slip took place, but after the removal of the
whole of the high side, which would necessarily be left, by the
sinking down of the strata on the north.              This is an opinion
from which I confess I differ with reluctance nevertheless, as
                                                        ;
the limestone at Cullercoats is manifestly thrown down along
with the yellow sand, and contorted by mechanical action, we
are compelled to come to the conclusion, that the ninety-fathom
dyke was formed after the deposition and consolidation of the
magnesian limestone and this would necessarily be our con-
                            ;
clusion if there were no marks in the quarry at Whitley to
point it out, as we cannot suppose the limestones in the two
situations to be of different ages, or, closely connected as they
are, to be operated upon by different causes.
     The    idea of the limestone overlying the dyke,        may    possibly
have arisen from its being considered as a perpendicular fis-
sure, which it certainly is not, either in the quarry at Whitley,
at Cullercoats, or at Gosforth, where it has lately been so
completely examined in Mr. Brandling's new colliery.
     We     have thus traced the edge of this formation through
the whole of the county of Durham, and to Cullercoats, in
Northumberland, its most northern limit and, in the whole
                                                    ;

beds, subordinate to the sand, which is here of great thickness.

now    before the Society, from the different localities, will show
most of the characters of the two beds. At the same time it
must be admitted, that hand specimens can give but a vague
idea of a formation of such extent and variety as this is.            In
many situations on the line it might be taken by any one who
had not examined it thoroughly, to be a sandstone of the coal
measures; but a more extensive survey, with an attention to
all the circumstances under which it occurs, could not fail of
satisfactorily pointing out its true relations to the adjoining
strata.
    The most convincing proof of its total independence of, and
want of conformity to, the coal measures, is the difference of
depth at which the same seam of coal is found along the line
of its outcrop.       If we take, for instance, the low main coal of
the Tyne, which is the Hutton seam in the collieries on the
Wear, we shall find its depth below the red sandstone, as
follows    :

    To the south of Moorsley, the seams of coal unfortunately
again change their names, and it would therefore be impos-
sible,  without further investigation, to trace the continuity of
each individual seam; but it may be stated, that the sandstone
crosses the coal strata, at many various depths, above a coal
in that district, called the Five-quarter Seam, and in its range
southward very nearly comes in contact with the grit and
shale beds below the whole of the coal series.

 than above stated.

  414      Mr. Hutton's Notes on    the  New Red Sandstone   of
 interesting speculation.       As  it has now been ascertained that
 we have below the magnesian limestone a formation of new
 red sandstone, may we not be allowed to conjecture that a
 bed of rock salt is existing in it somewhere, as this stratum is
 well known to be the great depository of that substance all
 over the world?         This idea is rendered more probable by
 the situation of the places where salt springs occur, none of
 which are at a great distance from the outcrop of this stra-
 tum. Butterby, near Croxdale, is about two miles from it;
 Lumley is rather less than two miles; Old Walker Colliery is
furthest from the line, being about three miles and a half;
 and Jarrow is the nearest, being little more than a mile and
a half*.
    The great scarcity of organic remains in the lower beds of
 the magnesian limestone is rather singular.         In the foregoing
notice, four different localities have been mentioned, where
fish have occurred, all in the slaty beds of the limestone, a
few feet above the yellow sand.           Organic remains are at all
times of great use to the geologist and observer of nature
they are, as it were, nature's own medals of the wonderful
changes that have taken place upon the surface of the globe
before it was brought to its present state ; and the great im-
portance of these fish is, the light they may throw upon the
nature of the changes that have taken place at the time they
were buried. That the catastrophe was sudden, the forms
in which they occur, and their perfect preservation, sufficiently
testify  ;  indeed, it is a generally received opinion, that where
the remains of soft-bodied animals occur, with their outward
form perfectly preserved, and associated in families, they have
been suddenly overwhelmed, and entangled in the substance
now forming their stony matrix. It is a singular circum-
stance attending these fish, and one in which they agree with
those that have been found in different situations upon the
continent, that many of them are contorted; not that sort of
twisting which might be produced by any movement in the
mass, and subsequent to the time they were enveloped, but
the graceful contortions of the living animal in a state of pain,
as if struggling against its fate.

strata caused by the ninety-fathom dyke, at the point of its
greatest depression, certain appearances having led us to sup-
pose that the lower new red sandstone existed somewhere near
Killingworth; and we found it accordingly in one spot, called
the  Clowsden or Closing Hill Quarry, situate about 950 yards
to the south of Killingworth    House, and immediately adjoin-
ing the Killingworth Railway.      It is of inconsiderable extent,
and forms a small hill, which slopes gently on every side,
except where it has been broken in upon for quarrying the
stone.     There are two quarries that on the northern slope
                                    :
of the hill has been extensively worked ; it is now full of
water, but is said to be sixty feet deep.    The southern quarry
was drained by means of a drift from the bottom of the hill
this was driven northward entirely in sand, until the face of
the rock was suddenly and abruptly come upon, which was
no doubt the northern cheek of the dyke. I am informed by
my friend Mr. Nicholas Wood, that a seam of coal twenty
inches thick, with a shale bed above it, appeared in the north
quarry this coal stratum is higher than any bed we have
         ;
been hitherto acquainted with in this coal field. The highest
known is in Hebburn, Jarrow, and South Shields collieries,
from their pits being sunk at the point of the greatest depres-
sion of the strata, or at the bottom of the coal basin, as it is
termed; it is 114 fathoms above the High Main, whilst this
is 1 90 fathoms at least.
   The     red sandstone exhibits here its usual characters, but
the ruddle is in greater abundance than common, particularly
in the lower part of the bed, where it exists in large masses,
all the farmers in the neighbourhood supplying themselves
from this quarry with Keel (as it is termed, and the spot the
Keel Quarry), for marking their sheep. Its dip is 15° south,
whilst the dip of the coal measures is twice this amount, or
about 30°. It is satisfactory to know, that this has been proved
by the working of the High Main Seam below, because it
would appear that the dip of the coal seam and shale bed
which were found in the quarry did not differ much from that
of the red sandstone nevertheless I am perfectly borne out
                        :
by the personal observation and practical experience of Mr.
Wood, in considering the red sandstone here " in general
position clearly unconformable with the coal measures."
   The relative position of this patch of red sandstone will be
best understood by a reference to the annexed diagrams.         In
the sketch No. 1. the line A B represents the course of the
High Main Coal Seam, on the north, or low side of the dyke,
having the depth marked at which the coal has either been
worked, or proved to exist, at seven different points; and

 unequal depression of portions of the strata. I have taken
 the High Main Coal as the representative of the whole series,
 from its being best known but the continuous line exhibited,
                                            ;
 although sufficient for our present purpose, is incorrect, as
 many slips or dykes occur, throwing it down in portions un-
 equally.

is, nevertheless, as probable, that such a removal of this bed
may have           taken place, as that the strata on the high side of

must have presented at this point, a face of rock, upwards of

    The unknown                        quantity e cannot be determined by observa-
tions of         an occultation of a star, except when d is known for at
least one place of observation, for it entirely unites with the
difference of meridians.                               The second term proportional to the
reciprocal of the tangent \J/ is the same which is usually added
to the time of conjunction deduced from an observation as cor-
rection on account of the latitude (or declination) but it ap-                                 ;

 [1], as the time of conjunction was there determined without
being affected by an error in longitude (or right ascension),
 whereas such an error here affects the difference of meridians,
and consequently likewise the time of conjunction. But it is to
 be observed that this contradiction is only apparent, and may be
considered as arising from the omission of that term of the cor-
rection which is to be added to the time of the conjunction cal-
culated by that method, and which depends on the error (x) of
the assumed difference of meridians as explained in [2]; if
this correction is added and x eliminated by the comparison of
 the time of conjunction found with the one resulting from the
tables and   A  a, the dependence on this quantity will likewise
 be perceived. Both methods only differ by being made to
depend on different unknown quantities. The determination
of all the 5 quantities s, £... by observations of an occultation
of a star, is mathematically possible; but it is easily perceived
that if these quantities are thus kept separate, small errors of
observation will greatly affect their determination, unless the
observations were made at the most proper spots of the globe,
and not confined to the small part of its surface contained
between the observatories of Europe. The advantageous se-
paration of the two last quantities from the others, requires,
for example, that at two of the places of observation the times
of the phenomenon should be very different, which will be the
case if at the one it takes place a little after the rising of the
 moon, and at the other a little before her setting; the last is
separated from the rest only by the difference of the value of
/3 for the different places of observation.
    The difficulty of producing a concurrence of favourable
circumstances induces the belief that the determination of the
excentricity of the meridians of the earth for which observa-
tions of occultations of stars have been proposed (without,
however, sufficiently developing the greatest possible advan-
tages to be obtained by them), may always be founded on more
successful methods. Besides this difficulty, the mountains pro-
jecting on the limb of the moon, and other probable deviations
from the globular form, may and will spoil observations good
in themselves ; the immersion and emersion can rarely both
 be observed with accuracy and lastly, the advantageous se-
                               ;
lection of the places of observation is much restricted by the
 presence of the sun above the horizon.       I believe, therefore,
 that the calculation of the influence of all the five unknown
 quantities will only have an interest for the purpose of judg-
 ing how far they may affect the results of the calculation, but
 not for their determination.

   [11.] In most cases only e and £ will be determined by the
observation ; in particular cases, likewise ; but the others will13
be considered as evanescent.                  My       experience proves that this
object, a very limited one when compared with the complete
determination of all unknown quantities, is generally so diffi-
cult to be attained that, in most cases, a good meridian obser-
vation of the moon is very acceptable in order to diminish the
uncertainty which the occultation alone leaves behind.                              The
comparison of it with the observations of the occultation is
most easy when the right ascension and declination have been
employed in the calculation. The quantities s and £ having

If these quantities denote the errors of right ascension                             and
declination,    and if it be required to find those of longitude                     and
latitude, or vice versa, the          well-known formulae by which these
calculations     may be        effected are to be applied.                    The com-
plete formula? [11] and [12] will show in every case how far
the errors of the tables determined on the supposition of ij, •&,
i being evanescent might be altered by these quantities.                            This
connection might be determined generally from one of the two
formulae in particular cases, ex. gr. if                     A    a and  A  S have been
determined by the combination of the observations of immer-
sion and emersion made at one place but it appears to be      ;
more convenient to calculate the coefficients for both phaeno-
mena, and to derive the result required from their numerical
values.
    [12.] I shall now generally consider the problem of eclipses,
and suppose that both bodies have a parallax and a diameter.
 The determination of the most convenient form of the ge-
 neral equation [2] is then less apparent than in the particular
 case of an occultation of a fixed star; but even then formulae
 may be found combining convenience of calculation with per-
fect correctness.         Although the method of approximation, ex-
 plained by Lagrange, is sufficient for practice, yet the im-
 portance of a theory which has been so often treated, will be
 an apology for resuming              it   again.

sion which forms the first part of the equation (2) is thus re-
duced to the sum of two squares.
   The angles d and a by which this is effected may be con-
sidered, the first as the declination (or latitude), the second as
the right ascension (or longitude) of a point of the sphere of
the heavens, which may be easily demonstrated to be the point
in which the great circles passing through the true and appa-
rent places, respectively, of the bodies, intersect each other.
For in the expressions by which d and a have been deter-
mined, the last parts of the expressions [1] of a, b, c} a', b\ c'
vanish ; so that we have
              {G sin d                       = sin sin D - sin w' sin 8

   In these equations is contained the condition that the three
points concerned in it, viz. the two true places of the bodies
and the point determined by d and a, are situated in a great
circle   ;    this condition may be reduced to the form in which it
is usually represented, by eliminating G,'sin 7r, sin w', which is
done by multiplying the three equations respectively by

428 Mr. Prideaux's Continuation of the Table of AtomicWeiglits,
   (a.) Acetic, Succinic, &c.    —  The slight augmentation in the
decimal is required for the increased estimate of the atom of
carbon.
   (b.) Antimonic.   —  Thomson's number is adopted for the
simplicity of its relation to bases, in connection with the con-
siderations in the note on antimony (ubi supra), but with the
qualification there stated.
   (c.) Arsenious, Arsenic.     — It is difficult to read the account
of Berzelius's investigations (Ann. Phil. xv. 352.) without feel-
ing convinced by them.       Those of Thomson (First Principles,
i. 229) are almost equally convincing yet both cannot be
                                                ;
right. The sulphurets of arsenic appear, in Berzelius's paper,
                                       a
to consist respectively of As S           and As S', analogous to
Thomson's     constitution  of  the acids  ;  which, having also the
advantage of simplicity, in relation both to the bases with
which they combine, and the oxygen they contain, seems
rather entitled to preference.
   (d.) Benzoic.  —  If carbon be 0*76, benzoic acid will be 15*] 5.
 But the mean between Thomson's and Berzelius's number for
carbon is a fraction below 0*76, whence the number adopted.
   (e.) Boracic.  —  See the note on Boron.
   (f.) Perchloric.  —  Berzelius's reasons for giving this acid
a different constitution from that assigned by its discoverer
(First Princ. i. 85) not appearing, the latter is adopted.
   (g.) Chloriodic, &c.   —  Calculated from the components in
the former table.
   (//.) Citric. — About the composition of crystallized citric
acid there is some obscurity; which, though of little import-
ance in chemistry, is otherwise in extemporaneous pharmacy,
iu which its neutralization is a frequent desideratum.
   The most satisfactory analyses of it are those of Berzelius
(Ann. Phil. v. 93.), and of Prout (Phil. Mag. and Annals, hi.
109), which nearly coincide: the former giving the crystals
17 per cent of water; the other resolving them into
                      Carbon                 6 atoms.
                      Oxygen                 3 atoms.
                      Water                  5 atoms.
Chemists are generally agreed in making the dry acid con-
sist of 4 atoms of carbon, 4 atoms of oxygen, and 2 atoms of
hydrogen hence Dr. Prout's statement gives 2 atoms of water
            :
to 1^ acid; which is confirmed by Berzelius's table (Essai),
as well as by the quantity of water above stated.        But 3 atoms
of acid to 4 of water is so strange a combination, as not
easily to obtain our acquiescence.            The equivalent weight
would turn out       Acid     1                     7*27

       -and Notice of a    new analytical Scale of Equivalents.   429
   Thomson and Ure           agree in assigning 2 atoms of water to
1  of acid   ; but the latter reduces the atomic weight to 8*375
(Diet., 2nd edit., Appendix, 84) ; the latter raises it to 9*5;
pointing out however, in a note, its variance from his own
analysis. (First Principles, i. 123, note.)
   The apparent facility of determining the atomic weight of
these crystals would lead us to impute the differences above
quoted, to inconstancy in their water of crystallization. But
having generally found this equivalent between 8*77 and 9",
I suppose the ordinary constitution to be Acid          1  ... 7*27

   («'.) Columbic.    —   See the note on Columbium.
   (k.) Ferro-prussic.       — Of the discordant data relating to the
atomic weight of this acid, an experiment of Dr. Ure's (Diet.,
2nd edit., Appendix, 805) seemed the most direct; but subject
to the uncertainty of all atomic deductions from precipitation
with salts of lead, excess of which is apt to fall with the pre-
cipitate, as was observed some years since by Berzelius.
   Some experiments of mine, guided by Mr. Porrett, give
13*28 for the atom of ferro-prussiate of potash; constituted as
follow:               Potassium         4*95  =  1 atom.
                      Oxygen...,        1*5  == 1| atom.
                      Hydrogen          0*19 =   1| atom.
                      Cyanogen          4'92 =   l^atom.
                      Iron              1*72 =    ^ atom.
                                       13*28
   If this be, as I believe, anhydrous ferro-prussiate of potash,
the acid is 7*33    :  but it may be construed in other ways ; and
there is an anomaly about the half atoms, which becomes still
more perplexing in prussian blue, composed of 1^ atom of
acid to 1 atom of red oxide of iron, or rather of 3 atoms of
acid to a double atom of oxide.          I had therefore some hesi-
tation in putting the dry acid on the scale, where it is accom-
panied with a ? The composition of the crystallized acid I
have not ascertained that of the salts corresponds in analysis
                           :
(though differing in theory) with the previous determinations
of Berzelius.

nitrous acid of Berzelius is the hyponitrous of English che-
mists.

stals found by Thomson to contain 4 atoms of water (First

   Having now submitted to the correction of your readers
the leading equivalents, leaving the bulk to be seen on the
scale itself, I wish to add a short notice of what is distinctive
in the construction of the instrument.
   The object was, to contain in portable compass, of easy re-
ference, and subject to the sliding scale, all the salts and pre-
cipitates used in practical chemistry, and their secondary and
elementary components; multiples of the elementary atoms
occurring in vegetable and animal analysis, and of water and  ;
to present at one view a general table of atomic weights, sim-
ple and compound, referable by moving the slider, to either
the hydrogen or oxygen scale.
   The symbols of Berzelius offered the compactness and faci-
lity of arrangement, which were the first requisites, with the
further advantage of exhibiting the atomic construction of
every substance contained; a point of some importance, as
will presently appear, in apportioning compound salts, and
convenient in looking out the ingredients of complicated sub-
stances, as phosphoric      and hydrocyanic    acids.  Their defi-
ciency, for our present purpose, was in conspicuity,         which
I have endeavoured to supply as follows      :
   Where many of the symbols had        the same initial, the Eng-
lish is substituted in some of them for the Latin one: as T,
tin; An, antimony; for Su, stannum; St, stibium &c. &c.   ;
as explained in an index-table attached to the scale.        Acids
and negative bodies are distinguished by upright letters, the
others being inclined ; as S sulphuric acid, CI chlorine, Po
potash,   H  hydrogen and Salts by combination of the upright
                        ;
and inclined symbols, as     PoS sulphate of potash, AgN nitrate
of silver.     Water (Aq, in running hand) attached to any
symbol, shows it to be a hydrate, and generally crystallized;

         and Notice of a   nevo analytical Scale oj Equivalents.  431
SoSAq™,       sulphate of soda, crystallized, 10 atoms of water;
                  *   s
T Aq\      tartaric acid, crystallized, 1 atom of water. The simple
bodies are designated in that massive letter, called by printers
" Egyptian."
    Oxides being also distinguished by superimpressed dots,
expressing the number of atoms of oxygen, thus leave the
substances without a generic sign, so reduced in number, as
to make the privation almost answer the purpose of one.
    The following arrangement, added to these distinctions,
render this scale (with a little practice, for chemists not fami-
liarized to the symbols) easier of reference than others much
less comprehensive; so at least it is found in my own prac-
tice.
    The scale is the same length as Wollaston's, but double,
opening, bookwise, on hinges, and having of course two
sliders, which are on the outsides. Within, is on one side a set
of index-tables illustrative of the symbols; on the other, a let-
ter-press explanation of the distinctive objects and use of the
instrument.
    The principal working scale is occupied entirely with the
tests, salts   and precipitates, arranged in four columns as fol-
lows   ;  each column being headed with the generic symbols of
its  contents.
                                        —
    In the column left of the slider, muriates, nitrates, borates,
and a few sulphites, arsenites and silicates.
                                        —
    In the outer column on the left, sulphates, arseniates, phos-
phates, and a few tungstates.
    In the first column on the right of the slider,     — carbonates,
acetates, and a few chromates and chlorates.
    In the outer column on the right,      —  tartrates, oxalates, ci-
trates, and a few ferro-prussiates and benzoates.
    Triple, quadruple and compound salts, being heavy, fall
near the bottom; and their long symbols crossing two co-
lumns, readily strike the eye.
    The other scale contains the simple bodies, binary com-
pounds, and multiples, having four columns on the right of
the slider, and five. On the left, each column being headed
with its contents.
    On the right side are negative substances, chlorides, bro-
mides and the multiples. On the left, neutral and positive sub-
stances,    and iodides.
    Simple bodies are on the columns next the slider (except a
few displaced to prevent crowding)         ; oxides in the two suc-
ceeding columns to the left; and sulphurets, phosphurets, &c.
in tlf^two columns furthest left.
                                                                Acids

 432 Mr. Prideaux's Continuation ofthe Table ofAtomicWeights.
    Acids are on the column next the slider to the right; cry-
 stallized and hydrated acids in the succeeding column and ;
 chlorides in the two columns furthest right.       Multiples of
 oxygen, 1 to 12, are in the second column; of hydrogen, 10
 to 50, and carbon, 2 to 10, in the third    ;  and of nitrogen,
 1  to 5, and water, 1 to 25, in the outer one.
    Iodides and bromides, being heavy, are all near the foot,
 on their respective sides and therefore easily found, without
                           ;
 crowding the other substances, by confining them to particu-
 lar  columns.
    In linking from column to column, where it could be done,
 to prevent the embarrassment of needless multiplication of
 lines, precision has been allowed to give way in a few un-
 important cases but the deviation has rarely amounted to
                   ;
 an hundredth part, particularly on the scale of salts.
    The salts not packing so close as the binary compounds,
 and hence requiring a slider with longer degrees, an adjust-
 ing line »)      tJk is drawn across the face on each side, to
 set the two scales in accordance.     Thus, when a salt and a
 chloride are to be used together"; when the binary or ele-
mentary ingredients of a precipitate are to be ascertained
or, in short, whenever the relations between salts and binary
                                                   —
compounds or simple bodies are to be examined, each slider
must be set with the same number against the line xJ>        ^JT,
and they correspond throughout.
    As a general table of equivalents, set 1 "0 against O (oxy-
gen), and the numbers are on the oxygen scale; then move
the slider and bring *8 against O, and the numbers are on
the hydrogen scale, disregarding the decimal point.       In the
latter case the scale of salts must have its numbers corre-
spondingly decupled.
    The advantage alluded to in the outset of this notice, as
belonging to the analytical character of these symbols, in
cases of compound salts, may be thus illustrated.       Suppose
we have to prepare acetate .of alumina from alum and acetate
of lead: the symbol shows that alum contains four atoms
of sulphuric acid acetate of lead but one atom of oxide
                     ;
and hence that four atoms of the latter salt are requisite for
throwing down the acid; and that three atoms of acetate of
ammonia will remain in the solution. So if we use cream of
tartar, red sulphate of iron, dichloride of lime, &c. we are
guided at once by the symbol what proportions to employ,
accordingly as the acid or base be the subject of operation.
A similar convenience is afforded in looking out the quanti-
tative ingredients of a compound salt.
   These advantages are only in promptitude; for a knowledge

 of the atomic construction of each substance is necessarily
 presupposed and hence this scale is addressed less to the
               :

    P.S. —  In several scales that have fallen in my way, the
 stretching of the paper, in pasting, has produced important
 deviations from the original impression.      A  simple contrivance
 remedies this.   A box tablet, the full length of the slider, and
 grooved to fit, is correspondingly graduated on each side of
 the groove.     The slider is placed in this, to receive the gra-
 duated paper; which being pasted, is allowed to remain until
 sufficiently elongated by the humidity.       It is then fixed and
                                                               ;
 such of the graduations as are out of place, by the irregular
stretching of the paper, are rectified by pressure with the nail.
 The slider being now put in its own place, the side pieces,
having been pasted at the same time, will be found nearly to
correspond, and may be further stretched or shortened, and
any irregularities adjusted, on comparison with an uncut im-
pression, by the action of the nail, as before.
LXVI.      Narrative of an Excursion to the Summit of the Peak
   of Teneriffe on the 23rd and 2i4h of February 1829: With
   some Remarks on the Geology of that Island. By Robert
    Edward Alison, Esq.
                         [Concluded from p. 251.]
                   On  the Geology   of Teneriffe.
  A T   every step we take in Teneriffe, unequivocal marks ap-
^*- pear of the great revolutions that have taken place upon
its surface by volcanic action: such as craters of enormous ex-
tent and depth ; conical mountains produced by eruptions
currents of lava which have flowed in every direction ; beds of
black and white rapilli, and tufa with the sulphureous fumes
                                     ;
from the Peak indicating an active state of combustion, which
in a moment may be the cause of new disasters.
   The lavas are of endless variety, and their appearance is
variously modified, according to the heat and pressure they
have been subjected to; and frequently there is a heaving-up of
the strata from central points, from which they dip away in
various directions as if they were elevated from the bottom of
the sea by the pressure of elastic vapours, which have changed
the lower strata of the island from their horizontal position to
their present one of great inclination,

   The    lavas proceeding from the ancient volcanoes in the Cen-
tre of the island,    and particularly those from the Peak, may be
divided into three sorts: 1st, basaltic lava of a blueish-black
colour, but with an ochrey crust on the outside, very compacts
and with a fracture partly conchoidal. This lava appears to
be the most ancient, and is generally found near the sea; and
when the stratum is thick, it frequently takes the prismatic
form, but when it is rather thin, it is less compact, assumes
the appearance of common trap, and is very similar to the
greenstone of the Salisbury Craigs near Edinburgh:
   The 2nd sort is of a griinsteinic character, of a dark
green appearance it is found in large blocks in the Canadas
                       :
del Pico, resting upon beds of pumice, which are in places
eighty feet thick.
   The 3rd variety is a trachytic porphyry, which forms the
walls of the crater upon the top of the Peak; the colour is a
brownish red, but externally it is white, from the action of
sulphureous vapours upon the argil of the lava.
   The other lavas, though variously modified, maybe classed
under two great divisions: 1st, those of a trachytic character,
which are compact from being forced through the primitive
ejections. And, 2ndly, lavas which are less compact, and have
sometimes a vitreous and sometimes a stony appearance : these
are generally covered with the last ejected masses, which are
always lapilli or white rapilli.
   Frequently the first stratum of the modern lavas, reckoning
from below, is a dull trachytic porphyry, covered by rapilli or
an earthy conglomerate which alternate several times. The
next is generally a cellular augitic lava, containing felspar,
more or less decomposed, alternating the same way as the
others and last of all, at the surface is a sort of basaltic trap
        :
(similar to what is called whinstone in Scotland) of a deep
black colour, but where it is exposed to the atmosphere it is
covered with a yellowish- coloured rind.           Most of the com-
pact lavas strongly affect the magnetic needle, from the quan-
tity of titaniferous iron they contain.
   Upon the sea-coast, about five miles to the west of Orotava,
are basalts of a regular hexagonal figure ; and near the same
spot, at an elevation of about 1 20 feet above the sea, there is a
thick bed of clayey volcanic mud, containing quantities of ma-
rine shells. It is difficult to account for this phenomenon, other-
wise than by supposing that they were drawn into the crater of
the volcano through some crevices between it and the sea,
and afterwards thrown out with the mud. It is well known,
that many of the existing volcanoes have a communication
                                                               "with

            Mr. Alison on   the Geology   of   Teneriffe.       435
with the sea.    Humboldt mentions that some of the Andes
frequently throw out vast quantities of water, and sometimes
mixed with fish. In 1824, a volcano in Lanzerote sent forth
a large body of salt water, which did considerable damage to
the surrounding lands.
   Columnar lava is found not only near the coast, but like-
wise in several ravines at considerable elevations, and even in
theCanadas del Pico, which are eight thousand feet above the
level of the sea.   I have particularly observed that whenever
the stratum of lava is thick, it appears to have a constant ten-
dency to take the prismatic form ; and little difference appears
to exist, whether it cooled quickly or slowly, as the basalt
near the sea, proceeding from a crater four or five miles off,
and flowing over an inclined plane of five degrees and a half, is
equally crystallized [?] as the basalts from a crater only a few
hundred yards off. Occasionally the lower part of the stra-
tum is perfectly crystallized [?], whilst the upper surface is with-
out the slightest sign of crystallization [?], and only presents
a close and compact mass.       These basalts are internally of a
blueish slate-colour or a black, sonorous, compact and hard,
and frequently include small crystals of greenish augite, and
leucite of a vitreous lustre.
   The columns are generally from one to two feet in breadth,
sharply defined, and frequently destitute of articulations; very
few of them are straight, but are bent in the middle like the
ribs of a ship, as if unable while in their soft state to   support
the mass of incumbent matter.          They appear to decompose
quickly by the action of the atmosphere and from the iron
                                                 ;
they contain, all the prisms are covered by a yellowish-co-
loured coating.
   There is a species of basaltic trap exactly similar in com-
position to the columnar basalt     ; but I do not recollect hav-
ing seen it in thick strata, but generally traversing volcanic
breccias in dykes of four or five feet in thickness, nearly per-
pendicular to the horizon.      These aggregates contain a mass
of rounded pieces of lava, strongly calcined, and large cry-
stals of hornblende; the basis or cement is generally a tufa or
brown mud.
   It is worthy of observation, that these dykes are generally
found nearly at the same elevation that is, from four to five
                                        ;
thousand feet above the level of the sea occasionally they are
                                             ;
to be met with higher, but seldom lower.
   In the south-east side of the valley of Orotava, at a place
called los Organos, is the crater of an extinct volcano, which
evidently has fallen in and formed a small but picturesque
valley called Agua Mansa one side of the crater still remains,
                              :

  and presents      a perpendicular wall of aggregates 150 feet high ;
  this wall  is crossed at right angles by dykes of trap, which at
  a distance give it the appearance of the pipes of an organ.
     Near this spot are large scattered masses of amorphous
  amygdaloidal lava, filled with crystals of augite, hornblende,
  idocrase, leucite, felspar       and  cubicite.
     On  the west side of the island, in the valley of Vilna, there
  are high dykes of trap         : the space between these dykes was
  evidently filled up with breccias at one period, but now they
  are destroyed (probably by torrents of water from some of the
  neighbouring volcanoes), leaving isolated walls of trap, which
  the ignorant natives suppose were erected by the Guanches,
  or some supernatural beings. The basaltic dykes do not (like
  those in Scotland and other places) follow a particular point
  of the compass, but they are flexuous and uncertain.
     The composition of lava is not only extremely various from
  the same volcano, but from different parts of the same stream
  near the crater it will be close, compact, and free from cry-
 stals ; but if it be traced to some distance below, it will be
 found frequently to be vesicular, and to contain numerous
 crystals.
     The   lavas are generally in broad streams, from three to
 twenty   feet thick    ;   but large amorphous blocks are frequently
 met  with, containing numerous crystals of augite, felspar and
 hornblende, and occasionally olivine.
     Upon some of the small volcanoes called in the country
 Montaiietas, are found hollow hemispherical masses, which
 I name, from their appearance, volcanic bombs; they are ge-
 nerally twelve inches in diameter           : the exterior is a compact
 reddish-coloured lava, but the interior is much less compact,
 as if following the law of fluid bodies when turning round a
 centre. They are covered generally on the outside by a white
 rind, probably caused by the action of sulphureous vapours.
 Some of the bombs are composed of obsidian to a thickness of
 three or four inches from the outside, but nearer the interior
 they present a fibrous appearance showing its passage into
 pumice.      The montaiietas are covered with irregular de-
 tached pieces of scoriae and volcanic slag they are all much
                                                     ;
tumefied and expanded by sulphureous vapours, and almost
as light as pumice.           These slags frequently exhibit all the
colours of the rainbow, but their general appearance is a dark
blue, a black, or a brown, and some so exactly resemble blue
iron slag that    it is   difficult to distinguish them from     it.
    There are    several varieties of       pumice  in different parts or
the island.  — The      1st,   and most common,     is  of a grayish or a
grayish- white colour, occasionally tinged with red.              The 2nd
                                                                        is

             Mr. Alison on   the Geology of Teneriffe.       437
is  of the same colour, but has a porphyritic character, as
it  contains crystals of augite and felspar: —  these two varie-
ties are in the greatest abundance in the Cafiadas del Pico,
which in many places are covered to the depth of seventy
or eighty feet.    The 3rd variety is of a pale olive colour;
its surface is rough, but the pores are minute.    The 4th is a
gray pumice with small veins of carbonate of lime traversing
it.   The 5th variety hardly ought to be called pumice, as it is
a vitreous obsidian which has had the outside changed by the
great strength of volcanic heat into a dull rough sort of
pumice, with the fibres hardly discernible.
    The 3rd, 4th, and 5th varieties of pumice, I have only
seen in the neighbourhood of the Peak; but no doubt they
are to be found in other places, as pumice entirely covers most
of the plateaux or table-lands of the island (which are only
extinct craters of volcanoes, several square miles in extent);
and when the mountain torrents break through the lavas, and
form ravines of an enormous depth, beds of pumice are fre-
 quently observed of great thickness.     The finest specimens
of pumice are to be seen upon a mountain behind the town
 of Guimar, and I understand they are equal, if not superior,
 to those of the Lipari islands.
    It appears that the white cinders are thrown out last from
 a volcano, and announce the end of an eruption.       When the
 heavy compact lavas had ceased flowing, the black rapilli
 were ejected; after which, the volcanic fires still diminishing
 in strength, the white rapilli were then thrown out, but to a
 smaller distance.
    This last-named production surrounds the Peak, and co-
 vers vast plains some miles from it but from other volcanoes
                                      :
 it seldom extends so far as the sea, nor to a great distance
 from a crater. The black rapilli, on the contrary, are found at
 a^considerable distance from any crater, and frequently in thick
 strata near the sea.
    There are several sorts of tufa, and they generally contain
 a large proportion of carbonate of lime. One sort is generally
 found in rather thin beds under numerous strata of lava; it is
 a brick- red colour, and may be called a puzzalana, as it con-
 sists of a carbonate of lime with silex and a large portion of
 iron, and to have flowed in a perfectly fluid state, and turned
 into a brittle red mass by a stream of hot lava afterwards
 flowing over it.   I have repeatedly observed, that when the
 stratum of lava over it was thicker in one place than in an-
 other, the tufa was of the deepest colour, where it had
 been exposed to the greatest and longest continued heat. The
  second variety resembles trass or tarras, and is found in si-
                                                            milar

milar situations to the      first;   the colour    is yellow and hard,
but  it is  brittle, and rough    to the touch.  The third    sort, called
by the inhabitants Tosca, is a species of piperino the colour is
                                                           ;
a dirty white, and occurs in beds varying in thickness from
twelve inches to twelve feet: it is only a carbonate of lime
mixed with white rapilli. It is sufficiently tenacious for build-
ing purposes, and is used for the upper part of walls and ter-
races.     The fourth variety is of a dark-gray colour, or almost
approaching to a brown, and is used by the inhabitants for the
formation of filtering stones. At Gandelaria, about eight miles
from Santa Cruz, it is found in great abundance, and superior
to any stones for the same purpose that I have seen in Eng-
land.      The price being only a dollar or a dollar and a half
for one of large dimensions, it is an appendage to every house ;
the form of them is a rectangular parallelopiped surmounting
a hemisphere, whose diameter is equal to the side of the square

   Two      or three varieties of obsidian are to be observed in
Teneriffe.     The first is in immense blocks weighing from forty
to one hundred tons       ; they are to be found in the Canadas
near the foot of the Peak, at an elevation of 8100 feet above
the sea, and appear to have been thrown out by the last
eruptions ; they generally approach a spherical form, and
many of them are split or broken into fragments by their fall.
The colour is a greenish-black, with a chatoyant lustre; the
fracture is irregular or hackly, and separates by a slight blow
it frequently presents on the outside a fibrous appearance,
denoting its passage into pumice, and it generally contains
large white crystals of semi-vitrified felspar.              The second
variety is of a very opposite character           :   the colour is a jet
 black, possessing internally a shining vitreous lustre; it is
hard and compact, breaking with a conchoidal fracture, and
is translucent at the edges.          The inhabitants call it Tobo?ia,
 which was the name given it by the Guanches or ancient in-
 habitants, who formed all their cutting instruments of it.              It
 is sometimes found in streams, which in cooling have formed
 large detached blocks, and in other situations it appears in
 long continued currents there is one of considerable thick-
                              :
 ness extending from the north side of the Peak to the district
 of La Guancha, in the valley of Icod, a distance of nine or
 ten miles.      The third variety has all the qualities of the se-
 cond, but it is of a dark-green colour. I have only found it
 in small pieces.

LXVII. On       determining the Longitude by Occultations of the
              fixed Stars. By Mr. Thomas Squire.
   To   the Editors   of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
r^CCULTATIONS of the fixed stars by the moon are
^^ phenomena that would seem to offer the best means for
determining the longitude of places on the earth's surface of
any yet known, at least as far as regards observation; as the
instant of immersion or emersion can mostly be obtained to
the fraction of a second.         But, on the other hand, the com-
putations which are necessary for obtaining the desired re-
sults may, under certain circumstances, require data that are
not so well established as the nature of the problem demands ;
and therefore, though the observations may be taken with the
greatest care, yet the longitudes thence obtained may not al-
ways prove so satisfactory as the known accuracy of the ob-
servations might lead us to expect, even when the process of
computation is managed with the greatest circumspection.
    In confirmation of the above remarks the occultation of
Aldebaran, on the 15th of October 1829, may be very pro-
perly cited as an example.         The weather proving favourable
at the time of this phenomenon, both the immersion and
emersion of the star were accurately observed at Greenwich
and at Epping and from these observations computations
                    ;
have been made upon two suppositions, with the view of ob-
taining the respective longitudes.           First, by considering the
effects of parallax as computed from the altitude of the star,
at the same time using the moon's semidiameter without aug-
mentation for altitude, and the orbital angle as given in the
elements.     Secondly, by using the parallactic depression as
found from the apparent zenith distance of the moon's centre,
also her visible semidiameter, and the correct orbital angle as
found for the times of immersion and emersion.
    Hence, according to the first rule the immersion gives the
longitude of Greenwich =           s
                                     , as it ought to do and that of
                                                             ;
Epping     =  25 s, 37 E., which is also very near the truth; but
the emersion makes the longitude of the former place                 =
23 s, 34 E and that of the latter
            !                            =   49 s -34 E !
    Again, by the second rule the longitude of Greenwich             =
  S,
     8 E., and that of Epping          = 25 s, 92 E., according to the
times of immersion but by emersion the longitude of Green-
                         ;
wich = 23 s "28 E and that of Epping
                       !                            =  49 s '49 E which
                                                                 !
numbers agree very nearly with the above.
    Here then we see that the results according to both me-
thods are correct, or very nearly so, for immersion, yet greatly
                                                                     in

    Mr. Squire on determining Longitudes by         Occultatio?is.      443
in excess for emersion, which might lead us to suppose that
in the latter case there is some error in the observations ; but
as we cannot suspect this to be the case at the Royal Observa-
tory,    and the discrepancy being nearly the same        at both places,
it  may   reasonably be inferred that the time of emersion at Ep-
ping is equally correct as that at Greenwich. And, moreover,
as both methods of computation are founded upon true mathe-
matical principles, it were for these reasons naturally to be ex-
pected that the results for the respective places would have been
the same at emersion as at immersion.             But as that is not the
case, some natural cause must have operated in producing an
 effect in the former instance that did not take place in the
latter, and which, being unknown, could not enter as a com-
 pensating quantity into the elements of computation.
     Before any opinion is hazarded on this point, it may be
 proper to observe, that in this occultation the immersion took
 place at the light, and the emersion at the dark border of the
 moon. Now it is well known that the rays of light suffer a
 degree of inflection when they pass near the surface of an
 opaque body. Hence in this case, when a direct ray of light
 from the star became a tangent to the dark limb of the moon,
 which was the absolute time of emersion, it was bent towards
 that body, and thence thrown off at some distance from the
  spectator ; so that the moon had to advance a few seconds in
  its orbit before the star could be seen by the observer.
      It is pretty evident that some phenomenon of this kind
  must have taken place at the emersion by which the occultation
  was retarded several seconds beyond what the true semidia-
  meter of the moon, and her visible horary motion, would give.
  If therefore we increase the moon's radius a small quantity
   (in the present instance 9"*74), as a compensation for the time
  it took for her western limb to reach the incidental point of
  inflection, then we shall have the longitudes of both places
   as correct at emersion as at immersion*.
      Perhaps, after all, the above may not be considered an
                                            —
   adequate solution of the difficulty: if so, I can only say that
   I have nothing better to offer just now; and therefore hope
   some of your scientific readers will have the goodness to give
   their opinions on the subject, by pointing out the reason why
   correct observations of the immersion and emersion of a star
   at any place should not give the longitude the same, with the
   same method of computation founded upon a true mathema-
   tical basis.    I have not thought it necessary to enter minutely
   into the method of solution, as that must be evident to most
      * Some  observations on the value of the Moon's inflection will be found
   in No. 29 of the Proceedings of the Astronomical Society, p. 190.    Edit.

   Note. The figures contained in the column on the right in the above
Table, as well as those affixed to the species not included in it, refer to
the numbers in Fleming's History of British Animals, which we have in-
serted, in order that the reader who wishes to have a description, or see
the various synonyms of any of the birds here alluded to, may find the
species at once, should he possess that highly useful and most excellent
work.
                                                                     Swallow.

   Swallow.  —  On referring to our remarks upon this species,
it will be seen that we considered the arrival of the Swallow
near Carlisle, last year, unusually early*.        We     have, however,
to record its appearance this year three days sooner, namely
on the 6th of April. Three or four were seen on the 10th,
exactly in the same situation as the one observed last year on
the 9th of April.
                   —
   Sand Martin. This is the first time we have been able to
see the Sand Martin arrive in March since we have paid any
attention to the appearance of the summer birds of passage in
this neighbourhood.       In the year 1788 it was observed nearly
in the same locality as early as the 25th of this month.
   Goatsucker.   — We    have this year been so fortunate as to
obtain six eggs of the Goatsucker, four on the 2nd, and two
on the 6th of June. These were all found exposed on the
bare ground, and so much resembled the small grey or whitish
stones commonly found on heaths and mosses, that in one in-
stance they were found with great difficulty, notwithstanding
the female was put off her eggs.
   The eggs of this species are rather elegantly formed, some
being almost perfectly oval ; they however vary much in size,
weighing from 112 to 134 grains.
                      —
   Pied Flycatcher. Either the Pied Flycatcher was later than
usual in making its appearance this year, or it had escaped our
search; for we could not discover it before the 23rd of April.
A pair had a nest in the identical hole where this species has
bred for four successive years. On the 14th of May this nest
contained eight eggs, arranged in the following manner: one
lay at the bottom, and the remainder were all regularly placed
perpendicularly round the sides of the nest, with the smaller ends
resting upon it, the effect of which was exceedingly beautiful.
    We   regret to observe that we were not successful in our
attempts to rear the two young Pied Flycatchers mentioned
in our last communication f.        We    are satisfied that our want
of success may be attributed, in a great measure, to allowing
them to wash too frequently when first caged, from the
effects of which they never completely recovered.               The first
 died on the 24th of September, the other survived until the
 20 th of October.
    After the beginning of September the strongest bird became
 exceedingly restless and uneasy, especially in the evening and
 at night; and occasionally to such a degree, that the person
 who had the care of it was more than once induced to get up
 in the night, being apprehensive that it had been attacked by
 a cat.   It would frequently start up suddenly from the perch,

446 Notice of the Arrival of some Summer Birds of Passage
dart with great violence against the wires of the cage, flutter
about in the strongest manner, and was often so much ex-
hausted with these efforts, that the whole frame was convulsed
it panted, gasped, and was to all appearance in the very agonies
of death. All these symptoms are we believe common to most
migratory birds when first kept in confinement, and are a strong
proof that this species migrates, notwithstanding the assertion
to the contrary by Montagu and some other authors.            The
plumage underwent a material change: it gradually lost the
dusty speckled feathers peculiar to the majority of young birds,
and had nearly acquired the livery of the female. It proved
however to be a male.
   Ring Ouzel.  — We   could not ascertain that the Ring Ouzel
was seen in its usual breeding haunts before the 22nd of April.
Yet we think it probable it arrived sooner, having secured two
young birds in full feather on the 15th of June. The last
was noticed on the 28th of September.
   123. Greater Spotted Woodpecker (Picus major.)      —  One of
these birds was shot near Croglin on the 8th of September; it is
a species very rarely seen in the neighbourhood. The last was
caught alive by a cat a few years ago in a garden in the sub-
urbs and having received little or no injury, it amused the
      ;
curious for some days, by almost incessantly tapping with its
bill the wooden bars of the cage in which it was confined.
   131. Spotted Gallimde or Rail [Gallinula Porzana).     —  Two
specimens of this prettily marked species have latelyfallen under
our observation. The first was killed on Hayton Moss on
the 9th of September, the second near Jedburgh in Scotland
a week afterwards. Montagu, in his Ornithological Dictio-
nary, makes the following observation upon this species   : — "In
England it has not been observed further north than Cum-
berland."    Whether this is the first Spotted Gallinule that
has been detected in Scotland we know not; yet it is probable
it may have     occurred there since the publication of the
Ornithological Dictionary in the year 1802.
   133. Grey Phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus).   —  The first Grey
Phalarope we believe ever recognized in this part of the county,
was killed on the coast not far from Cardurnock on the 18th
of September.     This bird had a small clay-coloured patch on
each side of the neck near the middle. The sex could not be
ascertained by dissection, owing to the injury it had received.
There was nothing in the stomach except the fragments of a
few shrimps (Crangon x>ulgaris\ and it only weighed one ounce
one dram.
   This is undoubtedly a rare species, especially in the nor-
thern counties but it would appear from the annexed quo-
                ;

it is  not considered by any means rare in some parts of Corn-
wall.     " Not uncommon on the coast in winter, but their ha-
bits make them seem so rare.             They never perch on rocks or
the sands, but alight on the water with ease, and are capable
of swimming against a rapid tide.             Not shy."
    138. Dusky Sandpiper {Totanus fuscus).                 —  A specimen of
this very elegant Sandpiper was shot in Solway Firth near
Bowness on the 13th of October. It was a female; the sto-
mach was empty, and it barely weighed four ounces four
drams. The plumage agreed in almost every respect with the
figure and description of the Spotted Snipe, given by Mon-
tagu in the Supplement to the Ornithological Dictionary;
which, according to Temminck, is a young bird of the year.
   This is unquestionably one of the rarest of the British Sand-
pipers, and in very few cabinets.            Pennant records a solitary
specimen killed in Anglesea; Bewick two in the north; two
others came into the possession of Montagu, both taken in
Devonshire; and the authors of the Catalogue of the Norfolk

of Yarmouth, the fourth near Ipswich f.                    It appears also to
have occurred on the coast near Whitehaven %.
    139. Redshank [Totanus Calidris).            —   Three or four Red-
shanks were shot on Br ugh Marsh on the 20th of August.
This species used formerly to be considered somewhat rare in
this neighbourhood           ;  but during the last few years several
have come under our inspection.
    140. Green Sandpiper [Totanus ochropus).                —  A specimen of
this elegant bird was killed near Walby on the 1st of Sep-
tember, which is the third we have seen within a few years.
    1 56. Knot ( Tringa Canutus).           Three Knots were shot on
the coast on the 9th or 10th of September, and are we believe
the first birds of this species that have been detected in the
neighbourhood of Carlisle.
    158. Ruff (Tringa pugnax).          —   During the month of Sep-
tember five or six of these birds were obtained, one near Park
 House, a second on the coast, and two others not far from
 Kirklinton.       There was little or no variety in their plumage,
being all females or young birds.
    We    cannot find that the Ruff has been noticed in this part
 of the county before.

448    Notice of the Arrival of Birds of Passage at Carlisle.
Turnstones were occasionally seen on the coast between Bowness
and Cardurnock from the middle of May to the beginning of
June.    A young female was killed on the 1 3th of the former,
and an old male nearly in full summer plumage on the 3rd of
the latter month.      This is only the second instance of the
Turnstone having been met with in Cumberland that we are
aware of; the first was killed on the borders of Ulles water on
the 11th of   May  1801.
   1.61.  Grey Plover  {Squatai~ola cinerea).  —  Four Grey Plovers
were procured on the coast      in the  month of September. Di-
minutive as the hind toe of this species is, it varies much ; in
some specimens it is scarcely T\jth, while in others it exceeds
 2
T (jths of an inch in length. The Grey Plover is by no means
common on the shores of Solway Firth, although there can
be little doubt that it is frequently confounded with the Golden
Plover (Charadrius pluvialis) by persons not conversant with
ornithology. It may be, however, always known with facility
by the long black feathers beneath the wing at the base or, as
                                                             ;
Montagu calls them, the inner scapulars, which form an excel-
lent specific distinction.
   Dottrel. — On the 12th of May a gentleman residing          in the
city,  when searching    for Corncrakes, accidentally fell in with
a small flock of Dottrels near Kingmoor House, a short di-
stance from Carlisle two of which he shot.
                       ;                            This occurrence
had no sooner transpired, than the remainder were almost
immediately pursued, and we have reason to believe that not
one escaped. Ten came under our inspection ; the majority
were young birds, and not -one had acquired the perfect
plumage of the adults in summer. A single specimen was
shot on Cardurnock Moss about the middle of August, and
another was killed on Cross Fell on the 18th of September.
    The spring of this year was remarkably early, and when
compared with the preceding, the vegetation in general was
fully three  weeks in advance. The temperature of the wea-
ther during the last week in March and throughout the greater
part of April was unusually mild, warm, and genial.             This,
however, was succeeded by one of the wettest summers almost
ever recollected in this district.     It will be seen upon inspect-
ing the subjoined Table, that from the 1st of May to the 30th
of September, an interval of one hundred and fifty-three days,
there was more or less rain on one hundred and seventeen
days, leaving only thirty-six fair days, or little more than one
 month out of the five.

Elements of Practical Chemistry,' Comprising a Series of Experiments
    in every    Department of Chemistry, fyc. By David Boswell
    Reid, Experimental Assistant to Professor Hope, fyc. &;c.
 THIS work         is presented to the chemical student under circum-
       stances calculated        to raise high expectations of its value.
 Mr. Reid was formerly the pupil, and is now the chemical assistant,
                 —
 of Dr. Hope, a lecturer, who is justly celebrated for the excellence
 and accuracy of his experimental illustrations to him the book is
                                                         :
 dedicated, and we may, perhaps, not unfairly presume that it did
 not make its appearance entirely without his sanction.
     Thus advantageously situated, Mr, Reid must excuse us, if we
 examine his pretensions, which are by no means slight, with some
 degree of minuteness. " The object of this work," says the author,
 " is to present the student with a systematic series of experiments,
 sufficiently broad to lay a proper foundation for acquiring habits of
 practical skill in chemical operations, with precise and minute direc-
 tions for enabling him to perform them."
     We    shall not pay any attention to Mr. Reid's arrangement, nor
  proceed regularly through the work, but confine our remarks prin-
  cipally to the chapter on Nitric Acid. The subject is one of iroport-
   ..N.S. Vol. 8. No. 48. Dec. 1830.                       3 M             ance

 ance   ; and as it Involves in our opinion no peculiar difficulty, either
 theoretical or practical, we trust we shall be considered as acting
  candidly towards the author in selecting it for examination.
     To prepare nitric acid, Mr. Reid directs the use of equal weights
 of nitre and sulphuric acid, and recommends that the acid distilled
 should be condensed in a receiver kept cold by a slender stream of
  water.    Now although in this operation the receiver certainly be-
 comes slightly warm, yet it is never rendered hot; and we know
 from direct experiment that within       ^^   of the whole quantity of
 acid contained in the nitre may be procured without the aid of
 any artificial cooling whatever; when, however, it is required, the
 plan of placing the receiver in a vessel of cold water is much more
 simple and easy of execution, and requires much less attention
 than the mode of cooling recommended by Mr. Reid. In the figure
 representing the apparatus a flask is employed instead of a proper
 receiver: now this, on account of its form, must render the appa-
 ratus liable to accident from unsteadiness a common bottle is
                                                  ;
 much better, but a tubulated receiver used with it is greatly to be
 preferred.
    " The   distillation" of nitric acid, says Mr. Reid, p. 54, " may
 also be   conducted   in flasks with a long glass tube bent at one end
in the manner shown in the figure, or the condensation of the acid
 may be effected almost entirely in the tube. This is a very con-
 venient method of conducting the process, and is often preferred
 to distilling the nitric acid from a retort, though beginners find
some difficulty in adjusting the tube. The nitre and the sulphuric acid
are first put into the flask, and a thin tube bent at an acute angle,
about two inches from one extremity, and a very little less in dia-
meter than the neck of the flask, is surrounded with some well-
worked clay, and put into it, a small quantity of plaster of Paris
being placed over the luting to render it tight."
    The reason for this apparatus being " often preferred," Mr. Reid
has not given; nor can we discover any, unless that which is con-
fessedly difficult to beginners is peculiarly easy to the initiated.
We    do however assert, without having tried, and without intending
to attempt this process, that it is the most inconvenient which it is
possible to devise; a flask is much less proper than a retort, as will
occur to any one who will for a moment compare the diameters of
the descending tube of the former, with the descending aperture of
the neck of the latter: owing to the narrowness of the tube, much
nitric acid which condenses, necessarily runs back into the flask,
and consequently the process is lengthened. It must be difficult,
not only to the beginner but also to the veteran, to fasten the glass
tube into the flask with clay and to render it secure two lutes are
                                  ;
recommended, when in common cases one is sufficient a thin tube
                                                           ;
when bent is extremely apt to break at the angle, more especially
when it is to be fastened into two flasks, one of which is unsteadily
supported on a ring, and the other equally so on its side.
    In explaining the nature of the action occurring between sul-
phuric acid and nitre, Mr. Reid observes " Every two equivalents
                                              :
                                                                       of

of the common sulphuric acid (96) consist of two equivalents of
water (18), and two of dry sulphuric acid (80); the nitrate of pot-
ash on the other hand, is composed of one equivalent of potash
 (48), and one of nitric acid (54).        The dry sulphuric acid com-
bines with the potash, forming bisulphate of potash, and the water
goes to the nitric acid, forming the liquid which is condensed in the
receiver :" and we are afterwards informed (p. 56) that the nitric
acid of the nitre requires two equivalent portions of water to con-
dense it. When we first noticed that according to the above state-
ment, 18 added to 80, are equal to only 96, we considered it as an
error of the press; but in the following page the same blunder
is more conspicuously repeated in a diagram        ;   we must, therefore,
charge Mr. Reid with an extreme want of attention. When cor-
rected we admit that this is the view of the subject taken by the
late Dr.Wollaston   ; but it is not an accurate one, as Mr. Reid might
have seen in the second volume of the Phil. Mag. and Annals of
Philosophy, p. 430. It is not the dry sulphuric acid only which com-
bines with the potash, the bisulphate always contains water, which is
essential to its exstence ; consequently the whole of the water does
not go to the nitric acid, and two equivalents of water are not re-
quired to condense one equivalent of nitric acid.
    Indeed Mr. Reid has given two tables of the strength of liquid
nitric acid of different densities   ;   and if he had examined them,
one of two things must have occurred to him viz. either that his
                                                     :
assertion, as to the smallest quantity of water which is capable of
condensing a given proportion of nitric acid, was erroneous or that ;
these tables were both extremely inaccurate.           The first of them is
Dr. Thomson's it shows not only the per-centage of real acid, but
                  ;
also the atomic constitution; and it surely ought to have excited
Mr. Reid's notice, that according to this table it is acid of sp. gr.
 T4855, which contains 75 per cent of real acid, and which is stated
to be constituted of 1 atom of acid, and 2 atoms of water; whereas
Mr. Reid asserts that this is the composition and atomic constitu-
tion of acid of sp. gr. 15. The second table is Dr. Ure's        ; and if he
had doubted the accuracy of Dr. Thomson's statement, he would
have found its correctness confirmed by referring to Dr. Ure, who
mentions that acid of sp. gr. 1-485 contains 74918 per centof real
acid.
   It is quite evident that Mr. Reid never compared these things,
or he would not have considered that statements so contradictory,
as that a table founded on the assumption that acid of P4S55 con-
 tains 75 per cent of acid, would " be found vei*y convenient to refer
 to in making experiments," when he had previously asserted that
 acid of sp. gr. 1500 was of that strength.
    After having mentioned the weights of nitre and sulphuric acid
 proper to be employed, and adverted to the circumstances attend-
 ing the use of one atom each of the acid and salt, we did not ex-
 pect that our author would have given further instructions on the
subject ; but to our surprise the following directions occur at p. 56 :
 " in conducting this process on the small scale, three ounces (water)
                                 3 M   2                             measure

measure) of sulphuric acid to eight ounces by weight of nitre will
be found convenient proportions." In this short quotation there is
much to perplex a student; but "precise and minute directions"
for enabling him to perform the experiment are lamentably defi-
cient. The quantities which had been previously mentioned, we sup-
posed were intended for operations on the small scale, since flasks
are the vessels in which they are directed to be conducted and we
                                                               ;
have heard of wine measure, beer measure, and imperial measure,
but we have yet to learn what water measure is. An ounce water
measure may, we conceive, have several meanings first, the measure
                                                    ;
of an avoirdupois ounce of water j secondly, the fluid ounce used in
the London Pharmacopoeia and, thirdly, the measure of a troy
                               ;
ounce of water so that the student has the chance of using a
                  :
measure equal to 480, ^5^5, or 437'5 grains of water. Nor is this
all ; he is directed to take eight ounces of nitre, and " by weight,"
for fear he should measure them but as to whether the ounces are
                                    ;
to be avoirdupois or troy weight, he is totally without a guide. As
however the quantities, whatever they may be, are specially di-
rected for the " small scale," the student may suppose that they
are to be as different as he can make them by the laxity of the rule,
from the proportions previously assigned      :  in this case he may
take the avoirdupois ounce of water for the measure of the acid,
and the troy ounce in weighing the nitre and then the weight of
                                            ;
the acid will be to that of the nitre about as 2 to 3*16, which are
indeed very nearly the quantities given in the Edinburgh Phar-
macopoeia, and proportions less in unison with the doctrine of equi-
valents could hardly be adopted : on one plan of operation the
quantity of sulphuric acid is too great, and that of the water which
it contains is too small on the other.
    Referring to the red acid, which is a mixture of nitric and ni-
trous acids, Mr. Reid says " It is seldom necessary to expose the
                             :
mixed acid to heat so as to obtain pure and colourless nitric acid, as it
may be used for almost all the purposes to which the latter is applied.
It is even preferred in many processes from its great strength, being
always stronger and more active than the pale acid. Dr.Hope has
prepared it with so high a specific gravity as P54, though the spe-
cific gravity of the colourless acid does not exceed 1*500."     Others
have obtained the red acid of a still higher specific gravity than
Dr. Hope but whatever may be its density, we deny that it is on
            ;
that account stronger than pale acid, nor are we aware that it is
more active and if it Were so, the proof would be difficult, for it is
              ;
never used as a solvent without previous dilution.
   When nitric oxide gas is passed into colourless nitric acid it be-
comes red, and its density is considerably increased : when, how-
ever, water is added, which must be done before use, the nitric
oxide is expelled, leaving the acid without either increase or di-
minution of solvent power : if then we use equal weights of con-
centrated pale and red acid, the former will be the stronger.        We
think we can also defy Mr. Reid to point out a single process, in
which the coloured acid is to be preferred to the pale we know
                                                            :
                                                                    that

            Reid's " Elements of Practical Chemistry"                453
 that Dr. Hope has already made a similar assertion, but it was un-
 accompanied by proof, and the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia certainly
does not contain any.
    At page 60 our author states that " nitric acid (by which the com-
 mon liquid nitric acid is always understood, composed of one equi-
valent of real acid and two of water,") possesses certain properties,
 all of which it is not requisite to quote  ; but he tells us that " it is
 distinguished from all other acids by the facility with which it af-
fords oxygen to metals and combustible bodies, most of which de-
 compose it with great rapidity." This the reader will remember is
stated of acid of sp. gr. 1-5 : and yet in direct contradiction to this,
and only six lines further on in the same page, we are informed
 that nitric acid of sp. gr. 1-48 " is scarcely affected by the metals
at ordinary temperatures/' requiring the addition of a "small quan-
tity of water" to cause its decomposition. Here then occurs another
instance of that want of care of which we have given so many}
nitric acid of sp. gr. 1-5, containing of course less water than that
of 1*48, is decomposed by metals " with great rapidity;" while that
of 1*48, which contains more water than that of 1-50, " is scarcely
affected by the metals at ordinary temperatures, without adding a
small quantity of water."
    Let us then suppose that the acid is to be diluted; yet when it is
decomposed by metals " all the oxygen, however, is not withdrawn
from the nitrogen, nitric oxide, and nitrous acid, being generally
disengaged during the action that takes place." These statements
are, we apprehend, not quite correct    : we admit that nitric oxide is
usually evolved, and sometimes nitrous oxide is mixed with it; but
the nature of the gases depends upon the strength of the acid and
the nature of the metal; for zinc and very dilute nitric acid, give
nitrous oxide nearly pure and unmixed with nitric oxide and we ;
much doubt whether nitrous acid is in any case whatever evolved.
Has not Mr. Reid mistaken the production of nitrous acid, by the
action of nitric oxide upon the oxygen of the atmosphere, for its
direct evolution by the action of the metal ?
    On the subject of the action of dilute nitric acid upon the metals,
Mr. Reid has, if we mistake not, committed another error. After
stating that the nitric acid and water are both decomposed, he says
" When this takes place, the hydrogen of the water unites with the
nitrogen of the acid forming ammonia, which combines with part of
the nitric acid that is not decomposed, forming nitrate of am-
monia this explains,'' continues Mr. Reid, " the appearance of the
        :
white fumes which are often seen intimately blended with the ni-
trous acid vapours that are formed when this acid is decomposed
by a metal having a great affinity for oxygen."
    For our part, we must confess that we had never observed this
blending of white and red vapours during the solution of a metal
but Jiat experimentum is our motto, and we accordingly mixed
some diluted nitric acid and tin and we do admit that for a mo-
                                   ;
ment, and by the action of the heat generated before any consi-
derable evolution of nitric oxide occurred, that some white vapours
                                                                   were

454?                 Notices respecting  New   Books.
 were visible; they were, however, instantaneously succeeded by
 red fumes, in which it required powers of vision superior to those
of second sight to detect any blending of white vapour.
   We   suppose that Mr. Reid takes the .white vapour for volatilized
nitrate of ammonia    : but he must surely be aware that this salt is
decomposed at a low temperature and not vaporized and in proof
                                                        ;
that it is neither decomposed nor volatilized in the present instance,
it is well known that when lime is added to the oxide of tin, the
nitrate of ammonia diffused through it is decomposed and the al-
kali evolved.
   Mr. Reid next notices the action of nitric oxide upon nitric acid,
and the changes of colour which result from it. " If a current of
nitric oxide gas be transmitted through colourless nitric acid, a
large quantity of this gas is absorbed, and the acid speedily ac-
quires a light-straw colour, which deepens to a reddish brown, and
passes through various shades of olive and green, till it at last be-
comes almost blue." From this statement, it would appear that the
only circumstance which determines the colour of the acid, is the
quantity of nitric oxide which it absorbs. We have been already
instructed to consider, that by nitric acid we are to understand that
which is concentrated, and such we presume is that to be employed
in this experiment; and if this be the case, the effects produced are
described with extreme and most culpable inaccuracy. In the first
place, strong nitric acid never becomes at all either olive, green, or
blue by absorbing nitric oxide     : and what proves that Mr. Reid
never made the experiment is, that when the colours are produced
they do not occur in the order stated by him ; nor is acid of any
one degree of strength capable of exhibiting them all, whatever
may be the quantity of nitric oxide passed into it. If, for example,
pale acid of sp. gr. 1-46 be used, the nitric oxide renders it for a
moment    yellowish, and then it becomes red, but never olive, green,
nor blue at all : dilute a portion of this acid with an equal bulk of
water, the nitric oxide then renders it green, but it assumes no
other colour mix three measures of the acid with four of water, and
              ;
the mixture may be rendered blue, but neither yellow, olive, red,
nor green. The mistakes committed by Mr. Reid in this part of
the subject are the more remarkable, because in the very next page
to that in which they occur, he shows that the production of the
different colours does not depend upon the quantity of nitric oxide
absorbed by strong acid, but upon that retained after various de-
grees of dilution for he says, if small quantities of water be added
                  ;
to the strong fuming acid, " it gradually loses its deep orange red
colour and passes through various shades of olive, green and blue ;
and if a sufficient quantity of water be added, it becomes quite
colourless."
   " Pure nitric acid," according to our author, " is easily recog-
nised by the facility with which it is decomposed by inflammable
substances and the metals, especially zinc, tin, mercury and cop-
per, and the large quantity of deep ruddy fumes which are disen-
gaged." Now this is a method of ascertaining the purity of nitric
                                                                 acid

               Reid's " Elements of Practical Chemistry"               4>55
  acid which, we believe, never occurred to any chemist before.
  Mr. Reid surely does not mean to state that an admixture of sul-
 phuric or muriatic acid would prevent the action of the nitric acid
 so contaminated     ;  on the contrary, he must know that there is a
                           —
  " lovely experiment;" we mean the accension of oil of turpentine
 by nitric acid, in which it is common to add sulphuric acid to it,
 to accelerate the combustion.         We really suspect that the word
 pure has crept in here by mistake and yet something is wanting
                                          ;
 to account for the introduction of the remainder of the paragraph,
 for we have been before told of the mutual action of nitric acid,
 metals, and combustibles.
    Continuing the quotation, we learn that pure nitric acid, "when
 present in small quantitj', however, is not so easily recognised,
   a there are no substances with which it forms characteristic
 and insoluble precipitates.       The only test indeed which can be
 relied on, is that proposed by Dr. Liebig [Ann. de Chimie, xxxv.
p. 80.)   : he recommends the liquid under examination to be mixed
 with a solution of indigo in sulphuric acid till it requires [acquires]
a perceptible blue colour a few drops of sulphuric acid are then
                              :
added to the solution, and the whole is boiled for a short time. If
the liquid contain any nitric acid it will be completely deprived of
colour, or rendered yellow if the proportion of acid is extremely
small."
    We    presume that Mr. Reid     will not insist that the acid must be
pure   in  order that its presence may be detected, though such is the
legitimate inference deducible from his statement.        We  may also ob-
serve that Liebig's process is not intended for the detection of un-
combined nitric acid, as Mr. Reid supposes, but of a nitrate and     ;
the use of the sulphuric acid is to separate the nitric acid from its
base, that it may act upon the indigo.          Our author then informs us
that another very delicate test consists in subjecting a solution,
suspected to contain a nitrate, to the action of sulphuric and muri-
atic acid and gold-leaf; adding, " this test, however, cannot be re-
lied on in all cases, as chloric acid produces the same effect when
treated in this manner."        Now we would simply inquire whether
the acid of a chlorate would not by suffering decomposition also
discharge the colour of indigo? Mr. Reid must admit this, for
chlorine is notoriously employed for this purpose ; there can there-
fore be no difference in the accuracy of the two modes, as far as
the action of chloric acid is likely to interfere.
    We  have now arrived at the concluding paragraph of the chap-
ter on Nitric .Acid; it is as follows   :
                                            •' Oxygenated nitric acid may
be prepared much in the same manner as oxygenated water, the
deutoxide of barium being dissolved in diluted nitric acid, the
bastes removed by sulphuric acid, and the liquid that remains
strengthened by evaporation in the exhausted receiver of the air-
pump. It presents the same general phsenomena with many of the
metals and metallic oxides, &c. as oxygenated water, but has not
hitherto been applied to any use." In the yearl818 (Annals of Phi-
losophy, vol. xv. p. 378), M. Thenard announced to the Academy
                                                                         of

of Sciences, that " by carefully dissolving superoxidized barytes in
nitric acid, and precipitating the barytes from it by sulphuric acid,
the excess of oxygen remains united with the former acid, which by
this means becomes oxygenized nitric acid."           How soon M. The-
nard discovered that he had mistaken the nature of the compound
formed, we do not know but in the fourth edition of his Traite de
                             ;
Ckimie, published in 1824, he says (vol. ii. p. 83), " Puisque les
acides donnent plus de stabilite a l'eau oxigenee, c'est sans doute en
se corabinant avec le peroxide d'hydrogene         : du moins, dans l'etat
actuel de la chimie, la composition de ce peroxide rend toute autre
hypothese invraisemblable.         A v la verite, cette opinion n'est pas
celle que j'avais adoptee d'abord: j'avais pense que 1'oxigene se
combinait avec les acides, et qu'il en resultait un grand nombre
de nouveaux acides oxigenees." As the result of further experi-
ments he concludes : " je compris et je reconnus bientot que ce qui
m'avait paru etre des acides oxigenees n'etait que l'eau oxigenee et
acidifiee."    It is clear, therefore, even in the opinion of Thenard
himself, that no such compound as oxygenated nitric acid exists
and it is singular that Mr. Reid should have stated that as a fact,
which had been six years at least exploded by its promulgator
more especially as there is not, that we know of, one work on the
subject of chemistry written during that period, which contains any
notice of the existence of such an acid.
   The circumstance which we have just pointed out, as well as the
numerous mistakes that have been previously detected, prove that
Mr. Reid is not sufficiently acquainted with the science which he
has undertaken to teach and even when he appears to possess
                              :
some knowledge of facts, they are usually very loosely, imperfectly
and incorrectly stated. We might adduce numerous instances to
those already given in support of these charges, but we shall now
conclude, with adding, that the work is very inaccurately printed
for in the chapter which we have examined, there occur four typo-
graphical errors, only one of which has been corrected and we    ;
have detected several in other parts of the work, that are not in-
cluded in the Errata.

the ring and satellites are good tests.    The instruments which were
employed in the present investigations were two Newtonian reflec-
tors, —  one, supposed by Watson, of 40 inches focus, and 6^ aper-

ture.    The first, under favourable circumstances, gives a most ex-
cellent image the latter is a very good instrument.

The inner edge appears more yellow than the rest of the ring, and
nearer in colour to the body of the planet.

appearances shown as on the 30th November, 1825, but no divisions
seen in the outer ring.      I am, therefore, the more persuaded that
they are not permanent." With the Dollond.
   On the 17th December, when the divisions were most distinctly
seen, Captain Kater made a drawing of the appearance of Saturn
and his rings. The phenomena were witnessed .by two other per-
sons on the same evening, one of whom saw several divisions in
the outer ring, while the other saw one middle division only but   ;
'-he latter person was short-sighted, and unaccustomed to telescopic
observations.
   It will be remarked, that these divisions were not seen on other
evenings, which yet were considered very favourable for distinct
vision.
   It seems that the same appearances were seen by Mr. Short, but
the original record of his observations cannot be found.
   In Lalande's Astronomy (third edition), article 3351, it is said,
" Cassini remarked that the breadth of the ring was divided into
two equal parts by a dark line having the same curvature as the
    N.  S.  Vol.   8. No. 48. Dec. 1830.           3 N              ring,

 ring,  and that the exterior portion was the less bright." {Mim.
 1715, p. 13,)   Short told me that he observed still more singular
 phenomena with his large telescope of 12 feet.
    The breadth of the ansse, or extremities of the ring, was, according
to him, divided into two parts,   — an inner portion without any break
in the illumination, and an outer, divided by several lines concen-
tric with the circumference    ; which would lead to a belief that there
are several rings in the same plane.
    Delambre and Biot severally state, that Short saw the outer ring
divided, probably on the authority of Lalande cited above.       There is
a note to the same purpose in Brewster's edition of Ferguson's Astro-
nomy, but without reference to the source from which it is taken.
   In December 1813, at Paris, Professor Quetelet saw the outer
ring divided, with the achromatic telescope of 10 inches aperture,
which was exhibited at the exposition. He mentioned this the fol-
lowing day to M. de la Place, who observed, that " those, or even
more divisions, were conformable to the system of the world."
    But, on the other hand, the division of the outer ring was not
seen by Sir William Herschel (Phil. Trans. 1792), nor by Mr. Her-
schel in 1826, nor by M. Struve in the same year; and on several
occasions when the atmospheric conditions were most favourable, it
 has not been seen by Captain Kater.
   " It has been remarked by Sir William Herschel, by M. Struve,
and by most persons who have observed Saturn, that the exterior
ring is much less brilliant than the interior.    May not this want of
light in the outer ring arise from its having a very dense atmo-
sphere? and may not this atmosphere in certain states admit of the
divisions of the exterior ring being seen, though, under other cir-
cumstances, they remain invisible ?
   " With respect to the form of the edge of the inner ring of
Saturn next to the planet, the appearance under favourable cir-
cumstances is such as to leave no doubt on my mind of its being
rounded."

South Wales      to England, by Charles Rumker, Esq., Member of
the Society.
   1st. A short table, with directions for ascertaining the time ap-
proximately by the position of the constellation of the Cross.    For a
rough estimation, it may be remembered that the Cross is vertical
above the pole at midnight 21st March, and vertical below the pole
at midnight Sept. 23rd.
   2nd. Observations of the variation and dip of the needle, made on
the passage home in 1829, round Cape Horn      :  and,
   3rd. Currents.
   "The waters of the Pacific being supposed higher than those of
the Atlantic, I expected an easterly current on approaching Cape
Horn, but I could discover none. Near the northern coast of the
Brazils and Guiana we experienced strong currents to the west, in
conformity with Humboldt's theory of an indraft into the Caribbean
Sea, occasioned by an equatorial current."       Mr. R. gives a table of
comparison between the ship's place by observation and that obtained
by the log, with the drift and force of the current for twenty-four
hours.

          " Sargasso Weeds. In the North Atlantic Ocean, coming
from the south, you fall in about the tropic with the Sargasso weeds,
collected in narrow lines extending in the direction in which the
trade wind blows, that is, E.N.E. and W.S.W., and the eye cannot
see the end of them on either side of the vessel.      These lines run
constantly parallel to each other, and the nearer you come to the
middle of the Sargasso Sea the thicker it is strewed with weeds, and
the closer the lines approach to one another, being in some places
but fifteen feet asunder. Home-bound ships have abetter opportu-
nity of observing these lines, as they cross them nearly at right
angles, and can trace their continuation more conveniently on both
sides, observing one line after another in rapid succession.
    *'
       These weeds occupy the zone from about 20° to 35° north lati-
tude, which may, however, differ according to the longitude in which
you cross it. Towards the zone's northern extreme the weeds are
less regularly formed in lines, which may arise from their being less
 methodically acted upon by the trade-winds that seem to occasion
 their order.    They have been termed gulf-weeds by sailors, who
believed them to be driven out of the gulf by the Florida stream }      -
 nor is this opinion entirely refuted by the experience that they are

rarely  met with   in the gulf.    For the weed swimming on the surface
of the Atlantic     is withered, decayed, and incrusted with salt, which
proves the time    it has been exposed to the sun, and is of a brownish-
yellow colour, whilst you rarely meet with a green bunch : that,
being heavier on account of its higher state of vegetation, swims seve-
ral feet below the surface.       It is true that not with certainty can any
roots, thicker branches, or stems, be perceived, wherewith they
might have adhered to rocks or the ground : nevertheless, as these
weeds abound with animals that do not live upon the surface, but
inhabit the bottom of the sea, such as crabs, shrimps, barnacles, con-
chilias of all descriptions, and serpents, I have no doubt that they
originated in a shallow basin of water, out of which they were swept
by the force of a current along the bottom, until the heavier vegetable
fluid being exhausted, they rose to the surface.          Moreover, they are
never seen near the European or African coast, but most plentifully
found about the entrance of the gulf."

observers should be careful to swing the pendulum in the magnetic
meridian for comparative observations.
   VI. On Mayer's celebrated Catalogue of Zodiacal Stars, by Fran-
cis Baily, Esq.
   Since the publication of the Astronomical Observations of Mayer,
by the late Board of Longitude, Mr. Baily has examined the position
of every star, by comparing each of them not only with the observa-
tions, but also with the catalogues of Bradley and Piazzi, by which
means he has been enabled to detect many inaccuracies in Mayer's
catalogue, which have hitherto puzzled the practical astronomer
and he has now given us a corrected catalogue, together with refe-
rences to every observation of every star, in a collateral column, as
well as the difference between the results of Mayer's observations
and those    of Bradley, his contemporary, in another collateral column.
The   corrections which Mr. Baily has actually introduced are those
only which are sanctioned by the observations themselves              : at the
same time, he has pointed out other corrections, which, although
only conjectural, are highly probable ; but these are kept distinct
from the former. The author has subjoined a list of some other stars
observed by Mayer, but not contained in his catalogue, as well as a
list of several occultations.     From    the result of Mr, Baily's investiga-
                                                                         tions,

 ley  and Mayer   in the declination of the stars 5 and it is a remarkable
 fact, that the differences are almost always on the same side        :  the
 mean of all the comparison is 4", 27, which is the quantity by which
 Bradley's north polar distances exceed those of Mayer. There is a
 greater discordancy, as might be expected, in the right ascensions.

                Seventeenth Annual Report of the Council.
[The Council, after noticing the demise of His late Majesty, who
    originally took the Society under his protection, as Patron, during
    the period of his Regency, and also the accession of his Royal
    Brother to the Throne, and suggesting an address of condolence
    and congratulation, proceed as follows :]
   The communications which have been made to the Society since
the publication of its third volume of Transactions being quite suf-
ficient to fill another volume, the Council suggest that an immediate
arrangement be made for the printing and publication of a fourth
volume : and as the Society will probably take one hundred copies
for its members, those who may wish to be furnished with copies
will intimate their wish to the Secretary.*
   The Council cannot refrain from expressing the pleasure which
they feel in communicating to the Society a proposal from Dr. Paris,
its Founder, made to them in person on this day, viz. To deposit with
the President the sum of Ten Guineas, to be laid out on a Medal, to
be presented to the writer of the best practical communication on
Mining, to be made to the Society at their next annual meeting.
    The donations of metallic and earthy minerals have not been
great during the last year ; but for those which have been received,
the Society are indebted to the kindness of Lieutenant General
Tench, Mr. Alfred Fox, Mr. Joseph Carne, &c. In the department
of Geology, however, the Council have to congratulate the Meeting
upon a large and interesting series        : their late highly respected
Secretary Dr. Boase has during the past summer investigated the
geological structure of the north, and a considerable part of the
centre of the county     j he has traced the rock formations of Pydar,
   * Agreeably to this suggestion, it was resolved by the Society, " That
a fourth  volume of Transactions be immediately published.''

 accompanied by a beautiful section of the different districts, and a
 series of illustrative specimens.   This valuable contribution will not
 only form a very prominent feature in the Geology of Cornwall, but

    ON THE SESgUIPERSULPHATE OF MERCURY. BY LIEUT.
                  W. T. HOPKINS, UNITED STATES.
   " Having had occasion, lately, to pour strong nitric acid on the
yellow neutral persulphate of mercury, known as the ' turpeth mine-
ral,' 1 observed that a portion of the salt disappeared, while the re-
mainder was converted into a white powder. This substance was
readily reconverted by water into the yellow salt.          I succeeded how-
ever in edulcorating a portion of it without change ; and upon boil-
ing thirty grains of it with nitrate of baryta, digesting afterward with
nitric acid, (to remove a portion of peroxide of mercury which was
deposited,) washing, drying, and weighing, I obtained 9 grains of ]
sulphate of baryta.      Now 19 grains of sulphate of baryta contain
6*44 grs. of sulphuric acid, and the white powder submitted to experi-
ment consisted of sulphuric acid, 6"44 grs.         +   peroxide of mercury,
23'56 grs.   = 30.   We   have therefore the proportion
                      23-56   : 6-44  :•.  216  : 59-04
where 216 represents the atom of peroxide of mercury, and 59"04 the
quantity of sulphuric acid that would combine with it to produce the
compound under examination. If the numbers I had obtained had
been 6*48 and 23'52, the proportion would have been
                         23-52  : 6-48   : : 216  : 60
                                                                             and

and   this last  term would precisely represent 1 \ atom of sulphuric
acid.   The   hastiness of  my experiment could account for a much
greater discrepancy.
   This sesquisulphate has no very interesting properties. It ap-
pears to be insoluble, but is easily decomposed by cold water.
It is usually said that the action of water upon the white biper-
sulphate of mercury consists in the resolution of it into the yellow,
insoluble, neutral sulphate, and a soluble supersulphate.             Yet
upon evaporating the liquor thus obtained, I observed the deposition
of a white substance resembling in its external characters the biper-
sulphate; while the supernatant liquid had those of free sulphuric
acid."    Silliman's Journal, vol. xviii. p. 364.
           ON CHLORIDE OF        SILVER.     BY M. CAVALIER.
   The colour produced in    chloride of silver by the action of light has
long been known, and a similar change is apparently produced by
some chemical reagents, but whether the alterations are identical is a
question which M. Cavalier says he does not pretend to decide ; he
then states a method by which the violet chloride of silver may be
procured without the agency of light       : Dissolve some recently pre-
pared and perfectly white chloride of silver in ammonia, and pass a
current of chlorine gas through it, and the same phaenomenaas occur
when the gas is passed through mere solution of ammonia will be
presented; such as slight detonation on the arrival of each bubble,
abundant white vapours, increase of temperature, and the disengage-
ment of azotic gas, &c. Afterwards the solution becomes turbid,
and soon a grayish precipitate is observed, and at length it assumes
a well marked violet colour ; this colour occurs when the ammonia
is completely decomposed by the chlorine.
   What is the nature of this new substance } Is it a smaller or greater
quantity of chlorine which has modified the properties of the chloride,
or is it identical with the white chloride ; and is the colour acquired
merely by a different molecular arrangement?
   The following experiments are in favour of the latter opinion.
   If the violet chloride be dissolved in ammonia, nitric acid precipi-
tates it white. Take 20 grains of violet and 20 grains of white chloride,
put each into a glass and with them diluted sulphuric acid and a piece
of zinc, stirring the chloride with the latter so as to keep it sus-
 pended ; the chlorides are both decomposed by the hydrogen evolved
and metallic silver is obtained, and from each chloride the same quan-
tity, viz. 15 grains.
   According to these experiments, the new substance cannot be
regarded either as a subchloride or a deutochloride ; every circum-
stance seems to prove that the colour is produced merely by a diffe-
rent molecular arrangement.       In this case it remains to be explained
what is the body which forces the chloride to acquire a differentphysical
property.     The heat produced during the operation has certainly
nothing to do with it, for the experiment succeeds equally when the
vessel is placed in a freezing mixture.       Journal de Pharmacie, xvi.

                            AURORA BOREALIS.
     At 20 minutes past 7 o'clock in the evening of the 5th of October,
 an aurora borealis suddenly rose between the N. by E. and N.W.,
 a little above the edge of a dark cirrostratus cloud, which was seven
 or eight degrees above the horizon: after remaining a steady arc
about ten minutes, several thin columns of light emanated from
 it, and two meteors passed under Ursa Major.              A few minutes
 before eight, two or three more coruscations rose from the aurora,
 which was perceptible till after the moon rose.
    At ten o'clock in the evening of the 16th an aurora borealis
 again appeared, from which several wide red columns emanated
 between the true and magnetic north, and rose to the same altitude
 as the star fi in Ursa Major.       The aurora disappeared in half an
hour, and one meteor fell near the star Benetnasch.            It also ap-
peared the following evening, but without any coruscations and         ;
two meteors appeared over it.

            OCCULTATION OF ALDEBARAN BY THE MOON.
    In the morningof the 6th of October, at 6 h 46 m 21 s apparent time,
an immersion of Aldebaran behind the moon's enlightened limb, about
22° on the right of her vertex, was observed at Gosport. Alde-
baran appeared on the moon's limb nine or ten seconds before it
finally disappeared, but this unusual time was owing in a great
measure to the oblique immersion of the star, and the consequent
small chord which it had apparently to describe.
    The exact time of the emersion was not observed, it having
taken place several minutes sooner than the computed time ; but it
could not have exceeded a few seconds before or after 7 h 2 m apparent
time here. Missing the time of the emersion was regretted, as it
might have been of some service to those who had taken the trouble
to comnute the occultation.

     General Observations.           —  This has been the finest and driest October that
 we have had          for   many    years past, but not the warmest. From the 3rd to
 the 22nd no rain fell here; the atmosphere was often transparent and
 cloudless, and its elasticity very seldom broken by the wind; therefore the
 mercury in the barometer maintained a high elevation till the 28th. Both
 the maximum and minimum temperatures have been comparatively high and
 low for several days during the month, and were thus influenced chiefly by
 the position of the prevailing winds. The 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd were
 warm days and nights, but were preceded and followed by a cold air.
    The mean temperature of the external air this month is one-seventh
 of a degree higher than the mean of October for many years.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
 observations, are four parhelia, two solar and two lunar halos, fourteen
 meteors, three auroras boreales, and three gales of wind, namely, two from
 the West, and one from the North-west.
