  IN zinet
     two former communications to the Philosophical Maga
           respecting the magnetic characters of metals ge
 nerally and the temperatures at which they respectively
                                                               lost
 or gained the powers of magnetic induction, I said that iron
 and nickel were the only metals which had this power, and
 that I could not find it in pure cobalt. In this was in error;                           I
 cobalt has this property in common with iron and nickel, as
 others have said.                     I
                        have sought for the piece of cobalt on
which         I
          experimented and believed to be pure, but cannot
find     it,
         and am now unable       ascertain the cause    my error,
                                                         to                                   of
though not too late      correct        to                    it.
   By favour       Dr. Percy and Mr. Askin
                                of                  have recently                    I
experimented with two fine pieces       pure cobalt prepared             of                                       by
the latter, both being well-fused and perfectly clean masses.
This metal becomes strongly magnetic         induction, either                 by                                 of

more than      own weight. Like soft iron and nickel,.      does                                     it
not retain     magnetism when the inducing influence          re                                         is

         at

a certain degree of heat, and then suddenly ceases; and it
comes on as suddenly in descending from still higher tempe
ratureS.
    The oxide of cobalt procured by burning the metal cobalt
on charcoal by a jet of oxygen was obtained as a fused glo
bule and was not magnetic.
    The oxide of nickel being heated and cooled is not mag
netic, but whilst heating care must be taken that it is not re
duced.       If  heated in the flame of a spirit-lamp, especially at
the lower      part,   it will often appear to be not magnetic, and
 then as the temperature falls will become magnetic; but this
is caused by the reduction of a little of the oxide at the edges
or elsewhere in the mass to the metallic state, and its exhibi
 tion of the properties of the metal at temperatures above and
 below the magnetic point.

 Thomson and considered pure was put into my hands. It

 probably only in consequence of the little iron present. Before
 a jet of oxygen or charcoal, it burnt with sparkles somewhat
 in the manner of iron, and produced an oxide which could be
 obtained either as a porous white mass or as a dense compact
 brown mass, translucent in small slices; but in neither state
 was the oxide magnetic.
    I   then cooled * manganese, chromium and many other
 metals and bodies to the lowest temperature which I could
 obtain by a mixture of aether and solid carbonic acid placed
 in vacuof, the temperature being then not higher than 156°F.
 below 0°, but not one of them assumed the magnetic state.

4.
      Dr. Stenhouse on          the Products        of the Distillation
salicylite and benzoate of copper, Dr. Ettling had obtained
among other products two neutral crystalline bodies—that
from benzoate of copper having a smell very much resembling
the odour of the geranium.     Being quite unaware that Dr.
Ettling had, subsequently to the publication of that notice,
analysed the compound from the benzoate of copper, I was
induced a few months ago also to prepare a quantity of that
substance and to subject it to examination.    Having men
tioned this circumstance to Dr.  Ettling, he very kindly fur
nished me with the subjoined account of his experiments, and
at the same time requested me to prosecute the examination
of the subject.
     “A   quantityof benzoate of copper consisting of a mass of
 small, slightly soluble needles of a greenish-blue colour, ob
 tained by mixing hot solutions of benzoate of potash and sul
 phate of copper, was heated in a retort placed in an air-bath
 to about the temperature of 220" R. The retort was furnished
with a tubulated receiver and a pneumatic apparatus to collect
any gases which might be evolved. The salt became first
brown and then of a reddish copper colour, giving off at the
same time an oily matter, a portion of which crystallized in
the neck of the retort, while a light             oil
                                            passed into the receiver,
where     oncooling    also became filled with crystals.
                          it                                         gas              A
passed into the pneumatic apparatus, which,                           as
                                                               rendered      it
lime-water turbid and was absorbed                      by
                                               potash, was evidently
carbonic acid.        second
                      A        portion       gas   of
                                                    was also evolved,
which burned with       blue flame and was not absorbed
                          a                                         pot               by
ash.       was not more closely examined. The mass
          It                                                      salt               of        in
the retort diminished        about half its bulk, and when still
                                to
more highly heated gave out          oily liquid, which
                                         an                      cooling         on
crystallized   in needles.          If
                                the distillation was carried still
further, the retort was found            to
                                    contain      little  a   brownishof     a
coloured salt    of copper   mixed with         quantitya       metallic         of
copper.
   “The solid portion yielded            by
                                     the distillation had greenish               a
colour, was hard, brittle, melted readily, and
                                                                   of it,
                                                             well    the    as            as
more fluid portion, had very much the smell                naphthaline,
though also faintly reminding one                 of

                                                       them dissolved,
forming    ayellow solution, while another swam             the surfaceon

                     as

was repeatedly treated with alkaline leys,                    by

6        Dr. Stenhouse on    the Products   of the Distillation
improper to employ a solution of a caustic alkali to remove
the benzoic acid, as such a proceeding would certainly destroy
a large proportion of the neutral compound.             The crystals
were next collected on a filter and washed with cold water till
every trace of alkali was removed. They were then dissolved
either in hot alcohol or in aether, in both of which liquids they
are exceedingly soluble, and were purified by repeated cry
stallizations.    They crystallize out of aether in large four-sided
oblique rhombic prisms.         The crystals are hard and brittle,
and    grate between the teeth like sugar.        They have a faint
aromatic smell, somewhat resembling that of the geranium,
but when heated approaching that of lemons. When slowly
deposited from an aethereal solution, the crystals may be rea
dily obtained an inch in length. Their melting-point is 70° C.
After they had been kept melted for some time, to drive off
any adhering aether, they were dried in vacuo over sulphuric
acid and subjected to analysis.

    It is evident from these analyses that this compound con
 tains only one atom of oxygen less than benzoic acid, the for
 mula of which is Cla H, O, and consequently it is isomeric
 with benzile. It differs very essentially from benzile, however,
 for when it is heated with solid potash it is immediately con
 verted with evolution of hydrogen into benzoate of potash;
 while benzile, when similarly treated, yields, as is well known,
 benzilate of that alkali. When treated with an alcoholic so
 lution of potash, it quickly forms benzoate of potash without
 any change of colour, while at the same time a little benzoic
 aether is also produced.      When it is boiled with an aqueous
 solution of potash or soda, it is also converted into benzoic
 acid, though more slowly; and a portion of the compound is
 apt to distil over undecomposed.        A quantity of the acid ob
 tained   by  decomposing     the neutral compound with an alkali
 in the way just described was purified by repeated crystalliza
 tions and subjected to analysis.

   When this crystalline compound is heated in an alcoholic
solution of potash, benzoate of potash, chloride of potassium
with a little benzoic aether are immediately formed, the colour
of the solution becoming at the same time of an inky blackness.
 When this alkaline solution is treated with an excess of mu
riatic acid, the benzoic acid precipitates on the cooling of the
liquid. The benzoic acid is mixed with a good deal of a dark
coloured tenacious semifluid resin, which has a strong empy
reumatic smell, exactly similar to that of creosote; so that
chloride of potassium and benzoic acid are not the only pro

When the liquid compound was treated with an alcoholic so
lution of potash, it was also resolved into benzoate of potash,
chloride of potassium, and a similar resinous matter, the quan
tity of which appeared to be even greater than that yielded
by the solid compound.
   Neutral benzoate of lead, formed by adding a solution of
benzoate of soda to acetate of lead, was also subjected to de
structive distillation. A small quantity of benzoic acid came
over mixed with a little of an aromatic oil, the smell of which
was quite different from that yielded by benzoate of copper.
I was unable, however, to detect the presence of any neutral
crystalline body.

III.   On the Aberration of Light.   By G. G. Stokes,                                    M.A.,

THEis sogeneral explanation of the phaenomenon of aberration
          simple, and the coincidence of the value of the ve
locity of light thence deduced with that derived from obser
vations of eclipses of Jupiter's satellites so remarkable, as to
leave no doubt on the mind as to the truth of that explana
tion.    But when we examine the cause of the phaenomenon
more closely, it is far from being so simple as it appears at
first sight.  On the theory of emissions, indeed, there is little
difficulty; and it would seem that the more particular expla
nation of the cause of aberration usually given, which depends
on the consideration of the motion of a telescope as light passes
from    to its
           object-glass       cross wires, has reference espe
                              to     its

the luminiferous aether passes freely through the sides          the                     of
telescope and through the earth itself. The undulatory theory
of  light, however, explains               so
                                   simply and        beautifully the   so

 stance pm being by hypothesis small (two or three radii of the
 planet suppose), it follows that the angle peq is extremely small,
 and may be neglected.       Hence a planet will appear to be dis
 placed from the position which it had when the light left                                                             it,

 this, the planet has moved from        while the light has been   P
travelling                   E.
                     These two considerations combined lead
                        to                                                                                             to

Copper duplicates of steel or copper engravings, it is well
known, are not nearly so durable as the original plates, yet
in   some cases they may be advantageously employed,—not
however where very large numbers are likely to be required,
as, for example, in the printing of bank notes.        was once                       I
consulted as to the practicability of coating the interior of the
air-pumps and the valve facings of large marine engines by the
electro-metallurgic process, and I include this as one of the
improper applications of the art.    In conclusion, I again re
peat, that the processes of electro-metallurgy are a valuable
acquisition to the arts, yet it is necessary to bear in mind                                              its
defects,  itorder that                  we
                            may not apply           purposes for      it      to

  Dr. Hofmann on        the true Composition    of Chlorindatmit.     21
tion of the preparation and analysis, until I found the object
could be attained by a much more convenient way.
    For this purpose       I  must here mention some results ob
tained by Erdmann in his excellent investigation on indigo.
                j
    If indigo suspended in water be treated with chlorine, it is
transformed, as is known, into a reddish yellow mass, which
is a mixture of different substances. On submitting this to
distillation with water, chlorisatine and dichlorisatine remain
in the retort, whilst another body volatilizes with the watery
vapour, which according to Erdmann contained no nitrogen.
He called this substance chlorindoptene”, and gave for it the
following formula:
                             Caº Hs Cls O.
   By later experiments Erdmann found however that on                 di
stilling chlorindoptene with potash or carbonate of potash it is
decomposed into a neutral body which passes over, and an acid
which ramains in the retort united to the potash.              The latter
is chlorindoptenic acid (chlorophenisic acid of Laurent); the
former Erdmann called chlorindatmit, and gave it the for
mula C13 Ha Cls O2.
   Whence comes this body? In what relation does it stand to
the other members of the indigo or phenyle series?                 Among
the many derivatives of indigo made known to us by the inves
tigations of Erdmann and Laurent it stands quite isolated.
    On comparing the properties which Erdmann described as
belonging to                      with those I had observed in        tri
chloraniline, it appeared to me in the highest degree proba
ble that these bodies were identical.         The properties of both
 bodies correspond exactly, and the method of formation is
 extremely alike.       The production of trichloraniline, as well
 as that of  chlorindatmit,     is accompanied by the formation of
 chlorindoptenic acid.        Erdmann had determined the carbon,
 hydrogen and chlorine in chlorindatmit.             His numbers cor
 respond completely with the composition of trichloraniline.
 For comparison     I   placed together the theoretical numbers of
this body and the analytical results of Erdmann.

22    Dr. Hofmann              on the true Composition                       of Chlorindatmit.
   Erdmann did not look for nitrogen in chlorindatmit as he
had found none in chlorindoptene. Did chlorindoptene consist
of equal equivalents of chlorindoptenic acid and chlorindatmit,
such a compound (assuming chlorindatmit to be an azotized
body) would contain 3-61 per cent. nitrogen, a quantity which
could not have been overlooked.               It                      is,
                                                       however, not com

                                         of
tenic acid    predominates      very    much,         that the amount so                                of
nitrogen       much
               is      reduced,   and may          easily overlooked. On
                                                                 be
the other hand, the proportion                          of
                                           carbon and hydrogen cannot
essentially alter,         chlorindoptemic acid and chlorindatmit
                               as
contain nearly equal quantities.
    To determine this question               experiment, by    treated with       I
chlorine, according           Erdmann's method,
                                    to                        quarter                              of

                                               or
converted into the brownish-yellow body.                  The whole mass,
together with the fluid, was poured into                retort and distilled

stance condensed and swam on the surface                   the water, which  of
had also passed over and contained hydrochloric acid. The
distilled product was saturated with potash ley, which com

our knowledge can be satisfactorily explained.             In some                           in

bodies by exposure to sunshine; in others, that radiation has
the power of disturbing the known chemical forces, and appa

  mena. It has indeed been suggested they may be distinct
 principles, and a considerable amount of experimental evidence
  has been brought forward in support of this position. With
  out entering into the argument in this place, I desire simply
  to impress strongly the necessity of considering the three effects
  of luminous agency and colour, of calorific action, and of
  what has been called photographic influence, as phaenomena
 depending upon three things (whether these be independent
 principles, or only modifications of one great immaterial ele
 ment, not being here considered), to which it is necessary to
 give distinctive appellations. Light and heat are terms about
 which, in their familiar acceptation, there can be no mistake;
 but it is to be regretted that some confused terms have had
 the sanction of some eminent experimentalists, leading, as it
 appears to me, to a sad complexity of ideas.              An “invisible
 chemical coloration” is the hypothesis of one philosopher and
 “invisible light” the epithet of another, introduced in me
 moirs of great interest, in which the changes produced by the
 dark chemical rays, as they have been called, are sought to
                     j
 be explained. In support of this view it has been suggested
 that rays of light may exist which do not produce any excite
 ment of the optic nerves of man, and it has been assumed that
 these rays may still be sufficiently powerful to produce vision
 in the night-roving animals; howbeit, of this there is not the
 slightest proof,             all

potash, as AdiActinic, whilst media admitting the free per

Any instrument used for measuring the amount of chemical
disturbance effected by the solar rays, would be called, as was
proposed by Sir John Herschel, an Actinograph.            With
these preliminary observations I do not think any difficulty
will arise from the terms made use of in this paper.
      INFLUENCE          of THE Solar Rays on PRECIPITATION.
     In1832 Sir John Herschel communicated the remark
able fact, that when a solution of platinum in nitro-muriatic
acid, which has been neutralized by the addition of lime, and
has been well-cleared by filtration, is mixed with lime-water
in the dark, no precipitation, or scarcely any, takes place, but
when (being thoroughly cleared of any sediment) this mixture
is exposed to sunshine it instantly becomes milky, and a white
or yellowish-white precipitate speedily falls.
   By exposing this mixture behind coloured media, Sir John
Herschel found that the effect was due to the influence of the
most refrangible rays.    I have placed this mixture in small
glass tubes, and so arranged them that they were individually
exposed to a separate ray of the spectrum. After an exposure
of one hour the following results were obtained, the precipi
tates having been carefully washed and dried in the tubes in
which they were formed.

solutions remained as clear as at first. One of the vessels with
its contents was then removed into the sunshine, when the
solution immediately became cloudy, and was very speedily
decomposed, the precipitate falling heavily.           By experiments
with the spectrum,     I  have since found that the precipitation is
due almost entirely to the more refrangible rays.            I have not
been enabled to decide with that         degree   of accuracy    I  could
desire, in which ray the maximum effect is produced.                 The
precipitates formed in the blue, indigo and violet rays were
nearly of the same weight, but it did appear that the precipi
tation was most speedily produced by the mean blue ray.
   If  we dissolve the brown precipitate from the mineral cha
meleon in a solution of cyanide of potassium, we have a clear
fluid.    Place one portion in darkness, and expose another
to  good  sunshine, the solution preserved in the dark will re
main   quite  clear for many days, whereas that exposed to ac
tinic influence throws down a brown precipitate after a few
hours' exposure.       If  the solution is washed over paper, we
procure by exposure good negative images of leaves or any
other body superposed.
   A few grains of sulphate of the protoxide of iron were
dissolved in rain water.       If kept in perfect darkness, the solu
tion remains clear for a     long  time; it becomes, however, even
tually cloudy and coloured from the formation of some per
oxide of iron, even in tubes hermetically sealed.            A few mi
nutes'  exposure  to sunshine is sufficient to    produce  this change,
and the oxide    formed,    instead of   floating  in the fluid,   and as
in the former case rendering it opake, falls speedily to the
bottom.

sensitive “photographic” process, the agents employed being
iodide of silver and the ferro-cyanide of potassium. I              since
then made some       experiments     with the    hope  of ascertaining
the rationale of the chemical changes which take place. This
has not been done in anything like a satisfactory manner;
they have, however, led me to observe a curious effect pro
duced in mixed solutions of iodide of potassium and ferro
cyanide of potassium under the influence of sunshine. .                 If
a mixture of these salts is kept in the dark, no change takes
place for a long period, but if exposed to sunshine, the colour
of the solution is much deepened, becoming of a bright golden
yellow, and a light brown powder is precipitated.            I have re
served the examination of this powder for some future period:
I believe it to be a combination of iron and iodine, and          I have
good reason for believing that a very remarkable change takes

     I
     have made one or two other experiments (particularly one
with a mixture of the bichromate of potash and the sulphate
of copper) in which precipitation appears retarded by solar
agency.           I
              am rather inclined to think that it will eventually
be  proved   that the electric energy of the different bodies in
relation to each other will greatly modify the results we shall
obtain in these experiments, and I intend, if possible, to                                                in
vestigate this part of the subject with care.        Since Becquerel
has shown (Annales de         Chimie,   November 1843) that the
electrical excitation produced by the solar rays is different for
each ray, and that this power is at         maximum               its

                   the violet  ray,  the minimum force being be
tween the  green    and blue  rays;   and since the mean maximum
of  chemical energy has been shown             manifest itself      the to                        in

 when both solutions are brought into the same actinic condi
 tion they do not precipitate more freely than those do which
 have been kept in the dark.       It appears to be necessary that
 the actinic states should be dissimilar to ensure the production
 of these curious phaenomena, which evidently point to some
 law of chemical action which has not yet been made the sub
ject of study.
    Bichromate of potash, it is well known, is decomposed
 by the agency of the solar rays when in contact with organic
 matter.     A solution of this salt spread upon paper forms a
 photographic agent of some interest. The paper, which is of
a fine yellow colour when first prepared, becomes brown upon
exposure to the sunshine, from the chromic acid of the salt
being acted upon by the organic matter of the paper.         A  si
milar change takes place, to a certain extent, in solutions of
this salt in distilled water, when exposed in clear glass ves
 sels, for some time, to bright sunshine.       The evidence we
have of this is the   gradual  formation of minute bubbles of air,
which are     redissolved, and the progressive increase of free
chromic acid in the solution, which may be detected by any
of the usual methods.
    A combination of the bichromate of potash and of sul
phate of copper, either on paper or in solution, exhibits the
above change very clearly, in the gradual formation of a
chromate of copper of a peculiar character, which, although
brown at first, becomes nearly white by prolonged exposure
to solar influence; indeed, upon paper the whiteness is quite
complete. Some very remarkable changes have been detected
in combinations of these salts, which will be made the sub
ject of a future communication.
      Actinic   INFLUENCE on ELECTRo-chemicAL         Action.
    Some years since, when endeavouring to discover the che
 mical action exerted by the sun's rays on the iodide of silver,
 I was induced to form some small galvanic arrangements, a
description of which and the results of my experiments,          I
published in the Philosophical Magazine for October 1840.
 As these experiments bear strongly on my present researches,
I  venture to extract a passage or two from that paper.
    “In   a watch-glass, or any capsule, place a little solution
of   silver; in another, some solution of any hydriodic salt;
connect the two with a filament of cotton, and make up an
electric circuit with a piece of platina wire; expose this little
arrangement to the light, and in a very short time it will be
seen that iodine is liberated in one vessel, and the yellow

iodide of silver formed in the other, which blackens as quickly
as it is formed.
    “Place a similar arrangement to the above (31.) in the
dark, iodine is slowly liberated.      No iodide of silver formed,
but around the wire a beautiful crystallization of metallic silver.
     “A   piece of platina wire was sealed into two glass tubes;
 these when filled, the one with hydriodate of potash in solu
tion, and the other with a solution of the nitrate of silver, were
reversed into two watch-glasses containing the same solutions,
the glasses being connected by a piece of cotton. A few hours
of daylight occasioned the hydriodic solution in the tube to
become quite brown with liberated iodine; a small portion of
iodide of silver was formed along the cotton, and at the end
dipping in the salt of silver.      During the night the hydriodic
liquid became again colourless and transparent, and the dark
salt along the cottom became yellow as at first.”
     I  have resumed this inquiry under modified conditions,
but the results have been invariably of a similar character to
the above. I shall for the present merely describe two sets
 of experiments, from which I draw these conclusions:—
    1st. That electro-metallic precipitation is prevented by the
influence of the sun's rays.
    2nd. That light is not the retarding agent, but that the
 exercise of electrical force is negatived by the direct influence
of actinism.
     I placed in a test-tube a strong solution of nitrate of silver;
in another tube, being closed at one end with a thin piece of
bladder,   I  placed a solution of iodide of potassium; this was
 supported in the solution of nitrate of silver by being fixed in
a cork, and a piece of platina wire was carried from one solu
 tion into the other. An arrangement of this kind was kept in
 the dark; iodine was liberated in the inner tube, and a cry
 stalline arrangement of metallic silver was formed around the
 platina wire in the outer one.       Another was placed in the
 sunshine; iodine was liberated in the dark, but no silver was
deposited.
    Having exposed the above solution to the sunshine of July
 during a long day, the tube was placed in a dark cupboard,
 but the actinic influence which had been exerted on the solu
 tion of silver had produced a permanent change in        itscondi
 tion; after several days  no  trace of any  metallic deposit could
 be  detected, but the whole    of  the iodine again entered into
 combination, whereas this was not the case      in  the unexposed
glasses.
     In
      the inner tube placed the solution
                     I                        of
                                         silver, and the        in
outer one the hydriodate     of

kept in the dark, the other was exposed to good sunshine. In
both instances the liberated iodine gave an intense yellow to
the solution, and in both cases the quantity of metallic silver
deposited was precisely the same.
   This yellow fluid being analysed by the prism was found to

ever, than that which existed when there was no interruption
in the circuit.      In this case, even at the distance of several
centimetres, there was a series of sparks which appeared
without interruption.        I wished however to assure myself of
 it by one of the very ingenious means discovered by Mr.
 Wheatstone.       This was a revolving disc, upon which I traced
black stripes. The space of time which elapsed in passing
from one stripe to the other was 0.00009 of a second: the disc
appeared immoveable.           It is proved therefore that the light
 was not    continuous,    and that it was a series of sparks or of
successive discharges which traversed the circuit, giving to
this circuit itself the properties of a conductor traversed by a
 voltaic current.      The enormous quantity of electricity which
is produced by this machine in                all

                                      passing the discharge into one
only  of  the conductors, keeping the other either insulated

communication with the ground: one while the discharge
passed through the moveable conductor,                   another      at
                                                                       the           by
fixed conductor. When the two conductors are                 the distance   at

movement was observed            in
                                 the moveable     conductor,   even when
examined with the telescope                  of
                                         the cathetometer.        At                     a   di
stance less than fifteen millimetres between the two conductors,
the moveable wire was           in    all

a much more evident manner when the fixed conductor or the
moveable conductor is in communication with the conductor
of the electrical machine.           Lastly, if the fixed conductor be
electrified with sparks, the moveable conductor is successively
attracted and repelled.           These phaenomena are very easily
explained by the ordinary attractions and repulsions of elec
trified bodies, in presence of bodies in the natural state.              I
only wished to try these experiments with my apparatus, in
order to see what part it might have in the phaenomena which
I  am about to describe.         The two conductors are arranged in
such a manner as that the discharge should penetrate them in
opposite directions. The distance between the two conductors
was from ten to fifteen up to thirty millimetres.             I began by
observing the moveable conductor with a telescope; but this
was useless, for the movements of repulsion which take place
in the moveable conductor at the moment of the discharge
are so great that they may be observed with the unassisted
eye.      On passing the current along the two conductors in the
same     direction,   the moveable conductor was also seen, and in
a very distinct manner, to fall upon the fixed conductor at the
moment of the discharge. Thus we may admit, without any
kind of doubt, that the fundamental law of Ampère, of the at
traction of currents of the same direction, and of the repulsion
of currents of opposite direction, holds good in regard to the
discharge of the jar under the same circumstances.
     I shall lastly add, that I repeated my experiments on the
induction of the discharge of the jar (Annales de Chimie et de
Physique, 3rd series, t.           iv.

X.   On a Phaenomenon in which the distant objects were seen

ON and  very
                               17, 1845, at 2h 20m p.m., a curious
                         unusual phaenomenon was observed near
Radford, which is situated about a mile W. of Nottingham.
  A group of trees at the distance of two miles, and a hill
(behind the trees) at the distance of four miles at the most
remote portion from the place of observation, were seen in
verted in the air and of a gray colour; the inverted phaeno
menon did not touch the objects of which they were the image,
but appeared about 30' elevated above them. There was a
haze between the objects and the phaenomenon; also the sum
mits of the inverted landscape did not end in blue sky, but were
observed also to end in haze. The breadth of the hill was
20°, which was inverted of an equal size, and appeared some
what to resemble Pendle Hill in Lancashire.         The phaeno
menon was seen for five     minutes,  and when left still visible;
returning an hour afterwards it had vanished. No clouds
were visible at the time, and the wind was very brisk.
    The morning had been cloudless until 10" a.m., then few
cumuli clouds of small size floated over, increasing in abun
dance until 1" p.m., when they began to disappear below the
S.E. horizon; at 2" p.m. sky almost cloudless and the weather
warm, soon after perfectly cloudless; at 3" p.m. cirrostrati
formed themselves on N.W. horizon; these increased rapidly,
and in an hour covered the sky, which remained overcast for
the rest of the day. The barometer fell from 30-596 in. at
9 a.m. to 30°560              in.

               Mr. Moon
                          .          on Fresnel's
general front (certainly one of the most absurd and chimerical
ever proposed) is untrue, and that the whole structure founded
                        consequence falls to the ground. But
let not the scope of these observations be misunderstood: the
principle in question has been represented by some leading
writers on this subject as so completely part and parcel of the
undulatory theory”, that the student who is little conver
sant with these subjects might suppose, that by rejecting it
we reject the theory in toto; but such is by no means the
                                                                     Theory                 of Diffraction.                      47
Case.
   The principle is quite collateral to the theory. With the
investigations into the phaenomena of polarized light it has
absolutely no connection whatever.      Rejecting it as I do,                                                                        I
still admit and  profess my belief in the truth of the undula
tory theory of reflexion and refraction, of the explanations of
the interesting experiments of the two mirrors and the prism
of small refracting angle, and of that admirable portion of the
theory which relates to the phaenomena observed in the sha
 dows of narrow fibres and the colours of Newton's rings.
 But if there be any soundness in the principles I have laid
 down, the remaining portion of the theory of diffraction, the
 whole theory of apertures, and of the shadows of extended
 bodies must be entirely rejected.
    Having thus explained my position, I shall proceed to make
 some further observations on the subject of diffraction, partly
 with a view to a more complete exposure of the extraordinary
    • One can hardly resist a smile at the extravagant admiration which
some of these gentlemen have displayed towards this monstrous hypothesis.

   fallacies which have been worked up into the received theory,
   but chiefly with the intention of giving a clear view of the en
   tire subject; and whilst I disclaim the idea of endeavouring to
   build up a settled theory of my own in the place of that which
 I    assume myself to have destroyed,                          I
                                                          propose to suggest
   various considerations which from time to time have occurred
   to me, and which I have some hope may lead, in the hands
  of those who have more time and opportunity for such re
  searches than are likely to fall to my lot, to the ultimate and
  complete elucidation of the subject.
      Recurring to my former example, suppose a series of con
  centric, spherical, diverging waves to be diffracted by an opake
  body indefinitely extended in                     all
                                                directions but one.            we         If
  suppose that       no  reflexion takes place near the edge             the dif     of
  fracting body, and that                no
                                      vibration       communicated through

                       beyond,    or,  admitting     the possibility                  of

         the aether                                                        either
      both of     these circumstances       occurring,        we suppose
                                                                     if                    it     to

      ascertained,        byexperiment         otherwise, that the phaeno
                                                    or
 mena are    in   no    degree attributable thereto,               evident that

 each wave      of   the series must     prolong    itself continuously   within
 the shadow.           On      former occasion (see vol. xxiv.
                               a                                                      p.   81     of
 this Journal)   I     endeavoured          point out how, upon
                                               to                          parti      a

 would naturally occur upon simple mechanical principles.
 But conceive the same would be true, whatever the nature
      I
of    the incident wave might be.              For experiment assures us,
 that    light  actually   penetrates     within the geometrical shadow
of    the   diffracting    body,   and   upon     the assumptions we have
 above made, this can only occur through                      innate power
                                                                     an                         in
diffracted waves          of diffusing themselves laterally; and this
being the case,      it   seems impossible that such diffusion should
operate itself otherwise than continuously.                           If
                                                                we were       lay         to

traversing transparent media with the same velocity, yet they

theory, so far as it went (which in the way of explanation was
not a great way), I was led to the above conclusions while in
search of a more intelligible mode of accounting for the phae
nomena than Fresnel's appeared to be, and which I naturally
 sought in the only direction in which, assuming the trust
 worthiness of his experiments, it could be found, namely by
 consideration of the effect of the diffraction of the waves them
selves abstracted from any specific action of the diffracting
 body.     But I must confess that since that time my faith in
 Fresnel's merits as an experimentalist, as well as a theorist,
 have been greatly shaken, and that                                I
                                                do not feel the degree
 of confidence which I once entertained as to the truth of the
 position which he assumes himself to have established by ex
periment, “that diffraction is independent of the nature of the
                                                                                                               be

diffracting body and of the form of             edge.”     But      this                           if

 ing the theory of DeCandolle, in which the deterioration experienced
 by most crops on their repetition was attributed to the deleterious
 influence of their root-excretions.    For this purpose he set apart,
 ten  years ago, a number of  plots  of ground     in the Botanic Garden
 at Oxford, uniform as to quality and richness, one-half of which
 was planted each year, up to the present time, with the same species
of crop, and the other half with the same kinds, succeeding each
6ther in such a manner that no one plot should receive the same
crop twice during the time of the continuance of the experiments,
or at least not within a short period of one another. The difference
in the produce obtained in the two crops, under these circumstances,
would, the author conceived, represent the degree of influence
ascribable to the root-excretions.
    The results obtained during the first few years from these experi
ments, as well as from the researches which had, in the mean time,
been communicated to the world by M. Braconnot and others on
the same subject, led him in a great measure to abandon this theory,
and to seek for some other mode of explaining the falling off of crops
on repetition.    In order to clear up the matter, he determined to
ascertain, for a series of years, not only the amount of crop which
would be obtained from each of the plants tried under these two
systems, but also the quantity of inorganic matters extracted in each
case from the soil, and the chemical constitution of the latter, which
had furnished these ingredients.     The chemical examination of the
crops, however, on account of the labour it involved, was confined
to six out of the number of the plants cultivated ; and of these, three
samples were analysed, the first being the permanent one, viz. that
cultivated for nine or ten successive years in the same plot of
ground; the second, the shifting one, obtained from a plot which
had borne different crops in the preceding years; the third, the
standard, derived from a sample of average quality, grown under
natural circumstances, either in the Botanic Garden itself, or in the
neighbourhood of Oxford.       These analyses were performed by Mr.
Way, formerly assistant to Professor Graham, of University Col
lege, London, and now attached to the Agricultural College near
Cirencester.
    The examination of the soils was carried on in two ways; the
first, with the view of estimating the entire amount of their avail
able ingredients; and the second, with that of ascertaining the quan
tity in a state to be taken up at once by plants, the available ingre
dients being those which are soluble in muriatic acid; the active
ones, those which are taken up by water impregnated with carbonic
acid gas. This portion of the investigation was conducted in part
                                          º
by the author, and in part by Mr. Way, and has reference to three
subjects; first, to the amount of produce obtained from the deficient
crops; secondly, to their chemical constitution; and thirdly, to the
nature of the soil in which the crops were severally grown.
    The plants experimented upon were spurge, potatoes, barley, tur
nips, hemp, flax, beans, tobacco, poppies, buckwheat, clover, oats,

show the influence of root-excretions was Euphorbia Lathyris, which
 would not grow in the same ground three years successively, al
 though the soil was found afterwards fitted for rearing several other
 species of plants.   In the remaining cases, there was in general a
 marked difference between the permanent and the shifting crop, to
 the disadvantage of the former; and where exceptions occurred to
 this rule, they seemed capable of being accounted for by accidental
 causes. The amount of each year's crop is given in a tabular form;
 and their differences illustrated by diagrams showing the relation
between the two crops of each vegetable.
     The second part of the memoir commences with an account of the
 method of analysis pursued by the author for determining the nature
 and proportions of the ingredients present in the ashes of the crops
 submitted to examination.     This method was, in general, similar to
 that recommended by Will and Fresenius in their paper published
 in the Memoirs of the Chemical Society “; but in determining the
 amount of phosphoric acid, the following mode was adopted in pre
 ference to the one therein given.
     As the phosphoric acid would seize upon the iron in preference
 to any other base, the amount of peroxide of iron present in the ash
 was first determined by precipitating it from a muriatic solution by
 means of acetate of ammonia.       The weight of the precipitate gives
 that of phosphate of iron, from which that of the peroxide of iron
 may be readily calculated.     This being ascertained, he proceeds to
 determine the phosphoric acid by operating on a fresh portion of
the solution of the ash, into which a certain known weight of iron
dissolved in muriatic acid is introduced, in quantity more than suffi
 cient to unite with the whole of the phosphoric acid present. This
done, acetate of ammonia is added and the mixture boiled, when all
 the peroxide of iron, whether combined with phosphoric acid or not,
is thrown down.       From the weight of the precipitate, that of the
phosphoric acid present may be calculated, as both the amount of
peroxide of iron present in the ash, and that which was added sub
sequently, are known.
    A report is then given of the analysis of the ashes of barley, of
the tubers of potatoes, of the bulbs of turnips, of hemp, of flax, and
of beans, all cultivated in the Botanic Garden; and from the data
thus obtained, the quantity of inorganic matters abstracted from the
soil in ten years by the above crops is deduced: and a table is given
showing the relation between the permanent and shifting crops, with
respect to their produce, the amount of inorganic matters, that of
alkali, and that of phosphates, contained in them.
    In the third part of his paper, the author considers the chemical
composition of the soil in which the above-mentioned crops were
grown. He states, in the first place, the method he adopted for de
termining the amount of phosphoric acid present in the soil.
    An analysis is then given of the soil taken from a portion of the
garden contiguous to that in which the experiments were carried on,
and from one of the plots of the garden itself, and from these data
                  * See Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxv. p. 500.

a calculation is made, that the ground at present contains enough
phosphoric acid for nineteen crops of barley of the same amount as
the average of those of the permanent crops, and of the same quality
as that obtained in 1844. It was also found, that there was a supply
of potass sufficient for fifteen crops of barley; of soda, for forty-five;
and of magnesia, for thirty-four.           When, however, we examine how
much of these      ingredients    is taken up by water containing carbonic
acid, the proportion of each is found to be much smaller; and a
striking difference exists, in this respect, between the soil which had
been recently manured and that which had been drawn upon by a
succession of crops. In the first case, the quantity of alkaline sul
phate obtained in the pound was 3.4 grs.; in the latter it varied from
0-7 to 0-07; and of phosphate, the quantity in the former was about
0-3, whilst in the latter it varied from 0-18 to 0-05.
    From these facts the author concludes, first, that the falling off of
a  crop   after repetition depends, in some degree, on the less ready
supply of certain of the inorganic ingredients which it requires for
its  constitution; but that two crops equally well supplied                  the soil        by
with these ingredients may take                 up
                                             different quantities         them, ac         of

  April 20, 1844.—On the Transport of Erratic Blocks. By W.
Hopkins, M.A., F.R.S. &c.
  The principal object of this paper is to investigate the transport
ing power of currents of water in general, and to explain in parti
cular the nature of those which would arise from the instantaneous
or paroxysmal elevation of any considerable extent of the earth's sur
face lying beneath the surface of the sea.   The author has termed
them elevation currents. The immediate effect of an elevation like
that just supposed, would be the elevation to a nearly equal height,
of the surface of the superincumbent water, whence a great wave
would diverge in all directions.   Such a wave would be attended by
a current in the direction of the wave's propagation, and has thence
been called a wave of translation. When such a wave proceeds along
a uniform canal, Mr. Russell has established experimentally the fol
lowing facts:—
   1. Every particle in the same transverse section of the canal has
the same motion.
   2. The velocity with which the wave is propagated is equal to that
due to half the height of the crest of the wave above the bottom of
the canal.
   From these data the author has calculated the velocity of the cur
rents which would necessarily attend these waves of elevation.          It
depends principally on the height of the elevation and the depth of
the sea, while the time during which the current will flow, depends
principally on the extent of the elevated area and the depth of the
sea. Thus if the depth of the sea should be 300 feet, and the height
of the crest of the wave above the even surface of the sea (which may
be considered as approximately the same as the elevation of the sud
denly raised area) should be 50 feet, the wave would be propagated
with a velocity of upwards of 70 miles an hour, and the attendant
current would be upwards of 10 miles an hour. Also, if the elevated
area were circular, the width of the wave would exceed the radius
of the circle. The wave would have the essential character of a tidal
wave termed a bore, except that it diverges in        all
                                                     directions, instead
of proceeding along     confined channel.

        Astronomical Society to the Annual General Meeting.
  To her Majesty's Government we have to express our obligations
for printing in our Memoirs, at the public expense, the late Professor
Henderson's right ascensions of principal fixed stars, deduced from
observations made at the Cape of Good Hope in 1832 and 1833. It
has been a fixed rule with the Council not to print in the Memoirs
the official transactions of public observatories; and they are happy
to say that administrations of all parties, and also the Directors of
the East India Company, have always recognised the reasonableness
of this rule, the instant the grounds on which it was made were
brought before them.
   The Council have received from Mr. Baily's executors the manu
script details of the Cavendish experiment.
   In the month of March last, Dr. Lee requested that the Society
would accept the perpetual advowson of the Vicarage of Stone, near
Hartwell. The grant is now enrolled according to the statute. This
is the second gift of an advowson from Dr. Lee, to whom the Society
is under many other obligations, and who has shown an incessant
interest in   itswelfare, not only                by

   Thomas Henderson was born at Dundee on the 28th of December,
1798.     His father was a tradesman in respectable circumstances,
who died early in life, leaving to the care of his widow a family con
sisting of two sons and three daughters. The eldest son, John, was
bred to the legal profession; and, after practising for some time as
a writer in Dundee, went to Edinburgh, where he studied for the
bar, and was rapidly rising to distinction as an advocate, when he
died suddenly, at the age of thirty-eight, of aneurism of the heart.
Thomas, the other son, and the youngest of the family, was destined
also for the profession of the law, and had the advantage of receiving
the best education which could be obtained in a town which has long
been distinguished in Scotland for the excellence of    public schools.              its

already become familiar with from study and books.           The instru
ments, it is true, were not of first-rate excellence,—a clock and
transit of 30 inches focal length, with an altitude and azimuth       in
strument by Troughton, formed the equipment of the observatory;
—but to a young astronomer, who had no other access to astrono
mical apparatus, such an opportunity was invaluable; and there is
little doubt that this circumstance had considerable influence on his
future history.
    The opportunity of making observations, however, did not in any
degree withdraw him from the less inviting parts of the science.
From the outset of his career he perceived that, in order to be an
astronomer, something more is necessary than mere expertness in
the use of instruments.       He accordingly continued to direct his
main attention to the reduction of observations; and, at an early
period, acquired a great knowledge of methods, and great facility in
calculating eclipses, occultations, cometary orbits, and, generally, in
all the computations and reductions which are subservient to practi.
cal astronomy.
    Mr. Henderson first brought himself into notice as an astronomer
in 1824, by communicating in that year to Dr. Young, then Secre
tary to the Board of Longitude, a method of computing an observed
occultation of a fixed star by the moon, of which that accomplished
philosopher thought so highly, that he caused it to be published,
under the title of an improvement on his own method, in the Nauti
cal Almanac for 1827 and the four following years; accompanied in
 some of the last of those years by a second method also proposed by
 Mr. Henderson. These methods were also published in the London
 Quarterly Journal of Science; and he received for them the thanks
 of the Board of Longitude.      About the same time, or shortly after,
 he   began to contribute to the Quarterly Journal of Science various
 useful  papers and notices; among which may be mentioned, in par
 ticular, elements for computing the eclipses of the sun, and lunar
 occultations of the planets and satellites for the years 1826, 1827,
 and 1828; and lists of the principal lunar occultations for the years
 1826, 1827, 1828 and 1829. These lists, it is presumed, were the
 cause of several valuable observations of the phaenomena being made,
 which, but for them, would probably have been neglected.
     In 1827 he communicated a paper to the Royal Society of London,
 “On the Difference of Meridians of the Royal Observatories of
 London and Paris,” which is published in the Philosophical Trans
 actions for that year, and which furnishes a remarkable instance of
 the value of that habit of scrutinising calculation for which he was
 particularly distinguished. In the copy of the observations officially
 furnished from the Royal Observatory to Sir John Herschel, with a
 view to his operations in 1825 for determining the difference of lon
 gitude between Greenwich and Paris by means of fire signals, there
 was an error of a second in one of the numbers, which had the effect
 of causing some irregularity in the results of the different days' work;
 but as the discrepancies were small, they had been ascribed to errors
 of observation. Mr. Henderson, remarking the irregularity, was led

64                           Royal Astronomical Society,
to recalculate the original data, and thereby detected the error; and
not content with this, he submitted the entire process to a new cal
culation.   His result differed immaterially from that which had been
previously obtained; but the correction of the error, by rendering
the single results more consistent, gave a greatly increased confi
 dence to the general conclusion; and, as was said of it by Sir John
 Herschel himself, “had the effect of raising a result liable to much
 doubt, from the discordance of the individual days’ observations, to
the rank of a standard scientific datum, and thus conferring on a na
 tional operation          all
                         the importance       ought       possess.”

Mr. Henderson entered into these views with his accustomed energy,
and not only embraced every opportunity                 putting the method  of                                       in
practice    by computing corresponding observations, but was               much                            at

efficient aid      by
                 contributing, for several years, monthly lists    the                                      of
principal lunar occultations computed for the meridian     Greenwich.                           of

 The promptitude        and accuracy with which these calculations were
  made induced the Council to request him to communicate his me
  thods to the Society; and he accordingly drew up a set of Practical
  Rules for the Approximate Prediction of Occultations, which are
  published in vol.                 iv.   of

Dr. Young. This very eminent person had received valuable assist
ance from Mr. Henderson in the computations required for the Nau
tical Almanac, and had formed the most favourable opinion of his
talents. About a fortnight before his death he placed a memorandum
in the hands of the late Professor Rigaud of Oxford, to be made use
of in case of his decease; and when the anticipated event took place,
the memorandum was found to contain a request that it might be
stated to the Board of Admiralty that he knew no person more com
petent to be his successor in the superintendence of the Almanac
than Mr. Henderson.         Professor Rigaud lost no time in making
known in the      proper quarter   the recommendation of his deceased
friend, which he also supported with the weight of his own influence;
but in consequence of other contemplated arrangements it was un
 successful, and the superintendence of the Nautical Almanac was,
upon that occasion, committed to Mr. Pond, then Astronomer Royal.
 Mr. Pond was also well aware of the efficiency and value of Mr.
Henderson's aid, and immediately preferred a request to him to con
tinue the same computations which he had been accustomed to sup
ply to Dr. Young; making offer at the same time of remuneration,
and sufficient employment to occupy a great portion of his time.
But although Mr. Henderson shortly after supplied Mr. Pond with
some calculations on which he had previously been engaged, this
offer appears to have been declined, and for two years longer he con
tinued to follow his professional occupation.           *
    His character as an astronomer, however, was now fully esta
blished; and accordingly, on the death of Mr. Fallows in 1831, he
was regarded as one of the persons best qualified to undertake the
direction and management of the observatory established by Govern
ment, and then recently completed, at the Cape of Good Hope.
Through the intervention of Captain Beaufort his qualifications were
a second time brought under the notice of the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, and on this occasion successfully : but the idea of
leaving his country was distasteful to him; and he accepted the
office with some reluctance, and only in deference to the advice of
his friends. The warrant of his appointment is dated in October
 1831, and a few months after he embarked for the colony.
    Mr. Henderson arrived at the Cape in April 1832, and forthwith
commenced his observations.       The principal instruments were a ten
foot transit   by  Dollond, and a six-foot mural circle by Jones; and
his  only assistant was Lieutenant Meadows, who had been sent out
in the  previous  year.   Few examples are upon record of more zea
lous and successful exertion than that which is furnished by him du
ring his residence of thirteen months at the Cape. The results of
his own personal exertions during that short interval comprehend
the determination of the latitude and longitude of his station; the
positions of stars near the South Pole for determining the polar po
sitions of his instruments; the amount of refraction near the horizon;
observations of the moon and stars for determining the moon's hori
zontal parallax: of Mars for determining the parallax of that planet,
and thence that of the sun; of eclipses of Jupiter's satellites; occul

                       Itoyal Alstronomical Society.                   67
tations of fixed stars by the moon; a transit of Mercury; places of
 Encke's and Biela's comets; and finally, between 5000 and 6000
observations of declination.      So large a mass of work would have
 been sufficiently creditable under the most advantageous circum
 stances; but when we call to mind that he had to contend with all the
 difficulties incidental to a new and imperfectly organized establish
 ment, where no assistance was to be obtained from artists, and with
 a notoriously unmanageable instrument, it will be easily admitted
that it would be difficult to overrate the zeal, perseverance and skill,
 with which he laboured to discharge the duties which had been        in
trusted to him.      But the merit of accumulating so large and valuable
a mass of observations, great as it must be allowed to be, is com
pletely thrown into the shade by comparison with that which is due
to the persevering industry with which he laboured in their reduction,
and in deducing from them the results we shall presently have oc
casion to mention.
    When Mr. Henderson accepted the appointment to the Cape
Observatory, it was no doubt anticipated (probably even by himself)
that his residence there would be of some considerable duration.
These anticipations were not realized, for in May 1833 he resigned
the office, and shortly after returned to Europe.      The reasons which
induced him to take this     step were fully stated by  him in his letter
of resignation addressed to the Secretary of the Admiralty. After
briefly alluding to the exertions necessary to carry their lordships'
instructions into effect, he went on to say, that not only did the state
of his health render him unable much longer to support the requisite
labour, but that the observatory, considered as a place of residence,
laboured under so many disadvantages, and required a mode of life
so different from that to which he had been accustomed, that he
found it impracticable to remain longer; and being thus unable to
perform the duties, he felt it to be incumbent on him instantly to
resign the situation. But with that regard for the interests of science,
and that kindness of disposition so eminently characteristic of him,
he added, that on his return home he would proceed, with the sanc
tion of their lordships, to the task of reducing the observations and
of extracting from them the results they were intended to afford;
expressed his sense of the efficient aid he had received from his as
sistant, Lieutenant Meadows; modestly proffered such assistance as
his experience might enable him to give to his successor; and con
cluded by recommending the state of the observatory to their lord
ships' consideration.
    Had his state of health permitted him to continue his observations

which he complained would in due time have been removed, or at
least have become supportable; but he had been made aware before
he left England, that his physicians already apprehended the germs
of that disease which eventually proved fatal to him, and under the
depressing influence of this knowledge, aggravated by separation
from all his friends, and his family to whom he was tenderly attached

efficiency.    Impressed with this idea he took the resolution to give
in his resignation, in order that it might have the contingent benefit
of another appointment; and thus an act which, hastily judged, might
appear to be an abandonment of his post, was the simple and natural
result of a high, it may be an exaggerated, sense of public duty.
The sacrifice involved in his resignation was of no small importance

was soon called upon for the discharge of more active duties.                      In
1834 an agreement was concluded between the government and the
members of the Astronomical Institution of Edinburgh, whereby the
latter gave up to the University the use of their observatory on the
Calton Hill, which the former undertook to convert into a public
establishment, by furnishing it with suitable instruments, and making
provision for an observer and assistant.             It was then resolved to                                fill

sions of the   same stars was only completed, and the results given to
the   Society,  in the course of the last year. They have, however,
 already been printed, and will appear in our forthcoming volume.
 Although the number of stars contained in this Catalogue is not
 large, it acquires importance and value both on account of the still
relatively defective state of our knowledge of the absolute positions
 of the southern stars, and from the circumstance that it is the first
 which has been deduced from observations made in the southern he
misphere with instruments equal to those of the best European ob
servatories. Indeed, if we except Mr. Johnson's excellent Catalogue
of Stars observed at St. Helena, it must be regarded as the first in
which the places of stars not visible in our latitudes have been de
termined with the precision and certainty now aimed at in astro
nomy.      It was principally with a view to the determination of the
positions of the principal southern stars, for the aid of navigation,
that the establishment of the Cape Observatory had been urged
upon and undertaken by the government, and this catalogue forms
one of the most important instalments astronomy has yet received
from it.
    Although the determination of the absolute places of the stars
formed the principal business of the observatory, Mr. Henderson
was too zealous an astronomer to omit taking advantage of the cir
cumstances in which he was placed to investigate various important
points which can only be determined by a comparison of observa
tions made at places remote from each other, or which acquire a
special interest from the position of the observer.   A point of this
latter kind is the amount of refraction in the southern hemisphere.
In an interesting paper on this subject, printed in vol. x. of the
Memoirs, he has given the results of a series of observations made
at the Cape, of stars having a greater zenith distance than 85°, both
north and south, and compared the refractions thence deduced with
the tables cf Bessel and Ivory. As tending to throw light on the
important subject of horizontal refractions, these results are valuable
with reference to general physics as well as to practical astronomy.
    Another important determination, also prompted by the locality,
was that of the moon's horizontal parallax.     It is well known that
the determination of this element was one of the principal objects of
Lacaille's voyage to the Cape; his purpose being to obtain observa
tions of the moon's declination corresponding to others made at dif
ferent European observatories, A similar investigation was proposed
for Mr. Henderson, or rather several stars had been marked in the
Berlin Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac as favourably situated for
having their declinations observed along with the moon's in both
hemispheres, by which means the moon's apparent declinations are
obtained free from the effects of errors in the assumed declinations
of the stars. But the number of corresponding observations of this
kind which could be made, being found to be too small to permit the
element to be determined from them with sufficient accuracy, Mr.
Henderson had recourse, whenever there was a deficiency of moon
culminating stars, to such of the principal stars as were observed,

and could be used for comparison. The investigation, like                    others                                    all

the observations of right ascension, from the direct observations of
declination, and from the reflected observations of declination, and
this in respect of each of the two stars; and though the resulting
parallax differed somewhat in the different cases, the general agree
ment was satisfactory, and the amount much too large to be ascri
bable to probable errors of observation.              But notwithstanding the
corroboration which the results of these different modes of deduction
afforded each other, if the question of the parallax of this binary star
had been allowed to rest in the state in which it was placed in Mr.

schel,  “It  is only on a very long series of observations of absolute
places, affected, as they are, by instrumental error and uncertainty
of refraction, that any conclusion of this kind can rest with secu
rity.” But whatever the ultimate decision of astronomers may be
with respect to the parallax in question, there will be but one opi
nion as to the merit of Mr. Henderson's investigations, and the      in
terest which attaches to the subject: and, in the meantime, it will
be remembered that this is the first determination of the parallax of
a star which has been confirmed by a different observer using a dif
ferent instrument; and that if future observations shall continue to
give similar results, which now seems a reasonable anticipation, to
Mr. Henderson will indisputably belong the enviable distinction of
having been the first who succeeded in an inquiry so often, but
fruitlessly, attempted by astronomers, namely, the discovery of a
fixed star whose distance from our system is capable of measurement
and expression. For these researches he was proposed to the Council
at the meeting in November last, as deserving the Society's gold
medal for the present year, but his untimely death prevented the
question from being entertained.
   Another attempt made by him to determine the annual parallax
was less successful. Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, might
be supposed to be one of the least remote; and some astronomers—
Cassini, Lacaille, and Piazzi—had assigned it a parallax of several
seconds. The Cape observations being well adapted for the inves
tigation of the question, Mr. Henderson undertook the examination
of those made by himself, and also a series by Mr. Maclear, in order
to ascertain if they indicated any sensible parallax; but in this case
the result amounted only to about a quarter of a second,—a quan
tity not exceeding, perhaps, the probable error of the determination.
   Mr. Henderson's labours on the subject of parallax did not termi
nate even here. In a letter to Mr. Main, which was read at the
December meeting of 1842, he gave the results of an investigation
of the parallaxes, as they appear from his Cape observations, of
twenty stars which had been observed sufficiently often to reduce
the errors of observation within reasonable limits. They comprehend
the greater number of the stars situated in the same region of the
heavens as a Centauri, which have been indicated by Sir John Her
schel as deserving of investigation for parallax, and which, on that
account, are at present objects of particular attention at the Cape
Observatory.      In a few instances considerable parallaxes appear; in
the greater number of cases the results are so small as to afford little
hope of a measurable parallax being found, and in some they are
negative.     The mean of the twenty parallaxes is +0"-29, a result
which, on the whole, may be considered as affording encouragement
to continue the research.
   It is matter of much regret that the reduction of the entire series
of Mr. Henderson's Cape observations—the rich store from which
the above interesting results have been extracted—has not been
completed by him; and that the observations must consequently be
deprived of the advantage of his final revision.    From the examina

fully written out, with the column headed “correction of instru
ment” filled up for the whole period; and that headed “correction
of clock” from the commencement to October 31, 1832. The circle
observations, which were all made by himself, are in a similar state
of forwardness; and it may be inferred from the appearance of the
 papers, that if he had lived a few months longer, and the work had
 proceeded at the ordinary rate, the whole would have been ready for
the press.
    A statement of the results deduced by Mr. Henderson from his
Cape observations could not be properly concluded without an ex
pression of admiration for that disinterested zeal which led him to
undertake and execute so great an amount of extra-official labour.
The observations, it will be remembered, were made at a public esta
blishment, and their reduction was matter of public concern and im
portance; and after his resignation of the appointment, the public had
no claim on his services more than on those of any other individual.
 But, as already remarked, considerations of this kind never, in any
degree, influenced his conduct; and, during ten long years, he gra
 tuitously devoted to this purpose all the time he could spare from
 his official duties.   In the same circumstances almost any other
 person would have claimed, and undoubtedly have obtained, both
 assistance and remuneration.
     In addition to the results now mentioned, he rendered still an
 other important service to the astronomy of the southern heavens, in
 superintending the reduction of the stars observed at the Cape by
 Lacaille.    This work, which he undertook at the instance of Mr.
 Baily for the British Association, was announced as completed in
 our Annual Report for 1843; but it has not yet been published.
     Mr. Henderson's labours in the Edinburgh Observatory are well
 known to astronomers from the five volumes of observations which
 have been published for 1834–1839.        A sixth volume is understood
  to be left nearly ready for publication; and the observations for the
  remaining years will, no doubt, still be rendered available to science.
  The published volumes are prefaced by an Introduction, containing
  a minute and most lucid description of the instruments and methods
  used in the observations and reductions, with every detail and ex
  planation which can contribute to give authenticity and value to the
  work. His first year's observations having been referred to this
  Society by the Home Secretary, a committee of the Council reported
  them to be of first-rate excellence, and recommended their publica
  tion as matter of scientific importance.     This report has been rati
  fied byall  astronomers; and,  so faras  they have yet been published,
  the Edinburgh observations not only    do       to

produced an effect on his sensitive temperament from which he never
completely recovered. In the summer of that year he was gratified
by an event which afforded him at the time the liveliest pleasure,
and ever after formed a bright spot in his memory.    This was the
visit to Edinburgh of Professor Bessel, whom he had always been
accustomed to regard as his master in science; and for whose cha
racter and writings he entertained an unbounded admiration.     In
company with the great astronomer, and his countryman and col
league, the celebrated mathematician Jacobi, he made a short excur
sion to the Highlands; and his friends well remember the delight
with which he used to recount the incidents of that journey, and re
late anecdotes of his illustrious companions.
   Although his constitution was never robust, and he was occasion
ally subject to low spirits, during the influence of which he would
express misgivings as to his hold on life, his health did not undergo
any visible change till the autumn of 1844, when he was suddenly
seized with an illness of so alarming a kind, that, happening at the
time to be on a visit to a friend, some days elapsed before he could
be removed to his own house.       From this attack he partially reco
vered, and hopes were entertained that he would soon be enabled to
resume his usual duties; but a relapse having occurred, he expired
suddenly on the 23rd of November, a few weeks before he would
have completed his forty-sixth year.     The disease was then ascer
tained to be hypertrophy of the heart; and there can be little doubt
that, in the state of health induced by this organic disorder, the
fatigue of the nightly observations, and of climbing the steep hill on
the summit of which the observatory is built, had been extremely
prejudicial to him, and contributed to accelerate        fatal termina                 its
tion.

   Before detailing the mode          which the following experi
                                                      in
ments were    conducted,     will briefly
                                      I   state the principal results
which     have obtained from the first series.
     1.   In I    no
              case where colourless gases are employed, have                                                    I
detected  any  additional lines.     Fourteen different substances
were employed, varying            density from that
                                                in          hydrogen,                           of
o-0691,      thatto   aether, 2.586, and hydriodic acid, 4.388.
                                of
Of these bodies three were simple, viz. oxygen, hydrogen and
nitrogen, and eleven were compounds, varying greatly              their                                   in
mode       of
          condensation,           binoxide as   nitrogen, where the
                                                in                       of
elements unite without condensation; protoxide               nitrogen,                               of
where three volumes       the gases  of
                                     become    two;  and  ammonia,                                                  in
which two volumes are condensed into one;               chemical pro                       in
perties they differed not less widely. Five         these gases were                  of
acid, the carbonic, hydrosulphuric, hydrochloric, hydriodic,
and sulphurous acid. One ammonia                alkaline, one cyano     is

                 produced   in   the   Prismatic Spectrum.             83
gen is usually considered an organic radicle, one a compound
of such a radicle as aether; the remaining one, chloride of
sulphur, possesses properties referable to none of these heads.
    2. The mere presence of colour is no indication of the ex
istence of lines.   Vapours which the eye cannot distinguish
from each other will be found in one case, as with bromine,
to give numerous lines, in another, as the chloride of- tungsten,
to give none at all.
    3. The probable position of the lines cannot be inferred
from the colour of the gas: with the green perchloride of
manganese the lines are most abundant in the green, whilst
with the red vapours of nitrous acid they increase in number
and density as we advance towards the blue end of the spec
trum.
    4. Simple bodies, as well as compounds, may produce lines;
and two simple bodies which singly do not produce them, may
in their compounds occasion them abundantly. Neither oxy
gen, nitrogen, nor chlorine, when uncombined, occasions
lines; but some of the oxides, both of nitrogen and of chlo
rine, exhibit the phaenomena in a most striking manner.
There are, however, oxides, both of nitrogen and of chlorine,
which do not occasion the appearance of lines.
    5. We find also that lines may exist in the vapour of simple
substances, as in iodine, which disappear in their compounds;
this is exemplified in the hydriodic acid, a combination of
equal volumes of gaseous iodine and hydrogen, united without
condensation.
    6. Sometimes the same lines are produced by different
degrees of oxidation of the same substances, a remarkable              in
stance of which is furnished in the oxides of chlorine.     Here
chemical considerations of interest    may   assist in explaining
the cause.
    7. The lines are increased in number and density by                in
creasing the depth of the coloured stratum through which the
light is transmitted, or by any cause which increases, the             in
tensity of the colour; proving that more lines exist, than our
instruments or eyes are capable of discerning when the vapour
 is dilute.  This is especially exemplified with iodine and bro
 mine.
    8. These lines occur both with polarized and non-polarized
 light. There is little doubt, although           I
                                              have not yet made
 the experiment, that the lines thus produced, as with the             or
 dinary solar lines, indicate an absence of chemical influence,
 as well as of the luminiferous portion of the ray.
   In   all   the experiments     on   transmitted    light, the -luminous

 source employed was, unless otherwise specified, the diffused
 light of day. The different spectra represented in Plate                                                 II.
 were obtained by receiving the rays upon a prism of                                                     Mu
 nich flint glass, mounted upon Fraunhofer's plan and ad
justed to an achromatic telescope, placed at 20 feet from a
 vertical slit in a brass plate, one-fortieth of an inch in width
 and about 4 inches long.           Half of this slit admitted diffused
 daylight in       ordinary state, the other half
                      its                                        the aperture     of

                                                                                                           of be
 position, and the lines               of

 traced across the vapour-spectrum, furnishing exact points

 be   composed       of  very fine lines, increasing         in   number and strength towards
the central       or   darkest portion       of
                                            the band.

                              produced        in the Prismatic                     Spectrum.                             87
 duced.              Chlorous acid, in very small quantity, is capable of
 tinging             avery large bulk of water of a bright yellow colour.
 As the gas had                    so marked an effect on the spectrum,                                            I    was
 induced to try this solution, but failed entirely in discovering
 lines; the liquid arrested the whole of the more refrangible
 rays entirely, no light passing beyond the midspace between
 E        and    F.
      I now prepared some pure peroride of chlorine (Cl. Os),
 freeing it from chlorine and chlorous acid, by which it is                                                             al
 ways accompanied, by passing the gas through tubes sur
 rounded with a mixture of ice and salt; the peroxide alone
 condenses at this temperature, and the deep red liquid thus
 obtained was allowed to fall into a tube and evaporate; the
 same series of lines were produced.              In this gas, which has a
 specific gravity of 2:325, 1 vol. of chlorine and 2 vols. of oxy
 gen are condensed into the space of 2 vols.
     Euchlorine was next tried; the gas was disengaged from a
 mixture of hydrochloric acid and chlorate of potash, conden
 sing the compound as before by a freezing mixture: to this
 compound Millon assigns the curious formula of Cls Ols; here
 too l found the same series of lines.             Millon's theory of the
 composition of these bodies                            is,

    a paper read at the last meeting of the British Associa
         the writer of these remarks had occasion to notice
the errors frequently committed by neglecting the algebraic
sign of zero in the extreme or limiting cases of certain infinite
series; and to show that this neglect had led Abel and other
distinguished analysts to conclusions incompatible with the
general laws of algebra.
   For example: Abel says, in reference to the series

  As it is thus important to inquire whether the sign of an
evanescent quantity be plus or minus, may it not be of equal
importance to ascertain, in certain investigations of analysis,
whether that sign be real or imaginary? That attention to
this is of consequence in the application of algebra to geometry
will appear by taking the extreme case of the ellipse, when by
the continual shortening of the minor diameter, the curve ulti
mately degenerates into a finite straight line—the major dia
                                                 ; vº
meter: the equation to this ultimate form of the ellipse is
                                         –=      9             **.

   Between the limits we —a and r= +a, the evanescent
quantity on the right is real, implying that every point on the
axis of a, which does not lie without these limits, is a real
point of the locus.     But if a exceed a, in either the positive
or the  negative direction, the evanescent quantity is imaginary;
and consequently, in accordance with the ordinary interpre
tation, the corresponding points on the axis of a are beyond
the bounds of the locus.
     If
      the curve had been an hyperbola instead of an ellipse,
the equation, in the extreme case, would have represented two
infinite straight lines in directum with the axis of abscissas,
but separated from each other by an interval equal to the fixed
principal diameter.
   But it is in the theory of conjugate points that the imagi
nary zero is in a more especial manner an item of importance;
and it is from the disregard that has hitherto been paid to                                            it,
that the discrepancies and contradictions,            found    the         to   be               in

And the late distinguished Mr. Gregory,                                   in   his valuable           Ex
amples, states that                “it      may happen that            #        and any number

but the differential coefficients are possible till we come to the
third.” Now these differential coefficients, thus affirmed to
be possible, give each a pair of equal values; so that the point
under consideration ought to be pronounced, not a conjugate
point, but a point of osculation*.

 Gregory, “has contact of the second order with the plane of
 the axes +.”
       I
      have employed the term imaginary in the foregoing ob
servations in accordance with the usual phraseology; but the
views of Mr. Warren and Dr. Peacock, in reference to the
geometrical interpretation of the roots of unity—and which
views Mr. Gregory and Mr. Walton have done so much to
illustrate and confirm—will necessarily lead to the abandon
ment of this expression in the application of analysis to curvest.
    From what has now been shown, it appears that it is not
“useless to attempt a test of a conjugate point by the differ
ential calculus:” since this point has the same situation as
another which unites with the continuous series of points form
ing an imaginary curve, or a curve out of the plane of the co
ordinates, and to any continuous series of values the calculus
 is,   of
        course, always applicable.     But      may connect the                          we

in a tubulated retort in which a thermometer is placed, a
quantity of vapour is evolved at 100° to 120° C. At 1453°
the fluid begins to boil, and there distils over a clear, oily and
beautifully iridescent fluid.           For some time the thermometer
remains stationary at the above temperature, then begins sud
denly to rise so fast, that it must quickly be removed from
the retort.      The portion left behind has now completely

                   Action of fuming Sulphuric Acid on Styrole.
    On mixing fuming Nordhausen sulphuric acid with styrole,
a violent reaction takes place with the evolution of heat; the
oil becomes tenacious, and assumes a dark colour.      The ad
dition of water produces the separation of a brown resinous
mass.    The fluid filtered from this substance gave, when
treated with an excess of carbonate of baryta, a soluble baryta
salt, which, however, could not be obtained in a crystalline
form.   The physical properties of these products, probably
analogous to Mitscherlich's sulphobenzide and hyposulpho
benzidic acid, are far from inviting to a nearer investigation.

of hydrochloric acid indicates that the decomposition is pro
ceeding further, by the formation of products of substitution
which contain fewer hydrogen equivalents than exist in sty
role; whereas chlorostyrole is a simple compound of chlorine
and styrole, or at least may be considered as such.
   We have frequently prepared and analysed the first pro
duct of the action of chlorine on styrole.       The analyses
proved however to us that only on one occasion were we for
tunate enough to have hit the proper moment when the action
of chlorine must be interrupted.    All the other combustions,
which we pass over, gave a constantly varying, but always too
small a proportion of carbon.

obtained     :-

                     Action      of Nitric Acid on Metastyrole.
   Nitrometastyrole.—Common nitric acid, either warm or cold,
attacks metastyrole but little. Even strong fuming nitric acid
acts but feebly in the cold, but on the application of heat dis
 solves it quickly with the evolution of red fumes. If a suffi
 cient quantity of nitric acid has not been employed, the new
 product is precipitated on cooling in the form of a slimy sub
 stance. On the other hand, if the acid has been in excess,
 the fluid remains quite clear, from which, on the addition of
 water, a white curdy mass, which sometimes has a shade of
 yellow, is precipitated. This is washed with water to remove
all  trace       nitric acid, and afterwards boiled
                of                                            alcohol     get   in            to

His suspicion of the presence of benzole we found to be also
correct.  The body described by Herzog under the name of
cinnamole was evidently benzole mixed with traces of other
materials. The boiling-point and specific gravity given by
him are in themselves sufficient evidence.                  By distilling a
considerable portion of cinnamic acid with lime we easily ob
tained proof of this identity in the following manner:-The
rectified product was submitted again to an interrupted distil
lation.     The          oil

                                                of   a     agent.     Aniline

the mixture must be several times distilled at a low tempera
ture, never reaching the boiling-point. What passes over is a
colourless fluid, and consists of dracyle, with a small quantity of
draconyle; the solid residue in the retort is entirely draconyle.
    To free the dracyle from the draconyle, “which passes over
dissolved in the vapour of the former,” it must, accoording to
Glenard and Boudault, be several times distilled over hydrate
of potash. The potash appears here to form no combination
with the draconyle, “but only to modify it in such a way that it
is no longer soluble in dracyle.” The draconyle remaining in
the retort is to be washed with alcohol to remove the dracyle
and then heated to 150°C., by which the last traces of dracyle
are driven off.

 The lime in the porous condition in which it is taken from
the dry-lime purifiers, absorbs oxygen so rapidly from the
air as to heat, and hence the state of oxidation in which the
sulphur is found.     If the lime be very damp, or diffused
through a quantity of water, as it comes from the wet-lime
purifiers, then the absorption of oxygen is much slower. The
fluid portion then contains in solution the bisulphuret of cal
cium of Herschel, which may be crystallized from        and
                                                                                 it;         at

                                 Levy. They occur distributed
over the surface    albite and associated with dark green am
                               of
phibole. The crystals are sometimes six-sided,      other times                     at
eight-sided, doubly oblique prisms.

   Before the blowpipe the crystals fuse per se into a black
enamel.
   With carbonate of soda they fuse into a green opake bead
in the reducing flame.
   With boraw in excess a clear pale yellow bead becoming
violet, and with microcosmic salt in excess a clear pale amber
bead are formed. These results are similar to those obtained
by Mr. Children, and his conclusions respecting the nature of
the constituents of the mineral, by testing, are corroborated
by analysis.

   The formula to express the composition of babingtonite,
as deduced from these calculations, is as follows:—
 MgO SiO, +4CaO SiO +4Fe0 (SiO)2 + 2MnO (SiO)2 + 3A10(SiO)2 + HO;
or it consists of two simple silicates and three bisilicates.
   Babingtonite agrees with the amphibole class in possessing
a complicated constitution.       It contains nearly the same
amount of   silica, but much less magnesia   and a greater amount
of manganese. Its specific     gravity is also much higher than
that of amphibole. My analysis approaches one by Bonsdorff,
of a black hornblende from Nordmark and Pargas, the mag
nesia being replaced by manganese in babingtonite.

XXI.   On a certain Method of representing by Diagrams the
  Results of Observations. By the Rev. S. EARNshaw, M.A.,
     Cambridge*.
IN British
   attending the proceedings of the Physical Section of the
           Association at the late meeting in this place, I
was struck on more than one occasion with a defect in the
method which had been employed by some of the experimen
talists in representing their results on paper.     My remarks
refer to those cases in which   polar co-ordinates were used, as
was done in two very interesting and important papers; one
“On the quantity of rain which had fallen with different
winds at Toomavara,” and the other “On Shooting Stars.”
In the former paper, the observer (the Rev. Thomas Knox)
reduced his observations to a pictorial state, by drawing upon
paper from a fixed point several lines to represent as many
directions of the wind; and this done, he set off upon each of
these lines, measuring from the fixed point, a length propor
tional to the quantity of rain which had fallen while the wind
was in that particular direction, and within certain limits on
each side of        Perhaps this will
                    it.                  plainer     figure.

 potash and muriatic acid on cinnamic acid is precisely similar
 to that of hypochlorite of lime, viz. the production of the oily
 compound, and subsequently of some of the series of chlori
 nated acids.      As stated in a previous part of this paper, it is
 not necessary to have the chlorine in a nascent state, in order
 to effect the decomposition of the cinnamic acid.              For if a
 stream of chlorine gas is sent through a hot solution of cin
namic acid, the chlorine                         oil
                                    and benzoic acid are immediately

    It will be observed by reference to the formulae given in a
previous part of the paper, that the acid A. obtained by hypo
chlorite of lime corresponds to the acid with two equivalents
of chlorine. No. II., which was treated with still more hypo
chlorite of lime, gave a mixture containing acids with two and
 three equivalents of chlorine; and No. III., in which the
 treatment was carried still further, corresponds to an acid
 with nearly three equivalents of chlorine.

    C. marked V. is       an acid containing one equivalent         of chlo
rine; and the silver salt marked           VI. is a mixture    of acids con
taining one and two equivalents of chlorine.
    Though several attempts were made,              I  did not succeed in
obtaining any of the salts of these acids in distinct crystals.
When boiled with a mixture of muriatic acid and alcohol,
each of these acids formed an aether, which in its smell and
other properties closely resembled that of benzoic acid.
    It is stated in most systems of chemistry, that chlorine has
no action on solutions of benzoic acid, but from the facts                 al
ready adduced, it is evident that this opinion is very incorrect.
It would be unjust to conclude without referring to the expe
riments of M. Herzog, detailed in Berzelius's Report for
 1842, p. 107, Paris edition.            M. Herzog says, “that when
dry benzoic acid is exposed to the action of chlorine under the
influence of solar light, the gas is absorbed and the acid is
transformed into a reddish humid mass, having a disagreeable
and fishy smell. When this is treated with carbonate of soda,
it forms a brownish-red solution, while a resinous body having
 the smell of benzoin remains undissolved.                 When the alka
line solution is neutralized with nitric           acid,  a crystalline acid
containing chlorine precipitates.”             The amount of the chlo
rine contained in it he did not determine.                M. Hertzog also
mentions that cinnamic acid is             decomposed      by chlorine in a
similar way, yielding a chlorinated cinnamic acid. He makes
no reference to the formation of any oil, nor does he appear
 to have attempted an analysis of any of these compounds
 whatever.

   bers; among whom were Sir Henry Halford, who long presided over
   the College of Physicians; and Dr. Hope, who for many years was
   Professor of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh. “We have
   still more immediate reason," his Lordship added, “to lament the
   decease of one of our ablest and most zealous colleagues, the late
   Mr. Baily, who had always taken an active share in the business
   as well as in the scientific pursuits of the Royal Society".  We have
   also to deplore the death, at a venerable age, of Dr. Dalton of Man
   chester, whose eminent discoveries have so largely contributed to
   our chemical knowledge and to the scientific reputation of En
   gland.”
      The Address contains obituary notices of deceased Fellows of the
   Society, from which we select the following:—
      DR. Thomas CHARLEs Hope was the son of Dr. John Hope,
   Professor of Botany in the University of Edinburgh, and was born
  at Edinburgh on the 21st of July 1766.
      His devotion to chemical science and his recognition as a chemist
  date from an early period of his life; for he was, on the death of Dr.
  Irvine, appointed Lecturer on Chemistry at Glasgow on the 10th of
  October 1787, while yet in his twenty-first year. He was further,
  in 1789, appointed Professor of Medicine in the same university,
  conjointly with his uncle Dr. Stevenson.       It does not appear, how
  ever, that he had actually delivered lectures on either subject in
  Glasgow until 1793; he most probably passed the interval in study
  ing at home and abroad, for we are informed that he returned from
  France in 1791, and he thereafter continued to lecture at Glasgow
 until 1795. At this period, he received the distinguished compliment
 of being recommended by Dr. Black as his assistant and successor
 in the chemical chair at Edinburgh. Accordingly, in 1795, Dr. Hope
 entered on his new duties by delivering a course conjointly with
 Dr. Black, whose decaying powers permitted him only to deliver the
 lectures on Caloric. In this, as well as in the courses of chemistry
 which he delivered in Glasgow, Dr. Hope taught the then recent
 doctrines of Lavoisier, which had not yet entirely overthrown the
 doctrine of phlogiston, and had not previously been publicly taught
 by any professor in Britain.
     Dr. Hope's exertions during his residence at Glasgow had not
been limited to writing and improving his lectures.         On the 4th of
 November 1793, he read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh his
well-known paper, “On a mineral from Strontian,” in which he
pointed out the existence of an undescribed earth, distinct from
barytes, with which it had been confounded, and to which he gave
the name of Strontites.
     In 1803, in the 6th volume of Nicholson's Journal, a brief notice
was published of the instrument with which Dr. Hope employed a
solution of sulphuret of potassium for eudiometrical purposes; and
    * The admirable memoir of our much-valued friend and correspondent
the late Mr. Francis Baily, from the pen of Sir J. Herschel, and read by
him at a special meeting of the Astronomical Society, is printed entire in
our 26th volume, p. 38.-Ed.

in 1804, he laid before the Royal Society of Edinburgh the careful
and elegant experiments, by which he demonstrated that the pro
position laid down by Dr. Croune in 1683 regarding the expansion
of water by cold is really correct; and that the phenomena observed
do not depend, as Hooke and others had maintained, on changes
occurring in the capacity of the vessel in which the experiment is
conducted.     From these researches, Dr. Hope concluded that the
maximum      density of water is at 394" or 40°Fahr. ; a result con
firmed  by  the more recent and very accurate experiments of Häll.
ström, who estimates         point            its

   The last communication which Dr. Hope made        the chemical                                  to
world was     1843, when

 and removed in 1793 to Manchester, where he continued to reside
 during the whole of his after-life.
    It was doubtless his long residence among the lakes and mountains
 of Cumberland, and his consequent early familiarity with the ever
 varying conditions of the atmosphere observable in that district,
 that gave the first impulse to his genius, and materially influenced
 his subsequent scientific career.           His earliest important publication
 was a Treatise on     Meteorology,     which furnished a clear compendium
 of  all the facts then     ascertained,    and made known various original
 views, especially            on
                          the altitude                  of

chapter contains the first announcement                 of the atomic doctrine of
chemical combination.
  He has often expressly stated that the tables of chemical equiva
lents constructed by Wenzel and Richter first suggested to him the
conception that chemical combination must have place between the
ultimate particles or indivisible atoms of bodies. The tabulated
differences of weight of the different bases required to neutralize a
given weight of acid would, on this hypothesis, represent the respec
tive weights of their ultimate atoms. Further evidence of more
decisive character presented itself in the instances in which one body
combines with another in more than one proportion.       The successive
combining quantities were ascertained to be represented by numbers
that were simple multiples of the smallest or lowest quantity.      Dr.
Dalton's earliest illustration of his law of multiple proportions was
derived from the gaseous compounds of oxygen and nitrogen.          Dr.
Wollaston afterwards discovered other examples of the law in the
tartrates and oxalates, and M. Gay Lussac's precise experiments on
gaseous combination completed the chain of evidence. All the phae
nomena of inorganic chemistry have been since shown to be in strict
 accordance with the atomic hypothesis, which has banished the un
 certainty of conflicting results, by enabling the experimentalist to
 anticipate and correct his analyses, and has thus raised chemistry, as
respects numerical precision, almost to the rank of a mathematical
 Science.
    It would be inconsistent with the principles of logical induction to
claim for the atomic doctrine higher rank than that of the most con
venient form of expressing and recording chemical phaenomena, and
of the most probable hypothesis that has been hitherto proposed for
interpreting chemical combination.     In the field of organic analysis,
which has of late years been laboured with signal success, rules of
combination seem to obtain which are difficultly reconcileable with
the doctrine of Dalton. It is scarcely possible to conceive the me
chanical juxtaposition of so large a number of elementary atoms as
would appear to constitute one compound organic atom; there are
consequently many among the cultivators of this branch of chemical
science who refuse to accept the atomic hypothesis as now consti
tuting a sufficient generalization of established facts. Yet even in
the chemistry of vegetable substances, the remarkable changes dis
covered by Mitscherlich, which he conceives best explained by the
 union of propejacent atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, and their elimi
 nation in the form of water, minister strong support to the theory of
atomic combination.      Without venturing to anticipate the future
 destinies of the hypothesis of Dalton, it is sufficient for the fame of
 its           acknowledge the mighty impulse          has given
    author  of to                                            it      the   to
 progress    chemical knowledge.

   WILLIAM ALLEN was the son of Mr. Job Allen, a silk-manufac
turer of Spitalfields, and was born in London on the 29th of August
1770.    His father being of the Society of Friends, he was strictly
educated in the principles of that religious community, of which he
continued till his death an exemplary and distinguished member.
 The early preference evinced by him for chemistry induced his
 father to place him in an establishment of high repute, of which,
some years after, he became the proprietor.            But happily for suffer
ing humanity, neither commercial gains nor the love of science itself
could hold exclusive possession of his mind.            From an early period
of his life he co-operated with Clarkson, Wilberforce and other philan
thropists in their efforts for the abolition of the African slave
trade, which were happily at length successful.
    Mr. Allen's connexion with the schools of chemistry and natural
philosophy in Guy's Hospital commenced in 1803, and continued till
 1826: Mr. Allen's ability and fitness as a teacher of science were
there amply attested.
    In 1804, Mr. Allen read his first course of lectures on natural phi
losophy in the Royal Institution. The valuable researches on carbon,
carbonic acid, and the changes effected in atmospheric air by respi
ration, made by Mr. Allen in conjunction with Mr. Pepys, are too
well known to require remark.         The results are to be found in our
Transactions for 1807, 1808, 1809. Mr. Allen was in 1807 admitted
a Fellow of the Royal Society.       He also became a member of other
scientific bodies of this country and of the continent.
    It was, however, to other objects of public utility that the greater
part of Mr. Allen's life was devoted. The education of the poor on
christian principles, and the circulation of the holy scriptures, were
among the first to which he directed his efforts; and wherever he
went the moral improvement of his fellow-creatures occupied his at
tention.    He was at             all
                            times ready          cooperate with the good
                                                             to                                 of
every creed whose aim was the happiness               mankind, and probably
                                                                  of

held until his death. To this institution                         he
                                                    liberally contributed not
only his time, but also large pecuniary assistance. At Lindfield,                               in
Sussex,       he
             expended large sums         building schools
                                                  in              industry, and  of
laboured    assiduously      otherbyplans    for  bettering   the condition                     of
the poor.     Among these the system          allotmentsof     land found him   of

        meetings regularly    Mr. Allen's house, Plough Court.—R.T.]

military and other schools of that empire. Mr. Allen made several
other journeys for benevolent objects to the continent, and he greatly
exerted himself in behalf of the Greeks and of the Waldenses of
Piedmont.
   The source of Mr. Allen's extraordinary influence was to be found
in that singleness of purpose, which, breaking down the obstacles of
party, gave him access to those in power, and carried him as by a
royal road to the confidence and favour of princes.         At home we
find him enjoying the marked consideration of their late Royal High
nesses the Dukes of Kent and Sussex, the former appointing him
one of his executors; and abroad he was in frequent communication
with the Emperor Alexander.
   Mr. Allen possessed in an uncommon degree the power of giving
his mind to a great variety of subjects, and this, together with his
activity, economy of time and early habits, enabled him to accom
plish a prodigious amount of good.       His correspondence alone was
a labour from which most men would have shrunk.
   In addition to subscriptions and donations to public charities, the
casual calls on Mr. Allen's benevolence were very heavy; he also
gave cheerfully, and there are perhaps few great works which he
did not at some period of his life assist.   The extent of Mr. Allen's
charity seems to have been widely known, for we find the Emperor
Alexander urging it as a reason for his undertaking the supply of
drugs for the Russian armies, an offer which he gratefully but firmly
refused, and to his honour be it spoken, he resisted a temptation the
value of which it would be difficult to estimate.      At the end of a
long life he could say that he had never compromised his public use
fulness for private interests.
   During the last fourteen years of his active life, Mr. Allen had
passed about half his time at Lindfield, diffusing happiness and doing
good to those about him.      The review of a well-spent life gave com
fort to the evening  of his  days, and that gospel which had been his
rule through   life was his  stay in death, sustaining his mind in se
renity and peace.
   He died at Lindfield on the 30th of December, 1843, aged 73.

   The Royal Observatory must occupy a very prominent place in
this year's report.
   The reduction of the Greenwich planetary observations from 1750
to 1830 was suggested by the British Association at the [first] Cam
bridge meeting. On the motion of the Board of Visitors of the Royal
Observatory, Her Majesty's government undertook to defray the ex
pense of printing, and committed the work to the charge of the As
tronomer Royal.      All is now done and printed in 671 large quarto
pages, except the introduction.     There are five sections: I. contains
the investigation of clock errors and rates, and computation of mean
time,      by stars.

causes of the foundation of an observatory at Cambridge, we form
no trivial wish when we hope that the consequences of the future
may equal in importance those of the past.
   It is probably known to most of the Fellows, that the government,
on the representation of the Astronomer Royal to his Board of Visi
tors, has sanctioned the erection of an altitude and azimuth instru
ment for extra-meridional observations of the moon.     For more than
a century all fundamental observations of stars and planets have been
made in the meridian; and if sufficient frequency of observation could
be ensured, there is no reason to suppose that any other species of
observation could be required.    In the case of the moon, however,
there is a necessary loss of the meridian observation during a part of
the month, and occasional occurrence of clouds at the time of other
wise visible transit; to which it must be added, that theoretical
knowledge of our satellite is so advanced as to make it difficult to
carry it further by such sets of observations as can be procured with
meridional instruments.       The Astronomer Royal has therefore de
termined to commence the task of following the moon through her
daily course to an extent which will supply, or more than supply,
the failure of meridian opportunities; and your Council feels a san
guine presentiment that this abandonment of the meridian will be an
epoch in the history of astronomy.       The altitude and azimuth                          in
strument is constructed on the same general principles as the ord
nance zenith sector described by Mr. Airy at the meeting of May
13, 1842.     It consists of very few parts, and these cast, and there
fore rather massive; and so important has it been considered to
unite the small parts, that the microscopes are cast in the same piece
with the rest, and are bored afterwards.       The instrument turns on
pivots above and below.        The revolving azimuthal frame consists
only of four casts—namely, the lower end, with a pivot and four
microscopes; the two sides, of which one has four microscopes; and
the top, with          its
                   pivot.    The moving vertical circle consists       two            of
parts only; one having one pivot, the graduated circle, and the two
ends     the telescope, the other having the other pivot.

of references for those stars which occur in the catalogues of Heve
lius, Bradley, Mayer, Piazzi, the Astronomical Society, Groombridge,
Pond, Argelander, Cambridge (first), Johnson and Taylor. This
brief notice needs no further comment here; for it would only be a
waste of time to add one word describing the excellence of the          in
struments employed, the finish and perfection of the reductions, the
 care of the editor or the utility of the final results.        We congra
 tulate all cultivators of astronomy on this noble addition to its Fun
 damenta, the influence of which will be instantly felt in every work
ing observatory, and directly or indirectly throughout every depart
 ment of the science.
    In the Cambridge Observatory Professor Challis has confined him
 self in a great degree, so far as the meridian instruments are con
cerned, to the planets and those double stars which have been ob
served with the Northumberland equatoreal.           A first series of obser
vations of double stars is in preparation, and a Second Cambridge
 Catalogue, in continuation of the one which was inserted by Mr. Airy
 in our Transactions.      The observations of the various recent comets
with the equatoreal above-mentioned will be valuable additions to the
 several yearly volumes.
    Your Council have great satisfaction in directing the attention of
the Society to the Observatory recently established at Liverpool by
the corporation.      In accordance with the advice of the Astronomer
Royal, the astronomical portion consists of a transit-room and a dome
for a large equatoreal. An adjoining apartment is appropriated to
the chronometers which are brought there for trial or rating, and to
the meteorological instruments; the rest of the building forms a
comfortable house for the observer. A transit of five feet focallength
and four inches aperture by Simms, a sidereal clock and a mean time
clock by Molyneux, and a standard barometer (Newman's construc
tion) by Adie of Liverpool, have been for some months in use, to the
perfect satisfaction of Mr. Hartnup, the director.        The telescope of
the transit is a   particularly fine  one, and the   mounting,    which was
directed by the Astronomer Royal, is the strongest and stiffest per
haps in existence.      With the two clocks (which are within hearing
of each   other,  and which are regularly compared whenever time is
got or chronometer errors ascertained) it forms a perfectly efficient
apparatus for getting and keeping the time, and is adequate to the
most delicate determinations of right ascension.        When the equato
real is   completed   (the  object-glass  will have an aperture of eight
inches, the mounting is to be under Mr. Airy's superintendence), we
may expect most valuable assistance from the Liverpool Observatory
in the extra-meridian branch of practical astronomy.          But the prin
cipal and most interesting object of this establishment          is,
                                                                            of of

giving true time  to  the great portof   Liverpool;  an  object which  is
high national importance, and which has hitherto been almost unac
countably neglected.       The observatory    is admirably situated for this
purpose,  on  the brink      the Mersey
                            of           at   the entranceto   the Waterloo

to that at Greenwich is let fall every day except Sunday, precisely
at one P.M. Greenwich time, and the whole arrangement is so com
plete, and the longitude so well known, that the dropping of the
balls at the two observatories may be considered to be simultaneous.

mers have each their peculiar interest; and some little account of
this arduous and toilsome undertaking will doubtless be interesting
to the Society.
   With the aid of his assistants and a military detachment placed
under his command, Mr. Maclear began, on the 1st of September,
 1840, the measurement of a base line, eight miles in length, on the
plains of Zwartland.      Its direction is about west by south to east
by north. The measurement of the first 1600 feet was repeated,
and the difference of the results was found to be inappreciable,
though the operation was rendered most harassing by the excessive
heat. The measurement of the whole line occupied six months, not
more than from 500 to 750 feet being completed in one day.           Mr.
Maclear thinks that there is just ground for believing that the
entire base, 42,818 feet in length, is scarcely erroneous to the
amount of half an inch, and that the error is probably much less
than this.
   Thenceforward the trigonometrical survey continued to occupy a
large share of Mr. Maclear's attention.      In December 1842 he pro
ceeded in H.M.S. Arrow to take the zenith sector up to the Oli
phant's River, which was then intended to be the northern limit of
the arc, though it was afterwards deemed advisable to extend the
triangulation both north and south of Lacaille's original arc; north
ward to Lily Fontein on the Kamies Berg, which has been accom
plished; and southward to Cape l'Agulhas, which is approaching to
completion.
    This labour has subjected the observers to the greatest privations,
to intense heat on the arid Karroos in summer, and to extreme cold
in the winter, when they had to ascend such commanding heights as
the Cedar Berg, the Snew Cop, the Winter Hock, and the Worcester
Range, leaving their wagon or horses far below them, and being
consequently reduced to sleep under the open sky, amidst snow and
sleet, waiting from day to day, till the weather would admit of flash
ing their heliotropes towards the concerted points. Mr. Maclear
speaks in the highest terms of the zeal of his assistants during the
whole of these laborious and trying operations.
    The East India Company has lately presented the Society with
two valuable volumes, printed by the order of the Madras govern
ment. The first, containing the meteorological observations made
at the Madras Observatory for twenty years (1822–1843), will find
those who can more appropriately discuss      itsmerits than your Coun

tions of stars which appear to exceed a quarter of a second of space
have been tabulated.       Of the merits of this Catalogue it would be
impossible to give any opinion at present; but your Council need
not say that, from what is known of the zeal and industry of Mr.
Taylor, they are well prepared to believe that it will soon be charac
terised as a valuable addition to sidereal astronomy, and an indis
pensable aid to the southern astronomer.
   The progress of Sir John Herschel's reductions of his southern
observations must interest the Fellows of this Society.             From the
state in which they now are, it is not very improbable that the Ca
talogue may appear in a year from this time, The constant atten
tion which the completion of this great undertaking requires, has
prevented Sir John Herschel from taking that share in the business
of the Society, from which, previously to his departure for the Cape
of Good Hope,            its
                     affairs derived      much benefit. The Council hope

   The  second comet was discovered at Rome at the observatory of

    Your Council will conclude this Report with one remark.                                                                    It   is

There is much reason for regret in the circumstance that the scien
tific body of our day has almost entirely lost the character of the col
lector of suggestions worthy of consideration, hints of useful ten
 dency, and valuable but isolated information.      If the minutes of
the Royal Society in the time which preceded the publication of the
Principia should now and then excite a smile, it will be checked by
the obvious consideration that we owe much of what has been since
done to the currency which the disposition to communicate, and the
facilities for doing        it,
                         afforded       mere suggestions.

    Observers have generally chosen their time for making these re
 searches.    For our part, a clouded sky alone interrupts our observa
 tions, to which we return, at any hour in the night, as soon as the
 state of the sky permits.      My registers give the following results:
 from the month of July 1841 to the month of February 1845, 5302
 shooting stars observed in 1054 hours. I have grouped, in the differ
 ent tables contained in my memoir, these observations in such a
 manner as to be able to deduce from them results relatively to the
 greater or less frequency of these meteors, according to the hours,
 months and years.       It will be conceived that, on this latter point, I
 do not yet pretend to draw any conclusions from observations which
 do not extend in a regular manner over more than four years; but
 as to the horary and mensual variations, I think that I have already
 arrived at two general laws.       Thus, in each month comprised be
 tween the winter and summer solstices, the mean number of falling
 stars, for one hour, is very sensibly the same ; and this is also the
 case during the six other months; with this difference, however, that
 for the latter, the mean is nearly double what it is for the others, and
 the change takes place, so to speak, without transition.         With re
 gard to the horary variations, on the contrary, there is a gradual
 change, and from six o'clock in the evening, which is the hour of
 the minimum, the number of the appearances goes on increasing
 continually up to six in the morning, which is the moment of the
maximum.
    In the second part the author treats of the directions of shooting
 stars. The following is the distribution of 1000 of these meteors
 relatively to the sixteen angular spaces into which he divides the
horizon, proceeding in the direction north, east, south, west:-74,
 90, 82, 91, 114, 86, 70, 79, 63, 34, 29, 28, 33, 28, 35, 64; which
shows that many more stars come from the east than from the west,
and nearly as many from the north as from the south.
    The author thinks that the difference between the number of stars
observed in the two directions, east and west, is attributable to the
twofold motion of the earth.
    There are mensual variations which it is difficult to determine.
In winter, the influence of the south is the greatest possible; in
summer the influence of the north is very perceptible. With regard
to the influence of the east, it is the weakest in summer, and the
strongest in spring and in autumn.
    The horary variations are more marked. Those from the north
are most numerous towards midnight, and least so in the morning.
With respect to the east, there are most in the morning and fewest
in the evening. From the south there are often the most in the
morning; lastly, from the west there are most in the evening.
    In the third part of his memoir, the author treats first of the
magnitude of shooting stars; he gives the name globe filant to every
meteor which presents a sensible disc, and reserves the name of shoot
ing stars for the meteors which have an appearance analogous to
that of the fixed stars and the planets.      He calls them of the first
magnitude when they appear equal to Venus or Jupiter; of the

                      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,                                         155
second magnitude when they resemble fixed stars of the first magni
tude; and thus with the rest. Among 5302 meteors, the author
counted eight shooting globes and eighty shooting stars of the first
magnitude; whence it follows that, if no obstacle prevented, an ob
server would see one shooting globe a week, and one falling star of
the first magnitude each night of eleven hours.
    In general the falling stars have the same tint as the fixed stars.
Sometimes this colour passes into yellow, then into a bluish or a
greenish tint, in proportion as the meteor approaches the horizon.
    Among all these meteors there are some red ones, which travel
slowly, and have a globular form, like a billiard-ball coloured red.
The author thinks that these are of a particular character. Lastly,
 he distinguishes others which are extinguished at their highest point
of brilliancy, as if they were plunged into water.
    With respect to the trains which some stars leave behind them,
 these cannot be compared to smoke, but rather to a shower of sparks
 like that of rockets. The train begins and ends always with the star
 producing       but it,continues one
                               it         two seconds after the disappear

 ance      of
           that star.    Sometimes the star breaks         into fragments,        up
 which form       continuation of the train, and which vanish almost
                      a                                                                                     as
 soon.    No star has ever caused any audible noise, whether remain
 ing simple,       producing
                      or        train,                     or
                                         separating into fragments.

 porcelain   earth from Aue in Saxony; 2nd, porcelain earth from
 Bayonne; 3rd, gray vesicular lava from Niedermennig on the
 Rhine; 4th, white trachyte from the Drachenfels; 5th, basalt from

 pure soda, the fused masses digested in water, and the liquids filtered
 from the insoluble residues neutralized with nitric acid. These neu

EXAMINATION OF SOME NATIVE AND ARTIFICIAL COMPOUNDS
       OF PHOSPHORIC ACID. BY C. RAMMELSBERG.
                           Wagnerite (Pleuroklase).
   We are indebted for the only analysis this exceedingly rare mine   of
ral     Fuchs, who obtained
         to                          the year 1821 the following results:
                                                    in
phosphoric acid 41.73 per cent., magnesia 46-66, peroxide             iron 5-0,                of
peroxide      manganese 0-5, hydrofluoric acid 6-5. Fuchs decomposed
                    of
the mineral with sulphuric acid, and separated the sulphate from the
phosphate        magnesia by water.

silicic acid (quartz).     The mixture was heated until the whole of
the fluorine and the greater part of the sulphuric acid were expelled:
it was then moistened with water, next mixed with four parts of car
bonate of soda, evaporated, and finally heated to redness for half an
hour.    The perfectly fused mass was exhausted with water, and after
repeatedly evaporating the alkaline solution, each time adding car
bonate of ammonia and redissolving, the phosphoric acid was preci
pitated by chloride of calcium.       The exhausted residue, after solu
tion in muriatic    acid, yielded,  on the addition of ammonia, a preci
pitate of oxide of    iron,  with a small quantity of alumina and mag
nesia, and some phosphoric acid; it was therefore again fused with
carbonate of soda. The separation of the bases, and also the sepa
ration of the lime and magnesia from the ammoniacal liquid, was ac
complished by the ordinary methods.
    2. The mass treated with sulphuric acid as above was finally re
tained at a temperature below that of redness, until fumes of sul
phuric acid ceased to escape, and was then exhausted with water.
According to the statement of Fuchs, sulphate of magnesia (with per
 oxide of iron) only should have been thus dissolved; and by ascertain
 ing the amount of sulphuric acid we might expect to obtain the equi
 valent amount of fluorine.       But this cannot be accomplished, partly
because the mineral always contains a little silicic acid which escapes
 in the form of fluoride of silicium, and partly because the water re
 moves phosphate of alumina as well as the sulphate.           The portion
insoluble in water is likewise decomposed in this case by heating it
to redness with carbonate of soda, although by so doing the whole of
 the phosphoric acid cannot be removed, and the precipitate obtained
 on the addition of ammonia must be digested and boiled with solu
 tion of potash for a considerable time.
    3. The more transparent parts of the mineral, being the most re
 cent and the purest, were decomposed by a mixture of an equal weight
 of hydrate of potash and three times their weight of carbonate of
 soda. The perfectly fused mass when treated with water yielded an
 alkaline solution, containing phosphoric acid and fluorine, and an
 insoluble residue, consisting of magnesia and the other bases. a. The
 liquid was evaporated to dryness in a water-bath in a platinum cap
 sule, treated with water, separated by filtration from a small residue
 of phosphate of magnesia, hydrochloric acid then added so as to pro
 duce a slightly acid reaction, the carbonic acid expelled by a very
 gentle heat, and then precipitated by ammonia and chloride of cal
 cium in a closed vessel.      The precipitate, consisting of phosphate of
 lime and fluoride of    calcium,  was decomposed by sulphuric acid and
 alcohol, and thus the lime was estimated; the alcoholic liquid was
 slightly evaporated, then mixed with ammonia and chloride of cal
 cium, and the quantity of phosphoric acid in the phosphate of lime
 ascertained by decomposing it with sulphuric acid.         b. The residue
 of the exhaustion of the fused mass, when acted upon by hydrochloric
 acid, left a residue consisting of silicic acid. The precipitate thrown
 down from this solution by ammonia also contained some phosphoric
 acid, it was therefore again heated with carbonate of soda.        It con

tained moreover peroxide of iron, lime and magnesia; a portion of
the two latter still remained to be estimated in the ammoniacal filtered
liquor.   The three above analyses, the third of which yielded the
best results, afforded the following proportions:—
                                                     II.           III.

      Magnesia     . . . . . . . . 42'04        38-49            45-07

                                                                 103-22
   The silicic acid is merely mixed with the wagnerite in the form of
quartz, it must therefore be deducted. The same holds good with
the alumina and small quantities of the remaining bases, which are
combined with carbonic acid, forming calcareous and bitter spar, and
cannot be completely removed in selecting the fragments. Their
amount is however very inconsiderable.         If we deduct the 2.68 per
cent. of silica there remain 40-61 per cent. phosphoric acid, 46-27
magnesia, 4:59 protoxide of iron, 2:38 lime, 9-36 fluorine; results
which do not differ to any extent from those of Fuchs except in the
proportion of fluorine.      If we calculate from the third analysis, we
find that the quantities of protoxide of iron and lime, which nearly
replace one part of magnesia, amount to one equivalent for 4.43 of
the latter. Now 9:36 fluorine to form MgFI require 6'34 Mg=10:34
magnesia; consequently 40°36 per cent. of magnesia remain to com
bine with the 40-61 per cent. phosphoric acid. But as the above ex
periment could hardly yield the entire amount of phosphoric acid and
of fluorine, we have no hesitation in regarding the magnesian phos
phate as 3MgO, P,0, assigning to wagnerite the formula Mg Fl
 +3MgO, P,0,. This formula requires 43.32 per cent. of phos
phoric acid and 11:35 per cent. of fluorine, whilst the formula
Mg Fl + 4MgO, P, O, requires only 38.5 phosphoric acid, thus less
than the experiment yields, and 55-73 magnesia; it is therefore in
correct.                                         -
   In the  specimens   of the wagnerite  selected for analysis, there were
reddish, dull, and soft portions, the examination of which showed
that they were probably decomposed wagnerite; they consisted prin
cipally of silicic acid. On analysis they yielded 93.81 per cent. silicic
acid, 1.87 phosphoric acid, 1.41 alumina and peroxide of iron, 2:58
lime, and 1.49 magnesia.-Poggendorff's Ann. lxiv. p. 251.

ON THE     STRUCTURE AND RELATIONS OF CORNULITES AND

  The singular fossil named Cornulites serpularius is well known as
characteristic of the Silurian rocks of Gothland, Britain and North
America, and     its
                  affinities have been the subject much conjecture.

Mr. Salter's investigations proved that it differed essentially from any
crinoidal animal or coral, and was most probably an ancient form of
the Serpulinae.  From a similarity of structure in the Tentaculites,
another abundant fossil of the Silurian rocks, Mr. Salter is disposed
to refer it to the same group with Cornulites.—Proc. Brit. Assoc.

   Letters from Naples announce, that the expected eruption of
Mount Vesuvius has commenced. At their date, the volcano had
been for several days throwing up flames and stones, by the mouth
of the cone formed some months ago in the midst of the crater; and
the burning lava had opened a wide passage below, and was flowing
down the side of the mountain.

    a recent paper in the Philosophical Transactions, Dr.
IN Fownes  showed the presence of phosphoric acid in several
igneous rocks, and having made some investigations on the
same point,     I
                may perhaps be allowed to state them here.
About two    years ago, Prof. Liebig mentioned to me the im
portance of examining different rocks in order to ascertain, if
possible, the presence of phosphoric acid in them, as he con
sidered very naturally that it must be universally present in
 allsoils and    the rocks from which they are derived,

may be detected               with certainty.  The following is the me
thod:—
   When the mineral was limestone, or a substance containing
a large quantity of lime, I took about four ounces of it broken
into fragments, introduced it into a covered crucible and ex
posed it for three or four hours to a strong white heat; the
mass thus treated was then digested in water, when I suspected
the substance contained potash or soda, in order to dissolve
out these bodies, and strong hydrochloric acid poured on the
remainder          (if
                     did not wish

 are different kinds of light, heat and sound.            Electrical phae
 nomena would then also be undulatory. We certainly do not
 readily see how the positive and negative could in this way be
 accounted for; but such a difficulty cannot justify us in re
jecting an explanation in other respects so accordant with
 reason. Viewed in this light, the increased effect produced
 by the simultaneous action of several sources of electricity
 (the voltaic pile, the electrical battery) would be considered
 as caused in the same way, as by the simultaneous action of
 many sources of the same kind of light an increased illumina
 tion occurs, and in the simultaneous emission of several sounds
 an increase in the sound conveyed to the ear is produced.
 The action of the condenser would then be intelligible as con
 verting electricity of less into that of higher tension.
    I  may be permitted here to draw attention to the facts
 which electrical phaenomena seem to point out, that an essen
 tially different mode of propagation of the electricity occurs in
 the so-called non-conductors to what takes place in the con
 ductors.      Thus it appears that in the former, when they
 allow the   electricity   to be diffused to any extent, as the air,
 its  propagation follows the same laws                light and radiant
                                                                as

                                                 the late experiments                             of
 Petrina, who found that electricity, when propagated                  rec               in   a

 metallic conducting plate connected with the earth), suffers dif
 fraction, just       rays
                     as        light and heat do. Hence any sub

 Magnetism exhibits the remarkable property of being retained
or absorbed by no other bodies than the few magnetic metals,
 whilst it is diffused through these comparatively slowly, and
 in a manner more analogous to heat. Consequently there is
no conduction of magnetism at                resembling the conductionall
of  electricity.
  If   the appearances         light, heat, electricity and magnetism,

                                     we must arrive         the conclusion                    at
that their exceedingly rapid mode                propagation essentially     of
depends upon motion                imponderable matter (aether), their
                                                  of       an
slow diffusion     being  essentially    dependent         the movements                   on
of  the atoms        the bodies. An analogy between magnetism

                                 the magnetic metals, these thus be
coming magnetized, just             bodies become warmed   as       the ab                                       by

the   magnetic    rays,  whilst there       scarcely    one which    is not                                            is

                             contact, they will for the greater part

168    M. Henrici on    the Theory and     Application of Electricity.
is diffused over the two conductors lying in contact. This
latter portion however may be further carried away by con
duction, and it is evident that by contact compensation must
ensue for that which is thus carried away (perhaps absorbed
by a condenser, or in some other way).
    If the conduction be now completed in a manner requiring
no further action by contact, an electric current is produced,
the power of which must evidently be proportional to the per
 fection of the whole conduction, because in any given time a
 certain quantity only of electricity can escape at the point of
 contact.    This quantity of electricity however always amounts
 to a  very small portion only of that originally produced by the
contact, as even the best conduction presents a remarkably
greater resistance than the point of contact itself.
    Thus the internal condition of an open galvanic series *
 cannot be compared with a charged electrical jar, because in
 this the electricities conveyed to it from without are artificially
 separated from one another by an intervening non-conductor
 and prevented from neutralizing each other.            But even here
 a certain amount of electricity, although it is but small, and
 proportional to the conducting power of the separating non
 conductor, must evidently pass through this to produce neu
tralization.    The discharge of the jar ensues when any better
conduction than by means of the non-conductor is presented
to the electricities, as for instance, by the air, or still more the
earth (which affords in the case of Volta's pile very imper
fect conduction).       Consequently, an electric jar, y no dis
charge occurred through the air, would almost entirely part
with the electricity communicated to it by rapid discharge
through the completed circuit, whilst of the electricity pro
duced by contact a small quantity only can ever be collected
and made effective at one time.
    From these considerations, it cannot be allowed that the
electricity from contact in the experiments we have investi
gated is capable of being rendered perceptible to the electro
scope without condensation, because, as we have stated, even
between unvarnished and very small metallic surfaces conden
satory effects occur. I have succeeded, by the following method
of proceeding, in making the electricity of contact unequivo
cally perceptible without condensation.           A strip of silver was
fastened to one end of a     strip of  zinc,  the whole was then bent
into the form of a U; between the two arms a narrow strip of
gold leaf was suspended, so that it could be moved without
   * By an open but complete series, as is well known, we understand one
in which, if we adopt the contact theory, the series is complete, as ex
pressed by the formula, “Copper—zinc–liquid—copper.”

difficulty to and fro.          By carefully moving this gold leaf, it
was very easy to place it in such a position that it should be
attracted by the strip of zinc only when negatively, and the
strip of silver only when positively electrified.                 As it was
electrified by induction, on removing the electrifying bodies
(sealing-wax and glass gently excited by friction) the opposite
attraction to that produced by the approximation of them took
place if an attraction had been thus produced. In my opinion
we have here no ambiguity.               There is scarcely occasion to re
mark, that the apparatus was enclosed in a glass vessel.                    As
the normal attraction ensued             only   when the    gold  leaf was in

 in  these experiments         first produced

 disappears            very short time, even when
                        in   a                                 not purposely     it   is

  to deduce hence their chemical attraction, we must evidently
  admit the existence of a great difference in the quantity of
  their peculiar electricities in the various atoms of bodies; the
  most positive bodies must contain the largest amount of posi
  tive, and the negative bodies the largest amount of negative
  electricity.     But how can electro-chemical attraction occur,
  when two      positive or negative bodies act on each other? and
 yet such bodies combine with each other in the most varied
  proportions.
     Thus it is vain to endeavour to find a physical basis for the
 electro-chemical views. But there exists between the elec
  trical relations and the general chemical character of a body,
 a parallelism which cannot be mistaken (as I have already
                                                 I
 endeavoured to prove elsewhere), and am still of the opinion
 that it deserves attentive consideration.
     5. The compound galvanic series presents a peculiarity
 which, in my opinion, deserves to be considered more carefully.
     If n represents the cells of like constitution, the electromo
 tive force of which is expressed by E, their resistance being
  = r, when united with an homologous metal, and provided
 with a common conductor whose resistance is =r' (previously
 to which the circuit is not perfectly complete), the intensity
 of the current (Q) in the latter is                -
                               Q-4.  7" —H 117
 When the elements are arranged in the form of a pile, the
 intensity of the current Q is
                                        nE
                              Q=ºr
 When     r"
            ! is  – “
              is = r, we have
                                     -o-,
                                  Q= Q           *—
                                             T(n + 1)r'
and it is then a matter      of indifference in what manner the ele
 ments are combined as regards the effects. If we now examine
 the intensity of the current in the elements of the compound
series, theory gives the equation
                                7=rina;
we thus arrive at the remarkable conclusion, that when r" is
 =r, the intensity of
       ;
                           the currents in the elementary series is
only       of that contained in the pile series; in other words,
the same mechanical (or other) effect of the conductor closing
the circuit, produces under these circumstances in the pile a
consumption of matter n times greater than occurs in the
compound series formed of the same elements.                Thus, were
it  possible,    by mechanical   arrangements,     to render the resist

ance r" of the conductor completing the circuit =r, the ex
penditure of these arrangements arising from the galvanic
consumption of matter in using 1000 elementary series com
bined in the manner of the compound series, would amount
to Tºnth only of that caused by their arrangement in the
form of a pile. Consequently, in the former combination, the
polarization would also be remarkably slight; we might also
thus avoid the use of constant series, and in the selection of
a liquid might merely take into consideration, in addition to
its conducting power,                 its
                           chemical relation  the two metals,                to
so as   toavoid chemical action between them.

  as well as in the dark.       This perchloride of carbon is identi
  cal with Regnault’s “ether chlorhydrique de l'esprit de bois
 perchlorure,” and may be obtained with ease from the chloride
  of carbon. Perchloride of carbon does not enter into direct
 combinations, but it unites with sulphurous acid when both
  are in a nascent state, and forms conjugate, neutral, indiffer
  ent bodies, which Berzelius and Marcet discovered when they
 digested sulphuret of carbon with moistened chlorine or nitric
 acid*. I call this white, volatile, crystallized compound sul
 phite of perchloride of carbon, C Cl, SO3.               It may be ob
  tained in large  quantities    by digesting   peroxide    of manganese
 and   hydrochloric    acid for several    days   in a close vessel with
 sulphuret of carbon, and after the decomposition is complete

  Sulphite of perchloride of carbon suspended in water is re
 duced by chloride of tin, sulphuretted hydrogen, or sulphurous
 acid, and converted with the loss of one equivalent of chlorine
 into sulphite of chloride of carbon, C CISO, a colourless,
 inodorous, and very unstable combination, soluble in water
 and alcohol.     The solution in water is decomposed upon ex
 posure to the air, combining with one equivalent of oxygen,
 forming oxide of chloride of carbon and sulphurous acid.
 Chlorine occasions a precipitate of regenerated sulphite of
 perchloride of carbon.         Bromine also produces a similar in
 soluble  combination,    which will be the subject of a future ex
 amination.     Iodine occasions no precipitate. The behaviour
 of sulphite of perchloride of carbon towards the caustic alka
 lies gives rise to a series of conjugate hyposulphates, which
 have the greatest similarity to one another, although their con
junctives, by which they are alone distinguished, are bodies
 of quite a different chemical nature. The acids thus produced
 do not show the slightest similarity to sulphurous acid; the
 chemical properties of the latter are upon formation of the
conjoined bodies completely changed, and they have obtained
properties and a power of combination which place them by
the side of the strongest incrganic acids. The first of these
combinations is hyposulphate of chloride of carbon, HO + C2
 Cls, S, Os. It contains as a conjunct perchloride of carbon,
and is formed together with chloride of potassium when the
sulphite of perchloride of carbon is dissolved in caustic potash.

effloresced salt is free from water, and is composed of KO-F
C. Clº S, O3. This decomposition is thus explained—

The hydrous hyposulphate of chloride of carbon, which is
obtained by precipitation of the baryta salt with sulphuric
acid, crystallizes upon evaporation in small prisms, not per
manent in the air, which may be heated to 150° without de
composition.      They are not oxidized by boiling with nitric,
nitromuriatic or chromic acids; nitric and hydrochloric acid
may be distilled off from them without any change. The salts
of hyposulphate of chloride of carbon are soluble in water and
in alcohol, and easily crystallizable.      They are decomposed
by heat into sulphurous acid, chloro-carbonic oxide gas, and
the metallic chloride, which last remains free from sulphuric
acid, and is colourless. The barytic salt is formed like the
alkaline salt, by solution of the sulphurous perchloride of
carbon in baryta water; it crystallizes upon evaporation in
large four-sided tables; at 100°C. it is composed of BaO +
C, Cls, S, Os -- aq. The remaining salts are formed by neu
tralising the free acid with a basic carbonate. The ammo
niacal salt crystallizes most readily in fine large prisms.

The oxalate of chloro-carbon                               remains dissolved in water,
and may be ultimately separated from the muriatic acid mixed
with it and crystallized, by evaporation in vacuo over lime and
sulphuric acid. The silver salt of this acid does not contain
any hydrogen: it detonates by heating, and becomes black by
exposure in the air.       0.396 grm. left by a red heat 0:210 grim.

   0.658 grim. burned with oxide of copper, produced 0.214

parts to 39.9 of silver and 8.9 of carbon. The formula Ag O
 +C, Cls C. Os requires 400 silver and 8.9 of carbon.

lated and peculiar, and therefore till chemists succeed in dis
covering more compounds of the same classes, the formation
of basic bodies in this manner must be limited.
   It is quite different with another method, by which chemists
have also succeeded of late years in procuring basic bodies.
Zinin” was the first who conceived the happy idea of investi
gating the products produced by the action of sulphuret of
ammonium upon nitrogenous compounds, which latter were
procured by treating various carbo-hydrogens with nitric acid.
Zinin investigated in this point of view Laurent's nitronaphtha
lase obtained by the action of nitric acid upon naphthaline, and
nitrobenzide, discovered by Mitscherlich, and he arrived at the
remarkable result that these bodies lose their whole oxygen
under the influence of sulphuretted hydrogen, and in assuming
hydrogen pass into combinations, presenting in every respect
the characters of true organic bases; the two bases formed
by Zinin in the manner described, are the naphthalidam, for
which Berzeliust has lately proposed the more appropriate
name of naphtalidine, and benzidam, afterwards recognised as
identical with aniline. The following comparison of formulae
shows how nearly the original compounds are connected with
the required products:—

182       Drs. Muspratt and Hofmann on Toluidine.
a series of investigations concerning the action of sulphuret
of ammonium upon various bodies containing, like nitro
naphthalase and nitrobenzide, the elements of peroxide of
nitrogen.
   There occurred in this inquiry some questions the answers
to which appeared of interest. Above all, it was necessary to
decide whether the transformations suffered by nitronaphtha
lase and nitrobenzide were identical with those of all simi
larly constituted bodies. Secondly, it was requisite to ascer
tain how hydrocarbons behave in which more than one equi
valent of hydrogen is replaced by peroxide of nitrogen. Here
very different results might be imagined.             Lastly, it was of
the greatest value to study the properties of those bodies re
sulting from treating with sulphuret of ammonium the pro
ducts of the action of nitric acid upon orides of hydrocarbons.
   The following is the first of a series of investigations made
with regard to the preceding statements.            The experiments
were   performed   in the Giessen     laboratory,   and therefore we
cannot refrain from expressing our greatest thankfulness to
Professor Liebig for his kind assistance and counsel during
the course of them. We commenced by a careful repetition
of Zinin’s experiments upon the formation of naphthalidine,
and have procured this body possessing                       all

happily chosen.    Berzelius+ has   given    this body  the name

   Deville has given benzoate of the oxide of ethvle as one of
the products of distillation of Tolu balsam; but if we consider
how minute is the difference per cent. between the ethyle
and methyle compounds of benzoic acid, as also that Deville
did not either analyse the alcohol from the former, or change
it into acetic acid, we may readily infer that his compound is
not benzoic aether, but benzoate of methyle, which by the
temperature acquired in the distillation is partly converted
into toluole and carbonic acid. Considerations of this kind
prompted us to study the action of caustic lime upon benzoate
of the oxide of methyle. We passed the vapour of this body
over incandescent lime previously strewn in a combustion
tube, and obtained an                       oil
                             which was not dissolved         potash                          by

                   comportment and analysis          proved                     it                to   be

Toluidine has no action upon curcuma paper, but it colours
green the pigment of dahlias.                   Reddened litmus paper is
faintly blued.          Toluidine is heavier than water. It evapo
rates at all temperatures, and when a glass rod moistened with
hydrochloric acid is held over it white fumes are perceptible;
this also takes place with nitric acid, but in a less degree.
When pressed with the hand between paper it leaves a slight
stain, which is however very fugitive.                     The fusing-point of
this base lies at       40°C.,     the boiling-point      exactly  at 198°C.
    Some years ago Professor Kopp * drew attention to the re
markable relation subsisting between the boiling-points of
bodies whose composition differs in a constant number of equi
valents of the same elements.                He found, for instance, that
the difference in the boiling-points of two compounds which
differ by two equivalents of carbon and two equivalents of
hydrogen (C, H,) is invariably 19°C. Kopp showed this at
first by comparing the boiling-points of a vast number of
ethyle and methyle compounds, and then the numerous hy
drated acids differing in C, H2. Since that time this concur
rence between a series of newly-discovered aethers and acids
has been perfectly confirmed, but it seems to take place only
in bodies of an analogous character, as remarked by Kopp
and subsequently by Fehlingt.
    We possess in benzole and toluole and their derivatives also
two series of analogous bodies, whose composition is distin
guished by the constant difference C, H2. It was of interest
to compare the boiling-points of these bodies in the sense re
ferred to.

    This comparison shows undoubtedly that Kopp's rule holds
good with regard to the above-cited bodies.
    The differences evidently arise from mistakes in observa
tion.     As for the boiling-points of nitrobenzide and nitroto
luide, the somewhat considerable variation can by nowise sur
prise, knowing as we do with what readiness bodies of this
nature undergo decomposition when submitted to distillation.

An alcoholic solution of this       base solidifies almost immediately
when mixed with most acids, and in order to obtain the salts
in good crystals it is only necessary to employ water or spirits
of wine as the solvent. The compounds are inodorous, and
with the exception of the palladium and platinum salt co
lourless.      When they are exposed, particularly in a moist
state, to the air, they acquire a pinkish hue like the aniline
compounds.         They are decomposed by the caustic or car
bonated alkalies and ammonia with the greatest facility; the
toluidine separating in crystalline grains.
    The constitution of the salts of toluidine resembles that of
the aniline and ammoniacal salts.
    Sulphate of toluidine, SO, + Cla H, N, HO.--Toluidine
was dissolved in aether and then a few drops of sulphuric acid
added, when immediately a shining white crystalline precipi
tate appeared, which was collected on a filter and edulcorated
 with more of the solvent.          This salt is difficultly soluble in
alcohol, but more readily dissolved by aether.

ther.  The crystals were washed with a mixture of alcohol
and aether and then desiccated in a water-bath.  We have         al
ready alluded to the determination of the platinum in this

          Products    of the Decomposition of Toluidine.
    We should have been exceedingly glad to have submitted
toluidine to the action of different agents, but the difficulty of
obtaining this body in sufficient quantity prevented us from
satisfying our wishes.    We can therefore only give a few re
actions, which we had the opportunity of remarking during
the course of the investigation.     When the vapour of tolui
dine is   passed  over fused   potassium,  an energetic reaction
ensues, and there is formed a quantity of cyanide of potas
sium, as was readily ascertained by the residue giving off hy
drocyanic acid when treated with a mineral acid. With con
centrated nitric acid the base is decomposed, and a large
quantity of nitrous acid eliminated.      On mixing the solution
with water, sulphur-yellow flakes are deposited, which dis
solve in alkalies with a brownish-red colour, and reappear on
the addition of an acid. This behaviour is analogous to that
of nitrophenisic acid, but we are not in a position at present
to communicate anything more definite concerning this sub
stance.   When this base is treated with a solution of bromine
a violent action ensues, accompanied by an elevation of tem
perature and formation of hydrobromic acid.          When the
product is heated in a test-tube, there sublimes in the upper
part white, shining needles, which are soluble in alcohol and
aether, but insoluble in water.      They do not possess basic
properties, and behave in every respect like tribromaniline;
 it is highly probable that their composition is also similar.

attention to a remarkable way for obtaining aniline, and which
we discovered during our experiments.
   Chemists are well acquainted with the interesting compound
Mitscherlich described under the name of azobenzide in one
of his beautiful papers upon the derivatives of benzoic acid.
He obtained this body by distilling nitrobenzide with alcohol
and potash, together with other products which were not fur
ther investigated.    Azobenzide differs only from aniline in
two equivalents of hydrogen.

     In order to see if a closer relation did not subsist between
these two    bodies, we prepared large quantities of azobenzide,
following Mitscherlich's directions throughout, and obtained
this body, possessing                all
                              the properties ascribed              that

   On more closely examining the secondary products formed
during this process, we found that besides other substances

XXIX.       Observations connected with the Discovery of the Com
    position of Water.      By Sir David BREwsTER, K.H.,
    F.R.S., and V.P.R.S. Edin.
                     To Richard Taylor, Esq.
      MY          SIR,
I
            DEAR
     OBSERVE       in the Number of the British Quarterly Re
      view  just published, a paragraph containing some very
unfounded and unjust assertions respecting the discussion
which took place some years ago on the subject of the disco
very of the composition of water. The following is the para
graph in which these assertions are contained:—
    “Sir David Brewster afterwards took up the subject (Edin.
Review, No. 142), and endeavoured to mediate between the
contending parties, but to little purpose. For he chose to con
sider it as a question of national honour, involving the rival
claims of Cavendish the Englishman and Watt the Scotch
man, and whilst he was willing to divide the merit between
them, assigned to his countryman the lion's share.”
    Without questioning the author's courtesy in attaching my
name to an anonymous review, when his object was to injure
my character and wound my feelings, I have no scruple in
giving the most pointed contradiction to every statement and
every insinuation contained in the preceding paragraph.           I
use the word insinuation, because it is impossible to read the
paragraph in question without perceiving, in the language
employed, even if that language had been the vehicle of truth,
the reviewer's desire to infuse into his statement a bitter per
sonality. But the assertions of the British Quarterly reviewer
are equally offensive with the language which conveys them.
He charges me, by name, with having decided a great scien
tific question, interesting to the whole civilised world, from
motives of national feeling,     with sacrificing by a temporising
verdict Cavendish the     Englishman     to Watt the Scotchman,—
and, under the pretence of dividing the merit, with assigning
to my countryman the lion's share.
    Were I to seek an apology for these unfounded aspersions,
I  should conjecture that the author had not read the review
which he thus misrepresents, for the very reverse of every
statement which he makes is true.         In place of dividing the
merit of the discovery between the Englishman and the
Scotchman, and giving the lion's share to my countryman,          I
have given the whole merit of the discovery to Cavendish the
Englishman, and have reserved only for Watt the Scotch
man, the merit of the previous hypothesis,          a merit freely
given him by Cavendish himself, and one which no other
person ever claimed.

196         On the Discovery              of the Composition of Water.
           of these assertions, I refer to the following passages
     In proof
in the Edinburgh   Review.
   “Mr. Watt felt a just indignation at the idea suggested by
Deluc, of his not claiming the merit which belonged to his hy
pothesis; but we are sure that his astonishment would be
equal to ours, were he to learn that that hypothesis had been
made to supersede and cast into oblivion the grand experi
mental discovery of Cavendish. The great merits of these two
great men are fortunately not in collision.              Mr. Watt will
for ever enjoy the honour of that singular sagacity which pre
sented to him the hypothesis of the composition of water; and
Cavendish will never lose the glory which belongs to him, of
having given that hypothesis, whether he was cognisant of it or
not, the force and stability of truth.”                           If
                                                   the reviewer should
perceive any ambiguity in these expressions when standing
alone, he will find their meaning amply explained in previous
parts of the Review, and especially in the following expres
sion:—“The glory of having discovered the composition of
water, that     is, having established
                        of                           physical truth, &c.

&c.”   I  have likewise  stated, that “Mr. Watt never pretended
to  have discovered the composition              water;” and   of   little                     a
further on    I  add, that “as Mr. Watt never wrote another
word     on the subject, nor made        single experiment after his
                                                    a
paper (the paper containing his hypothesis) was printed, how
      possible    identify this hypothesis with the discovery                                      of

    “We     have copied the preceding statement as that of Mr.
 Watt's friends, but a regard for the reputation of Mr. Caven
dish, independent of higher motives, compels us to acknow
ledge that the statement is partial, and the argument not well
founded. We are not able, at present, to refer to the original
documents, but we had occasion, some years ago, along with
a distinguished chemist (Dr. Hope), to examine them with
minute attention; and it was then our decided conviction,
that the merit of the discovery of the composition of water be
longed to Mr. Cavendish.”—Edin. Encycl., vol. xviii. p. 786.
    These observations will,         I   trust, convince every candid
reader that the reviewer's charges against me are utterly
groundless.       Although Mr. Watt was my countryman, and
my personal friend and correspondent; although I cherished
for him the warmest affection, and admired him as one of the
greatest and best men of his age, I have at three different
times of my life come to the decision that he was not, and
that Cavendish was the discoverer of the composition of water.
Had I been disposed to sacrifice truth, under the influence of
national and personal feelings,            I  might have found a safe
shelter behind the broad shield of M. Arago and Lord
Brougham's authority, and would thus have avoided the an

    XXX.       Observations on Osone as compared to Chlorine.
                 By Professor SchoeNBEIN of Basle.
   To the Editors     of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
MANY            properties, and the most essential ones belonging
          to ozone, are so similar to those possessed by chlorine,
that  I was led to suspect ozone to be a simple halogenous            body
like chlorine”. My more recent researches having rendered it
highly probable, if not altogether certain, that ozone is a pe
culiar compound of hydrogen and oxygen, I can no longer
maintain my former view, and we must place ozone far away
from chlorine, in case we regard, according to the established

theory of the day, the latter body as an elementary one. The
elementary nature of chlorine having, however, by no means
been proved by any decisive fact, and it being well known that
all the reactions produced by that body can be accounted for
by the theory of Berthollet, just as well as by the hypothesis
set up by your illustrious countryman, it seems to me that the
existence of ozone ought to induce chemists to reconsider the
two once-rival theories, and make them the subject of a very
close examination.
   It was chiefly from reasons of theoretical simplicity and
analogies, that chemists were determined to give up the old
theory and adopt the new one, cyanogen forming with mer
cury a compound similar to that produced by chlorine with
the same metal; cyanogen constituting with oxygen and hy
drogen two acids bearing some analogy to the chloric and
hydrochloric acids, the readily oxidable carbon remaining,
even at the highest temperature, inactive towards chlorine, the
muriatic acid of Berthollet having never been isolated, and
the views of Davy offering a very great facility in explaining
the reactions of chlorine; these were the reasons which induced
chemists to abandon the old theory and admit the present one.
In doing so they sacrificed a sum of analogies much larger
than that on account of which the new hypothesis was adopted.
The numerous class of muriatic salts that bear so close an
analogy to what we call oxy-salts, could no longer be parallel
ed to the latter; nay, on account of the striking resemblance
existing between those two classes of salts, chemists saw them
selves, as it were, forced to change the views they had for
merly taken of the oxy-salts and oxy-acids, and imagine a
great number of compound halogenous bodies being, as to
their chemical character, similar to chlorine and cyanogen.
But up to this present moment not one of those imagined ha
logenous bodies has yet been produced in an isolated state, any
more than the anhydrous muriatic acid of Berthollet.       It ap
pears, therefore, that there are at least as many arbitrary and
hypothetical notions mixed up with the modern views as there
were in the old theory, and that in this respect Davy's idea
does not offer peculiar advantages over that of Berthollet.
    Before entering into an appreciation of both rival theories,
I  shall take the liberty to point out once more the very great
similarity existing between the properties of ozone and chlo
rine.
    1. Though we are not yet acquainted with ozone in        pure   its
condition, we nevertheless know that        the common tempera
                                               at
ture  it exists    ingaseous state like chlorine.

                                            odour very similar            to
that     of
         chlorine, bromine and iodine.

     3. Ozone, like the three last-named bodies, enjoys the power
of negatively polarizing gold and platinum.
   4. Ozone, like chlorine, is absorbed at the common tempe
rature by most metallic substances.
   5. Ozone, like chlorine, is readily taken up by phosphorus
at the common temperature, causing at the same time a disen
gagement of light and some heat.
   6. Ozone, like chlorine, is absorbed by iodine.
   7. Ozone, like chlorine, very easily unites with olefiant gas,
producing a compound which seems to be analogous to the
chloride of hydrocarbon.
   8. Ozone, like chlorine, has the power of decomposing sul
phuretted hydrogen, and other compounds of hydrogen simi
larly constituted.
         .
   9. Ozone, like chlorine, transforms sulphurous acid into
sulphuric acid.
   10. Ozone, like chlorine, decomposes the iodide of potas
sium and the ferro-cyanuret of the same metal.
   11. Ozone, like chlorine, being placed in contact with the
protoxides of a number of metals, converts them into the cor
responding peroxides.         The protoxides of lead, manganese
and           for instance, are transformed into the peroxides
both by ozone and chlorine.
   12. Ozone, like chlorine, discharges the colour of many
sulphurets, for instance, that of the sulphurets of lead and an
timony.
   13. Ozone, like chlorine, destroys completely, and with
great energy,           all
                     the vegetable colouring matters.
   14. Ozone,    like chlorine,      readily taken
                                            is               variety      up   by
                                                                                a
of other  organic   substances,  for instance,    the ligneous     by
                                                               ones,
albumen, fibrine, caseous matter, &c.
   15. Ozone,        finish the comparison, being inhaled, causes
                        to
catarrhal  affections,    very similar     those produced
                                                     to        chlo                  by
rline,
   Now,      as   there can    be   hardly any doubt that the reactions
just mentioned are due         part to               of
                                        the oxygen contained
ozone, and         as
                there     not one
                              is  single  fact known which                                 irin

reconcilable      Berthollet's theory, we must think
                    to                                         least            it   at
possible that the chemical effects produced           chlorine may       by
also depend  upon  the  oxygen  supposed         contained     oxy
                                                              to   be                in

may add,       by               appreciated  fact, that free    iso                   or

to mind certain acids and peroxides.         Half the oxygen con
tained in chromic acid exhibits such a     high degree of chemical
excitement, that at the common temperature it sets on fire,
not only aether and alcohol, but also ligneous substances, as
paper and wood; whilst under the same circumstances, free
oxygen does not act at all, or at any rate very slowly upon
the above substances.        Nitric acid offers a similar instance;
and the peroxides of lead and manganese being put in contact
with a solution of indigo, destroy, like chlorine, that colour
ing matter; and the same peroxides, when brought into the
presence of a solution of iodide of potassium, eliminate iodine.
 But the most striking instance of the exalted oxidifying power
of latent oxygen we have in ozone itself. The affinities of free
oxygen are generally called forth by the agency of heat, so
that at the common temperature even potassium is not acted
upon by oxygen, if the latter happens to be completely an
hydrous.
     Starting from the hypothesis of Berthollet, according to
which chlorine is composed of muriatic acid and oxygen, we
 can easily conceive why chlorine at the common temperature
 acts upon so great a number of oxidable substances.            The
 oxygen being latent in chlorine, is in a state of great chemical
 excitement, similar to that in which the same element exists
 in ozone, chromic acid, nitric acid, the metallic peroxides,
 &c.; and in which state oxygen is so very apt to unite, even
 at the common temperature, with most of the oxidable mat
 ters.  If   these substances happen to be of such a kind as to
 combine readily in their oxidized condition with the muriatic
 acid of the older chemists, which is the case with hydrogen,
 phosphorus, sulphur, and the greater part of the metals,
 that circumstance must prove an additional reason why, in
 most instances, oxymuriatic acid acts at the common tempe
 rature upon those bodies. There are two facts that have, as
 already observed, much contributed to set aside Berthollet's
 views, and gain to oxymuriatic acid the reputation of being a
 simple body.       Those facts are, the chemical inactivity exhi
  bited  by  chlorine towards carbon, and the discovery of cya
  nogen.     As to the difficulty arising out of the first fact, it is
  easily removed by admitting that anhydrous muriatic acid
  unites only in one proportion with carbonic acid to form what
  Davy called phosgene gas, and that there does not exist a
 compound consisting of muriatic acid and carbonic oxide.
  These suppositions, taken together with Berthollet's view, ac
  cording to which muriatic acid cannot be obtained in an iso
  lated state, satisfactorily account for the inactivity alluded    to.
  Giving anhydrous muriatic acid the sign M,          we
                                                       must consider

duce CO+ M, but no such compound existing, according to
our supposition, chlorine does not act upon carbon.    C with
2M +O could form     CO,--2M,    but no such compound like
wise existing, only CO2+M could be produced; but we easily
see thatin such a case M would consequently be        liberty,                                         set   at

 must be taken for M+HO.         This view of the nature of cya
nogen offers, in my opinion, the advantage of assigning a
similar constitution to two bodies, being, as to their chemical
 bearings, so very like each other, whilst the established theory
is forced, in spite of that similarity, to consider one of those
bodies as an elementary substance, and the other as a com
pound consisting of principles which differ from chlorine as
much as night from day.
       If
       we compare the compounds which oxygen forms with
elementary bodies with the compounds which chlorine pro
duces with the same substances, we cannot but be struck by
the similarity existing between both series as regards the
ratio in which the equivalents of their constituent parts are
united.              If
             we except the bromides, iodides, and, to a certain
extent, the sulphurets, there are, to my knowledge, no other
sets of compounds that bear, with respect to the relation                                              al
luded to, so close an analogy to each other as the oxides and
chlorides do. That similarity loses, however,        peculiar cha                  its
racter so soon as we admit the correctness of the old views.

substances. Let us take         potassium   for an instance; ozone is
readily taken up by that metal, hydrate of potash being pro
duced, as potassium is transformed by chlorine into a muriate
of potash; in one case the metal unites with the oxygen of
ozone, in the other with that of chlorine; and in one instance
water unites with the base, and in the other muriatic acid.
The latter being a strong acid completely neutralizes the basic
properties of potash, whilst water, on account of                being                          its           a

      The electro-chemical system,                            as established by Berzelius,
 places oxygen at the head of what are called the electro-ne
 gative elements, and puts chlorine in a positive relation to that
 body.      It is however a well-known fact, that in a great num
 ber of   cases,   chlorine, with respect to                            its
                                                      electro-negative acti

potash, comes from the oxygenized muriatic acid, and not
from the potash; and the decomposition                        the former            of                         is
effected         by

   The    apparatus   exhibited before the Association consisted
of a  brass paddle-wheel working horizontally          can     water.             in   a             of

weights, pulleys, &c., exactly in the manner described in a
previous paper*.
   The paddle moved with great resistance in the can of water,
so that the weights (each of four pounds) descended at the
slow rate of about one foot per second. The height of the
pulleys from the ground was twelve yards, and consequently,
when the weights had descended through that distance, they
had to be wound up again in order to renew the motion of the
paddle. After this operation had been repeated sixteen times,
the increase of the temperature of the water was ascertained
by means of a very sensible and accurate thermometer.
    A series of nine experiments was performed in the above
manner, and nine experiments were made in order to elimi
nate the cooling or heating effects of the atmosphere.      After
reducing the result to the capacity for heat of a pound of
water, it appeared that for each degree of heat evolved by the
friction of water, a mechanical power equal to that which can
raise a weight of 890 lbs. to the height of one foot, had been
expended.
    The equivalents I have already obtained are, -1st, 823 lbs.,
derived from magneto-electrical experimentst; 2nd, 795 lbs.,
deduced from the cold produced by the rarefaction of airf; and
3rd, 774 lbs. from experiments (hitherto unpublished) on the
motion of water through narrow tubes. This last class of expe
riments being similar to that with the paddle-wheel, we may
take the mean of 774 and 890, or 832 lbs., as the equivalent
derived from the friction of water. In such delicate experi
ments, where one hardly ever collects more than half a degree
of heat, greater accordance of the results with one another
than that above exhibited could hardly have been expected.
I  may therefore conclude that the existence of an equivalent
relation between heat and the ordinary forms of mechanical
power is proved; and assume 817 lbs., the mean of the results
of three distinct classes of experiments, as the equivalent, until
still more accurate experiments shall have been made.
   Any of your readers who are so fortunate as to reside amid
the romantic scenery of Wales or Scotland, could, I doubt
not, confirm my experiments by trying the temperature of the
water at the top and at the bottom of a cascade.    If my views
be correct, a fall of 817 feet will of course generate one de

                                                                                                 I
was       follows:—I have bottle with
          as                                   a   stopper, which when

         Measuring the Water of Crystallization of Salts.       211
full contains exactly 500 grains of pure water at the tempe
rature of 60°F. I balance it on a pair of scales, then take a
solution of the salt made by heating water with more than it
can dissolve, allow it to cool to the required temperature, so
that it may be perfectly saturated, and fill the bottle exactly
half-full of the solution.    The bottle being half-full is then
balanced on a pair of scales, and filled up to the stopper
with the salt well-dried and in fine powder: it is then care
fully weighed again, and this weight, minus the weight of the
former additions, is divided by 250, which gives the specific
gravity   of the salt.   The reason   I divide by 250, is because
the bottle will hold 500    grains volume of pure water; there
fore if it be half-full of solution and half-full of salt, 250 will
equal the volume of that salt compared to an equal volume of
water; so that if a saturated solution, alcohol, aether, or any
other fluid, be poured into the bottle till half-full, there will
be a bulk which will equal 250 grains of pure water.
   On referring to Dr. Ure's Dictionary of Chemistry,       I found
several of the specific gravities of the salts used in my expe
riments, and these agreed almost exactly with the results as
determined by the above method, though I afterwards found on
repeating the experiments, some of the others, especially the
hydrous salts, to be incorrect.     Thus, according to my expe
riments, I found the specific gravity of nitrate of potash to equal
2:075, while the specific gravity of the same salt, according to
Dr. Ure, was 2-073, and several of the others agreed almost
as closely; I therefore inferred that the preceding method
Was COrrect.
   It is important to use a saturated solution of the substance,
                                                       I
the specific gravity of which is to be taken; for as afterwards
found, there was generally a certain condensation or expan
sion when a salt dissolved.      For if pure water be employed,
or any fluid that will partially dissolve the substance when put
into the bottle, there will be an erroneous result of the expe
riment, amounting in cases where there is a condensation to
a greater specific gravity than the truth, and where there is
an expansion to a less. Thus on dissolving 100 grains nitrate
                 -
of potash in 500 grains water, I found the specific gravity of
º
the solution to      1:1100, while the calculated specific gravity
equalled 1-0944, for 100 grains nitrate, specific gravity 2-074,
        48.21 grains of pure water bulk for bulk, and 500 grains
of water equal 500. Therefore
                       100 + 500 = 600 for the weight,
which divided by 48-21 + 500 =548.21 for the bulk of water,
gives 1-0944 as the specific gravity of the solution. But since
when 100 grains of nitrate of potash are dissolved in 500 grains
                                 P2

212      Mr. S. Holker on Dr. Dalton's                        new Method    of
water, there is a decrease of volume amounting to 6:22 grains
by measure; therefore the preceding way of calculating the
specific gravity, when the quantity of water and nitrate are
known, will be incorrect, as there is no allowance made for the
condensation which takes place when the nitrate dissolves.
   The following formula will give the solution to this calcu
lation.   Let r = the specific gravity of the solution; W =
the weight of salt; w = the weight of water; V = the volume
of salt; v = the volume of water; and C = the volume of con
densation. Then r =
                           W -- w
                        V + p     C          –
                                          the specific gravity of
                                                     T
the solution.
   Thus if 100 grains nitrate of potash, specific gravity 2:074,
be dissolved in 500 grains water, required the specific gravity
of that solution. Now it is known by experiment, that when
100 grains of the nitrate dissolve in 500 grains water, there is
a condensation of 6.22 grains by measure.        Therefore
               *     -   100 + 500
                   48.21 + 500       6.22
                                               -
                                                 –
                                                              -
                                           = 1 107, the required
specific gravity; and as this calculated specific gravity differs
only
       in      parts from that obtained by experiment,                       I    think
it goes far to prove that there is generally a certain conden
sation or expansion when a salt dissolves, though not in the
proportion Dr. Dalton has given.
   In order to find the amount of condensation or expansion
when a salt dissolves, the specific gravity is first ascertained
as accurately as possible, and after this the increase of volume,
when a certain quantity is dissolved in the water contained in
the bulb and stem of the apparatus.       From these two known
quantities, the increase of volume more than that occasioned
by the volume of the salt, or, as I call        the expansion   it,
                                                                                      of or or
the decrease     of
                 bulk less than that indicated       the volume        by
the condensation, may              be
                             calculated.   Thus      100 grains        if
nitrate  of potash, specific gravity 2-074,       dissolved    430be             in

mark     41.99 grains, the condensation        this case will equal
6:22 grains     by
                 measure, for 100 grains      the nitrate

relation which appears to exist in some of the salts might be
 brought to coincide much more perfectly than it does at pre
sent; but as this paper is designed only as an introduction to
a research which at a future time I hope to complete in a more
satisfactory manner,                I
                            have merely stated the direct results of
experiments without obtaining data requisite for allowances,
 which hereafter I might find to be incorrect.
    To ensure accuracy in the above experiments, it was neces
sary to obtain the various kinds of salts perfectly free from
impurity, and having analysed some of them, they were found
to contain the same quantity of acid, base and water, as indi
cated by Dr. Turner's Chemistry; and most of the others
being tried with the several tests for impurity in such salts,
were found to contain no appreciable quantity.             The way                                      I
calculate the amount of condensation occasioned         by a salt made
anhydrous combining with the requisite portion of water of
crystallization, is as follows:—
    Let w = the amount of condensation occasioned by the an
hydrous salt.
    W = the weight of crystallized salt.
    V = the volume of crystallized salt.
    C = the condensation resulting from the solution of the
crystallized salt.
    B = the weight of the water of crystallization.
    E = the increase of volume that the salt deprived of water                               its
of  crystallization occasions       solution.   in

isomorphous salt may contain a small quantity of another salt
of the same class combined with it; and if so, the separation
of these by crystallization will be exceedingly difficult, if not
impossible.   The ordinary reagents do not show one of two
isomorphous salts in the same solution when the other is pre
sent in great excess, though the greatest source of error ap
pears to be in the quantity of water influencing the condensa
tion produced by each salt which is not dissolved in atomic
proportion.
   On continuing this research on the increase or diminution
of volume, I found that a chloride, iodide, or sulphuret of a
metal, or by the other nomenclature, the hydrochlorate, &c.
of the oxide of a metal, when dissolved in water occasioned a
condensation, while the hydrochlorate of ammonia caused an
expansion; and if this line of demarcation could have been
established, it would have given rise to one of the most import
ant laws in chemical science.       For when hydrochloric acid is
added to the oxide of a metal, “for instance soda,” we do not
know whether, in the presence of water, a chloride of the metal
is formed or the muriate of soda; though the muriate of am
monia is considered by some to be a chloride of ammonium,
                                                        of is,
yet the theory now generally adopted             that when muriatic
acid unites with ammonia, the muriate           ammonia       formed;      is
and when the same acid unites with           metallic oxide,
                                                   a             forms          it
a  chloride; and   as   the hydrochlorates expand while the chlo
rides contract, we may infer that salt, the acid
                                             a            which con   of
tains  hydrogen,     expands      solution,
                                   in         while the haloid salts
contract; the combination               of
                                     the hydracids with ammonia
thus forming muriates, &c., and              of
                                        the same acids with metallic
oxides, forming chlorides, iodides, &c.

should then have    a   ready and easy way        distinguishing be

muriates expand while the chlorides contract, the various com
binations    of  chlorine and muriatic acid following the same
order, we should then, perhaps, have had               opportunity

zation would have been almost as interesting as the one show
ing the difference between the muriates and chlorides, if they
could have been both established, as then we should have had
a much more convenient way of measuring the water of cry
stallization than making an analysis, which, perhaps, would
be very complicated, and therefore much more liable to error.
    From the experiments contained in this paper, I think the
following conclusions may be drawn:—
    First, that when a salt dissolves in water, there is sometimes
a condensation and sometimes an expansion of the original
volume of the salt and water.
    Secondly, that the application of heat and the quantity of
water make a certain difference in the amount of condensa
tion or expansion resulting from the solution of a salt.
    Thirdly, that in the case of the isomorphous salts especially,
 when a class of them dissolve, they occasion an expansion or
condensation in a multiple ratio of the increase or diminution
of volume occasioned by the several atoms of those salts; and
that when a class of hydrous isomorphous salts made anhy
 drous combine with their requisite portion of water of cry
 stallization, the condensation then occasioned is also in a mul
 tiple ratio.

   1845.    A    PAPER was read by Mr. Lyell, “On the Miocene
                   Tertiary Strata of Maryland and Virginia, and
 North and South Carolina.”
    These rocks of the middle tertiary period are chiefly exhibited
 between the hill country and the Atlantic, and form a band of low
 and nearly level country, almost 150 miles wide, and not 100 feet
 high. They are assumed to belong to this period, because they are
 seen resting on the eocene deposits, and exhibit about the same pro
 portion of recent species.   The United States miocene beds consist
 chiefly of incoherent sand and clay, and the sandy beds, otherwise
 barren, have often been fertilized by the use of shell marl.   In the
 suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, there is however a remarkable bed
 of siliceous sand, derived from the cases of infusorial animalcules.
 The paper was accompanied by comparative tables and lists of the
 fossils.
    A paper, also by Mr. Lyell, “On the White Limestone and
  other Eocene Tertiary Formations of Virginia, South Carolina and
  Georgia.”
     The eocene beds extend chiefly to the south of the miocenes de
  scribed in the foregoing paper, and are very widely spread in the
  Southern States on the shores of the Atlantic. The mineral character

   of the  beds in the north is so like that      of the cretaceous series, that
   were it not for the     fossils, they  might   readily be mistaken; but to
   wards the south a new mineral         type  is put on, and the rocks consist
   of  highly  calcareous white marl and white limestone.           In point of
  fact, there seems to be as great a chasm between the cretaceous rocks
   and the tertiaries in America as in Europe.
      A second part of Mr. Lyell's paper gave an account of a series of
  rocks, called in America the Burr-stone, a siliceous rock, containing
  fossil sponges, and belonging, it would seem, to the upper division of
  the eocene period.
      March 12.—A communication was read by Prof. Sedgwick, “On
  the Comparative Classification of the Fossiliferous Slates of North
  Wales, with the corresponding deposits of Cumberland, Westmore
  land and Lancashire.”
      The object of the author in this memoir was to give a general ac
  count of the Silurian rocks of the lake district of the North of En
  gland, comparing them with those of North Wales, so far as he had
  hitherto investigated the subject. In both there appears to be a se
 ries extending through the various members of the Silurian rocks.
  In the lake district, the Lower Silurian rocks are imperfectly seen,
 and are not more than 300 or 400 feet thick, the Ash Gill beds being
 the highest; but the Upper Silurians are admirably shown, and con
 tain characteristic fossils.       Of these latter, the Coniston limestone
 and the Coniston      flags  form an important group as much as 1200 or
  1400 feet   thick,  and    correspond    with the Denbigh flags of North
 Wales and the Wenlock shale and limestone of the Silurian system.
 The Ireleth slate and grits succeed and occupy a considerable space,
 and must be of very great thickness. These higher beds in Cumber
 land abound with Terebratula Navicula, but above them are remark
 able bands with Asterias, while the upper portion is full of fossils,
 the prevailing type of which is Upper Ludlow.
    April 2.—A paper was read by Mr. Austen, “On an Aérolite
said to have fallen near Lymington, Hants.”
    A paper was also read by Capt. Bayfield, R.N., “On the Junction
of the Transition and Primary Rocks of Canada and Labrador.”
    April 16.—A paper was read by Mr. Macintosh, “On the Sup
posed Evidence of the former existence of Glaciers in North Wales.”
    Mr. Macintosh combated the opinion of Dr. Buckland as to the
origin of scratches and grooves on various rocks, referring these ap
pearances, in many cases, to structural phaenomena.
    April 30.—A paper was read by Mr. Murchison, “On the Palae
ozoic Deposits of Scandinavia and the Baltic provinces of Russia,
and their relations to Azoic or more ancient crystalline rocks, with
an account of some great features of dislocation and metamorphism
along their northern frontiers.”
    In this paper Mr. Murchison gave a general outline of the result
of his recent examination of Northern Europe, and the conclusions
to which he has arrived, chiefly with reference to the classification
of a large tract of country before undescribed on a large and compre
hensive scale.

rather be of the Permian than the true Carboniferous period.

    May 28.—A communication was read, “On the Geology of Lycia.”
By Prof. E. Forbes and Lieut. Spratt, R.N.
    The authors stated, that the rock forming the greater part of Lycia
consists of the scaglia, or Apennine limestone, a series not very di
stinctly defined, and that near the river Xanthus another rock of
greenish sandstone, whose age was not determined, rested conform
ably on the scaglia.        In other places, true tertiary beds, both marine
and    freshwater,   overlie the scaglia; and of these the marine are the
most     ancient,  and,  from the fossils which occur in the different beds,
they are found to be            all   of
                                 the same age. The authors then described
the districts        which the tertiary marine beds appear, some
                     in                                                      them      of

 Baron Leopold von Buch,     “On a new family of Crinoidal Animals,
 called Cystideae.”
    The stony cases of these animals differ from Encrinites chiefly in
 the absence of arms and the presence of ovarial apertures in the
 plates. They are found abundantly in the lower beds of the Silurian
 series, chiefly in Scandinavia.
    A paper was read, “On the Relation of the New Red Sandstone
to the Carboniferous Strata in Lancashire and Cheshire.”        By E.
W. Binney, Esq.
    The author endeavoured to show that the Lancashire coal-field, al
though of great thickness, does not exhibit a passage upwards into
the new red sandstone, but that it is a more perfect series than that
in the west of Yorkshire and Derbyshire. He also supposes that the
coal-measures are generally thrown down by the various faults, the
dislocation being of some extent; that these measures continue un
altered beneath the upper beds; and finally, that the lower portions
of the new red sandstone are but imperfectly exhibited in the coal
field in question.

proper motion of the primary of each system is given with care.

research and literary history, and the work is likely to prove ex

troduced that method of determining the elements of their orbits
which is yet probably the best that exists.                  A Struve has filled
volumes with the records of the observations made with the magni
ficent instruments at his command. Compared with these, the ad
ditions made by others to the theory or to the observations appear
small. Yet it would be unjust to omit mention of the labours of
Savary on the theory, and of those of South, Dawes, Bessel, and
Mädler on the observations. To these names we can now add that
of one whose labours place him in a higher position, the name of
Smyth.
    I may perhaps for a moment quit the scientific part of this notice
to remark that this science is in                          its
                                                origin and principal advances
essentially English, and that by far the greater part                     the work              of
done upon        has been done by private and not by official observers.

servations, like those of double stars, requiring little calculation, but
demanding peremptorily the most complete devotion of time and
energies when favourable states of the air occur, are likely always to
be better carried on by private observers than by official astronomers.
I might state, that the regular observer, when wearied with five hours'
calculation in the forenoon, is not likely to seize upon that precious
sky which sometimes suddenly presents itself in the evening, and to
continue his observations till dawning day terminates them. I might,
on the other hand, explain that private observers can seldom under
take the masses of calculation which are incidental to meridional ob
servations.      But I shall remark no further on this than to observe
that, in the instance of the double-star observations before us, as well
as in many of the others, discretion has been shown in the selection
of the subject as well as perseverance and skill in the pursuit of                                                      it.

 it is accuracy; comprising under this word the two different                                                       steps,
 of   exactness   in making observations, and certainty in transmitting
  them to the reader. And upon the importance of this accuracy, as
  contrasted with number or variety, I cannot express my opinion with
  sufficient strength.      It is matter of history that the establishment of
  the laws of Kepler, of the system of Copernicus, and finally, of the
  theory of gravitation, depended upon a discordance between the
  theory of that period and the observations amounting to eight
  minutes of arc. This was then a small quantity but certainly ap
 preciable, if the best instruments and best methods of the time were
 used.     Now, gentlemen, am I wrong in saying that the establish
 ment of a cosmical theory, infinitely more comprehensive and more
 important than that of gravitation, may depend upon the certainty
 of a measure to the tenth part of a second 2 I say, that it is more
 than possible; that it is highly probable; and that there is fair pro
 bability of         its
                   occurring within our time. Kepler                 similar occa    on   a

ing to the world the grounds of my general confidence in                the skill of the
observer. Still more, I wish that I could produce sufficient means for
estimating numerically the probable error of the observations, as af.
fected not only by personal sources of error, but also by the causes of
error which no skill can overcome. These remarks apply to the pro
bable exactness of the observation only. With regard to the certainty
of transmission to the reader, there is no sufficient security. The fair

remark, that the character of the Council is most deeply pledged in

deemed by such communication of the details of the observations as
will enable the Council to refer other inquirers to publications that

    October 28, 1844.—On the Foundation of Algebra, No.             IV.-
On Triple Algebra.      By Augustus De Morgan, Esq., of Trinity
College.
   The extensions which have successively been made in algebraical
interpretation have been consequences of efforts to interpret symbols
which presented themselves as necessary parts of the algebraical lan
guage which is suggested by arithmetic.       The now well-known sig
nification of a-H b v.– I did not yield any new imaginary or unex
plained quantities: and accordingly no effort (within the author's
knowledge) was made to produce an algebra which should require
three dimensions of space for its interpretation, until Sir William
Rowan Hamilton wrote a paper (the first part of which appeared in
the Philosophical Magazine” before the present one was begun) on a
System of Quaternions. This system, as the name imports, involves
four distinct species of units, one of which may by analogy be called
real, the three others being imaginaries, as distinct from one another
as the imaginary of ordinary algebra is from the real. These ima
ginaries are not deductions, but inventions; their laws of action on
each other are assigned: this idea Mr. De Morgan desires to acknow
ledge as entirely borrowed from Sir William Hamilton.
    Sir William Hamilton has rejected the idea of producing a triple
algebra, apparently on account of the impossibility of forming one in
which such a symbol as a #4 by + c, represents a line of the length
 w"(a^+b+cº). Mr. De Morgan does not admit the necessity of

interpreted.

 Infinite Angle. By the Rev. S. Earnshaw, of St. John's College.
     It has been usual with mathematicians to write zero as an equiva
 lent for both sin a and cosa when r becomes infinite.         The object
 of this paper is to examine into the propriety of this usage. The
 inquiry derives importance from its bearing on the general correct
 ness of Fourier's theorem for the transformation of functions, and
 from      its
            affecting the truth    many remarkable results

 on by Poisson, Fourier, Cauchy and others,          treating     periodic                         in                   of
 infinite series, are examined, and shown       be untenable    for exam                 to                         :

  The subject is further elucidated by the application of the remark
able symbol e'v'. I, a symbol which in geometry serves to indicate
the direction in which a line is drawn with respect to a given fixed
line; the same symbol is perfectly applicable as a sign of affection
for forces, and hence the conclusion is strengthened that the ground
of truth in the two sciences is the same.
   The reasoning of this paper extends not only to forces, but also
to velocities and moments, and to all expressions of whatever kind
of the pure ideas of magnitude and direction.
   If the author's reasoning be sound, the elementary propositions of
mechanics are necessary truths in as strict, in fact, in exactly the
same, sense as the elementary propositions of geometry; and to a
mind which dwells upon them, the truths of the one science ought
to appear in as axiomatic a light as those of the other.

   M. Claus states, that after an uninterrupted labour of two years'
duration, he has succeeded in obtaining the above metal, which he
had previously discovered, in a state of purity and by a simple pro
cess from the residues of platina.
   This metal has, however, as yet been obtained only in the state of
a gray powder, which is much lighter than iridium; and                       simple                its
and double chlorides strongly resemble those                   this metal. The    of

                                                strongly resembles that         po                       of
tassium and      ruthenium,    that M.    Berzelius,       whom M. Claus sent

withdrew this opinion, and considered this salt                   that        metal    as         ofa

   The characters              of

 addition of organic substances, such as alcohol, and also by the ac

of the oxide and potash; this is soluble in boiling hydrochloric acid,

is black with a tint of cherry-red; this, with the addition of a little
nitric acid, yields, when evaporated, extremely fine tints of colour;

                 ON OSMIUM AND ITS COMPOUNDS.
    M. Claus states, that from fifteen pounds of platina residue he
obtained nearly four ounces of metallic osmium.       During these ex
periments he states that he discovered previously to M. Fremy the
osmite of potash, but it was obtained by a different process.     It is a
very beautiful salt, which crystallizes in regular octahedrons of a
black, garnet, or rose-red colour.      The colour depends upon the
quickness of their formation. When formed slowly by gradual cool
ing in solutions which are not too much saturated, they are black,
the edges being transparent and of a garnet-red colour: if they are
quickly deposited from a saturated solution, they are garnet-red; and
if the separation of the salt be effected by agitation, the crystals are
pulverulent and of a rose-red colour. When reduced to powder, the         *
salt is almost white; it is KO-HOsO3 + Aq”.       It dissolves slowly in
water, imparting to it the same colour as manganesiate of potash.
The solution is partially decomposed by evaporation; free osmic acid,
OsO", is disengaged, and black oxide of osmium, OsO4 + Aq, is pre
cipitated; the liquor becomes strongly alkaline, and a part of the salt
crystallizes without decomposition; the decomposition occasioned
by evaporation may be prevented by adding great excess of potash
to the solution of the salt. Acids readily decompose the solution of
osmite of potash, yielding oxide of osmium and osmic acid: 2(OsO3)
produce OsO2+OsO4; this fact the author also states that he ob
served previously to M. Fremy.       The oxide has the remarkable pro
perty of decomposing with slight detonation when it is heated in a
glass tube into metallic osmium and osmic acid; 2(OsO4) yield
Os--OsO4.       Osmite of barytes, Ba04-OsO3+Aq, forms fine black
crystals with a diamond-like splendour; this salt is prepared by mix
ing a solution of osmic acid with excess of barytes water; the yellow
liquor deposits crystals at the expiration of a month; a large quan
tity of the salts of iridium was also obtained among other products
of the first fusion with nitre; among these were three ounces of a
salt which the author supposed to be a salt of iridium, but which he
afterwards found to be chloride of potassium and ruthenium.
    The author then attempted to obtain this new metal from the re
sidue which had been once heated to redness with nitre, and treated
with water and acid; the following process succeeded, and one ounce
and a half of the chloride of potassium and ruthenium was obtained
 by it:—equal parts of the residue and of nitre were heated to white
 ness for two hours in a Hessian crucible; the calcined mass was taken
by an iron spatula from the crucible while red-hot, and reduced when
 cooled to coarse powder. This was treated with distilled water, and        **.
 the mixture allowed to become clear by standing; this solution was
of a fine deep yellow colour, and water was added as long as it con
 tinued to dissolve. This solution contains rutheniate, chromate, and
silicate of potash, without any trace of rhodium or iridium, and only
 a slight one of osmiate of potash.     Nitric acid is to be cautiously
added to the solution till it ceases to be alkaline; this precipitates
a compound of oxide of ruthenium and potash, and a small quantity

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              233
of silicic acid, in the state of a velvet-black powder, and chromate of
potash remain in solution.        After washing the compound of potash
and oxide of ruthenium in hydrochloric acid, the solution is to be
evaporated until the silicic acid gelatinizes; it is then to be diluted
with water and filtered. The solution must not be evaporated to
dryness in order to separate the silica more perfectly, because in that
case the chloride of ruthenium is converted into an insoluble sub
chloride.
    The filtered solution is of a fine yellow colour, and is to     be re
duced to a small quantity and mixed with a concentrated solution of
chloride of potassium, there then separates the salt K Cl2 + Ru Cl",
in reddish-brown crystals. The liquor poured off from the crystals
furnishes afterwards much of this salt by evaporation; by repeated
crystallizations this salt is obtained in great purity.—Journ. de
Pharm. et de Ch., Juin 1845.
OBSERVATIONS         ON THE FOREGOING MEMOIRS.             By M. FREMY.
    The author remarks, that M. Claus alludes to some compounds of
osmium which he had obtained before him (M. Fremy). He further
observes, that before his paper on metallic acids appeared in the
Annales de Chimie, he had inserted in the Comptes Rendus de l'Aca
démie des Sciences and in the Journal de Pharmacie, extracts from his
researches on osmium, in which he stated the properties and compo
sition of the osmites.       M. Fremy therefore contends for the priority
of his experiments; he also observes that M. Claus represents the
osmites by OsO3, MO, which is the composition stated in his me
moir.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Juin 1845.
ExAMINATION OF SOME NATIVE AND ARTIFICIAL COMPOUNDS
            OF PHOSPHORIC ACID.           BY C. RAMMELSBERG.
                            [Continued from p. 158.]
                            Phosphate  of Magnesia.
    According to Graham's analysis, the salt which separates on mix
ing dilute solutions of sulphate of magnesia and phosphate of soda
contains 15 eq. of water, 8 of which are given off at 212°. The
 author examined the gelatinous precipitate which is formed in con
centrated solutions of these salts, and which differs from the former
 crystallized salt in containing less water.      After a portion had been
 washed in the cold and dried in the air, it lost 1-558, by remaining
 for some time over sulphuric acid it lost 0: 113, and on heating to
 redness 0-451; in all 0-567=36.2 per cent. The estimation of the
 magnesia showed that the salt was 2MgO, P, O, and that the amount
 of water it contained was almost accurately 7 eq. = 35.85 per cent. ;
 consequently this salt has the composition of that crystallized and
 dried at 212°. If the liquid which has been separated from the cry
 stals by filtration is allowed to stand, crystals of 2MgO, P, O, + 15HO
 form in it; if it be heated, it becomes turbid, and a flocculent sub
 stance is deposited, probably the tribasic compound.

   To test the accuracy of Riffault's statement, that the phosphate of
magnesia is decomposed by ebullition into an insoluble basic and a
soluble acid salt, a portion of the precipitate we have described, still
moist, was repeatedly boiled with water, the whole was filtered and
the residue washed with hot water. The filtrate was acid, contained
a considerable quantity of phosphoric acid, but little magnesia, and
did not yield any crystalline salt. The phosphate of magnesia is
thus decomposed by boiling with water into a basic salt and free
acid. The former when dried forms a white powder, and only differs
from the bibasic salt in being coloured yellow by salts of silver, after
having been heated to redness. 1.087 grim. of the substance dried
in the air lost by exposure to red heat 0:267; the residue, after
                                    -
being heated with carbonate of soda and washed, yielded 0-37 mag
nesia; consequently the salt is       3MgO, P, O,--5HO, and should
yield, according to calculation, 34.76 per cent. magnesia, 40.02
phosphoric acid, and 25-22 water.

   The author analysed a dark blue lazulite from the Fischbacher
Alp in the province of Gratz, and a bright blue spar from Krieglach
in Styria.    The specific gravity of the lazulite was 3.106–3. 123,
Fuchs found 3.057; that of the blue spar 3-021, according to Brandes
3:001; according to Klaproth 3-046. On account of the great diffi
culties presented in the analysis of these substances, the author, even
by repeating them several times, could not obtain results which
agreed perfectly. The mineral was heated to redness, to estimate the
quantity of water it contained: this caused the colour to change
from yellow to brown, resulting from the oxidation of the protoxide
of iron. The substance in fine powder was fused with carbonate of
soda and the mass decomposed by muriatic acid.         After separating
the silica, the acid solution was digested and boiled with concen
trated solution of potash in a platinum dish, which effected the solu
tion of the greater part of the alumina and phosphoric acid. The
phosphate of alumina was then thrown down by ammonia, from the
liquid acidified with muriatic acid;         its
                                          composition was ascertained

maining in the liquid was precipitated by chloride of calcium.    The
portion undissolved by the potash, which contained the oxide of iron,
lime and magnesia, with some alumina and phosphoric acid, was dis
solved in muriatic acid and precipitated by ammonia.
   This threw down everything except the greater part of the lime
and magnesia, which was separated from the filtered solution in the
ordinary way. The precipitate was heated to redness with carbonate
of soda, a little caustic potash being added, then exhausted with
water, and the solution treated in the same manner as the potash
solution obtained at first, to which it was added, whilst the residue,
dissolved in muriatic acid, yielded the amount of iron, lime, and mag
nesia. The following are the results of five analyses of lazulite and

 wavellite free from water and fluorine; consequently lazulite and
 blue-spar are the same mineral, and are only distinguished by the
 former containing a larger portion of protoxide of iron, which is iso
 morphous with the magnesia, hence also its darker colour.                   But as
 the protophosphate of iron is colourless, and the double salt only
 yields a blue colour with basic phosphate of iron, it is probable that

    This mineral, which was discovered by Breithaupt, and is found
 only in the granite of Penig (Chursdorf and Arnsdorf) and Zinnwald,
 is one of the rarest, and from its chemical composition, one of the
 most remarkable minerals.            Berzelius found 11 per cent. of lithia, as     -
 well as  phosphoric       acid and fluorine.     According to Plattner it also
 contains   soda,     tinging  the flame of the blowpipe yellow, so that the
 reaction of the lithia is barely perceptible.            Its specific gravity, ac
 cording to Breithaupt, is 3' 11.          After  making     many fruitless expe
riments the author         adopted   the following   method of analysis:—The
mineral, in fine powder, is heated with sulphuric acid in a platinum
vessel until the fluorine is driven off, the solution is diluted with
water and precipitated by ammonia; the alumina and part of the
phosphoric acid are thus thrown down, and the precipitate may be
decomposed by fusion with either carbonate of soda and silica, or
bisulphate of potash. The ammoniacal filtrate, which contains the
alkalies and the remainder of the phosphoric acid, is decomposed
with chloride of calcium to separate the latter, and the excess of
lime is afterwards removed by oxalic acid.               The alkaline sulphates
remaining after evaporation and heating to redness, are estimated by
first precipitating the potash by chloride of platinum; the weights
of the sulphate of lithia and soda are next estimated, and finally the
quantity of acid they contain. To ascertain the amount of fluorine,
the powder of the mineral was distilled with silica and sulphuric acid,
and the fluoride of silicium conducted into water, so that none of it
could escape. The fluid was supersaturated in a platinum dish with
pure carbonate of soda, boiled, and finally, after the escape of the
carbonic acid, precipitated by ammonia and chloride of calcium. The
analysis yielded the following results:—

    We cannot regard amblygonite              as a compound of fluoride of        li
thium and sodium with            phosphate    of alumina, because the amount
of fluorine is not sufficient to saturate the metallic bases of the alka
lies; consequently it must consist of phosphate of alumina and lithia
(soda), and fluoride of aluminium (sodium). Three-fourths of the

 fluorine belong to the aluminium, one-fourth to the lithium and so
 dium, thus in the proportion of 5 equiv. to 2 eq. In the remaining
 double phosphate the quantity of oxygen in the alumina is half as
 great as that in the phosphoric acid, that of the alkalies amounts to
 a third part of the former. Whilst the alumina of the phosphate
 contains five times as much oxygen as the aluminium of the fluoride
 which is converted into alumina, we thus obtain
                (5R, O 3P, O,4-5Al, O, 3P, O.) + (RF1 + 2A13FI)
 as the formula for amblygonite.
  It has been previously mentioned, that ammonia throws down
phosphate of alumina from the solution of the amblygonite in sul
phuric acid. The quantity in one experiment amounted to 68.33
per cent. of the mineral, and consisted of 31.71 phosphoric acid and
36-62 alumina, consequently it was 5A), Os3P, O, i.e. the same
phosphate as the formula requires.—Poggendorff’s Ann. lxiv. p. 251.

XXXV.  An Account of the Fossil Trees found at St. Helen's.
 By Edward WILLIAM BINNEY and Robert HARKNEss+.
                               [With two    Plates.]
          the beginning of August 1843, owing           to the ex
ABOUT
   cavations made in the White Grit Quarry             at Scotch
row, near St. Helen's, three almost perfect specimens of fossil
trees were discovered.
   At the Cork meeting of the British Association, Mr. Binney
gave a verbal account of the fossils, and in October of the
same year read a paper upon them before the Manchester
Geological Society, which was afterwards published in the
Philosophical Magazine for March of last year.
   The fossils, then laid bare only on their western side, were
found standing almost upright in a thick deposit of indurated
gray silty clay, locally known by the name of “warren,” which
lies immediately upon the white sandstone, which in this loca
lity is about ten yards thick, and which it is necessary to re
move before the white sandstone can be worked.         The whole
thickness of the    clay, as seen at this period, was about seven
yards, and the bases of the fossils were on an average about
eight feet above the white sandstone; above the clay there oc
curred a deposit of till, about seven feet in thickness, which
                            i.
appeared to cut off the upper portion of the trees;          whichall   of
stood        line running nearly north and south, and         right     at

intimation having previously been given to Dr. Buckland and
other geologists, that on that day the tree would be entirely
uncovered, in order to afford them an opportunity of seeing
the connection which subsists between Sigillaria and Stigmaria,
as shown by this plant.        Circumstances having, however,                                in
terfered to   prevent   several from availing themselves of the op
portunity, the only individuals who were present when the
tree was laid bare, with the exception of the workmen, were
the authors of this account.         The appearances on the eastern
side of the tree were     very  similar to those on the western: the
furrows and ribs were to a great extent the same, and at once
 identified the tree with Sigillaria, although no distinct scars
were noticeable.       Larger portions of the bark occurred on
this side than on the one laid bare two years previous.             One
of these near the top, in thickness from one-third to half an
 inch, was eight inches square, and another near the base was
 of still larger size. These patches of bark were marked by
 longitudinal fibrous lines, easily distinguishable to the eye,
 and similar to those which occurred upon the stem when de
 corticated, but of greater size.       The stem contained no inter
 nal cylinder, and       all   its

246   Messrs. E.   W. Binney   and   R. Harkness's Account of
the successful use of the pickaxe, so that none of them were
traced to their termination.
   All the roots were surrounded throughout their whole length
with a coaly bark, but like that which covered the stem, it ad
hered so firmly to the matrix, that in general, when the roots
were laid bare, they presented a decorticated appearance.
The upper surface of the decorticated roots was marked with
irregular and interrupted ribs and furrows, which diverged on
each side of lines parallel to the longitudinal axis of the root,
as observed in the fossil trees of Dixon Fold.      Several slight
depressions traversed the upper sides of the roots in a diagonal
direction to the ribs and furrows, these resembled impressions
produced by long grass-like fibres having laid upon the roots;
circular impressions occurred similar to those seen on the
large stems of Stigmaria.       From each of these impressions
issued the   long fibrous appendages   which have been termed
leaves. These fibrils were met with in the matrix all round
the roots, but they occurred much more abundantly on the
under than on the upper sides, and were in general less fre
quent on the higher parts. These appendages were cylindri
cal, and when not compressed, about a quarter of an inch in
diameter; their length must have been very great, for at the
distance of three or four feet from the root, they were not found
to decrease in thickness: they occur abundantly throughout
the whole depth of the warren, which is seventeen yards in
thickness, so that it is not improbable that these appendages
may be at least equal in length to those described by Mr.
Steinhauer.     These appendages were covered by a carbona
ceous   envelope, and some of them appeared to afford traces of
a small internal cylinder.
   The deposit all around the tree abounded in various coal
plants; these, for the most part, consisted of leaves of the Pe
copteris nervosa, sometimes adhering to their rachis, Calamites,
Asterophyllites, Lepidostrobus,      Lepidodendron, species of
Neuropteris and Cyclopteris. The Calamites appeared in great
abundance, and in several instances specimens were obtained
which appeared to have their bases in contact with the main
roots, before they assume the Stigmaria character, in such a
manner as almost to induce the observers to believe that they
had some intimate connection with the tree.
   In removing the encasing matter from the eastern side of
the large tree, another was discovered about five feet distant,
and due east from the large tree; occurring further on the dip
than the other, it appeared rather lower in position, but in
reality its base was about one foot six inches higher before
the strata were inclined. Of this tree only one foot seven inches

               the Fossil Trees              found at St. Helen's.                     247
of the   stem remained, which       at its base measured four feet
seven inches in circumference. As in the large tree, the whole
of the bark was converted into coal, about one-third of an inch
thick, which fortunately adhered to the stem instead of the
matrix much better than in any of the other trees, and there
                               .
fore showed the ribs and furrows of Sigillaria in a much more
perfect and distinct manner than the other individuals.            This
tree, which was cylindrical in shape, was of a softer nature
than the others, being composed of the indurated gray silty
clay which constituted the matrix.         Its base was a little con
cave, and from it sprung four slightly compressed roots, mea
suring one foot six              across at their origin.        On the
under side of each root in the middle, appeared a singular su
ture which ran under the base of the tree, and there uniting
formed a regular cross. The roots struck downwards almost
perpendicularly into the strata, and the whole tree bore great
resemblance to the molar teeth of a human being.               The ex
ternal surface of the roots was covered with a coaly envelope
much thinner than that which occurred upon the stem, and
was marked in a similar manner to the surfaces of the roots
of the large plant, except that it showed the raised circular
markings of Stigmaria and the diagonal depressions previously
alluded to running across their upper surfaces in a more pro
minent degree. The roots                     all
                                      proceeded downwards            the          to

roots, and which were           of

248         Messrs.    E. W. Binney and R. Harkness's Account of
the roots proceeded downwards, they increased in width, and
the spaces became narrower in consequence, until the roots
again rapidly narrowed and finally terminated.            The secon
dary roots also gave rise to secondary spaces; these com
menced about one foot three inches below the upper part of
the principal spaces; they were likewise rounded at their
upper extremities, but continued to increase in width as they
descended. These spaces were separated from each other by
the thickness of the secondary roots, which measured two feet
four inches.     At the distance of about seven inches below the
higher extremities of these secondary spaces, originated the
spaces caused by the bifurcation of the tertiary roots; these
were separated from each other at their origin by one foot four
inches, the breadth of the tertiary roots. In form these spaces
resembled those produced by the secondary roots, except                   in
creasing more rapidly in width as they descended. This uni
formity and regularity in the roots of this plant will be more
manifest by referring to Plate VI., which would represent the
roots if compressed; where A shows the main roots, A' the
principal areas, B the secondary roots, and B the secondary
areas, C the tertiary roots, and C the tertiary areas. This pe
culiar regular mode of rooting is most probably characteristic
of this genus of plants, and the various degrees of dichotomi
zation appear to result from a difference of age in the different
individuals.     Thus, in the small specimen found about five
feet east of the large one, there is seen only the four main
roots, which had not commenced bifurcating at their base.
    In the trees found at Dixon Fold, the same regular appear
ances are presented as in the large individual; and a Stigma
ria in the museum of the Leeds Philosophical Society affords
evidence of a similar regularity.

too highly eulogized, since every discovery connected with this
fossil renders the value of the description more appreciable.
     The authors of the Fossil Flora have represented, in the
31st plate of their valuable work, what they term a “nearly
perfect specimen” of Stigmaria.              This specimen, which was
obtained from the roof of one of the Newcastle coal seams,
shows only the under side; the central part, like the large tree
already described, was concave, “the whole surface being co
vered with wrinkles, which, when attentively examined, were
seen to be caused by depressed semicircular spots, compactly
arranged in a spiral manner, in the centre of which is a round
ish scar, to which a little fine coaly matter adheres.”               From
this centre the arms         radiate,  bifurcating    as  they  increase in
length, and becoming covered with the characteristic tuber
cles of Stigmaria, having fibrils attached as they receded from
the centre. Two other individuals occurred in the same roof,
 but the authors state “that the upper part of the centre itself
 was too much damaged to have                     its
                                            structure made out.” From
 an   examination   of  these specimens they were induced               con                   to
 clude “that     Stigmaria   was    prostrate
                                      a         land-plant,   the branches
of   which radiated regularly from common centre, and finally
                                                    a
 became forked.” What the nature                              of
                                                    this centre was, the
                    to      be
                             difficult     conjecture,   but they conceive
                                           its a a
 authors declare
it   to have been dome-shaped,           form which probably resulted
                                                   to
 from the plant growing upon             hillock. The succulent nature
of    Stigmaria they infer from          commonly occurring            com                in  a
 pressed state, and also from the eccentricity                 woody axis,         its
                                                                           to of
 when this   is   traceable, which also shows               have been it                           ofa
 dicotyledonous nature.
     From the great regularity              of
                                          the tubercles which cover the
 radiating portions       ofthe plant, the authors are led          suppose              to
 that    they  were the base          to
                                     which leaves were       attached,   and
 hence they reject the conclusion             Steinhauer, that they were
                                                        of
 the parts from whence the roots emanated. The same cir
 cumstance which led them               infer the succulency
                                           to                        the ra              of
 diating parts, viz. their compressed state, also induced them
 to   suppose that what they termed leaves were                similar cha   of    a
 racter.      From their examination                     of
                                               the whole characters, the
 authors came     to  the conclusion that the Stigmariae were allied
 to   the Euphorbiaceae          or
                                 Cacti.
      The reliance     onthe part          of
                                        these authors        the perfection  on
 of   their specimen,   which     appears      have been to sufficiently im
  perfect entirely   to  mislead them, has been the cause              many                   of
  errors having been propagated respecting Stigmaria.                     the                  In
                                                              as no
  first place,  there appears         to
                                    have been        evidence    upon  which
  they were able       to form any opinion               the nature   to  the                  of

250    Messrs. E.              W.   Binney and       R. Harkness's         Account       of
roots of their creeping plant, but on the contrary, the concave
base from whence the roots ought to have issued possessed                                     si
milar characters with the radiating stems; and with regard to
the leaves, these appear to have radiated from the so-called
stems, not only striking upwards and sideways, but also down
wards,-rather an extraordinary direction for the leaves of a
creeping plant to take. Then as regards the supposed dome
shaped summit, which they state to be much damaged, they
do not appear to have looked after any portion of it in the
roof from whence the plant fell. Altogether these plants ap
pear to have borne great resemblance to the base and roots of
the large tree at St. Helen's, which would most probably have
presented a perfect similarity, had the circumstances under
which it was first discovered been the same, viz. by excava
ting under       base, when the lower portion would most pro
                     its
bably have separated from the matrix,                   one    bythe jointsof

                               in

   Such are the two opinions which have been most currently
adopted, and which are still most generally entertained con
cerning the nature                  of

     Inthe year 1839, Mr. Binney,              company with several gen
                                                              in
tlemen, found some upright specimens                   Sigillaria reniformis
                                                                        of

                       a               coal   exposed

                             the North Midland         Railway     near Ches
terfield.    These were followed downwards until they became
Stigmaria, but there was some difficulty                  proving the absoof
lute insertion           of
                       one  plant   into the    other,      that             so

some doubt existed.
   From the present time,                      as by
                                       the discovery        the fossil tree  of                         at

                                                    to
tween Sigillaria and Stigmaria must                considered      be settled            as             in
favour       the opinion
            of                           of
                                the one being the stem and the other
the root       the same plant, justifying the conclusion formed
               of                                                                                       by
one    of the authors               of
                             this account         1839, and the inferences
                                                               in
afterwards drawn from an examination of their internal struc
ture      by   Brongniart.
     What may have                  been the foliage               of   Sigillaria, the authors,
from actual observation, are not prepared       say; but they                  to
consider    not improbable that Pecopteris nervosa, from
               it                                                                                       its
great abundance and                      its
                        peculiar character, may have been                                               in
timately connected with this plant.   This peculiar character
consists       in
            the absence    any midrib          of
                                           the leaflets, and            in                              in

252      Account            of the Fossil Trees found at St. Helen's.
 having several veins originating from the rachis, circumstances
 very different from those which prevail in true ferns, more
 particularly in the Pecopteris, and which appear to connect it
 with Odontopteris, a form very nearly allied to Otopteris, a
fossil of decided cycadeous type, occurring along with other
cycadeous forms in the Yorkshire oolite”.
    The roots of Sigillaria are more abundant than any other
remains which occur in the coal formation, and the smaller
fibrils abound to such a degree in coal floors, that it is scarcely
possible to obtain a hand specimen of one of them without
meeting with some trace of the rootlets of Stigmaria; and in
 most of the floors these roots are met with unassociated with
any other description of plant.
    This great abundance of the roots in floors, and the very
frequent occurrence of stems of Sigillaria in various states in
the coal deposits, would almost justify the supposition that this
plant had, by             an
                     destruction, formed the chief portion          our           of
coal seams,                 its
                    opinion which      further confirmed when we
                                                   is
remember that such portions          coal      of
                                              show traces    asinternal      of
organization have decidedly        gymnospermous character.

         upright position       many  of                of
                                          these stems also seems                           to
lead      the conclusion, that these trees have not been trans
ported        by
              the agency      water, but rather that they have pe
                                    of
rished        on
             the spot  where they originally grew, most probably
 by  some such cause
                                    as
                              subsidence

circumstance           probable that we owe the formation
                          it   is                                                     of   all
our coal deposits with floors containing Stigmaria.
   The external character, the internal structure, and all the
circumstances under which Sigillaria occur, render the sup
position that this plant was          partially aquatic nature, and
                                              of   a
required       watery habitat, exceedingly probable.

conclusion           as    to
                    the nature             of
                                  the habitat      which     grew and

        rara to an base,                of which he pointed out the
existence, in the bark of a tree of that colony known by the
names of Bebeeru or Green heart. This tree has recently been
examined botanically by Sir Robert Schomburgk, and found
to be a species of Nectandra, which in compliment to Dr. Rodie
he has named N. Rodiei (Hooker's London Journal of Botany,

                                                 in

 perties of an organic alkali. This is pure bebeerine, as de
 scribed in April 1843.
   Bebeerine thus obtained does not crystallize. It is very so
luble in alcohol, less so in aether, and very sparingly in water.
 Heated, it fuses; and the heat being continued it swells up,
giving off vapours of a strong peculiar odour, and burns with
out residue. Subjected to the action of oxidizing agents, it
gives with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid a black,
and with nitric acid a yellow resin.      It forms with acids salts

      XXXVII.       On the Spheroidal Condition   of Liquids.
                   By W. G. ARMSTRoNG, Esq.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
AT bridge,
        the recent meeting of the British Association at Cam
                 I had the pleasure of witnessing M. Boutigny’s
pleasing experiments on the spheroidal condition of liquids;
and since my return to Newcastle I have exhibited the same
experiments to the Philosophical Society of this town, accom
panied by explanatory observations, the substance of which       I
take the liberty of communicating to you for insertion in the
Philosophical Magazine.        This I am induced to do, not only
because   I  conceive that observations upon a subject so much
before the public as this is at present, are likely to be interest
ing to a considerable portion of your readers, but also because
the explanation of the phaenomena is still in some measure a
matter of controversy.
   Although M. Boutigny’s experiments embody no new dis
covery, yet they have the no small merit of showing in a stri
king and prominent manner, effects with which most persons
are in some degree acquainted, but which fail to excite atten
tion in consequence of the unattractive form in which they are
commonly observed.
   The fundamental experiment of the series consists in drop
ping water upon a metallic plate or dish to which heat is ap
plied.    If  the dish be heated to 212° or upwards, the water
immediately boils and is dissipated in vapour, provided the
temperature of the dish do not exceed a certain limit; but if it
do exceed that limit, then the condition of the liquid is en
tirely changed and the following effects may be observed:—
    1st. The ebullition of the water, instead of being accele
rated, is altogether prevented, and the evaporation is greatly
retarded.
   2nd. The water assumes a rounded or “spheroidal” form,
like a globule of mercury.
    3rd. The water does not touch the dish, being separated
from it by a thin interposing stratum of vapour.
    4th. The temperature of the water never rises above 205°
(96 centigrade), being 7° below the boiling-point.
    A tolerably correct idea may be formed of the spheroidal
condition of water by reference to the annexed diagrams.
 Fig. 1 represents a dish containing water in the spheroidal
form, and, by way of contrast, the diagram fig. 2 represents a
similar dish containing water which is not in the spheroidal
form.

ficiently hot to sustain water in the spheroidal state, it will still
be sufficiently hot to sustain spirit of wine in that state; and
again, when it is too cool for spirit of wine, it may still have
sufficient heat to produce the effect with aether.         On the other
hand, if the boiling-point of the liquid be higher than that of
water, then it is necessary to increase the temperature of the
dish, in order to produce the spheroidal state.           But whatever
the   boiling-point  of the  liquid   may  be,  the maximum tempe
rature it attains in the    spheroidal    form is always several de
grees below the temperature at which ebullition takes place.
    It is obvious, therefore, that the cause which limits the
temperature of the liquid spheroid, as well as that which oc
casions       separation from the heating surface, has
            its                                                  intimate        an

                                      the water before       comes into it

    The absence          ebullition, which also characterizes the
                            of of
spheroidal state       liquids,     plainly attributable
                                              is               the steam    to
 being enabled       escape from beneath the fluid without rising
                        to
 upwards through the mass; and the rounded form which the
 liquid assumes       simply owing
                        is                  there being to      adhesion     no

                                                    to
obeying the influence               of
                              their mutual attraction.
    With    regard     the fact that liquids
                         to                       the spheroidal state

 never attain, by several degrees, the temperature at which,
 under ordinary conditions, they would boil, the reason of this
 appears to me to be clearly explainable as follows:–
    Suppose heat to be applied to the dish represented in
 fig. 2, then the particles constituting the inferior surface
 of the liquid, being in contact with the dish, would abstract
Jrom the dish the heat which is taken up in the process of
 evaporation.     But when the liquid is in the spheroidal state,
 as represented in fig. 1, then the particles constituting the
 inferior surface of the fluid being separated from the heated
 dish, abstract the heat required to convert them into vapour,
 not from the dish, as in the other case, but from the rest of
 the liquid, with which alone they are in contact.        In other
 words, the cooling influence of evaporation is in the one case
 exercised upon the dish, and in the other case upon the liquid.
 Hence, therefore, a liquid in the spheroidal state never can
 attain the temperature at which it boils, because the more we
 increase the heating action of the dish, the more we also                                            in
 crease the cooling action of evaporation.
    This explanation is at variance with that propounded by
 M. Boutigny, who accounts for the comparatively low tempe
 rature of the liquid spheroid, by ascribing to it a power of                                         al
 most entirely reflecting heat from                         its
                                        inferior surface; but this
 hypothesis affords       explanationno                       of
                                           the relationship which
 unquestionably exists between the boiling-point         the liquid                   of

liquid is in the ordinary spheroidal state.            The reason of this
I   rendered     apparent    by first  heating   the water to the boiling
 point, and then immersing the red-hot platina, which in that
 case produced a rapid ebullition during the time that the metal
 remained incandescent and separated from the water by the
 usual atmosphere of steam.             The absence of ebullition in M.
 Boutigny's experiment is obviously therefore simply owing
 to the steam being condensed by the coldness of the water,
 as soon as it recedes beyond the influence of the heated
 platina.
     It is instructive also to observe the different effect produced
 by the partial and the total immersion of the red-hot platina
 in water heated to 205°, which it will be recollected is the
 maximum temperature that water acquires in the spheroidal
 state.    If the heated metal be only partially immersed, there
is no     ebullition,    and the temperature of the liquid remains
stationary; but if the platina be wholly sunk in the water, then
the temperature rises and ebullition takes place. The reason
of this difference is very evident: when the platina is not en
tirely covered by the water, the steam it produces has an out
let, and the conditions resemble those of water in the sphe
roidal state; but when the platina is submerged, the heated
steam is compelled to bubble up through the water, and
thereby not only produces ebullition, but also imparts in                                          its
passage additional heat            the liquid.

with the heated metal and causes             so sudden a production     of
steam as to burst the boiler.
    Ifeel, however, great difficulty in conceiving the possibility
of water within a steam-boiler existing in the spheroidal con
dition.   The coarse rough surface which the interior of the
boiler  presents to the water is extremely unfavourable to the
spheroidal state; and there is every reason to believe that the
separation could not exist in part of the boiler without exist
        j.
ing throughout the whole. But be this as it may, the exces
sive heating of the boiler is the real cause of the mischief; and
unless it can be shown that the spheroidal state of the water is
the cause and not the effect of the boiler becoming red-hot, the
explanation appears to me to amount to nothing.
   M. Boutigny, with more reason I think, also conceives that
the            condition of water has an important bearing
upon the art of tempering steel. Whatever promotes contact
between the heated steel and the water into which it is plunged,
must accelerate the cooling and increase the hardness of the
steel.  Now it has been shown that the higher the boiling
point of the liquid, the higher is the temperature of the metal
necessary to preserve separation; and hence probably the rea
son why artificers can harden steel more effectively in salt and
water than in water alone, because the addition of salt raises
the boiling-point of the water.
   The remainder of M. Boutigny’s experiments do not involve
any other principles than those I have already touched upon,
and I shall not, therefore, trouble your readers by any obser
vations upon them.

XXXVIII.       On Currents of Electricity produced by the Vibra
    tion of Wires and Metallic Rods. By WILLIAM SULLIvan,
    Esq.”
IN thatreading over a paper of Seebeckt, in which he observed
         when a compound bar of bismuth and antimony was
heated at the junction of the two metals, a peculiar sound was
heard to accompany the deflection of the galvanometer-needle,
I thought at the time that if a similar sound could be pro
duced by vibration, a current might in           all

262     Mr. W. Sullivan          on Currents          of Electricity produced               by
molecular motion than was generally supposed.                 In order to
test the accuracy of my views, I took a flat piece of board
about two feet long and morticed two uprights, each three
inches high, into it about eighteen inches apart.             I then took
a piece .# No. 15 brass wire and soldered it to a similar piece
of iron wire, and stretched it tight over the uprights so as to
produce, when set in vibration, a musical note; the ends of
this compound wire were then connected with an exceedingly
delicate galvanometer, similar to that used by Melloni in his
researches on radiant heat; when this was set in rapid vibra
tion, a slight deviation of the needle took place, the direction
of the current being from the iron to the brass, as in a similar
thermo-electric circle; this was not, however, always the case,
but seemed to depend upon the kind of vibration, though I
could not discover how. That this effect did not depend on
 any heat produced is quite certain, as the current ceased the
 moment the vibration ceased.                     I
                                           could not always produce a
 deviation, and very often, when there was a current produced,
 it was scarcely appreciable until                    I
                                            increased the oscillation of
 the galvanometer-needle by frequently breaking contact.                On
 one or two occasions I noticed a deviation            equal  to that  pro
 duced by heating the junction of the two wires to dull redness.
 From some of my experiments, it would appear that when the
 wire vibrated continuously from end to end, the greatest effect
 was obtained; but when from some cause a nodal point was
 produced in the centre of the wire, and the two halves of the
 wire vibrated in opposite directions, no effect was produced.
 This point indeed was the cause of                             all
                                                    my difficulties,                        as  I
 found   it almost impossible         detect when this took place. As
                                      to
                                                               be by

 soldered

results seem more likely to be effected by a vibratory motion
of molecules than by a continuous effluence of caloric fluid. In
fact, vibratory motion is the sole cause of the phaenomena he
observed, and not the heat produced by the friction.
    There are a number of points of great importance in this
inquiry which demand further investigation, but which at pre
sent    Icannot follow out from want of proper apparatus; but
I  hope it will meet with the attention from men of science

                   Lieut.-Col. Yorke on Brown Iron Ore.                                      265
  When         I
            made the experiments I had not seen the second
edition of Dana's Mineralogy*, or the analyses of Kobell
quoted therein, or I should probably have saved myself the
labour. Although my results accord with those of Kobell,
yet as it does not appear that any distinctly crystallized spe
cimen has been analysed, and as the most interesting problem
in mineralogy is the connection between crystalline form and
composition, it may not be deemed superfluous if I submit
my results to the Chemical Society.
                       A.       Crystallized
                                   Brown Iron Ore.
    The   specimen   was obtained from Restoomel mine near
Lostwithiel. The specific gravity of the mineral, taken on a
crystal weighing 2'504 grs.,                   I
                                    found to be 4.37; when taken
from the     powdered  mineral,   in the manner described by G.
Rose, it came out 4:22 to 4'24.
   I   annex figures of the forms of two crystals, and the mea
surements I have observed on them, together with those of
similar angles obtained by Phillips and Levy.           Levy makes
the primary form a right rhombic prism of 95°14, the ratio of
whose terminal edges is to that of the lateral edges as 10 to
9f; and I have followed this author in the choice of the planes
 assumed as primary.
     Fig. 1. agrees perfectly with the view that the primary form
 is a right rhombic prism; but with the crystal fig. 2.          met                     I
 with a difficulty, inasmuch as I obtained as the inclination of
g, on a plane apparently corresponding to h, fig. 1, the angles
  115°40', and with g! on the other side 114° nearly. I believe
 this is owing to there being in reality two very narrow planes,

by Kobell was from Oberkirchen in Oldenbourg; it was
crystallized, but the crystals were not measurable.         This is
undoubtedly the same species that I have just described.
Under the second name is included a substance of the same
composition apparently as the first, but from the observations
of Rose it seems doubtful whether it has the same crystalline
form *.    It is under the name of goethite, however, that our
mineral of Lostwithiel, &c. appears in Dana's work.       may now                           I
remark, that as the composition of this substance is perfectly
analogous with that of manganite (Mn2O3 + HO), so are the
crystals plesiomorphous; the primary form of manganite bein
a right rhombic prism of 99°40', and the ratio of
to      its
        lateral edges           is    as

portance.  The idea had occurred to him in passing one of
the large breweries, that, from the greatly increased demand
for pale ale, such as is exported to India, as a beverage for
home use, it would be practicable to discharge the colour from
the ordinary beer by artificial means, and thus obtain the de
sired object. What rendered this, he said, the more import
ant, was the difficulty he had heard expressed by persons                                              in
terested in the matter, in preparing an article sufficiently pale
for the purpose of sale, the malt employed requiring to be
made expressly for this quality of beer. To effect this deside
ratum, he considered that            that would  all      required would be
 be
 to    pass the fluid through        medium      a animal charcoal, and

that the ordinary amber colour             ale would    of   thus partially   be
removed.     I undertook        make histo  experiment      for him,     the                      at

   therefore digested some nux vomica in coarse powder with

stance, while the front and back should each consist of a thin
film of glass equal in breadth to the bore of the tube. In the
absence of such an instrument         I used a spirit thermometer,
the tube of which had a large bore and a small external dia
meter. This was inserted in a slit made in the side of a flat
box, and the portions at each side of the spirit column were
blackened.     A sheet of photographic paper, prepared with
bromide of    potassium    and nitrate of silver, was placed on a
plate of glass which was drawn by clockwork through the
box. The plate was at a distance of nearly 1 of an inch from
the column of spirit in the thermometer, and five feet from an
open window.       The window faced towards the east, but the
            i.
direct rays of the sun did not fall on the apparatus during the
experiment.      As the plate passed before the thermometer, a
beam of   light  was thrown upon it more or less high, accord
ing to the           of the spirit in the tube or the temperature
of the   surrounding     air.   A shadow bounded by a defined
curve was thus    formed,    as is shown in the figure.

 shadow was not perfectly continuous, but, as can be perceived,
 a series of white spaces were interposed between each of the
 dark portions. The translucency of the coloured spirit also
 permitted some light to act upon the lower part of the sheet,
making faint prolongations of the dark spaces.
    In my first experiment the temperature was registered in
this way for only five hours; in my second, the result of which
is exhibited in the diagram, the operation was carried on for
nine hours, or from ten in the morning until seven in the af
ternoon.      During the course of the last experiment, the sky
was   occasionally  much obscured so as to lessen the intensity
of the   light, and both experiments were performed during the
present month.
   When results so satisfactory have been obtained with such
imperfect apparatus as that which I have used, it is super
fluous to anticipate what would take place under more favour
able circumstances.      The application of photography to re
gister the height of the mercury in the barometer ought to be
still more practicable than in the thermometer, as in the
former case the shadow thrown on the paper would be so
much broader than could ever be possible in the latter.                                          I
trust that I shall soon be able to present such facts on this
portion of the subject as will effectually clear up             doubts.          all

    3. To a weak solution of nitrate of silver in distilled water
a  very  dilute solution of pure baryta was added, and the re
sulting precipitated oxide of silver received upon plates of
glass. When the whole of the oxide had fallen down, the
fluid was removed very slowly by means of a small glass                                                si
phon, so that the powder on the glass plates might not be dis
turbed.      Without being removed from the vessel in which
the  precipitation    was effected, the oxide was dried at a very
moderate heat, and there resulted exceedingly thin films of
the oxide of silver on the glass, quite free from                  organic               all
matter, every precaution being taken              prevent       presence.

reduced            to
              the metallic state.      Moderately strong nitric acid,

 however, that something more than this takes place, and that
  an actual combination of the organic body with the silver en
 sues; and I hope to have an opportunity of examining some
  of the very complicated phaenomena which have presented
 themselves to my notice, during investigations which have
  been made incidentally to the present inquiry, into the influ

  exposure to light and heat.
     is. Count Rumford appears to have been the first who no
  ticed that carbon had the property of reducing the salts of
  gold and silver from their solutions, at a temperature below
  that of boiling water in the dark; and that the same precipi
  tate of pure metal took place by exposure to the sun's rays.
  He inferred from this, that the “chemical properties attributed
  to light” were due alone to the heating powers of the sun's
  rays.   The error of this has long been known, as experiments
* with the prismatic spectrum have shown that the rays in which
  the calorific power exists at                    its
                                    maximum have little effect                                    in
  producing any such reduction. The precipitation        the silver                   of
  from the nitrate     solution takes place very speedily under

state (17.) than the    chloride; and that the well-known acce
 lerating power of moisture is due to the decomposition of
 water, and the influence of the nascent hydrogen, in reducing
 the argentine salt.
     28. The principal point was now to ascertain the condition
 of the chloride of silver after it had been thoroughly darkened
 by exposure. Many experiments were tried, in various ways,
 which need not now be detailed, as they were in varying de
grees successful; to one alone which gave very satisfactory
 results I shall at present confine myself. Pure chloride of
 silver was prepared with great care, as before stated (21.), well
 washed with boiling distilled water, until neither nitrate of
 silver nor muriatic acid produced any precipitate, and then
dried. Five grains of the salt were put into a long test-tube
full of distilled water, and placed in the sunshine to darken,
 the powder being frequently moved that every part might be
acted upon by the sun's rays.         It was found, even after an
exposure of a few minutes, that the water contained chlorine;
it became opake on the addition of nitrate of silver, and this
very gradually increased as the chloride darkened.                The
darkening was continued for several hours, after which the
solution was filtered to free it from chloride of silver, and             *
nitrate of silver added to the filtered fluid; chloride of silver
was precipitated, which, when collected and dried, weighed
 1:4 grain on one occasion, 1 grain on another, and 1.5 grain
on a third trial. It is very difficult to ensure the darkening
of every portion of the chloride of silver, it adheres in little
masses; these are darkened on their outer surface, and the           in
terior is then protected from the solar influence; this was over
come as much as possible by repeatedly breaking down those
small particles with a glass rod. On drying the darkened
chloride and weighing, it was found that the loss of weight
was scarcely a quarter of a grain. From this it is evident that
the chlorine liberated by the sun's rays must have been partly
replaced by some other body; and it becomes highly probable
that the darkened chloride is in the state of an oxychloride.
No oxide of silver could be detected by digestion in diluted
nitric acid.
    29. The exposure in the water was in another case conti
nued for many days, but no greater degree of darkening oc
curred; but a curious fact was now noticed. It was found that
during the night nearly    all  the chlorine which had been libe
rated   during  the day  was recombined,    and that the darkened
powder became much lighter.        A    similar effectto   this, but a
more striking one, has been noticed        by  Dr. Percy and Mr.
Shaw, when chloride      of  silver
                                  is   darkened  by    light
                                                           in   an at

mosphere of chlorine. Some other salts of silver exhibit this
curious phaenomenon in a striking manner, as will be shown
in future communications.
   30. Pure chloride of silver was dried on a glass plate and
heated nearly to the point of fusion; it was then placed in an
atmosphere of chlorine and darkened in very bright sunshine.
No loss of weight could be detected by the most careful ma
nipulation and with a very delicate balance. There is no very
satisfactory way of explaining this, except we suppose that the
liberated chlorine is retained by cohesive force in connection
with the finely divided particles of what we must regard as a
subchloride of silver, unless we return to the old theory of
the compound nature of chlorine.
   31. In these experiments the presence of organic matter has
been carefully avoided.          It now became necessary to inquire
into the condition of the chloride of silver darkening by the
solar rays on paper.        Bath post paper, highly glazed, was co
vered with chloride of silver in the usual way, all free nitrate
of silver being washed off. The prepared paper was then ex
posed to light for forty-eight hours, in which time it darkened
and became of a fine olive-brown. The paper was now cut in
pieces; some parts were immersed in very dilute nitric acid,
which produced no change; others in ammonia, which had
 not the slightest effect upon them; therefore it was evident that
no oxide of silver was present. On putting fragments of the
paper into nitric acid diluted with equal parts of water,                the  all
darkened     portion   was  rapidly   dissolved    off, and the  paper   was
left  of a lilac colour.     Hence we have very satisfactory proof
that metallic silver       eventually formed
                               is                        on
                                                        the surface      the  of
chloridated    photographic      papers,   and that the under sensitive
surface    ispreserved          in

290           Dr.      J.   Stenhouse on an OEconomical                            Method    of
transport to any distance, and any attempt to reduce it to the
solid state by evaporation, involves so large an expense for
fuel as to render it in most cases quite unadvisable.
   The method by which                             I
                                   purpose to procure phosphoric
acid from urine is not    by  evaporation,     but by precipitating it
in the state of the insoluble phosphate of lime or bone-earth.
This is easily and cheaply effected, by merely adding a slight
excess of lime-water, or still better, of milk of lime, to the
urine so long as it causes a precipitate.            This precipitate,
when    produced    by means of     lime-water,    has a bulky gelati
nous  appearance,    very  much    resembling    alumina,   and, as will
be seen by the subjoined analysis, consists of basic phosphate                                                  -
of lime with a little magnesia and some organic matter. After
standing for some hours, the precipitate subsides pretty
and the greater portion of the supernatant water may be easily                                   .#
drawn off by a siphon. The remainder may then be removed
by collecting the precipitate on any suitable filtering appara
tus. On drying the precipitate, which, as we have already
mentioned, is very voluminous, it shrinks exceedingly.              For
the  purpose   of obtaining    this   precipitate,  it is  by no means
necessary that the urine should be in a concentrated state;                                                I
have been able to procure it quite readily from urine diluted.

it in shallow vessels to the rays of the sun, or to a current of dry
or hot air. When dry it forms a friable mass, which, when
slightly rubbed, crumbles into a very fine powder. The quan
tity of lime required to precipitate the phosphoric acid from
urine is by no means great, and the only difficulty experienced
in the whole process is in the filtration, which proceeds much
more slowly than could be wished, though I have no doubt
that a little practice would suggest the means of greatly dimi
nishing, if not of wholly obviating this impediment.
     Glasgow, August 26, 1845.
   P.S. Since the above was written, I have ascertained that
the difficulty in filtering and drying the precipitate, to which
reference has more than once been made, may be greatly obvi
ated by intimately mixing a small quantity of finely-powdered
wood-charcoal with the precipitate, after the great bulk of the
water has been drawn off by means of a siphon or otherwise.
The quantity of charcoal which is necessary for this purpose,
is by no means considerable; it has the effect of rendering the
precipitate tolerably porous, and thus greatly facilitating                                                       its

twenty or twenty-four hours the evolution of gas nearly

296                 Mr. Crum   on the Action of
   By calculation 20 grains CuO changed into Cu, O, ought
to yield, by Berzelius's numbers, 1.98 grain of oxygen.        A
nearer approximation than in the foregoing results is scarcely
to be expected; for although there was no perceptible dis
engagement of gas during the washing of the precipitate in
these experiments, it is certain that oxygen always escapes
during the time so employed.
   The quantity of lime necessary to the production and sta
bility of this oxide is not more than 1 equivalent after satura
tion of the nitric acid : 1 atom of lime to 3 of copper gave
 only 0.558 gr. of oxygen gas instead of the mean quantity
of 1828; 2 atoms to 3 of copper yielded 1-295. I conceive
 the rose-coloured powder then to be a compound of an oxide
 of copper with lime, in which the copper exists in the state of
 sesquioxide, Cu2O3.
    I have not succeeded in producing this oxide by means of
 the  hypochlorites  of potash or soda, even with the alkali in
 great excess; but by adding caustic soda to a solution of hy
 pochlorite of lime, and afterwards nitrate of copper, we obtain
 the calcareous compound (lime being precipitated along with
 the copper) in a state of division so fine as to show the rose
 colour as soon as it is formed. This method, however, does
 not serve for the purposes of analysis, for the powder never
 becomes granular, and remains therefore too bulky to be
 washed.
    It will now be observed that the dehydrating action of the
hypochlorites upon oxide of copper must depend upon the
momentary formation of a sesquioxide in which the oxygen
has replaced the previously combined water.
   The solution of bleaching powder in which the sesquioxide
has been formed is of a fine but very pale pink colour, and
contains so small a proportion of the colouring ingredient,
that the nature of that body can scarcely be discovered by
analytical means. The second washing of the oxide is colour
less; but if a very minute portion of sulphate of manganese
be added, the pink colour is restored.      When manganate of
potash is dropped into nitric acid, the well-known red colour
of hypermanganic acid is produced. In lime water the colour
is bluish green; but in bleaching liquor, even with excess of
lime, we have the peculiar amethystine colour of the solution
in which the sesquioxide of copper has been produced.
 Bleaching powder has long been said to contain manganese,
and to this I at first attributed the pink colour of the original
solution; but I afterwards found that it could be reproduced
from pure Irish limestone which I employed.        Even marble
gives a pink solution in the same circumstances.

    The   vessel in which   the sesquioxide has been produced,
is lined with a beautiful rose-coloured deposit, which remains
attached to the glass when the other matters are washed out;
but it fades away in a few hours, particularly when exposed
to light, and cannot even be long preserved in the solution
in which it forms.      Dissolved in dilute nitric acid, copper is
found in the solution and no manganese. There can be no
doubt that, like the precipitate, it is the sesquioxide of cop
 per in combination with lime.
    The red oxide of iron has also the power of decomposing
 the hypochlorites.

 speculations on these and other weak affinities which give rise
 to many of the phaenomena of catalysis.
    When a solution of bleaching powder is mixed with nitrate
 of copper, a light bluish-green powder precipitates, the bulki
 ness of which renders it somewhat difficult to wash.          This
 powder is very slightly soluble in water, and scarcely changes
 colour in boiling.   Heated in a glass tube over a spirit-lamp,
 chloride of  copper sublimes into a cooler part of the tube, and
 water   escapes.  The residue consists of black oxide of copper
 mixed with a quantity of chloride, which may be separated
 from the oxide by washing.        Professor Graham, who sug
 gested to me this experiment, remarked the analogous effect
 of boiling water in separating water from a hydrate. It
 proved to be a hydrated oxichloride of copper, the substance
  known by the name of Brunswick green, and formed in a
  variety of other circumstances.      Analysis gave me nearer
  3Cu O, Cu Cl than 4 Cu O, Cu Cl; but the presence of car
  bonate in the specimen left me in doubt upon this point, and
I could not resume the inquiry.   In this reaction the whole

of bodies. I made the observations in Dr. Lee's Observatory, at
Hartwell House, with my former instruments, which are always
obligingly kept in readiness for my immediate use. The mean mi
crometrical readings gave 174° 36' 6 for the position, which, cor
rected to the meridian, and brought to proportional parts, afford
Position 185° 23'-3 (w. 6); Distance 2". 10 (w.                           4); Epoch 1845.34.

confidence, for, previously to my placing the micrometer on the ob

eye-piece magnifying 240 times, under which the minute companion
following nearly on the parallel was distinctly seen. On this occa

 rous of beholding, provided, however, as he would of course be, with
 a sufficient apparatus.
     “During the first nine days of its appearance to this end of the
 colony generally, this comet was only seen once at the Royal Ob
 servatory, on account of the clouds which form so frequently to the
 west, because Table Mountain is there; and, now the comet is going
 southward so very fast, that it will probably soon be out of reach of
 the equatoreal mounting of the telescope. This state of things has
 already supervened in the case of Mauvais' comet, which has been
 observed since October, and is likely to be visible for a long time to
 come; but from the middle of December its south declination has
 been so great as to place it beyond the range of the instrument at
 the best times for observation.      Now, therefore, a polar axis mount
 ing is being hastily run up.”
     Meteorology.—“A large mountain is too generally associated in
 idea with constant clouds and storms; but two years' experience on
 great elevations at this end of the colony shows decidedly that the
 highest position is by no means, on that account solely, liable to
 most mist, or vexed with most wind; such effects depending more
 on the proximity of the sea, and the configuration of the neighbour
 ing country.
     “Winterhock-berg, 6500 feet high and 60 miles from the sea, had
 little wind and less mist; but one of its off-sets contains a kloof, or
 cleft, which serves as a vent for the wind which has been blowing
 up the Worcester and Tulbagh valleys; and, in this kloof, 1200 feet
 high, there is generally abundance of both wind and cloud,                the              :
 latter of that sort which is forming at the same time on the top of
 Table Mountain, 3600 feet high.
     “Kamiesberg, 5500 feet high, a cold mountain, isolated in ex
 tensive warm plains, had little wind; but Klyp Rug-berg, only 1000
 feet high, situated on the edge of a steppe dividing a cold region
from a hot one, was subject to wind, violent and continual beyond
 example.
     “In the plains there generally prevails during summer a certain
 degree of haziness and indistinctness in the atmosphere, highly pre
judicial both to the definition and the intensity of any distant illu
minated object.       A residence on a high mountain shows that there
is  spread   at such times over the whole lower country a stratum of
 dry fog to the depth of 3000 or 4000 feet, not affecting the dew

   “Not having been able yet to get my tourmalines applied to a
telescope, I cannot report on their actual sufficiency for measuring
the magnitudes of stars; the principle, however, seems to answer,
inasmuch as a mode of observation is produced, in which the only
variable element is angular motion.
    “Numerical measurement of the periodical and secular changes
in the colour of stars would seem to be as important as that of their
lustre.   My plan for doing it cannot be put into action without a
clock-moved telescope.       The principle is merely this:—a prism is
to be introduced into the tube of a telescope so as to make the linear
spectrum of a star, instead of the round white image to be viewed by
the eye-piece.    The mean yellow ray is to be brought by mechani
cal  adjustments  to a fixed point in the field, and, the spectrum being
divided into a number of spaces of certain angular extent, the bright
ness of each is to be measured separately, as in the case of the mag
nitudes of the stars.
   “White stars of all sizes will, of course, show the same relative
intensities in the different divisions of the spectrum; while coloured
stars will exhibit a preponderance in the part which answers to their
colour. To eliminate the differences of the effects of the atmosphere,
and to determine what is white light, a method must be pursued si
milar to that in the discussion of the measurement of magnitudes;
and the colour of the star will ultimately be expressed by numbers,
without attempting to determine by what particular designation such
a tint would be conceived by a person of ordinary eyesight.

   The author concluded that the decomposition of ferridcyanide into
ferrocyanide, would afford cyanogen which would act as if it were
free; and he found that when he heated oxide of lead in a mixture
of ferridcyanide and potash, he procured binoxide of lead, and the
solution contained ferrocyanide of potassium only. Having thus
proved that the ferridcyanide might be substituted for cyanogen as
an oxidizing agent, experiments were performed on the superoxi
dizement of various oxides.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Juin 1845.
SUPEROXIDIZEMENT OF METALLIC OXIDES BY MEANS OF THE

dency to pass to a higher degree of oxidizement; and some of them
undergo it with great readiness, under the oxidizing influence of
cyanogen, either at common temperatures or when boiling, accord
ing as the oxide is more or less superoxidizable.

This oxide may probably be the stannate of protoxide of tin, disco
vered by M. Fremy (SnO, Snº O').
   Oride of Chromium, when dissolved in potash and heated with the
ferridcyanide to the boiling-point, is converted into chromate of pot
ash; and if sufficient oxide be used, all the ferridcyanide is reduced
to ferrocyanide; this is evidently an example of very energetic oxi
dation, for hitherto chromate of potash has not been procured in the
moist way.
   Orides of Gold and Silver are not superoxidized by the ferridcya
nide; in a cold solution no effect is produced, but at a temperature
near that of ebullition, peroxide of iron is precipitated; and the so
lution contains ferrocyanide of potassium, and cyanide of gold dis
solved in the cyanide of potassium.
   The salts of silver exhibit similar phaenomena, viz. the formation
of ferrocyanide, precipitation of peroxide of iron; and the solution
contains ferrocyanide of potassium, which being precipitated by al
cohol, cyanide of silver and cyanide of potassium were obtained.
These facts are not included in simple oxidizement, they are true
decompositions.
   Sulphur may also be oxidized by this same influence; it becomes
sulphuric acid.
   Acids and Salts.-Certain mineral acids may be oxidized, whether
free or combined; phosphorous acid and the soluble hypophosphites
are converted into phosphates; sulphurous acid yields sulphuric acid,
the sulphites are converted into sulphates. Oxalic acid, and oxalates
added to the alkaline solution, yield carbonates almost instantane
ously.
   M. Boudault gives the following explanation of the phaenomena
which he has described:—the        ferridcyanide of potassium is consi
dered by him as a double salt, that is to say, as a compound of per
cyanide of iron and cyanide of potassium ; this percyanide of iron,
therefore, does not exist in a free state, and being a very unstable
salt, it is retained in the red prussiate by the cyanide of potassium.
As soon as a reaction takes place in the presence of this salt, it has
a tendency to be decomposed, and the author gives the following as
explanatory of his views:—

By this formula we find two equivalents of ferrocyanide of potassium
and binoxide of lead, which is what we obtain by the reaction which
it explains.
   The author considers the ferridcyanide of potassium, under the
circumstances described, as ferrocyanide, minus potassium, and con
sequently as possessing an equivalent of free cyanogen, capable of
replacing cyanogen.        It is therefore demonstrated, M. Boudault
 oncludes, that cyanogen possesses the additional analogy with chlo

           PHosphoric Acid found IN ALMost ALL Rocks”.
   The following extracts from a lecture by Dr. R. D. Thomson in
the forthcoming number of the Quarterly Agricultural Journal of
Scotland, taken in conjunction with the paper printed in the Philo
sophical Magazine on the Inorganic Constituents of Lichens, render
it obvious that few rocks will be found destitute of phosphoric acidf.                                                  •
   Greywacke Soil.—By explaining geologically the dependence of
the soil upon rocks, and tracing the production of various soils from
their respective rocks, not only may much interest, but much instruc
tion be derived in the chemical studies of the agriculturist.  During
the last winter many careful analyses of rocks have been made.
These I do not intend to describe at present; but, as an example of
the importance of such analyses, I may notice those of the greywacke
and the superimposed soil at Balkerr in Wigtonshire. The experi
ments were conducted by my pupil, Mr. James M'Bryde, under my
immediate direction.     The analyses of the rock and soil are placed
in parallel columns for the sake of comparison.     Specific gravity of
the rock 2:76.

   Greenstone Soil.—The following analyses were made             Mr. James                           by

exhibited in two trials made by Mr. J. C. Stevenson.
  A similar limestone exists in Stirlingshire, at Boquhan, and is be
lieved to extend to the south-west, although I have not had an op

pitation of a neutral aluminous salt by 2NaO, P, O, to which,
 consequently, the composition 2Al, O, 3P, O, is assigned; and 2,
a basic salt, which is formed by dissolving the former in an acid

   a. So-called neutral Phosphate of Alumina.-If a solution of alum
is mixed with one of ordinary phosphate of soda until the latter
produces no further precipitate, the filtered liquid, which, although
containing excess of the alkaline precipitant, reacts strongly acid, is
free from alumina, but contains a considerable amount of phos
phoric acid.   It might thus be readily imagined that the decompo
sition which ensues here is similar to that in the case of silver,
where, as we know, (2NaO, HO)P.O., throws down 3AgO, P,0,.
The precipitate, when carefully washed and dried in the air, forms
a white, very loose and hygroscopic powder, which after having
been dried in a stove, loses 39: 17 per cent. of water at a red heat.
When dried in            vacuo over sulphuric                    acid, it lost in four experiments

 XLIX. A        Theoretical Explanation of the Aberration of

     Itwill be seen that in the above explanation it is assumed
that  light travels from the object to the eye in a straight line.
According to the emission theory of light such is the case, and
if this view of the nature of light be adopted, nothing further
need be said. The same would be true on the undulatory
hypothesis, if we might suppose the aether to be absolutely at
rest. But it is impossible to conceive that the earth can move
through space without communicating some motion to the
aether which surrounds and pervades                        therefore ne

  Then, since the point a with regard to the direction of motion
  of the aether is in advance of the point b, the velocity of the
  aether is less at a than at b.        For we are here considering a
  position in that part of the tether which, with regard to the
 direction of the earth's motion, is in advance of the earth's
  centre; and it is plain that if we trace at any time a line of
  motion in that part, beginning at the earth's surface and pro
 ceeding in the direction of the motion of the particles through
  which it passes, the velocity will be less the further we advance
 along this line. Let the velocities V, and V<U+017F> continue uniform

328             Prof. Draper on the Allotropism of Chlorine,
   More than two years ago I brought before the British As
sociation some of the facts. They were subsequently published
in the Philosophical Magazine, in a memoir on “Tithonized
Chlorine,” July 1844).     The connexion of these experiments
with the discussion between the theory of substitutions and
the electro-chemical theory is obvious.
   Very recently M. Berzelids has published an important
paper on the Allotropism of Simple Bodies”, the object of which
is to point out that many of those bodies can assume different
qualities by being subjected to certain modes of treatment.
Thus carbon furnishes three forms—charcoal, plumbago and
diamond.
   To a certain extent these views coincide with those which
have offered themselves to me from the study of the properties
of chlorine. They are not, however, altogether the same. M.
Berzelius infers that elementary bodies can, as has been said,
assume under varying circumstances different qualities.            The
idea which it is attempted to communicate in this memoir is
simply this; that a given substance, such as chlorine, can pass
from a state of high activity, in which it possesses              well               all   its
known     properties,            to
                             state    acomplete ofinactivity,    which                 in
even       most energetic affinities disappear; and that between
          its
these extremes there are innumerable intermediate points.
Between the two views there            therefore this essential differ
                                                is
ence; from the former           does not appear what the nature
                                       it                                                           of
the newly-assumed properties may be; from the latter they
must obviously              be   of
                          the same character, and differ only        in                        in
tensity      degree, diminishing from stage
             or                                       stage until com     to

simple appellations active and passive, are perhaps the best,
and  I  shall therefore employ them.

transferred to a graduated vessel and measured.           I satisfied
myself, by            variations of this arrangement, that the
small  quantity  of water introduced from time to time when
the gas bubble escaped from the end of the tube c, exerted no
essential influence on the phaenomenon.       The following Table
shows the amount of     gas  evolved in the dark during the pe
riods indicated.
   The bulb having been exposed to the sunshine, in ten mi
nutes the evolution of gas commenced, and in an hour 107
cubic inch having collected, this was cast away and the ar
rangement placed in the dark. To prevent the undue escape
of the chlorine, a piece of flat glass, d, was laid on the open end
of the tube c. In each successive hour the quantity of gas
given in the following Table was then evolved:—

and for four days afterwards gas was collecting in the bulb in

diminished quantities.
    V. This evolution of gas in the dark is not merely a gra
dual escape of oxygen originally formed whilst the solution
was exposed to the sun, but is traceable to an influence conti
nuously exerted by the chlorine, arising in properties it has
            during         its
                        exposure       the rays.

      hese ninth and tenth facts are         further interest  of   bearing                     as
upon   a   question which has been much discussed                 chemists,                   by
—the nature          of
                     the  bleaching    compounds          chlorine.    The      of
chloride    of lime, and other such substances, probably have the

334           Prof. Draper on the Allotropism of Chlorine,
same theoretical constitution as chlorine-water.           Berzelius and
Balard    suppose,    that in this solution chlorous or hypochlorous
acids exist.      It might     be inquired, if this be the condition of
things, why does not an exposure to heat alone evolve oxygen P
for chlorous acid is exceedingly liable to decomposition by
slight elevation of temperature; and we should be justified in
inferring, that if any of this acid is to be found in chlorine
water, it would be decomposed at the boiling-point. M. Millon
adopts the view, that the bleaching compounds are metallic
chlorides, analogous to the corresponding peroxides.                   But
                                                               If chlorine
                                             j
the ninth fact seems incompatible with this view.
water is analogous to peroxide of hydrogen, and the last be
what    itsname imports, and not merely oxygenated water,                                     it   is
difficult      understand why, when chlorine water
              to                                                   boiled,          is
oxygen    is  not  given  off.          If
                                    the atom                      of
                                                  chlorine and the atom
of oxygen        this body are placed under the same relations                                     to
the atom        of in
                  hydrogen,        seems necessary that the chlorine
                                       it
atom    at 212° Fahr. should expel the oxygen atom and chlo
rohydric acid form.              probable, indeed, that the two oxy
                                  It
gen atoms        peroxide

                                              affinity, and that one                               of
them   is   retained far more               than the other. But this
would correspond with our ideas              oxygenized water and not
peroxide       of
               hydrogen, and leads                     is us of

   We have thus traced the cause         the decomposition        of                           of
water,  in the case before us,      change  impressed upon the

position three elementary bodies are involved, chlorine, oxy
gen and hydrogen.
   We can therefore reduce the problem under discussion                                        to

          as connected with the Theory                         of Substitutions.                  335
simpler conditions,   and study the relations of each of these
substances to each other and to the solar rays successively.
   When a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases, in the pro
portion to form water, is exposed to the most brilliant radia
tion converged upon it by convex lenses, union does not ensue;
the reason being, as I have formerly shown, that those gases
are perfectly transparent to the rays, and do not possess either
real or ideal coloration.
   For the     same cause, water exposed alone                            for any length of
time to the sun, or to the influence of a large convex lens,
does not decompose.             It is transparent and cannot absorb
any of the rays.
    But, as is well known, a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen
unites under the same circumstances with an explosion.                                              I
have formerly proved that this depends on the absorption of
the indigo rays, for in the indigo space the action goes on
with the greatest rapidity.
   If,   therefore, this phaenomenon             due  is absorption taking
                                                                    to
place    by  the  mixture,       it easy

                               ingredients.
 I    transmitted      a ray     light through hydrogen gas contained
                                  of
                              long,                            of

   a   tube seven inches              the ends       which were terminated
     pieces    of flat glass, and then dispersing the ray              flint            by   a
glass prism, received the resulting spectrum                    Daguerreo     it, on
 type plate. Simultaneously,                     by
                                             the side                of
                                                               received the    I  a
 spectrum      of  aray which had not gone through hydrogen, but
 through  a    similar tube filled with atmospheric air. On com
 paring the resulting impressions together, could find              I    dif                 no
 ference between them.
        therefore infer that hydrogen gas does not exert any
    I
  absorptive action        onthe solar rays.
 In       one  ofthe   foregoing    tubes placed dry chlorine gas, the

  found that   a   powerful absorption had been exercised                 the                 by

338         Prof. Draper on the Allotropism of Chlorine,
receive tightly the tube c. In a short time, therefore, B be
came full of dry hydrogen, the surplus escaping through the
open aperture p. The two ground glass plates were now
moved on one another in such a manner that they mutually
closed each other.     The vessel A was therefore filled with
dry chlorine, and the vessel B c with an equal volume of dry
hydrogen, without communicating for the present with one
another.
  I  had provided two sets of these tubes as nearly alike as
they could be made, and operated with them in the following
WaW   :-
  i. a dark room     I filled the tube A of each of them with dry
chlorine, in the manner just described, and confined it by sli
ding the plates.    One of the tubes was retained in the dark
room and kept carefully screened from the light, but the other
was set for half an hour in the sunbeams.     The chlorine which
was in it underwent the      specific change which it is the object
of this paper  to describe.
                                                                                     -
   After restoring this tube to the dark room, and waiting a
few minutes for it to gain the same temperature as the other,
the tubes B c of each set were filled with dry hydrogen in the
manner described.
   In each instance, as soon as the plates were moved on each
other so as to confine the hydrogen, and were released from
the cork h of the drying tube K, fig. 7, their lower extremity
was dipped beneath the surface of some water contained in the
saucer P, fig. 8; the two sets of tubes being held steadily in a
proper position by the aid of a wooden frame Q R, Q R.
   The two sets of tubes now differed from one another in no
thing but the circumstance that the chlorine of one had been
exposed to the sun and that of the other had not.
   The gases were now brought in contact. This was easily
done by sliding each pair of ground glasses until their aper
tures coincided, as shown in fig. 9. The hydrogen now rose
through the hole into the upper vessel, the chlorine descend
ing through     it,
                 mutual and perfect diffusion             of
                                                      the two gases
rapidly taking place. This was done                 by

                                        ascertained that the gases

                              soon      the apertures coincided

bubble     of
           gas would have  escaped    through   the water,         or   at   all a
events the level would have    changed.
  It  remained now      open the shutter

 tubes having been previously set in such a position that the
 light would fall equally on both.       As soon as this was done,
the chlorine which had been       exposed  to the sun united at once
with      its
           hydrogen, and the water rose          the tube         But   in                    c.              in

immediately arises from the phaenomena we have had under

             electro-negative properties are exalted, and            has                                it

    Itis  now fully established that        great number    a   the ele                       of
mentary bodies undergo similar modifications. Many                 these                              of
can exist       in  less than three different states, and these pe

the elementary bodies now known, many undoubtedly exist
several allotropic states, and infers that           are liable     ana   all                         to

former the carbon is under the form of common charcoal, and
in the latter under the form of diamond.
    The following instances from Berzelius may serve as exam
ples of these allotropic states.
    Carbon is known under three forms, charcoal, plumbago,
and diamond; they differ in specific gravity, in specific heat,
and in their conducting power as respects caloric and electri
city.     In their relations to light the one perfectly absorbs                                         it,
the second reflects           like
                                it    metal, the third transmits

glass.        Intheir relations with oxygen they also differ surpri
singly; there are varieties               of
                                       charcoal that spontaneously take
fire  in  the air, but the diamond can only                 burnt with diffibe
culty    at   ahigh temperature          pure oxygen gas. The second
                                              in
and third varieties             do
                               not belong       the saine crystalline form.

                          Berzelius   remarks,     may lead         conjecture    to   a
respecting the true condition                      of
                                             certain gases. No one can
reflect     on the inactivity        nitrogen gas under ordinary cir
                                      of
cumstances, contrasted with                   its
                                          equally extraordinary activity

                as connected with the Theory                 of Substitutions.                      341
as a constituent    of organic bodies, without being struck with
the apparent connexion of that phaenomenon with those of allo
tropism. And though Berzelius, with his customary caution,
merely insinuates that nitrogen can exist under two forms, the
facts which are here developed in relation to chlorine seem to
show that that opinion rests on something more solid than
conjecture. . The habitudes of many of the gaseous bodies
strengthen this conclusion. Oxygen gas refuses to unite when
mixed with hydrogen, precisely in the manner of chlorine;
and it requires a certain modification to be made in the elec
tro-negative element before water or chlorohydric acid can
result.
   Just, therefore, in the same manner that so many elemen
tary bodies can put on under the influence of external causes
an active or passive condition, I infer as the final result of the
experiments brought forward in this memoir, that chlorine is
one of those allotropic bodies having a double form of exist
ence; that, as commonly prepared, it is in             passive state,       its

changes and assumes the active form; and that              this latter             in
state     its
          affinity for hydrogen becomes         great that    so

how it is that after an         exposure   to the sun decomposition is
subsequently carried forward in the dark.

   Now     among     the  physical  facts connected with the theory
types and substitutions, two are prominent:—1st, the union
chlorine with hydrogen, giving rise              the removal      to  that hy                of
drogen         chlorohydric acid; 2nd, the subsequent function
                as
discharged            by
                    the chlorine which has entered                   integrant         as    an

                 as connected with the Theory                 of Substitutions.                      343
portion of the molecule, and occupies the place of the hydro
gen removed. This function is in many instances that of the
 hydrogen itself, and it is this fact which is the remarkable
 point in the phaenomena of substitution, that an intensely elec
 tro-negative body can act the part of a positive body.     It is
 this fact which is leading chemists to the conclusion, that the
properties of compound bodies arise as much from the mode
of grouping of their constituent atoms, as from the qualities of
those atoms themselves.
    But if it be admitted that the experiments related in this
memoir establish the allotropism of chlorine, then it is plain
that a very different, and perhaps satisfactory account, of the
phaenomena of substitution may be given.
    As has already been said, no difficulty can arise in account
ing for the removal of hydrogen from organic bodies, or for
the first fact just alluded          This removal will ensue when
                                            to.
                                                                                                      to an
ever   processes    are resorted     which bring the chlorine into
                                               to
active state.       When we expose acetic acid and chlorine
the sun, the latter becomes active, gains the quality               uniting                of
with    hydrogen,     and chloracetic acid forms.           Probably     the
same change could                     be
                               brought about         the aid       by

 be unembarrassed and distinct; but there are many facts which
 serye to show that the passage from a state of complete acti

 dual steps.    Thus, in carbon itself, there are undoubtedly
 many intermediate stages between the almost spontaneously

      DEAR SIR,
    perusing lately the highly interesting volume on Natu
ON ral Magic by your distinguished co-editor, Sir David
Brewster,     I
           was much struck by his description of matural
phaenomena which had for many years past occupied my con
sideration.
   As one fact which was new to me bears directly upon the
subject of my previous communications to you on the Diffu

matter, I may be allowed to offer some observations upon                               it,

   “Some authors ascribed this fact to the cessation of the
humming of insects, the singing of birds, and the action of the
wind on the leaves of trees; but M. Humboldt justly main
tains that this cannot be the cause of it on the Orinoco, where
the buzz of insects is much louder in the night than in the
day, and where the breeze never rises till after sunset. Hence
he was led to ascribe the phaenomenon to the perfect trans
parency and uniform density of the air, which can exist only
at night after the heat of the ground has been uniformly dif
fused through the atmosphere.               When the rays of the sun

  348           Prof. Grove on Grotthus's Theory of
 ment of the molecules of the three gases concerned must be
 perfectly symmetrical.       I see in this fact a confirmation of an
 idea which    I believe I was the first to announce, of the exist
 ence of an attractive force between mixed gases of a double
 character; in one sense a chemical force, because it exists
 only between the particles of dissimilar gases; in another
 sense a mechanical force, because it obeys a mechanical law,
 —the law of diffusion as ascertained by Prof. Graham.             In
 atmospheric air, which is a mixture, not a chemical combina
 tion, of oxygen and nitrogen, the chemical force is so feeble
 as not to interfere with the communication of sound, as it
 would take place in a homogeneous medium.              But in a mix
 ture of   oxygen,    nitrogen  and   hydrogen,   the conditions are
 changed; the superior chemical affinity of oxygen for hydro
 gen disturbs the mechanical equilibrium of the system; the
 molecules cease to vibrate, as in a homogeneous medium;
 and sound ceases to be communicated, as I infer from the fact
 announced by Sir David Brewster.
    I cannot better conclude these remarks than by adding to
 the interesting facts previously quoted, the explanation of a
 similar phaenomenon which I have never seen noticed before.
 In Lancashire, where I passed the early years of my life,          I
 soon found that it was, among the farmers and country people,
 a traditional observation, that when the distant hills appeared
 unusually distinct, it was a sign of approaching rain. This        I
attribute to the homogeneity of the atmosphere under such
circumstances, with respect to aqueous vapour.
    The whole intervening space between the eye and the           di
stant object is saturated with moisture, and consequently
vision is more perfect, as there are no series of media of dif
ferent densities to interfere with the direct transmission of
light.

LII.    On Grotthus's Theory      of Molecular    Decomposition  and
    Recomposition.      By W. R. G.Rove, Esq., F.R.S., &c., and
    Professor of Natural Philosophy in the London Institution.
                 To Ilichard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S.
      DEAR    SIR,
           great mystery of voltaism, or the phaenomenon of two
THEconstituents        of a chemical compound being eliminated
at distant points without any apparent disturbance in the         in
tervening liquid, is accounted for, as you are well aware, by

                Molecular Decomposition and Recomposition.                                                349
Grotthus, on the supposition of a series of molecular decom
positions and recompositions. This theory has become almost
universally adopted by electro-chemists;                   I have frequently
availed    myself   of it in     my    lectures,   and,   though     with some
doubt and hesitation, have applied it to explain the action of
the gas battery.                   I
                           have ever been anxious, if possible, to ac
count for new      phaenomena        by generally received theories, one
main    object   of a    theory     being    to collate facts in a manner
which may render them conventionally intelligible, while plu
rality of theories introduces anarchy into science.
    It has lately, however, struck me very forcibly that the gas
battery presents a strong objection to the theory of Grotthus,
or in other words, that it places us in a dilemma in which we
must either abandon this theory or the generally received
                              I
views (I think may say established laws) of chemical affinity.
My difficulty is this. In a single pair of the gas battery, we
must, according to the theory of Grotthus, suppose that oxy
gen and hydrogen tear asunder oxygen and hydrogen already
united; for whether we suppose the action to begin at the hy
drogen extremity of the electrolyte, or at the oxygen, or at
both simultaneously, the force which produces the composition
of water is regarded by the theory sufficiently strong to over
come the force by which                               its
                                        constituents are already united,
i.   e.  force
          a        equal is and   unequal                     at
                                                 the same time.
    The gas battery also presents cases where, according                      this                      to
 theory,     more feeble
               a              affinity   overcomes        more   powerfula   one,
 as  when water         the electrolyte and deutoxide

 oxygen the gases: we have indeed some instances                      chemistry               in

350       Messrs. Schlossberger and Kemp on the Proportion                                          of
observed facts go to prove that platinum reduces the gases to
a state analogous to the nascent state, i.e. one at which their
specific chemical energies are at the highest, but it does not
change their specific energies; thus platinum enables gaseous
oxygen to combine with gaseous hydrogen, but it does not
give to oxygen the affinities of chlorine, or to hydrogen those
of potassium.      Even the granting this hypothesis, however,
does not extricate us, as whatever specific power the platinum
may possess in respect to the gas, it must also possess in                                      re
spect to the electrolyte; it can scarcely be supposed to assist
combination and yet not to prevent decomposition of the same
molecule; it is an equation upon any view.

gas battery cells differs from other cases of electrolysis; the
line of discharge in the gas battery affects the magnet, and                                    in

physiological effects, or has presented to the eye of the mind
the important part which these substances perform, as the
above-mentioned distinction, which is also identical with that
of azotised and non-azotised bodies.
    In order to give some indication of the state of confusion
which existed, even in this most elementary proposition of
dietetics, previous to that distinction being made, it may not
be more than necessary to mention the idea of that classical
author, Dr. Prout”, that the nutritive power is in direct pro
portion to the quantity of carbon.             At the present day not a
single fact is known which can support the idea of the animal
body being able to form azotised from non-azotised substances,
—possibly, under the influence of ammonia or of nitrogen
from the atmosphere; on the contrary,                     experiments,    all                               as

   Somewhat more nutritive than milk, and more nearly allied
to cheese, is a series of bodies obtained from the lower orders
of the animal kingdon.          We give here, as examples, the
oyster and one or two others.
   IX. O'418 grm. of the oyster, Ostrea edulis, gave 0.346
grim, of ammonio-chloride of platinum, equal to 5:25 per cent,
of nitrogen.
   As this seemed to us a very low result, we repeated our
analysis, which, however, confirmed our first experiment; in
this case 0.354 grim. giving 0.283 grm. of ammonio-chloride
of platinum, equal to 5:07 per cent. of nitrogen,
   X. 0.354 grim. of the yellow matter (liver and bile) from
the crabfish, Cancer communis, gave 0.418 grm. of ammonio
chloride of platinum, equal to 7:52 per cent. of nitrogen.
   XI. O'377 grim. of the common mussel, Mytilus edulis, gave
0.498 grm. of ammonio-chloride of platinum, equal to 8:41
per cent. of nitrogen.
   XII.   0.308 grm. of the above animal, previously boiled,
gave 0.510 grim. of ammonio-chloride of platinum, equal to
10:51 per cent. of nitrogen.
   We find that many of the organs of the higher animals, for
example, the liver of the ox, nearly agree in the amount of
nitrogen with those substances we have just treated                               of.

the numbers are somewhat lower than might have been ex

    We regret that at the time when these experiments were
 made, we were unable to procure fresh pork, but we thought
 that an examination of the salted and smoked substance would
 not be devoid of interest.
    From these results we see that there is no appreciable
 change produced in the composition of the fibre by the pre
 paration and length of time it had been kept; if however we
 take equal weights of the prepared ham and of the fresh flesh
 of the sow, we shall of course find a considerable difference
 in the amount of nitrogen from the large quantity of salt which
 is present in the prepared ham.           We conclude this account
 of our  experiments    by giving   the  analysis of the white of the
 egg of the barn-door fowl.
    LIV. 0.369 grim. of the white of the egg gave 0.781 grim.
 of ammonio-chloride of platinum, equal to 13:44 per cent. of
 nitrogen.    The quantity of nitrogen in pure albumen, as de
 termined by Mulder, is 15.8 per cent.
    We take the liberty to add to these experiments the follow
 ing remarks:—The proportion of nitrogen in purified mus
 cular fibre seems to be identical, from whatever part of the
 animal kingdom it may be obtained; and the differences given
 by the results of analysis may be fully explained by the diffi
 culty, or even impossibility, of analysing it in an equally pure
 or impure condition, as obtained from different animals, in
 which it is always mixed with cellular tissue, minute vessels
 and nerves.      Moreover, it is extremely difficult to get rid of
 traces of fat and hematine.
    That the chemical properties of muscular fibre in the whole
 animal kingdom are identical, one of us endeavoured to prove
 in a former research (Schlossberger, Pergleichende Unter
suchungen uber das Fleisch verschiedener Thiere.           Stuttgardt,
 1840). In contradiction to a         very   generally-received   opi
 nion, it appears to us that the muscles of fish are as rich in   ni
 trogen as those of higher animals; at first sight, however, owing
 to the presence of a greater quantity of water, and in some
 fishes, as the eel, to a difficultly separable fat, its  amount ap
pears very much lower. Further,        as   the proximate principles
 are  essentially the same     inboth classes  of   animals,
                                                           it   seems
to   us that they should      equally nutritive, although this pro
                              be
 position     also directly opposed
             is                      to    another very general pre
judice. According        to our   scale,  the oyster does not seem

 nearly so nourishing as it is generally reputed to be by com
  mon opinion, although it is possible that the proteine com
  pounds in the lower classes of animals may be found to be
  much richer in phosphorus, in sulphur, and in phosphates
 than in the higher.    Should this prove to be the case, we can
 see, that although the proportion of nitrogen may not be so
 great, nevertheless that they might act more powerfully as
 stimulants, which, as regards the oyster, is believed by some
 of our best physicians. We intend in a future series of expe
 riments to direct our attention to this part of the subject.
     In order that our views on this subject should not be mis
 understood, it is necessary for us to state, that we do not con
 sider the proportion of nitrogen, taken alone, to be an absolute
 measure of the nutritive power of our aliments; but as there
 is a total want of any positive data in regard to this subject,
 and as so many different and contradictory opinions are given
 in the works on dietetics”, it must be granted that any                                                at
 tempt to fix a standard for comparison is not without interest.
    With respect to the capability for nutrition, we are far from
 denying that the physical condition, the state of admixture,
 the peculiar kind of proteine compound, the amount of water
 and other inorganic matters, of fat, and lastly, the effects of
 cookery, must necessarily have a very great influence on the
 physiological effects of our aliments.
    There is one consideration in particular which requires to
 be noticed, namely the distinction between the absolute amount
 of nutritive matter and that portion of it which is in such a
state as to be easily digested and assimilated by the system,
in the same way as a soil produced from minerals abounding
in alkaline salts is not always the most fertile as regards plants
with a predominance of alkaline bases, but the fertility of
which depends on the amount of these bodies contained in a
state in which they can be taken up and made use of by the
plant. Thus an aliment abounding in nutritive matter may
be inferior to one with a much smaller quantity as regards the
nourishing effects produced by                     it;
                                            the first    if   in

only    apart,   the second the whole
                        in               may       easily  absorbed       be
and assimilated.     Here                    we
                                must rely upon the experiments
of  the physiologist        the degree

in the elucidation of this point.         If   the work were once fairly
begun by the physiologist, chemistry would not be long in
rendering that assistance which would then be found neces
sary; for example, in the various experiments which might be
made in artificial digestion, from the results of which as one
element in the calculation taken along with the proportion of
nitrogen as the other, it would at once be possible to deter
mine scientifically the real nutritive value of the different kinds
of aliment; the importance to our dietetics of this method of
determination, which at present exists only in idea, would
then not only be felt by the patient, but by the whole human
race.

LV.    On the Oil produced by the Action of Chlorine on Cin

of a remarkable oily compound which is invariably formed
whenever cinnamic acid is heated in contact with either chlo
rine or hypochlorous acid. I shall now proceed to detail
some additional observations which I have been able subse

   The growth of green con<U+017F>erve in this water is extremely
rapid, and occasions inconvenience when the water is kept in
open tanks.   It is a subject perhaps worthy of inquiry, whe
ther the value of some waters for irrigation may not depend
upon their containing phosphoric acid, this constituent having
hitherto been generally overlooked in waters.

Th;        alloy in question was obtained from the worn-out
      amalgamated zinc plates used in the voltaic battery after
the mercury had been recovered by distillation.         As the sul
phate of zinc, resulting from the solution of the zinc in the
battery, is exceedingly pure, it follows that the residue of the
plates contains, besides the mercury used for amalgamation,
most of the impurities contained originally in the whole plates,
and the metal obtained therefrom is consequently much infe
rior in quality to the original rolled zinc.
   Zinc in a       state for rolling
                  fit                   obtained

to  cool down      to  certain point after fusion, the metal left be
                        a
hind being less pure than that which flows off. The manu
facturer who furnishes me with rolled zinc and takes back the
zinc obtained from the worn-out plates, informed me that the
latter isunprofitable    re-work from

        Mr. De la Rue on a Crystallized Alloy of 2inc.                871
stirring well; after the oxide had been withdrawn the metal
was removed to another vessel to cool; it weighed about 15 lbs.
When partially solidified the fluid portion was drained off,
leaving a considerable portion of the metal in a spongy state,
and occupying the same bulk as the whole mass; one part of
zinc plate residues usually gives the following results:—
                    Zinc . . . . . . .673
                     Mercury . . . . .043

                                                1°000
this average being taken on a quantity of old plates amounting
to 24 hundred weight.
   The spongy residue, examined with the microscope under a
power of twenty to fifty times linear, proved to be composed
of minute, perfectly clean and well-formed crystals of the form
of right rhombic prisms; their breadth varying from the
gloth to sºuth of an inch; the angles of the base are of about
 119° and 61° respectively.
   A selected portion, free from scoria, weighing             5 grammes,
was subjected to analysis, and found to be an alloy of zinc,
iron, lead and copper.        After solution in nitric acid the lead
was separated as sulphate, which weighed 441 grm.
   The copper being precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen
and then converted into oxide weighed '09 gramme.                     The
iron being thrown down as succinate from the neutralized solu
tion, and after the removal of the soluble salts, washed with
ammonia, and ignited, there resulted 1847 gramme of per
oxide of iron.
   The zinc, precipitated by carbonate of soda, gave when
ignited 5-6213 grammes of oxide of zinc.
   These results give the following composition of the alloy —

   It is possible that these substances may be combined into
proximate constituents, and the alloy be a compound of these,
but we have no data for so grouping them.            On re-melting,
however, a portion of these crystals, the mass separated into
two portions,—a metal considerably more fluid, and a com
pound more infusible than the crystals; these I have not
examined.
    From the preceding analysis, it will be seen that a portion
of alloy amounting to but 10 per cent, is capable of retaining
in combination 90 per cent. of zinc: this will account for the
large portion of difficultly fusible metal in a pasty state which
frequently rises to the top of the melting-pot in fusing com
mercial zinc, and which is probably an alloy of zinc combined
with but a small portion of other metals.
               LVIII.     Some  Experiments   on Ozone.
                 By A. W. WILLIAMson, Esq. *
 IT     has been satisfactorily proved by Marignact, that the
     phaenomena attributed to ozone have no connexion with
the presence of nitrogen. He finds that the ozone odour may
be developed in liquids free from nitrogen as well as in those
which contain that element.         He decomposed by the voltaic
current a portion of water from which atmospheric air was
carefully excluded, and found that the peculiar smell of ozone
was given off, as abundantly after a continuance of the action
for several days, when a quarter of the liquid had disappeared
in the form of gas, as at the beginning of the decomposition.
Marignac confirms Schönbein’s statement, that the odorous
matter in air acted upon by phosphorus, is identical with that
present in the oxygen set free by the electrolytical decompo
sition of water; and indeed recommends, as the most con
venient way of preparing ozone, to pass atmospheric air over
phosphorus. The substance made use of in his researches
was thus prepared.
    The object of the experiments I am about to describe was
to obtain some explanation of the phaenomena which gave
rise to the supposition of the existence of such a body as ozone.
The poles of a Bunsen's battery, consisting of four elements,
were plunged into sulphuric acid diluted with three volumes
of water. The hydrogen from the copper plate at which it
was evolved was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.           The
oxygen which was evolved upon a plate of platinum was col

oxygen and that produced by the action of phosphorus on
atmospheric air. To what then is to be attributed the reaction
produced by the direct action of air passed over phosphorus
on iodide of potassium and starch 2 . The following experi
ment was made. In a long and wide tube loose pieces of
asbestos and pieces of phosphorus were placed alternately.
By heating the tube thus filled the phosphorus was partly
melted into the asbestos, and partly sublimed upon it; thus
exposing a far greater surface than in the former experiments.
   After the tube had completely cooled, atmospheric air was
driven through it into the iodide and starch, but not the
slightest reaction was produced.
   This result plainly indicates the cause of the reaction in the
preceding instance. The phosphorus was there unable for
want of sufficient surface to absorb            the oxygen      all

     The bleaching action which the substance contained in elec
trolytical oxygen produces when dry on litmus paper, is a fact
which of itself indicates that it must be a peroxide. It is well

such combinations of oxygen as give up this element with
great ease, as for instance hypochlorous acid.

         obtaining the Sesqui-ferrocyanide                    of Potassium.        385
I   made use of this property with the view of preparing a com
paratively considerable quantity of the last-named salt. To
                          I
arrive at this end, put into each of twelve large balloons filled
 with atmospheric air a piece of pure phosphorus, an inch long,
in such a manner that half of the bulk of the pieces of phospho
rus was immersed in water, whilst the other half was exposed
to the action of the ambient air. I left the whole to itself at
a temperature of 70° F. for about twelve hours, after which
time the atmospheres of the vessels appeared to be so much
charged with ozone, that their smell resembled that of chlo
rine; paste of starch containing some iodide of potassium be
came instantaneously black in them, litmus paper was bleached
within a few minutes, &c.
    Things being in this state, the acid was carefully removed
from the balloons by rinsing them with distilled water, and
then an aqueous solution of the yellow prussiate was poured
into one of the vessels.         I need not say, that in shaking the
solution with the ozonized atmosphere of the balloon, the odo
riferous principle disappeared almost instantaneously.             After
the ozone had been entirely taken up, the solution was trans
ferred to a second balloon and shaken; from thence poured
into a third vessel, and so on until ozone acted no further upon
the liquid, or what comes to the same thing, until the solution
                                        ºf
no longer yielded prussian blue with nitrate of peroxide of
iron.     The solution, on being now sufficiently evaporated,
yielded most beautiful                    of the red cyanide.       It is
worth while to state       here,  that under the circumstances men
tioned so much ozone had been developed, that the ozonized
air of two balloons was sufficient to transform completely
5 grammes of the yellow crystallized salt into the sesqui-cya
nide. The formation of this compound depending upon the
elimination of part of the potassium contained in the yellow
   russiate, it follows that besides the red cyanide another alka
  ine substance must be formed.            What that compound                      is,
                                                                                     I

                                   to but    have reasons which make
                                              I
me inclined     to   believe that ozone combines with some po
 tassium, changing the latter into            peculiar peroxide      that     of
 metal soluble   in   water and able              to a
                                             co-exist with the red cya
 nide. Those reasons are, that the solution              the yellow cya
                                                                of
nide, after having been decomposed                       by
                                                 ozone, exhibits   much   a
 stronger alkaline reaction than the yellow salt does; and that
 the said solution,           by
                             being acidulated with dilute sulphuric
 acid, colours deeply the paste              of

the present state of science renders it rather more than pro
bable, that that agent, powerful as it is in other respects, is      in
capable of causing in a direct manner any material change in
the chemical bearings of elementary bodies.
    If the conclusion drawn by the distinguished philosophers of
Geneva should happen to be correct, the transformation of
common oxygen into ozone by electrical action would be a
case quite unique, and on that very account of the utmost
scientific importance. Such a fact would indeed almost imply
the possibility of transforming one elementary body into an
other by the agency of electricity, for in many respects ozone
differs as materially from oxygen as any two heterogeneous
bodies can possibly do. It is true, modern chemistry has made
us acquainted with a number of facts which prove that under
given circumstances the same elementary substance may exist
in different conditions. Those peculiar states have, however,
as far as I know, not yet been observed in any gaseous ele
mentary body”; and it is further known that the allotropical
modifications of simple bodies have as yet been brought about
by the agency of heat only, and in no case by that of electri
city.     It is said that chlorine, after having been exposed to
the action of solar light, enjoys the power of combining with
hydrogen in the dark, and at the common temperature. Sup
posing Dr. Draper's observation fully correct, the elementary
nature of chlorine is not half so certain as that of oxygen; and
then we must bear in mind that the modification which chlo
rine undergoes under the influence of light is insignificant if
compared to that which oxygen is said to suffer when exposed
to the action of electricity.
    If  ozone be nothing but oxygen modified by electrical influ
ence, it follows that a given volume of absolutely pure, i. e.
anhydrous oxygen, when sufficiently long acted upon by elec
 trical sparks, must be entirely transformed into ozone, i. e.
 changed in such a way as to be readily and completely taken
 up by a solution of iodide of potassium or of the yellow ferro
 cyanide of potassium.        An experiment of that kind has not
 yet been made; but if any chemist succeeds in transforming
 one cubic inch only of what is called completely dry oxygen
 into ozone, we must admit the correctness of the conclusion
 of the philosophers of Geneva, extraordinary as it may appear
 to us. Before such a decisive result is obtained,           I continue
 to consider ozone as a       peculiar   peroxide  of  hydrogen;    and
 the principal reasons which determine me to maintain that
 view are the following:—
     1. Ozone is such a powerfully-smelling        substance, that   in

 finitely small quantities are capable    of affecting the olfactory
 netwes.
    2. Quantities of ozone, by far too minute to be ascertained
 by weight, still perceptibly colour the test-paste.
     Hence it follows that a quantity of aqueous vapour, so small
 as cannot be ascertained even by our most delicate hygro
 scopical tests, is sufficiently large to produce with oxygen so
 much ozone, that the presence of the latter is detected both
 by the nose and the test-paste.      MM. De la Rive's and Ma
 rignac's conclusion is founded upon the assumption that the
 oxygen with which they made their experiments was abso
 lutely dry; and if chemists admit that moist oxygen, after ha
 ving passed through strong sulphuric acid, does not contain
 any trace of aqueous vapour, this inference is drawn from the
fact, that in oxygen treated in the manner indicated, no water
 can be detected by any hygroscopical means hitherto known.
 It is however very possible that minute quantities of vapour
 escape the hygroscopic action of sulphuric acid; it is very
 possible also that oxygen obtained even from melted chlo
 rate of potash still contains some traces of water, and that
 those minute quantities of vapour are large enough to pro
duce ozone sufficient to colour the test-paste and affect the
sense of smelling.      Such a conjecture seems indeed to be far
less bold and more in accordance with the present state of
chemical science, than the view which MM. De la Rive and
 Marignac have taken of the subject. If my opinion should
happen to be correct, the very property exhibited by oxygen,
of producing traces of ozone when the former happens to be
exposed to electrical action, would prove the most delicate
means of detecting the minutest quantities of vapour contained
in that gas.
    In forming a judgement respecting the nature of ozone,         I
think one thing ought not to be left entirely out of consider
ation, namely the fact, that in spite of some material differ
ences of properties which exist between ozone and Thenard's
peroxide of hydrogen, both bodies exhibit many chemical
bearings very similar to each other. Both substances possess
bleaching powers, both of them transform a number of metallic
protoxides into peroxides, both produce sulphuric acid if added
to sulphurous acid, both are destroyed by a great number of
organic matters, &c.
    I  myself and M. Marignac have ascertained that ozone is
destroyed when exposed to a certain degree of temperature.
Now that chemist must admit that heat has the power to an
                                             f
nihilate the peculiar condition which oxygen is said to assume
when placed under electrical influence.         appears to me that

   The experiments recorded in this paper were undertaken princi
pally with the ultimate view of ascertaining with exactness what
quantity of inorganic matter is removed from the soil by the seeds
of a crop of wheat. The author first inquires what is the average
amount of the inorganic or incombustible portion of a given quan
tity of wheat; a question to which no satisfactory answer has yet
been given.        The result of the author's experiments              that wheat                             is,

             Electro-Physiological Researches." Memoir First.
By Professor Carlo Matteucci. Communicated by Michael Fara
day, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S.
   The author describes several arrangements by which he was en
abled to make new experiments in confirmation of the laws of mus
cular currents, of which he has given an account in his recent work,
 entitled “Traité des Phénomènes Electro-Physiologiques des Ani
 maux." He finds that, in these experiments, the employment of a gal
 vanometer is unnecessary, as the sensibility of the electroscopic frog

    The general results obtained from these experiments are the fol
lowing.
    In the first place, the intensity and duration of the muscular cur
rent is independent of the nature of the gas in which the muscular
pile is immersed. Secondly, it is altogether independent of the ce
rebro-spinal portion of the nervous system. Thirdly, the circum
stances which exercise a marked influence on                               its

opposition to the generally received opinion, that the mercury in the
barometer has always a tendency to fall when the wind is strong.
During a period of fifteen years passed in the Gulf and River St.
Lawrence, he found that the barometer as frequently rises as falls
under the prevalence of a strong wind; and that the winds often
blow with greater force with a rising than with a falling barometer.
He gives a circumstantial account of the progress and course of va
rious gales which fell under his observation during that period, and
from which he infers the existence of a steady connexion between
the prevailing winds of this region and the movements of the baro
meter, and enters into an inquiry into the mode in which that in
strument is affected by them. The extensive valley of the St. Law
rence is bounded at                  its
                             lower part, for    distance      nearly 500

tion.   Within this space, the ordinary winds follow the course       the                                of
river; and      almost every instance when they approach from wind
                in
ward, the barometer rises with them; and when, on the other hand,
the wind approaches from leeward, the barometer not only falls be
fore the arrival          of
                    the wind, but continues        fall until    has sub to                   it

    The author, referring          paper      his publishedof     the Philoso

                                                                     in

some of the experiments therein contained, he was led to those which
form the subject of the present memoir. With the form of gas bat
tery last described in that paper, by which the interfering action of
the external air is excluded, he finds that deutoxide of nitrogen as
sociated with oxygen gives a continuous voltaic current; and that
the volumes respectively absorbed by the electrolyte are as four to
one, indicating the formation of hyponitrous acid.
    Passing to the more immediate object of the present paper, he states
that having observed nitrogen procured by the combustion of phos
phorus to give rise, in the gas battery, to a temporary voltaic cur
rent, he was led to believe that phosphorus, although an insoluble
non-conductor, might, by means of the gas battery, be made the
excitant of a continuous voltaic current, analogous to the zinc ele
ment of an ordinary voltaic combination. This expectation was ve
rified by experiments, a series of which is given; phosphorus being
suspended in various gases and voltaically associated with oxygen.
The experiments were continued during several months, and the
results indicated the same consumption of phosphorus with reference
to the oxygen, as would occur by the formation of phosphorous acid;
the phosphorus being thus burned by oxygen at a distance. Phos
phorus and iodine, both non-conducting solids, being each suspended
in nitrogen in the associated tubes of a gas battery, give a continu
ous voltaic current, and are consumed in equivalent ratios. Sulphur,
suspended in nitrogen and associated with oxygen, gives a voltaic
current when fused. Other volatile electro-positive bodies, such as
camphor, essential oils, aether and alcohol, when placed in nitrogen
and associated with oxygen, gave a continuous voltaic current.
    The author observes that the gas battery which in his former ex
periments introduced gases, by the present experiments renders solid
 and liquid insoluble non-conductors the exciting constituents of vol
 taic combinations, and enables us to ascertain their electro-chemical
 relations: it also introduces the galvanometer as a test of vaporiza
 tion.
    A new form of gas battery is described, in which an indefinite
 number of cells are charged by the hydrogen evolved from a single
 piece of zinc ; the oxygen of the atmosphere supplying the electro
 negative element. The charge of the battery is self-sustained, in a
 manner somewhat similar to the Doebereiner light apparatus.

reference to the forms and structure of Clouds, Films and Mem
branes."     By William Addison, Esq., F.L.S.
    In the course of his researches into the nature and origin of tu
bercles in the lungs, and into the physical properties of the secre
tions of the human structure, the author had occasion to notice va
rious fibrous and membranous forms arising solely from physical
agencies. On pursuing the inquiry, he observed a class of phaeno
mena indicating some peculiar modifications of the force of cohesion.
Thus he found that transparent liquid streams are visible when va
pours or fluids mingle with one another, and also when solids are
dissolving in a fluid, and that opake deposits, assuming the appear
ance of clouds, form on those streams, rendering visible the lines
of junction of two fluid or gaseous surfaces. A great number of
experiments are described illustrating these general facts, which are
afterwards applied to explain various phaenomena of clouds, films
and membranous formations, resulting from the operation of the
different cohesive forces which are called into action, under a diver
sity of circumstances, when liquid or gaseous bodies are brought
into mutual contact.

     From the results of a comparison made by the author of the
 weight of the ashes obtained from a quantity of bread, equal to that
 which was the sole food of two mice during thirty-eight days, with
 the weight of the ashes of their excretions during the same period,
 it appeared that the latter exceeded the former in the proportion of
 1334 to 934. The amount of soluble salts was also found to be
 greater in the latter than in the former.       From these data, the
 author infers that both alkaline and earthy bodies are formed out
 of their elements by the animal system, and found in their excre
 tions.

causes which determine an excess or a deficiency of these salts in the

the existence of some alkaline phosphate, or of some carbonated alkali

   “On the Nerves of the Uterus." By Thomas S. Beck, Esq.
Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
   The object of the author in this communication is to record the
results of his dissections of the nerves of the uterus, both in the unim
pregnated and gravid states, with a view to determine if any changes
are observable in them in these two conditions.         He enters minutely
into the anatomical details of the formation of the great splanchnic
nerve, the composition of the semilunar ganglion, and the distribu
tion of the branches proceeding from it to the different abdominal
viscera.    His conclusions are, that while the ovaria derive their
nerves from the venal, the fallopian tubes from the hypogastric, and
the bladder, rectum and vagina from the pelvic plexus, the nerves
supplying the uterus are continuations of the hypogastric plexus,
and that they undergo, during pregnancy, no further change, either
in size or position, except that which is the simple consequence of
the enlargement of the organ over which they are distributed, and
that they undergo no other change during a second pregnancy. He
thinks it probable, moreover, that the vessels of the uterus do not
decrease in size after parturition, but are only contracted in their
cavity.    He notices several points relating to these subjects, which
are still open to further investigation.        The paper is accompanied
by highly finished drawings of the appearance of the dissected parts.
   “On a Peculiar Source of Deterioration of the Magnetic Powers
of Steel Bars.” By William Sturgeon, Esq. Communicated by
S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
   The author concludes, from various experiments on the changes
in the magnetic force of steel magnets produced by subjecting them
to blows with a wooden mallet, or other modes of creating tremors
or vibrations among their particles, that the most apparently trifling
mechanical agitation is sufficient to occasion a considerable diminu
tion of magnetic power; that this loss, when it has taken place from
such a cause, is permanent; and that in every case, after reaching a
certain point, it attains
                                   of its

    “Observations on the Growth and Development of the Epider
 mis.” By Erasmus Wilson, Esq., F.R.S., Lecturer on Anatomy and
 Physiology in the Middlesex Hospital.
    The author adduces evidence derived from his microscopic obser
 vations, in confirmation of the commonly received doctrine respect
 ing the origin of the cells of the epidermis and epithelium generally,
 from the materials furnished by the liquor sanguinis or plasma of
 the blood; which fluid, passing by endosmosis through the walls of
 the capillary vessels and peripheral boundary of the surface, deve
 lopes granules by a vital process, analogous to coagulation.        On a
 careful examination of the inner surface of the epidermis with the
 aid of the microscope, he finds it to be composed of four kinds of
 elements, arranged in such a manner as to constitute an irregular
 plane, similar to a tesselated or mosaic pavement. These elements
are, 1. Granules, which the author terms primitive, of a globular
form, solid and apparently homogeneous, and measuring about
 1-20,000th part of an inch in diameter. 2. Aggregated granules,
having about double the diameter of the former and apparently com
posed of as many of these as can be aggregated together without
leaving an unoccupied space in the centre of the mass. 3. Nucleated
granules measuring in diameter from the 6000th to the 4000th part
of an inch, each being composed of an aggregated granule as a
nucleus, enveloped by a single layer of aggregated granules, giving
to the whole mass an oval or circular, and at the same time flat
tened shape.     Their constituent granules have acquired, during this
aggregation, greater density, and are separated from each other by
distinct interstitial spaces filled with a transparent homogeneous sub
stance.    4. Nucleolo-nucleolated cells pervading the deep stratum of
the epidermis, and of which the longer diameter measures from the
3000th to the 2500th part of an inch. These cells, which constitute
the principal portion, and may be regarded as the chief constituent
of the epidermis, are formed from the nucleolated granules, on the ex
terior of which there is superposed a transparent layer, bounded by a
well-defined outline, by the dark interstitial substance of the wall of the
cell; the nucleolated granule being the nucleus, and the aggregated
granule the nucleolus of these primitive cells of the epidermis. The
author is of opinion that the nuclei, up to a certain point, grow with
the cells, by the separation of the original granules from the deposi
tion between them of interstitial matter, and also by the cleavage of
the latter and the consequent multiplication of the granules. This
peripheral growth of the cells is totally different from the mode of
growth described by Schwann, and explains the disappearance of the
nucleus in the scales of the epidermis. The observations of the
author lead him to believe that the same process of development and
of growth is followed in the epithelium as in the epidermis; and he
offers evidence, showing that similar arrangements take place in the
cells of melanosis, in the pigment cells of the choroid membrane of
the eye, and in those of the skin of the negro.

     <&
               the Temperature         of Man.”                By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S.
L. &      E.
   Having in a former paper shown that, contrary to a commonly
received opinion, the temperature of the human body, as mea
sured by a thermometer placed under the tongue, is not a constant
one, the author has resumed the inquiry, and gives, in the present
paper, the results of numerous observations made with a particular
instrument constructed for the purpose, admitting of minute accu
racy (each degree of the scale being divided into ten parts), and
when used with the precautions pointed out, affording satisfactory
indications in many problems which may be proposed relative to the
temperature of man, &c., and confines himself to a small number,
offering the information he brings forward only as a preliminary
contribution in aid of their solution.
    The paper is divided into seven sections.
    The first treats of variations of temperature during the twenty-four
hours. The author finds from his observations, that the temperature
is highest in the morning, on rising after sleep; that it continues
 high, but fluctuating, till the evening; and that it is lowest about
midnight, ranging on an average from 987 to 97-9.
    The second, of variations during the different seasons. These, he
finds, bear some relation to the temperature of the air, but less than
 might be expected; which he attributes to the majority of the ob
servations having been made within doors, under circumstances pe
 culiarly favourable to uniformity.
    The third, of the influence of active exercise on the temperature.
 The effect of this, when not carried to the length of exhausting fa
 tigue, he finds to be elevating; and that the augmentation                    within          is,
a   certain limit, proportional         the degree
                                            to                        of

    “On Ozone.” By C. F. Schoenbein, Professor of Chemistry at
Basle, in a letter to Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S. Com
municated by Michael Faraday, Esq.
    The author finds that the peculiar substance he has denominated
ozone, and which, reverting to the opinion he originally entertained,
he now believes to be a compound of oxygen and hydrogen, is ob
tained readily and in great abundance by placing phosphorus in im
mediate contact with water and atmospheric air at a temperature of
about 30° Cent, but that none is produced when water is absent.
Heat was found to effect the decomposition of ozone. He infers,
both from his own experiments and those of M. Marignac, that the
presence of nitrogen, instead of being essential to the formation of
ozone, as he formerly believed, does not in reality contribute in any
way to the production of that substance.

 Sec. R.S. By William Ford Stevenson, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author adduces two experiments, of placing before the eye an
object, the ends of which are marked, in a vertical position, as
“clearly demonstrating that objects are not presented to the mind
as they are found upon the retina, but in the actual position in which
they are placed before the spectator.”
    “On the Compounds of Tin and Iodine.” By Thomas H. Henry,
 Esq. Communicated by Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S.
    Different properties have been assigned by different authors (as
 Sir Humphry Davy, Gay-Lussac, Boullay and Rammelsberg) to a
 combination of tin with iodine.          With a view to explain these dis
 cordances, the author instituted the series of experiments detailed
 in this paper, and which have led him to the conclusion that the
substance obtained by heating tin with twice                  its

         ON THE RED COLOUR OF LITH ARGE.       B.Y. M. LEBLANC.
THE      author remarks, that M. Fournet         opinion that red            is    of                                 li
       tharge contains more oxygen than yellow litharge, and that                                                      it
owes        its
          colour     certain proportion
                             to  a       minium; and several spe        of
cimens yielded him unquestionable traces            M. Thenard and              of of
most other chemists attribute the colour      litharge     the same                it.              to
cause.
    The author, without denying that litharge slowly cooled                                                     may    in
certain   circumstances absorb oxygen and give rise               minium, and                  to

assigned for the production           red litharge; and his grounds for this
                                                         of
opinion are the following:—1st, the red litharge which               examined                        he
yielded           no

                            heat; 2nd, the same litharge, carefully exa
mined by means         pure nitric acid, gave
                              of                    binoxide               no

              of                    yellow litharge, without even modifying
                                                 to
its tint, was discoverable by this test; 3rd, red litharge, heated                                                    to

the weight of which served to calculate the oxygen contained in the
mineral above the protoxide.
   The liquor derived from treating the black mineral with hydro
chloric acid was filtered, then evaporated to dryness to separate some
flocculi of silica, and again filtered; the manganese, iron and lime
were separated by the means already described; no magnesia was
found.
   The residue unattacked by the hydrochloric acid was calcined and
weighed, the gelatinous silica was then separated by liquid potash;
the portion insoluble in the alkali consisted of small rose-coloured
grains, which, examined by the glass, appeared to be perfectly simi
lar to the bisilicate from the centre of the specimen. In fact, by
acting upon this matter by carbonate of soda in the platina crucible,
there was separated by acid 0.48 of its weight of gelatinous silica, a
quantity very near that obtained by the analyses of the bisilicate.
   To estimate the water of the black mineral, a portion of it was
heated in hydrogen, by employing a platina crucible with a tubulated
cover; a greenish substance was obtained which was acted upon by
hydrochloric acid without evolving any chlorine.                            The loss of
weight of the mineral heated in the hydrogen consisted of,-1st, the
water; 2nd, the oxygen above that which corresponded to protoxide,
which was known by the weight of the sulphate of barytes, so that
the difference of the loss in the current of hydrogen would give the
Water.

   When it is considered that the rose-coloured silicate is acted upon
by boiling in hydrochloric acid, it will be admitted as probable, that
the small portion of gelatinous silica occurring in the analyses is
derived from a portion of the bisilicate.                 Admitting this supposition,
and  subtracting   from the      quantity       of  protoxide       of manganese found
that which   corresponds       to the     gelatinous         silica,   and which is 2:10,
the  remainder,   40.90,     contains a       quantity        of  oxygen    equal to that
occurring in the sulphurous acid. It may also be concluded that the
black substance is a mixture of hydrates of peroxide of manganese
and iron, with a certain proportion of unaltered bisilicate.
   If also this composition be compared with that of the rose-co
loured matter, it will be seen,_1st, that the silica and the magnesia
have completely disappeared during decomposition, as well as the
greater part of the lime; 2nd, that the protoxides of iron and of
manganese are converted into hydrates of peroxides, and occur in
the black substance in the same relation as in the unaltered mineral.

   We are therefore able artificially to reproduce hydrophane, this
rare variety of quartz, and the curious property of which had struck
mineralogists.
   A very small proportion of foreign substances suffices in fact to
modify the translucidity and the appearance of the hydrate of silica;
thus a small flask containing silicic aether having been closed by mis
take with a cork, which belonged to a bottle full of creosote, the
aether, on becoming coagulated under the action of moist air, yielded
a slightly yellowish silica, and merely translucid like chalcedony;
the product thus obtained was not hydrophanous.

         To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
     From the many able papers which occasionally appear in your
Journal on photography, by Sir  J. Herschel, Messrs. Talbot, Hunt
 and others, I am induced to believe that any facts bearing on that
 most interesting subject will be welcome.          I therefore hasten to
communicate them for the information of your numerous readers.
    My attention has lately been directed to ascertain what other sub
 stances besides chlorine and bromine, separately and combined, pos
 sessed the property of accelerating the action of light on a Daguer
 rean or iodized plate; and after many trials, I found that the vapour
 of ammonia possesses this singular quality in a very remarkable de
 gree. I first employed it with iodine alone, by simply iodizing a plate
to a full yellow colour, and then exposed it for a few seconds to the
 vapour of ammonia in an exceedingly attenuated state by adding a few
 drops of strong ammonia to a little water, just sufficient to recognise
it by its odour; thus prepared it was placed in the camera, and pro
duced a perfect impression of a building in half a minute in mode
rate sunshine; and several other experiments satisfied me that am
moniacal vapour has a very quickening action on iodine alone.          My
next step was to ascertain how it would operate with bromine; ex
pecting it would either destroy or accelerate             action,  was re
                                                                 its          I

  LXIV.    On the Comets which have     been discovered  since  July
                   1844.    By J. R. HIND, Esq.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
 II   HAVE    prepared, at the request of Mr. Bishop, a few re
       marks on the comets which have recently appeared, and
    forward them in the hope that they may be found useful to
 those who desire information on the subject without possessing
 the various astronomical publications in which it is generally
 to be found.
    I also avail myself of the present opportunity to inclose you
 some results which I have lately obtained for early comets, by
 means of the Chinese Astronomical Annals.
                   I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
                               Your most obedient Servant,
                                                   J. R. HIND.
    On the night of July 7, 1844, M. Mauvais discovered a
telescopic comet in the constellation Hercules: it was de
tected at Berlin by M. d’Arrest on the 9th.           During the
month of    August   this comet was    easily observable;   it pre
sented a fine round nebulosity with a lucid point about the
centre, and was distinctly seen in the strong twilight.      It was
followed by European astronomers until the second week in
September, when it became invisible from proximity to the
sun. Within ten days after perihelion passage (October 17),
Mr. Mann rediscovered it at the Royal Observatory, Cape of
Good Hope, with the assistance of an ephemeris calculated
by M. Nicolai, and forwarded to the colony by the Astrono
mer Royal.      From this time until March iO, Mr. Mann ob
served it most indefatigably; and he has furnished us with a
series of measures which will prove of the greatest value in

final researches on the elements. At the latter end of January,
Professor Encke with the Berlin refractor, Mr. Lassell at                                           Li
verpool, and many others again observed the comet. I caught
sight of it on February 2, when it was seen without much
difficulty in Mr. Bishop's eleven-foot refractor: the state of
the atmosphere near the horizon prevented our taking obser
vations at an earlier date.
   The parabolic elements of this comet have been computed
by many astronomers. M. Nicolai has based his calculations
on four normal positions, three before and one after the peri
helion passage; his results are almost identical with my own,
obtained from three observations, July 8, November 2, and
 February 8.

usual among astronomers, viz.        the ecliptic   on the node and             to

of the reduced Cape observations.       M. Nicolai suggests that
the slight differences between his calculations and the normal
positions may arise from eccentricity       the orbit.         in

rabola would not satisfy the observations, and M. Faye                                              byof
the Royal Observatory, Paris, calculated the elements
Gauss's general method, from which           was evident that the

    Faye and Nicolai reckon their longitudes from the mean
equinox at the commencement of 1845.                        Goldschmidt counts
from mean equinox of 1844, Sept. 21.5, and                          I  have referred
my node and perihelion to the apparent equinox of Sept. 30.
    The first comet of De Vico was not generally observed after
the end of November.               With the great equatoreal at Cam
bridge, it was observed until December 7; I observed it on
December 6 with Mr. Bishop's refractor, and perceived it for
the last time on the 30th of December.                          The comet had a
bright nucleus, and, during the month of September, a short
fan-like tail.
    Dr. Brünnow of Berlin writes me that he is making a com
plete investigation on the elements of this comet, taking ac
count of the higher powers of the masses in the calculation of
planetary perturbations.               This is precisely the discussion
most desirable for comets of short period, as a basis on which
future investigations may be erected.                       We shall probably
learn more        respecting    the   resisting     medium brought to light
by Encke, after the completion of another revolution of
De Vico's comet.
                          Great Comet        of 1844–45.
    About the middle of December 1844, a very fine comet be
came visible in the southern hemisphere, in the constellation
Grus. It was seen at the Cape of Good Hope on December
 18; Mr. Caldecott saw it at Trevandrum on December 30;
and it was observed by Mr. Taylor at the Madras Observa
tory on January 5. The tail was from 7” to 10 in length,
the nucleus distinct and resembling a star of the fifth magni
tude. On 1)ecember 28, the tail was found to be slightly
                                       2  E    2

412                        Mr.   J.   R. Hind         on the Comets
curved towards the north.           Mr. Maclear considered the ge
neral outline “more sharp and clear than the great comet of
March 1843.”
   This comet was found by M. Colla at Parma on February 5,
                                                 ...
and by Dr. Peters and Mr. Cooper at Naples on February 7.
I saw it with great difficulty on                3, and Professor Challis
observed it until the 11th of that month with the great equa
toreal at Cambridge.          When I found the comet on March 3,
it was barely perceptible in a dark field, and was observable
 with extreme difficulty.        A faint oval nebulosity was              that            ali
         be distinguished             large

creasing slightly towards the extremity.                     borders were Its
comparatively well-defined, and the light gradually diminished

                                                         and a tail 2° in
                                                        On June 9, with
 a low power on Mr. Bishop's refractor, the tail was evidently
 bifid; one well-defined branch extended to a distance of about
 24° from the nucleus, the other train was much shorter and
                        The tail was far brighter on the preceding
 than on the following side. In about a week from this time,
 a coma formed round the nucleus, and the tail assumed a fan
 like form, somewhat diminishing in length. Prof. Santini ob
 served the comet at Padua until the end of June, but it was
 not generally seen after the 20th.
    The most rigorous investigation on the elements of this
 comet is one recently published by M. d’Arrest.              From fifty
 two right ascensions and fifty-four declinations he deduced
 seven normal positions between June 7 and 17.               From these,
 by the method of equations of condition with least squares,
 M. d’Arrest computed the most probable parabolic elements,
 and by a direct solution of the equations (a term depending
 on a small variation in the eccentricity being introduced), he
found that the resulting elements were hyperbolic, with an ec
centricity = 1.0025942.            It appears, however, that the result
of   my  calculations    relating   to the comet of 1596, undertaken
at the   suggestion    of Prof.    Schumacher,    induced M. d’Arrest
;:
to ascertain how the observations would be represented by an
ellipse, with a period of 249 years; and he finds, elements
    reeing in the most satisfactory manner with his normal
            It is therefore extremely probable that the comet of
 1596, observed by Tycho, is identical with the great comet of
June 1845.
    M. d’Arrest's elliptical elements are as follows:–
                  T  1845. June 571064.    Mean time at Berlin.

    The details of my investigation on the comet of 1596 will
be found in the Astronomische Nachrichten.            The tempestuous
state of the weather only permitted Tycho to observe the
comet on three days, but the observations were made at very
convenient intervals for the determination of the elements.

details in the Cometography of M. Pingré.

           Biot has given a translation
                                                                   des Tems

catalogues of comets and extraordinary stars: these records
have enabled me to calculate the elements of five comets whose
orbits were previously unknown. From the nature of Chinese
observations no great dependence can be placed on elements
deduced from them, nevertheless it is probable that the results
will be sufficiently near in the generality of cases, to show
whether the comets are identical with any that have been ob
served and computed in after times.
   Prof. Schumacher has published the elements of the comets
in 568, 574 and 1385, in his Astronomische Nachrichten.          The
orbits of the comets in 574 and 770 are extremely uncertain,
the others are, perhaps, tolerable approximations. I attempted
the elements of a comet in the year 12 B.C., but could arrive
at no satisfactory conclusions, owing to the vagueness of the
Chinese description.

                             dates are given      the Julian style,      in

 Ti (commencing at a Librae).” But it is to be observed, that
in 568 there was no day Jin-tseu in the sixth moon: the date
given by M. Biot falls in the fifth moon. The next day,
tseu, answered to August 27 in the seventh moon; and I am
                                                                                                              Jin
strongly inclined to think that this is the date intended, for
the following reasons:—1st. Ma-tuon-lin says the comet ob
served on the day Jin-tseu was situated to the east of Ti                                                     (Li
bra); and this position agrees very well with that which the
second comet of 568 would have occupied on that day, for on
September 3 it was in Scorpio, and moving in the order of
signs: it would therefore pass through Libra previous to Sep
tember 3. 2nd. The Chinese state that the comet was seen

LXVI.    Observations on a paper by Prof. Faraday concerning
  Electric Conduction and the Nature of Matter. By Richard
   LAMING, Esq.
                   To Richard Taylor, Esq.
     SIR,
IN   February of last year a letter from Professor Faraday
     was published by you, expressing an opinion that the im
material centres of force of Boscovich * have a greater claim
to be regarded as true than the solid atoms of Newton ; and
in which he represents his preference to result from the con
templation of certain facts relating to electrical conduction and
insulation.      In going over his arguments I have not arrived
at the same     conclusion,     owing to a difficulty in admitting an
assumption which I find mixed up with the facts.                It will be
better to give Mr. Faraday's meaning in his own words: he says,
“The view of the atomic constitution of matter which I think
is most prevalent, is that which considers the atom as some
thing material having a certain volume, upon which those
powers were impressed at the creation, which have given                                                          it,
from that time          the present, the capability
                            to                              constituting,                of
when    many    atoms are     congregated   together   into groups, the
different substances whose effects and          properties    we observe.
These, though grouped and held together                 their powers,               by                           do
not touch each other, but have intervening space, otherwise
pressure       cold could not make body contract into smaller
                 or                                         a                                      a

fore sees         no
              alternative but      believing that “the reasoning

   In fact definite integrals are in many cases really indeter
minate, and acquire different values according as we consider
the variable to pass through real values, or through imaginary
ones. Where the limits are real, it is tacitly supposed that
the variable passes through a succession of real values, and
thus w, u may be considered as completely determined by
these equations, but only in consequence of this tacit suppo
sition. If c and e are imaginary, there is absolutely no system
of values to be selected for w, v in preference to any other
system. The only remaining difficulty is to show from the
integral itself, independently of the theory of elliptic functions,
that such integrals contain an indeterminateness of two arbi
trary integers; and this difficulty is equally great in the sim
plest cases.     Why, d priori, do the functions
                               dr_
          sin-1   a   =

contain a single indeterminate integer ?
    Obs.  I am of course aware, that in treating          of the proper

necessary to pay attention to the relations between the infi
nite limiting values of m and n ; and that this introduces cer
tain exponential factors, to which no allusion has been made.
 But these factors always disappear from the quotient of two
such products, and to have made mention of them would only
have been embarrassing the demonstration without necessity.

   The same writer has given the vapour pressure on the
coasts of the Baltic, at Trapstow near the Rya, for the months
of July and August. It appears that in those parts the mini

and the maximum is 11:41 at two o'clock in the afternoon.
For August, the minimum is 11’ 18 at three o'clock in the
morning; and there are two risings, the first until ten o'clock,
when it is at 12:05: from this time it falls till two, and then
suddenly rises until three o'clock, from which time it falls for
the rest of the day. From these statements we find that there

not near the surface, the source of evaporation, but on the

was in   operation, which determined the vapour that had been
produced by evaporation from the surface of the earth in the
warm and comparatively dry month of June to continue in
creasing at the low           to eight in the evening, but to ac
cumulate only to a moderate extent, whilst on the mountain
it accumulated to a much greater extent, but not later than
until noon. In the cooler month of September, however, the
vapour accumulated to about an equal extent, and about the
same times, on the low level and on the high mountain, pre
senting a great difference between the action of the vapour in
June and in September. The absolute pressure of the va
pour, it will be recollected, is greater in the lower than in the
higher strata; but the increase of that pressure is greater in
the higher part in the dry and warm month of June, while it
is only equal in the moist and cool month of September,
showing that it was not merely expansion and diffusion of the
vapour produced by evaporation that were in operation, but
that some other cause was at work, which made the vapour
accumulate on the mountain more than on the plain in June,
but not in September.
   In high latitudes the pressure of the vapour is the least in
winter, and the most in summer. In Halle, in Prussian
Saxony, for instance, it is 4.509 in January, and in July
 11'626, almost three times the amount; and the same kind of
difference between winter and summer is found in other
northern parts. Generally it may be said to be the least in
winter and in cold climates, and the most in summer and in
warm climates.
    When the dew-point, contiguous to the surface of the
earth, is the nearest to the temperature, which           is,
                                                       say,    four  at
or  fivein  the morning, both the temperature and the dew
point are the lowest.     From this time the temperature rises
more than the    dew-point,  until the former reaches the highest
point for the day. There        isconsequently      the lower part
                                                     in

4.32             Mr. T. Hopkins                       on the     Diurnal Changes
 between the two thermometers is greater than it was at eleven
o'clock, two hours before the highest temperature!                Evapo
 ration must therefore have been more energetic, and must
 have continued to throw into the atmosphere more vapour
 from eleven to three than it had done four hours earlier'
 Now, if increase of vapour pressure always accompanied in
 crease of vapour, the increase of pressure at Plymouth must
 have continued up to three o'clock ' If however we look at
 the curve or line of the dew-point, which represents vapour
 pressure in the diagram, we find that it did not rise after
 eleven o'clock, but continued stationary from that hour until
 4 P.M.     It is therefore apparent, that at Plymouth the quan
 tity of vapour which by evaporation passed into the atmo
 sphere in the middle of the day, to add to the general atmo
 spheric pressure, in some form, was not indicated by the dew
 point. And analogy authorises us to infer, that in other parts
 of the world, the state of the dew-point during the same
 portion of the day does not express the quantity of vapour
 that has passed into the atmosphere, and which must have
 added to       general pressure

nine and two, or still later in the day, may have ascended and
formed cloud, which cloud must have added to the general
weight of the atmosphere.            Had we accounts of the state of
the wet and     dry-bulb     thermometers,     and of the dew-points at
different heights, there is little room to doubt that we might
trace the ascent of the vapour at Trevandrum until we found
it collected and floating in the atmosphere as a cloud, and in
that form adding to the general weight of the atmosphere.
    Colonel Sabine says that the maximum of vapour pressure
occurring at Trevandrum at 9 A.M. may be a consequence
of the sea-breeze blowing at that time.                  I have however
shown that the      daily   sea-breeze is   itself  produced     by the di
urnal cloud     formation;     the sea-breeze is      only  another    effect
arising from the same cause.           The sea-breeze blows towards
the   part,  because    the  atmosphere    has there been made lighter
than in adjoining parts by the heating power of condensing
vapour. The wind too that comes from the sea, particularly
 in the fine season, when the diurnal disturbance of the baro
 meter is the greatest, comes more fully loaded with vapour
 after nine o'clock than was the air over the land before that
 time, and ought to increase the vapour pressure after that
 hour, instead of stopping the increase. .                     the vapour If      all
 that arose had             to

attributed to the absence of daily cloud formation.                      In a
dry and cold climate there is not in the course of the day su
ficient water evaporated to produce a daily thick cloud, and
therefore small vapour pressure goes on increasing with the
temperature up to the hottest period.                Under these circum
stances, the vapour pressure, when exhibited in a diagram,
forms a regular curve, having one rise and one fall in the
twenty-four hours; but where much vapour exists, and much
more is produced daily, the dew-point does not at                             times                   all

        A     of glass is opake to the phosphoric rays of an
             screen
 electric spark, but is quite transparent to those of incandescent
 lime.
        It
        might be supposed that the very brief duration of an
 electric spark has something to do with the phaenomenon; but
 the voltaic arc passing between charcoal points gives the
 same results.         caused    I rays      impinge    its   plate for   to                   on   a
 thirty seconds, and observed the obstructing effect

a  few minutes, when the phosphorus will begin             shine under                         to
 the glass.
 I     came       the conclusion, also, that the transient duration

glass; and differ from those of an electric spark, or galvanic
discharge, in which that peculiarity is deficient.
    I have also remarked some curious cases of spectral ap
pearances, they are analogous to those instances to which I
first drew public attention in 1840, and which, at a later date,
M. Moser brought before the British Association. They are
interesting, as affording an ocular proof of “secondary radia
tion.” The following experiments may serve as illustrations:—
    Place a key, or any other opake object, before a sensitive
phosphorescent surface, and having made that surface glow
intensely, by a galvanic discharge, between charcoal points,
continued for two or three minutes, on removing the key an
image of it will of course be seen. This image in a short time
will disappear. Then shut the plate in a dark place, where
no light can have access to it in the daytime.          If in a day or
two the surface be carefully inspected, in the dark, no trace
of anything will be visible upon it; but if it be laid on a piece
of warm iron, a spectral image of the key is suddenly evolved.
    It is still more curious, that a number of these latent images
may co-exist on the same surface. Provide a phosphorescent
surface, on which the latent image of a key, impressed a day
or two before by the galvanic discharge, is known to exist.
Take some other object, as a metal ring, and setting it before
the surface, discharge at a short distance a Leyden jar. The
phosphorus shines           all
                            over, save            on
                                            those portions shaded                            by
the ring;     it exhibits therefore       image  an that body. Thisof
image soon fades away, and totally disappears. Set the plate
now upon         piece    warm iron;

488                Prof.         J.       R. Young              on the Evaluation                        of
limit the convergent cases of the general forms considered
above—were proposed by Leibnitz and Daniel Bernoulli:
these methods have been the subject of a good deal of contro
versy, which, as they are really true, would, no doubt, have
been spared if they had been based upon firm mathematical
principles.     The considerations offered in the preceding part
of this paper will conduct to a very easy and satisfactory proof
of Bernoulli's rule.
   Let the terms of the limiting series in question be repre
sented by              &c. These are such, that
                      the   tº      ta.                  we take the                                 if
first term,   the sum     the first two, the sum
                                          of          the first three,                          of
and      on, we shall find that, after
        so                                 certain term, the former         a
sums will    recur;     that the several results always return
                                      so                                                                                      in

 M. Boussingault is inclined to believe that               some of the acci
 dents in mines have occurred from            draughts     or currents of                                   in
 flammable gas, and not from the carelessness of the workmen
 in the use of the safety-lamp, to which they are generally at
 tributed; he considers that the voltaic arc, being independent
 of atmospheric air or other supporter of combustion, in the
 usual sense of the word, might be rendered practically avail
 able.     M. De la Rive states that he has been occupied with
 the  subject,   and proposes a cylinder of close-textured charcoal,
 similar to that of Bunsen, with a metallic ring or plate above
it;   the carbon being rendered the positive terminal                       vol                  of    a
 taic  pile,  the  particles  transferred from            the disc fall down

444.                  Prof. Grove on the Application of
applicable to lighting mines; their publication was postponed,
and I had nearly forgotten them, until reminded by the
papers above-mentioned.
   I  substituted the voltaic ignition of a platina wire for the
disruptive discharge.         Any one who has seen the common
lecture-table   experiment      of igniting a platina wire by the vol
taic current   nearly    to the point of fusion, will have no doubt
of the brilliancy of the light emitted; although inferior to that
of the voltaic arc, yet it is too intense for the naked eye to
support, and amply sufficient for the miner to work by.                My
plan was then to ignite a coil of platinum wire as near to the
point of fusion as was practicable, in a closed vessel of atmo
spheric air, or other gas, and the following was one of the
apparatus which I used for this purpose, and by the light of
which I have experimented and read for hours:–A coil of
platinum wire is attached to two copper wires, the lower parts
of which, or those most distant from the platinum, are well
varnished; these are fixed erect in a glass of distilled water,
and another cylindrical glass closed at the upper end is                                              in
verted over them, so that              its
                                     open mouth rests         the bottom              on
of                glass;        projecting                  copper

     Discovery of the Composition of Water.”     By A BRITIs H
     QUARTERLY REviewER.                                      -
                           To Richard Taylor, Esq.
        SIR,
      you allow us space enough in your excellent Jour
WILL
   nal to reply to a strongly-worded complaint by Sir
David Brewster, which appeared in your Number for Sep
tember last, against a passage concerning himself in the British
Quarterly Review for August 1845? The passage offensive
to Sir David is quoted below.     It occurs in a brief discussion
of the relative merits of Watt and Cavendish as discoverers of
the composition          of water, in     an article on   “Lord   Brougham's
Lives of Men of Letters and Science who flourished in the
reign   of George III.”
     “Sir  David Brewster afterwards took up the subject (Edin
burgh Review, No. 142), and endeavoured to mediate between
the contending parties, but to little purpose.         For he chose
 to consider it a question of national honour, involving the rival
 claims of Cavendish the Englishman and Watt the Scotch
 man; and whilst he was willing to divide the merit between
them, assigned to his countryman the lion's share.”
    Sir David declares, in reference to the paragraph we have -
quoted, that it contains “very unfounded and unjust asser
 tions;” that our object was to injure his character and wound
his feelings; that it manifestly was “the reviewer's desire to
infuse into his statements a bitter personality;” and he further
speaks of our having occasioned him “the annoyance of re
butting the calumnies of the British Quarterly reviewer.”
    The special charges which Sir David Brewster brings
against us we shall allude to immediately.          In reference to
the   general  one,  of our remarks  having  been  pervaded    by an
animus    against  him,  we  beg to assure Sir David that we had
not, in the passage he complains               of,
                                          the remotest intention            of
injuring his character        wounding his feelings: that
                                or                              were we
actuated       by   no
                    animosity  towards  him,  and were   guiltless          of
the slightest desire       to
                          vex    annoy him
                                     or              by
                                                aspersion, calumny,
or   insinuation.    Sir David Brewster we know only             the   as

most distinguished original observer in natural philosophy
which Great Britain possesses; and he is a philosopher whom
we delight to honour.     As such we freely subjected his opi
nions to criticism, as in similar circumstances we should feel
ourselves at liberty to do again; but we shall have little diffi
culty in satisfying Sir David himself, that in so doing, we did
not in the least overstep the bounds which are conceded to
impartial reviewers.
   The special charges brought against us are,
   1st. That we declare Sir David Brewster to have been ac
tuated by unworthy motives in deciding between the claims of
Watt and Cavendish as discoverers of the composition of
Water.
   2ndly. That we represent him as having preferred Watt
where in truth he preferred Cavendish.
   The first charge is contained in the following statement:
“The assertions of the British Quarterly reviewer are equally
offensive with the language which conveys them.        He charges
me, by name, with having decided a great scientific question,
interesting to the whole civilized world, from motives of na
tional feeling, —with sacrificing by a temporising verdict Ca
vendish the Englishman to Watt the Scotchman,—and, under the
pretence of dividing the merit, with assigning to my countryman
the lion's share.”    The italics are Sir David Brewster's. In
reply, we must be allowed to say, that we brought no such
charges against Sir David as he accuses us of having made.
Our statement was to the effect, that his attempt to mediate
between the partizans of Watt and Cavendish was to a great
extent unsuccessful, because he made a national—a Scotch
and-English question, of the dispute as to the discovery of the
composition of water; whilst he assigned the chief merit to his
countryman Watt.        That he made a national question of                    it,
Sir David Brewster will not deny. Here are his own words.
We quote from his article     on Watt,    the Edinburgh Review,
                                               in
No. 142,      p.
               496 :-“We       cannot conclude this part       our       of
subject without adverting     to the discussion           of
                                                       which ema
                                                               it
nated from the chair    of  the British Association      Birming    at
ham.     We regret that such meeting should have become the
                               a
arena    of
          a controversy involving feelings          so
                                               deeply personal,                as
well as national.”    The italics are our own. Here Sir David
Brewster surely declares that       considers the question “na
                                   hehe
                                                                         a
tional” one. In what sense          considers     such will appear
                                                     it
from a   further statement: “Scotland will not soon forget the
attempt which was lately made,            by
                                        one         of

British Association,   to  rob our illustrious countryman Dr.

4.48       Reply to Sir David Brewster's “Observations
Black of his grand discovery of latent heat; and it is an unfor
tunate circumstance that the President should have been spe
cially requested by the same Council to draw up a discourse,
in which another of our countrymen should have been deprived
of an honour so justly due to him.” That we were not singu
lar in drawing the conclusion we published, will appear from
the fact that Mr. Harcourt speaks of the writer of the passages
we have quoted as     “a northern critic who views this question
of individual  justice  as one of national honour*.”      We are
at a loss, indeed, to understand how any one who reads the
passages we have selected, can differ from us in opinion, and
are surprised that Sir David Brewster should judge us so
harshly, because we have said that “he chose to consider it
a national question,” which it seems to us he certainly did.
   Whether Sir David Brewster acted judiciously in thus ap
pealing to the feelings of our scientific men as Englishmen and
Scotchmen, is a matter of opinion.        We think that he acted
unwisely in so doing, the more so, that the great advocate of
Cavendish, viz. Harcourt, was an Englishman, and many mem
bers of the Council of the British Association were Cavendish’s
countrymen also, and could not but find something unpleasant
in the passages which we have quoted. We believe, accord
ingly, as we have implied in the paragraph to which Sir David
Brewster objects, that he greatly injured the effect of his state
ments by his allusions to nationality.      Sir David, however,
need not attribute to us, on that account, any concealed pur
pose of insinuating against him a charge of dishonesty, or par
tiality, in adjudicating between Watt and Cavendish.           We
can only emphatically say, that we had no intention of attri
buting any such motive to him.
   Sir David Brewster's reply to the second point is as fol
lows:—“In place of dividing the merit of the discovery be
                                                                        j
tween the Englishman and the Scotchman, and giving the lion's
share to my countryman,           I
                               have given the whole merit of the
discovery to Cavendish the Englishman, and have reserved
only for Watt the Scotchman the merit of the previous hypo
thesis.”. In reference to this, we have only to say, that Sir
                                                         as for
David, in rebutting our charge, takes           granted that our
estimate     “the lion's share”
            of                     the sameis   his own;     other           in

     In conclusion,      we have only further to observe, that Sir
 David Brewster has found ground of offence in several phrases,
 which we beg to assure him were used most innocently, and
 contain no such covert insinuations as he seems to think are
 lurking within them.          The    passage which has given         him so
 much offence       was intended to express the following             and no
 other truths:—“Sir David Brewster afterwards published on
 the subject, and tried to mediate between the contending par
 ties, but ineffectually ; for he discussed it as a question of na
tional honour affecting the claims of Cavendish the English

 LXXIII.       Remarks on Mr. Williamson's experiments regard
       ing Ozone.       By Prof. C. F. SchoeNBEIN of Basle.*.
 IT haveis rather amusing to see the variety of opinions which
              been given out respecting the nature of the odori
ferous matter disengaged by phosphorus in moist atmospheric
air. To some, that principle is either nitrous or nitric acid
according to others, it must be considered as phosphorous or
hypophosphorous acid.            M. De la Rive and Marignac think
it oxygen modified by the electricity which they suppose to
be disengaged during the chemical action of phosphorus upon
atmospheric air: oxide of arsenic, or arsenious acid resulting
from an arseniferous phosphorus, was once mentioned as likely
to be ozone, and some went so far as to declare that substance
to be nothing but organic matter changed by phosphorus
into ozone. I myself was inclined for a time to consider
ozone as a constituent part of nitrogen.                Mr. Williamson't
has lately augmented this list of opinions by one which
has certainly the merit of being the most original of all;

distinct terms, that under the circumstances mentioned no

                            phosphorus.      Though this conclusion
implied the most direct contradiction            my own statements,  to
and those made              by
                       Marignac, Mr. Williamson did not think
it worth his while        repeat the experiments which

 metallic substances to the highest degree of which they are
 capable: even silver is so acted upon.
    3. Chemical ozone transforms a series of metallic protoxides
 into peroxides, for instance, those of lead, manganese, cobalt,
nickel, silver.
    4. Chemical ozone, at common temperature, converts
iodine into iodic acid, phosphorus into phosphoric acid, sul
phurous acid into sulphuric acid, hyponitric acid into nitric
acid.
    5. Chemical ozone changes iodide of potassium into iodate
of potash, a great number of metallic sulphurets into sulphates,
for instance, sulphuret of lead into the sulphate.
    6. Chemical ozone destroys instantaneously sulphuretted,
seleniuretted, phosphoretted and ioduretted hydrogen.
    7. Chemical ozone transforms the yellow prussiate of pot
ash into the red one.
    8. Chemical ozone, as such, is insoluble in water.
    9. Chemical ozone when heated to a certain temperature
is  destroyed.
    10. Chemical ozone possesses the power of polarizing ne
gatively gold and platinum.
    The odoriferous principle disengaged at the positive elec
trode during the electrolysis of water has, according to my
experiments, exactly the same properties; and I have not yet
been able to detect the slightest difference between chemical
and voltaic ozone.     Hence I conclude, of course, that these
substances are identical.      If Mr. Williamson will take the
trouble of putting a piece of clean phosphorus into a bal
loon filled with common air and containing some water, in
such a way that the phosphorus is partly immersed in the
fluid and partly in contact with the ambient air, and leaving
the whole to itself at a temperature of 70° to 80°F., after a few
hours he will find in his balloon an atmosphere which will
serve to convince him of the correctness of the statements
above made.      Mr. Williamson will allow me to tell him why
the negative result of what he calls his decisive experiment
proves nothing against the correctness of my statements; and
indeed his very mode of experimenting could lead to no other
than a negative result.     If  phosphorus in a state of rather
minute mechanical division be shaken with voltaic ozone, the
latter is instantaneously taken up or destroyed, just as if it had
been treated with iron filings or any other readily oxidizable
body.     I need hardly state, that an atmosphere of chemical
ozone does not in the least differ from one of voltaic ozone,
i. e. is destroyed by being put in contact with phosphorus.

454.                 Messrs. Playfair and Joule on
 the gaseous state, even at very high temperatures, the im
portance of discovering the law which governs the volumes of
 these forms of matter, has long been recognised, and for some
 time past has much engaged the attention of philosophers.
     The first chemist who drew attention to this subject was
 Dr. Thomson, who published a Table”, in the year 1831, of
the specific volumes of certain of the metals, obtained by                 di
 viding their atomic weights by their specific gravities.                   In
this table a remarkable coincidence of volume is observed in
several of the metals most nearly allied in chemical characters.
     More recently the subject has been examined in detail by
 Kopp, Schröder and Persoz, whose researches have thrown
considerable light on this obscure department of physics.
     Koppt drew attention to the circumstance, that in many
cases isomorphous bodies possess the same atomic volume,
 the law being correct when the isomorphism is strictly accu
 rate, but approximating only when this is not the case.                  He
 admits also that perfect equality of the volume exists only at
 particular temperatures, on account of the unequal expansion
 of isomorphous crystals.
     Schrödert made the interesting observation, that the re
 mainder is the same when the primitive volume of the corre
sponding member of a series of analogous compounds is sub
tracted from them ; thus AO, BO and CO leave a constant
remainder when the known volumes of A, B and C are sub
tracted respectively from the known atomic volumes of the
compounds.
     Kopp S confirms this discovery to a certain extent, belie
ving, however, that the primitive volumes A, B and C must be
assumed in certain classes of salts to be different when in com
bination with O from their volumes when isolated.                  He also
announces the discovery | of a great regularity in the physical
properties of analogous organic compounds, so much so, that
the study of the physical characters of the compounds of one
body enables us to predicate those of the corresponding com
pounds of another substance.
    The discoveries of Schröder and Kopp, with regard to
the atomic volumes of liquid and solid bodies, do not, except
in a very few instances, indicate an approach to a simple mul
tiple ratio of volumes, and are therefore only in a small de

gree connected with the law of gaseous volume.        We there
fore thought it desirable to enter into a series of inquiries on
this most important subject, and we have now the honour to
lay before the Society the First Part of these researches.
    Hitherto the inquiry has been principally confined to solid
bodies, on the just ground that their diminished rate of ex
pansion offers less difficulty to the discovery of the law regu
lating volumes. But there is an objection to the use of so
lids, which to a certain extent counterbalances this advantage,
 viz. that they do not present matter in a perfectly uniform
condition, free from cohesion. On consideration, therefore, we
 were led to believe this objection to be so powerful, that we
conceived it to be preferable, so to separate the particles of
 the body under examination, as to destroy their cohesion,
 without at the same time altering their chemical properties.
 Solution in water was the obvious means of effecting this
 purpose, according to the notions generally entertained of so
 lution, and it was therefore resolved to experiment princi
 pally upon soluble bodies of well-known and defined constitu
tion.   At the same time, it was necessary to examine the re
lation of the solid volume to the volume of the body when in
solution, so as to indicate the connection between the solid
and the liquid atom.
   The specific gravities of salts are little known, and even
when recorded are described so differently by different ob
servers, that it was necessary to determine the specific gravity
in each of the cases upon which the experiments were insti
tuted.   Hitherto the volumes of solids had always been re
ferred to an equal volume of water; in other words, the solid
form of matter had been referred to        liquid form. This dif  its
ference      of
           conditions was     small impedimentno     the discovery              to
of a law which   might                   be

  dered liquid by water, we conceived that we might be placed
  in more favourable conditions for elucidating a law.
     Bishop Watson* was the first chemist who endeavoured
  to estimate the increase of volume when salts dissolve in water;
  for, although both Gassendust and the Abbé Nollet f had
  written, and Ellis $ had experimented upon the same subject,
  they had arrived at conclusions entirely erroneous, which were
  removed by Watson's more accurate experiments. Watson's
  apparatus was rude enough, being a matrass capable of hold
  ing 67 ounces of water, into which he projected 24 penny
  weights of each of the salts upon which he experimented, and
 noted the rise in the neck of the matrass. He completely ex
 ploded, however, the idea that saline substances dissolve in
 water without increasing            bulk.             its
     Between the time          Bishop    Watson, whose investigations
                                              of
  on  this  subject   are most      profound,    when we consider the
 period      which
                 at      wrote, and that
                                     he          Dalton, there were    of                                no

 tion.        In
             the  year   1840,    Dalton|| made the interesting dis
 covery, that sugar and certain salts                 being dissolved       on                           in
 water increase        bulk onlyits     the amount           by

 ing       them.
            in       He    generalized     this observation         assert                   by
                  byall
ing that       hydrated salts dissolve         water, increasing  in  bulk                        its
merely         their amount          water      hydration, while anhy

drous salts do not            all increase the bulk of the water

    But     must not
              it             forgotten, that when Dalton published

                      repeated trials that no loss of volume or error
                      was occasioned by the moistening of the tube

                      moisten the walls of the tube previous to the

 is filled.    The whole contents of the tube are then thrown
 into    water, and the salt is washed away by decantation. The
 mercury is dried by bibulous paper, and restored to the tube.
 If  the temperature be different from that which it possessed
 in the first part of the experiment, it is restored to the origi
 nal temperature, or a correction is made for the difference.
  It is now obvious that the space in the tube unoccupied by
 the mercury is that which was formerly filled with the salt.
  To this, however, must be added a slight correction for the
 imperfect nature of the vacuum, which is not Torricellian,—
 a correction which need not exceed ºuth of the volume
  observed. With these preliminary descriptions and observa
  tions, we now proceed to describe the details of our experi
  ments, throwing them into various classified groups of salts,
  for the purpose of easy reference.
     The first group described is remarkable for containing a
  large amount of water of hydration.

     combined with a salt may have a volume different from that of

     combined and that                    of combined             water.                Be this as                   it may,            it

we have determined the specific gravity of the latter with great
care. The distilled water, which we converted into ice, was
deprived of air by long-continued boiling, and a weighed por
tion of the ice was quickly immersed in water at 32°, the ba
lance being kept at the same temperature during the weighing
of the ice. The rise in the stem of the volumenometer, in which
fragments of ice had previously been placed, indicated the
volume due to the quantity of ice immersed.      On treating in
this manner 54.2 grains of ice, a rise in the stem of 59.0 was
produced; and in a second experiment 52.8 grains of ice oc
casioned an increase of 57-5, the temperature in both cases
being exactly 32°.

              tain water, and yet the most interesting result follows, that the

              allowing for errors of observation, are therefore always mul

              one and the same number, that number being also, as in the

    The correspondence       between the observed and calculated
results in the preceding table, as far as regards the potash
salts, is so striking as to remove any doubt of the basis upon
which the calculations are made. It is therefore of interest
to consider the results indicated by the table a little more in
detail.    The first point of remark            that                 is,
                                                        every case the              in
ammoniacal salt has one volume greater               solution than the       in
corresponding potash salt. Sulphate              potash possesses two  of
                solution;  sulphate                        of  one vo                           of

                           water possesses three. These volumes
are respectively carried through the whole class                double                          of
sulphates. The volumes             these double sulphates are made
                                                  of

                      the volumes       their constituent salts, which

   As one of the members of the group of double salts here
described takes up no space of itself, it became of importance
to ascertain the volume of the salt when deprived of water,
and also the space occupied by the double salt reduced to the
same state.     In this examination it was quite unnecessary to
obtain the volumes in solution, because it was obvious that
salts not occupying in solution a greater volume than that due
to their water of hydration, would, in their anhydrous condi
tion, take up no space at all. In fact, we had ascertained that
not only was there no increase in dissolving such salts in
water, but that actually there was a contraction if the water
were in large proportion to the salt; when this is not the case,
the increased expansibility of the solution prevents the con
traction being observed.
   In the following examination will be found almost         the                             all
salts previously described      their hydrated condition, with
                                       in
the exception      the phosphates and arseniates, which we re

   The preceding table exhibits various points of great interest
as regards isomorphism. Hydrogen has for a long time been
recognised by chemists as equivalent to a magnesian metal;
and hence the sulphate of a metal of this class should possess
the volume of sulphate of water. The volume of bisulphate
of potash is 55-0 by experiment, which leaves 22-0 for that of
sulphate of water, on deducting the volume of sulphate of
potash, which is 33-0; and the same result follows when the
volume of sulphuric acid is deduced from bisulphate of soda,
if we suppose the sulphate of soda to enter that salt with two
volumes. Thus we have —
                                                   -
                                                        9
        Sulphate of water    .   .  .   . = 22 + 11 =
        Sulphate of a magnesian oxide= 22         11 = 2
   We now see that    bisulphate   of potash (sulphate  of water
and sulphate of potash) is exactly equivalent to the double
sulphates of the magnesian class.     (Pide Section V.)
Bisulphate of potash (HO, SO,--KO, SO)=55
Sulphate of magnesia and potash(MgO, SO3 + KO, SOs)=55.
   It is now comprehensible why bisulphate of soda should
have a volume of 44-0 in the solid state and only of 18-0 in a
state of solution; because sulphate of soda which assumes a
volume in the solid state becomes added to the same volume
possessed by sulphate of water, while in the state of solution
the proper volume of sulphate of soda disappears altogether.
   Bisulphate of ammonia possesses a volume due to a com
bination of sulphate of water and sulphate of ammonia, with
a volume of 11 x 4, and it will be observed that the same
result attends the double sulphates of the magnesian metals
with sulphate of ammonia.
Bisulphate of ammonia (NH,O, SO3 + HO SO.)=66
Sulphate of ammonia and copper(NH4O, SO3 + CuO, SOs)=66.
   The cause of this singular result is in the mutual conver
tibility of the primitive volumes 9-8 and 11.
   It is very curious to observe the large number of volumes
which have disappeared when the salt combines with water.
Thus sulphate of alumina in      its anhydrous state possesses             a
bulk  equal to  792,  which has ceased       tooccupy space      the  in
hydrated salt; and still more remarkable instances               of
                                                            this are
seen  in the alums, which add    to this the volumes     their alka
                                                            of
line sulphates.  A   curious result obtained      the examination
                                                  in
of the hydrated alums up   now explicable.      We found that the
potash alums took    in is  solution only the space due           to
                                                               their
water; but that the space occupied          by
                                             them      the state
                                                       in                  of
salts was one volume    in addition     this quantity.
                                       to                  the pre

               Atomic Volume and Specific Gravity.                              487
ceding section we observed that sulphate of potash possessed
the singular property of expanding one volume in becoming
solid; 9 × 2 in a state of solution becoming 11 x 3 in the
state of a salt.   It is impossible to refrain from accepting this
as an explanation of the increase of one in the quotient ob
tained by dividing the volumes by their proper numbers 9
and 11—24 × 9 becoming 25 x 11.
   The difficulties, to which we have already alluded, prevent
us placing much confidence in our results for the anhydrous
alums.    Sulphate of alumina seems to affect eight volumes of
ice, 9.8 x 8 = 78’4; in ammonia alum the latter becomes
united to the volume of anhydrous sulphate of ammonia,
9.8 × 8 + 9.8 x 4 = 1 17:6; while potash alum should con
sist of 9.8 × 8 + 1 1 x 3 = 1 11:4. It is unnecessary to re
mark that these theoretical numbers possess only an approx
imation to our experimental results. (Wide remarks on Sec
                                                                     ..".

   The sulphates of soda and silver and the corresponding
chromate are also obviously exceptions to the                                     of
the solid volume being multiples of 11. But in the last section
we had similar exceptions in salts which ranged themselves
under 9-8 or the volume of ice. The sulphates now under
consideration have the same divisor, if sulphate of soda be not
considered an exception, as the variation is decidedly too great
to be attributed to a mere error of experiment; it ought how
ever to be observed that Mohs gives for the specific gravity
of this salt 2.462, a number much more in accordance with
theory than our own result; but as our experiments have been
often repeated, they may perhaps be viewed as an argument in
favour of an opinion, deduced from other considerations, that
sulphate of soda has a double atom 27.5 x 2 = 55, which
is 11 x 5.

           The results of the experiments detailed in this section afford
        strong proofs of the law of multiple proportions, and exhibit
        at the same time that remarkable alteration of the divisor of
        the solid volumes which we have already noticed so frequently.
        Thus, while many of the chlorides and bromides are multi
        ples of 11, we have decided exceptions in chlorides of potas
        sium and sodium, which possess for their divisor the volume
        of ice, viz. 9.8; and this reappears in the double salts.
           It is impossible, however, not to see that these results are
        somewhat singular, for in the double salts the chloride of
        potassium forces the double salt with which it is associated
        to assume the multiples of 9.8, and then exhibits         natural                                          its
        isomorphous relation       chloride     ammonium, which perse
                                                 to                    of
       it  did not possess.    Chloride      ammonium, anomalous,    of                                                                 in
        being multiple
                  a               the solid state, assumes four volumes,

multiples of 98, in the double chlorides, and then presents
the same number for its solid volume as chloride of potassium.
The isomorphism of potassium and sodium is so entirely hy
pothetical, that it will not excite surprise to find the volumes
of the chlorides so different. We were less prepared to detect
the difference between iodide and chloride of potassium; but
have confirmed it by an examination of iodide of ammonium,
                            *
50 grains of which dissolved in 1000 of water with an increase
of 18.7, which gives             = six volumes for the equivalent,           a
result confirmatory of our determination of five volumes for
iodide of potassium ; the increase of one volume being in
conformity with the usual behaviour of ammoniacal salts.
We shall return to the consideration of the chlorides in a fu
ture section.

                                 Chromates.
   The chromates present a class of salts which offer some
peculiarities with regard to their volumes, in elucidating which
we had occasion to repeat our experiments very often, and,
therefore, give the mean of the results, instead of taking up
unnecessary space in the Transactions of the Society by de
scribing each experiment individually.
   Chromic Acid, CrO3=52-19.-The chromic acid used in
our experiments was obtained by adding sulphuric acid to                    bi
chromate of potash. It was in beautiful distinct crystals of
nearly a quarter of an inch in length, being the finest and
purest specimen which we have obtained in many prepara
tions of this acid.
   The half of an equivalent, 26-09 grains, dissolved in 1000
of water with an increase of 9-0 at 72°; this gives 18.0 as the
volume of chromic acid in solution.
   The same quantity of acid, thrown into the solution from
which it had crystallized, gave an increase of 97 and 9.8 in
two experiments.

    Sesquichromate of Potash, 2KO, 3CrO3 = 251.09.—This
salt, which will be described in a future communication by
one of us, is obtained by boiling a solution of bichromate of
potash with an excess of finely pounded litharge. The oxide
of lead removes only one-fourth of the chromic acid of the
bichromate, and the solution on cooling deposits the sesqui
chromate in flattened prisms of a paler but more resplendent
colour than the bichromate of potash. On dissolving the
fourth part of an equivalent, 62.77 grains, in 1000 grains of
water, the increase in four experiments at 58° was exactly
18:0; this gives 72.0 as the volume of the equivalent in solu
tion.
   The mean of six experiments, placing the fourth of an
equivalent, 62.77 grains, in turpentine, was an increase of
237, which gives 94.8 as the volume of the equivalent, and
2.648 as the specific gravity of the salt.

turpentine, gave an increase, the mean of ten experiments, of
28-9, which gives 57-8 as the volume of an equivalent, and
2-624 as the specific gravity of the salt.
   Terchromate of Potash, KO, 3CrO3 = 203-92.-This salt
was obtained by mixing a solution of bichromate of potash
with nitric acid and crystallizing.     On dissolving 51 grains
of the salt in 1000 grains  of water, an increase was occasioned
of 18-0 at 60°; this gives 71.9 as the volume of the equiva
lent in solution.
   On immersing 50'98 grains in turpentine, the increase was
19-3 in two experiments, and 19-0 in a third trial.

dissolved in 1000 grains measure of a dilute solution of mu
riatic acid, gave an increase of 15:7 in two experiments at 57 ;
this result makes the volume of an equivalent in solution
62°8.
   The mean of various experiments on this salt gave an in
crease of 18:15 on immersing the above quantity of salt in
turpentine, which yields 72.6 as the volume of the equivalent,
and 2:466 as the specific gravity of the salt.
  The results now described show that the chromates form a
group different from the classes of salts hitherto given.

=95-4, which is not very far from 94.8, the volume deter
mined by experiment.     Bichromate of potash would consist
of a double atom of chromate of potash and 2 of chromic
acid, or 75-8 + 39:2–115-0, which agrees pretty closely with
the experimental determination of 115.6; and terchromate of
potash, in like manner, is 1 atom of double chromate of pot
ash with 4 of chromic acid, or 75'8 + 78.4 = 1542, which is
almost exactly the same as 154'4, found in the two consecu
tive experiments, and not far distant from 153-6, the mean of
the three experiments.
   This view receives confirmation from the volume of Peli
got's salt, which certainly consists of the volume of KCl,
when in combination, added to that of 2 atoms of chromic
acid, 33-0 + 39-2 = 72°2, a number very close to the experi
mental result 72-6.      It is quite true that we have made a
gratuitous assumption at the outset of our explanation; but
it is not surprising to find an unusual law prevailing in a class
of salts so anomalous as the chromates. When the experi
mental numbers, and those calculated on the assumption, are
so near as we have shown them to be, there           we think,                                    is,                     a

hydrous alum was found to have a volume of 1164 instead

it to contain the peculiar KO, SOA analogous to KO, CrO3;
in this case the theoretical volume would be 116:3.

as the volume of the equivalent in solution, 35-8. The same
quantity of salt, thrown into turpentine, gave an increase of

                    The volumes of the oxalates can only be explained by an
                attentive consideration of the previous results.       We have
                already seen numerous instances in which the primitive vo
                lumes 9-8 and 11-0 become mutually convertible; this is stri
                kingly the case with the salts of the present section. Hydrated
                oxalic acid has a volume 9.8 x 4; oxalate of potash possesses the
                volume 11 x 3, and passes with this volume into the binoxalate
                and quadroxalate of potash, the oxalic acid in the binoxalate
                being associated as two volumes of ice, although the water of
                crystallization possesses the volume 11.        Quadroxalate of
                potash is to be viewed as anhydrous binoxalate plus 2 equiv.
                hydrated oxalic acid, the latter having become 11 × 4 instead
                of 9.8 x 4. The same explanation applies to the binoxalate
                and quadroxalate of ammonia, the only difference being that
                anhydrous oxalate of ammonia, 9.8 x 4, takes the place of
                oxalate of potash. On these views the following table is con
                structed.

                              Subsalts and Ammoniacal Salts.
     The salts which we have hitherto examined have been those
soluble in water, and having a constitution to a certain degree
well-defined.    We have now to consider the insoluble sub
salts, and, in some cases, their neutral insoluble types, and
also to ascertain how far the results thus obtained serve to
throw light on the constitution of ammoniacal salts.
   Subsulphate of Copper, CuO, SOs, 4HO + 3CuO = 234.9.
—This well-known salt was made by adding ammonia to a
solution of sulphate of copper. The fourth part of an equi

19:1 and 19-0 in two successive experiments.

  chloride of copper was shown to be 33 or 3 × 11; but we have
  not yet examined the bulk occupied by the anhydrous chlo
 ride. The chloride was deprived of its water by a heat con
 siderably below that of redness, in order to prevent the forma

 an   equivalent,  into  turpentine,   the increase in two experiments
 was    exactly  11.0, which    gives  22:0 as the volume of the salt,

                      specific gravity.

   The important researches of Graham have shown that water
plays a most important part in the constitution of salts; and
that salts with an excess of base may be viewed as hydrates,
in which oxide of hydrogen becomes replaced by a metallic
oxide. The previous experiments will be found to give this
theory the fullest confirmation.    Sulphate of zinc crystallizes
with seven atoms of water and affects a volume of 74°6; and
sulphate of copper assumes the same state of hydration, when
crystallized with the latter salt, although per se it assumes
only five atoms. Placing together the subsulphates and hy
drated sulphates of these metals, we perceive not only a close
similarity in their formulae but also in their volumes, as ascer
tained by experiment.

calomel and chloride of ammonium we have a direct case in
point, and the similarity of volumes is very striking.
                                                                             Diff.

 In this case we have taken chloride of ammonium, because
KCl assumes the volume of four atoms of ice.
  Subchloride of copper, like NH,Cl, possesses three volumes,
according to Karsten’s experiments and our own, but these
three volumes are multiples of 9.8, and not of 11-0.

   These are instances in which two atoms of a magnesian
metal are at once shown to be equivalent to one of a metal of
the potash family; but it does not thereby preclude the pos
sibility of two atoms of a magnesian oride being equivalent
to one atom of potash. For example, a magnesian sulphate,
MgO, SO3, affects a volume 22, or 11 x 2, while the same
salt united to an atom of constitutional water has the volume
33, or MgO, SO3HO becomes equal to KO, SOA, which
also possesses a volume of 33.   The most striking case, how
ever, is seen when crystallized submitrate of lead is compared
with nitrate of potash.

   The fact that two atoms of a magnesian oxide are equiva
lent to one of potash, appears to find     explanation its

We are now in a condition to consider the salts of ammonia.
    Itis quite unnecessary to remind chemists that there are
two rival theories regarding the constitution of ammoniacal
salts. One of them, proposed by the profound Berzelius, is
that the salts of ammonia contain a hypothetical radical
termed ammonium, consisting of one equivalent of nitrogen
and four equivalents of hydrogen.    Sulphate of ammonia is
to be viewed as sulphate of oxide of ammonium, the latter
hypothetical body being equivalent to potash; and hence the
isomorphism between the salts of potash and ammonia. The
other view of the constitution of ammonia is that proposed
by Kane, and so elaborately supported by him in his paper
on subsalts and ammoniacal compounds”.         Dr. Kane sup
poses that an ammoniacal salt is formed on the type of a
magnesian salt, carrying along with it constitutional water.

524                 Messrs. Playfair and Joule on
reduction of the volume of ammonia turpeth. From this cir
cumstance, the view would appear probable that amide and
chloride of mercury are equivalent, and hence would follow
the equivalency of chlorine to amidogene. This receives fur
ther support from the volume of the double subamide and
subchloride of mercury, Hg,Cl- Hg,Ad, which has a volume
of 66.8, according to experiment. Calomel itself possesses
the volume 33-2, which, deducted from that of the salt just
described, gives 33.6 as the volume of Hg,Ad, showing the
complete equivalency of the latter to the subchloride.
   It has been shown that chloride of mercury and chloride
of hydrogen are equivalent, and it now remains to be shown
by direct proof that amide of hydrogen (ammonia) is embraced
in the same category. Ammonia-chloride of copper, CuCl
 +NH,       was found with a volume of 392 or 9.8 x 4; chloride
 of copper    itself affects two volumes, which leaves for Ad, H,
 as deduced from this salt, also two volumes.             But the am
 monia in CuCl4-2NHa-H HO, if we were to suppose the salts
 constituted in a manner so simple as expressed by their em
 pirical formulae, would only have a volume of 330 for two
 atoms, or 1% volume for each.
    In proceeding further, it will be seen that we involve our
 selves in inextricable difficulties, if we insist upon the equiva
 lency of NH.H to HO; or suppose the ammoniacal salts,
 such as those described, to be constituted on the type of the
 hydrated salts.       Thus, ammonia-sulphate of copper, CuO,
 SO,4-2NHa-H HO, has a volume of 68.6 or 9.8 x 7 in               solid       its
 state, and    of   54   or   x

                               ammonia. The simple salt, CuO, SOs

one atom      ofammonia; but the same salt, when combined with
three atoms        ofwater, yields the volume 63-6, which would
lead
       us
       to     suppose that one atom              of

 11,  or unity, when calculated from the observed volume            hy         of
drated   sulphate       of
                        ammonia. But         the ammonia-chromate

however, we become perplexed                by
                                          finding that the ammonia
in  ammonia-pernitrate            of
                                mercury possesses the volume

atom     ofwater. Thus, then,          by
                                     considering the volumes        the
ammoniacal salts         containing their ammonia quasi ammonia,
                         as
and   as constituted         on
                             the type    the hydrated salts, we ob
                                            of
tain the   contradictory    and absurd result, that ammonia, though

                 Atomic Volume and Specific Gravity.                      525
     often taking a volume equal to unity, sometimes possesses a
     volume of 1%, and occasionally two volumes. It is pretty
     certain, from these contradictory results, that the salts are
     not constituted on the hydrated type.
         Graham has thrown out the ingenious idea +, that the salts
     now referred to may actually contain an ammonium in which
     the fourth equivalent of hydrogen is replaced by an equivalent
     of a magnesian metal. Thus CuO, SO3 + NH3 is constituted,
     according to Graham, NH2Cu, O, SOs, on the type of sulphate
     of ammonia, NHaH, O, SOs. There is nothing whatever op
     posed to this view in Kane's researches, as he himself admits,
     the only difference being that he considers the said salts to
     contain oxide of copper and water united to amide of hydro
     gen, instead of to cuprammonium and oxide of ammonium,
     according to the views of Berzelius and Graham.           While,
     therefore, Kane admits that amide of hydrogen is very closely
     allied to chloride of hydrogen, he claims for the former body
     an equally close alliance to water, by asserting that it is equi
     valent to a magnesian oxide, although it is difficult to conceive
     why chloride of hydrogen has not a right to a similar claim.
     Amide and chloride of mercury have undoubtedly the same
     volume, viz. 22.0, and chloride of hydrogen also enjoys the
     same number; but water does not in any case do so.            On
 -   this point alone, then, are we at issue with Kane, for there
-    are many proofs that there is extreme probability in the view
.*   propounded by him of the presence of NH,H and HO in
     ammoniacal salts.      On the former view alone do we contest
º    the   accuracy
           research,
                     of the opinion, leaving for future consideration
      and             to which we are now devoting ourselves, a more
      defined notion of the reason why NH2H and HO are equiva
     lent in many instances, not in all, to potash. We have already
      stated the incongruous results which would flow from the
      conception that ammonia was simply attached to the salts
      examined. It is true that Kane gives to some of them a con
      stitution more intimate, and when he does so his theory ac
      cords with our results. But his conception of the equivalency
      of NH4H to HO has led him in other instances to attach the
      ammonia to the salt in place of water, and it is from these
      cases that we dissent.    If he merely means that 'NH2H can
      replace HO in a compound, as KO, SOs does in a magnesian
      sulphate, then we cease to differ, because the resulting com
      pounds do not remain in strict parallelism; the only point
      we argue against being that HO and NH2H are equivalent.
      Thus we have, supposing        all   of
                                         them     affect the primitive

   The first two members of the series have the same number
of volumes, because HgC) and HO are equivalent, and the
last salt should also affect the same, if NH, H = HO. But
if we consider the last salt as equal to nitrate of ammonia, in
which HgC) replaces HO, then it becomes intelligible.

   Perhaps the most anomalous salt in the whole series ex
amined is chloride of ammonium, which actually decreases
one volume in becoming solid, 9 x 4 in solution being 11 x 3
in the state of a salt. Chloride of potassium refuses to share
this anomaly, and we accordingly find it 9.8 x 4, and NH2Cl
associates itself to KCl in the double salts. Four volumes for
NH,Cl is undoubtedly what we should expect from            com                                       its

to be anomalous in the double chlorides. By placing together
the volumes of the hydrated acids and those of the ammoni
acal salts, it will be seen that the latter are made up of the
volumes of the hydrated acid united to amide of hydrogen
affecting two volumes, like HCl.
   Sulphate of ammonia= HO, SOA = 2+NH2H = 2=4
   Nitrate of ammonia = HO, NO. =3+NH2H = 2=5
   Oxalate of ammonia = HO, C, Og=2+NH2H=2=4
  All  the ammoniacal salts which we have described in this
section may be arranged in a similar way with a like result.
   We do not profess to have resolved the cause of the equiva
lency HO + NHs to KO ; nor do we insist that they do not
enter into more intimate union to form NH4O. It must not
be left out of consideration, however, that in almost every in
stance the ammoniacal salt affects one volume in solution more
than the corresponding salt of potash, and that the number
of volumes of the latter becomes augmented by one in pass
ing from the liquid to the solid state, while the number of
volumes of the ammoniacal salt remains unchanged.         It re
quires a more minute knowledge of the constitution of salts
than we now possess to decide the question at issue.
                              Conclusion.
   Although we have examined many other salts than those
described in the previous pages, with results quite confirma
tory of our views, we do not feel warranted in extending our
memoir, already much too long. We therefore conclude by
summing up, in the form of propositions, the laws which we
consider regulate the volumes of salts. At the same time we
do so with strict reference to the salts which we have de
scribed, deprecating their hasty generalization, being our
selves quite satisfied that there are peculiarities in other cases,
which must be subjected to close examination.          This being
only the first of several memoirs on the same subject which
we intend to lay before the Society, we do not present this
investigation as being in itself complete.

     On each of these heads we would offer                                 a    few remarks.
     With two assumptions                        we have been enabled                       to   connect
with each other the volumes occupied by         the salts exa                    all
mined   by          us
                   the previous
                         in      sections. These assumptions
                                                                  it, of
are, that the divisor for the volumes     salts either 11,                       is                          or
number very nearly approaching                               to
                                                that the divisor           or                             is a
9.8, the volume           of
                     ice itself.
   We have been guarded          stating positively that the first

memoir enter into the connection between this number and the
volume      ice, 9-8. To show, however, that our experiments
               of
agree with those       recent accurate experimenters, and that

rically, cannot           be
                     wide from the truth, we append the theo
retical and experimental results upon the alums, which we
stated     possess twenty-five volumes,
           to                                which therefore any     in
considerable error   the numberin     would     multiplied    11                     be                     by

this severe test,  will     seen that the theoretical and ex

as near each other as the estimation of specific gravities by
any two different experimenters.      We do not rest the claims
of our theories on our own     experiments,   but are willing to
admit the     accuracy  of other    experimenters,  especially of
Karsten, Hassenfratz, Kopp, and others who have preceded
us on this subject”; while at the same time we believe that
our methods of taking specific gravities have enabled us to
introduce more uniformity into the results. The simplicity
of the methods themselves is due to Bishop Watson, who was
the first to take specific gravities by the increase in the stem
of an instrument; and to Holker the suggestion is due of
using a saturated solution instead of the water employed by
Watson.
        We conceive that the primitive volume 9-8 is transformable
into the primitive volume 11, and vice versd, and for this reason
we sometimes see sulphate of ammonia 9.8 x 4, at other times,
in combination as in bisulphate of ammonia or the anhydrous
double sulphates, it is 11 x 4; and numerous other instances
of transformation are presented in the previous sections.
   The liquid volume being to the solid volume either as
9 : 11 or as 9 : 9.8, these numbers, used as the divisor for
the liquid and solid volumes respectively, usually yield the
same quotient.     Thus the liquid volume of sulphate of cop
per is 45,              its   solid volume            is   55.   *               =     5,   and      #    =    5;

or the difference between 11 × 3 and 9.8 x 4. This differ
ence, 6-2, added to the volume of potash alum 275 + 62 =
281.2, which is not very wide from the experimental results,
and would give the specific gravity by theory for ammonia
alum 1-616, and for ammonia iron alum l’711. These are
points which require further inquiry.
   We do not refer here to the minor views embraced in the
preceding investigation, being anxious principally for inquiry
and confirmation into the three main theories propounded.
With one assumption for the volume in solution, and with two
assumptions for the volumes of solids, we have been enabled
to explain, as we trust, the specific gravities detailed in the
previous sections. We might perhaps with propriety indulge
in speculation, and apply these laws in explanation of iso
morphism and dimorphism, but we prefer the safer course of
trusting to experimental investigation, part of which we shall
in a short time lay before the Society in an inquiry upon the
expansion of solutions, and on some other points connected
with this important subject.

of   full-grown   canes with but few    leaves,  from the island of
Grenada, was given me by Mungo Campbell, Jun., Esq.
No. 10, from Hampden estate, Trelawny, Jamaica, consisted
of transparent canes in full blossom, grown about six miles
from the sea, and manured with cattle-dung. No. 1 I consisted
also of transparent canes from Ironshore estate, St. James's,
Jamaica; they grew about 200 yards from the sea, and were
old rattoons, also manured with cattle-dung.           No. 12, from
Content estate, St. James's,    Jamaica,    were young transparent
canes, grown about three and a half miles from the sea, and
manured with cattle-dung, guano and marl.             For these last
three parcels I am indebted to the kindness of William Stir
ling, Esq. of Kenmure.
     The canes after being carefully cleaned were dried in a
stove, then charred on a plate of cast iron, and finally incine- .
rated in a Hessian crucible at a very moderate heat, so as to
prevent the ashes from melting.          The method adopted in
these analyses was chiefly that of Messrs. Fresenius and Will,
except in regard to the phosphoric acid.
     The method of proceeding was as follows:—
     I. A quantity of the ash (1 gramme) was boiled with nitric
 acid, and the filtered liquor was employed to determine the
 chlorine with nitrate of silver in the usual way.
     II. Another quantity (about 1.5 gramme), dissolved in
 muriatic acid, was employed for the determination of the sul
 phuric acid.
     III.  A third quantity (about 5:0 grammes) was boiled in a
 silver basin for about an hour with a very concentrated lye of
 caustic soda, to bring the silica into a soluble state, as the
 ashes were not completely decomposed by boiling with acids.
 The alkaline mass was then digested with nitric acid, evapo
 rated to dryness, again digested with dilute nitric acid, and
 filtered.    The silica, coal and sand in the insoluble residue
 were determined in the usual way. The liquor which passed
 through the filter was employed for the determination of the
 phosphoric acid, lime and magnesia. The whole of the liquor
 was measured in a graduated cylinder.
     a. The sulphuric acid was determined in a portion of the
 liquor by chloride of barium.
      b. Another measured quantity of the liquor, after bein
 neutralized by ammonia, was precipitated by acetate of         .#
 and the phosphoric acid it contained determined according to
 the method given by Berzelius.          The precipitate was well
  washed with    boiling  water to free it entirely from chloride of
 lead, and the sulphate of lead precipitated along with the
 phosphoric acid was calculated from the quantity of sulphuric

536                          Dr. Stenhouse's Analyses of the
acid already                 found      (in      III.    a), and was                 of      course sub
tracted.
   c. The liquor from which the phosphate of lead had been
separated (b), when freed from lead by sulphuretted hydrogen,
and rendered alkaline by ammonia, was employed for the de
termination of the lime and magnesia, by means of oxalate of
ammonia and phosphate of soda in the usual way. In the last
five cases the determination of the phosphoric acid was con
trolled by the process lately recommended by Fresenius with
sulphate of magnesia.         (See Liebig's Annalen, July 1845, and
 Chemical Gazette for October 15.)
   IV. A fourth quantity of ashes (about 2–3 grammes) was
employed to determine the alkalies.             It was digested with an
excess of barytes and a little water in a silver basin for about
two hours.       The alkaline mass was acidified with muriatic
acid, and evaporated to dryness.            It was then redissolved in
distilled water, and caustic barytes added to the solution, to
precipitate            all
                   the phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, lime and
magnesia         contained. The filtered liquor was then freed
                 it
from barytes             by
                     means       carbonate  of   ammonia, and the clear
                                                                  of
solution was     evaporated        dryness    and heated
                                              to               redness                   to               till
nothing remained but the chlorides                                of
                                                 the fixed alkalies. The
potash was separated from the soda                  means      chlorideby                of                of

grown upon the same land almost indefinitely.

  the juice they contain, are burned                  the coppers of the
 boiling-house to concentrate the syrup. As this operation re
 quires a strong, brisk fire, the furnace in which they are burned
 has usually a considerable draught, and therefore so high a
 heat, that the ashes, from the large amount of alkalies and
 silica they contain, are invariably fused into a hard, insoluble
 glass or slag. This slag or glass is usually thrown away, but
 even if it were pulverized and spread upon the fields, from                                                           its

January 1843, Mr. Davies treats the question of directrices
and foci in a manner perfectly general, and arrives at the con
clusion, that there are but two foci and two directrices in a
conic section, a result arising from the arbitrary nature of the
 definition which he had assumed as the basis of his investiga
 tion; a definition to which it would appear there                two ob                            lie

 minor directrices of the hyperbola;      and  if two  other points be
 assumed     at the distance        from the centre, these points
 are the minor foci. It is almost needless to mention that the
 distances of the common directrices and foci from the centre
 of the hyperbola are a cos   w  and  à-     respectively; hence, in
 the equilateral hyperbola,    where     w =  +,    the ordinary   and

 minor directrices coincide, as do also the common and minor
 foci; whence we may deduce the very general and remark
 able conclusion that,
     The common directrices and foci of the equilateral
 possess two distinct classes of properties, those which belong to
 them as being the common or ordinary directrices and foci, as
 also that other new and equally extensive class, to which they
 are in like manner related, as being the minor directrices and
joci of a central comic section.
     In the circle the minor directrices are infinitely distant, and
 the minor foci coincide with the centre, as is also the case with
 the ordinary directrices and foci.
     Of the following theorems, most of which are, it is believed,
 new, the demonstrations have been suppressed, as to any who
 are moderately versed in analysis, and who take an interest in
 the subject, it will give but little trouble to supply them. It
 may, however, be remarked, that the solutions of many of the
 theorems may be effected with great brevity and simplicity by
 the application of a new method in analytic geometry, the
 theory of tangential co-ordinates, an outline of which was pub
 lished some years ago by the author *.

    Theorem I. Let a quadrilateral be inscribed in a conic
section, whose sides, a, b, c, d, being produced meet one of
the minor directrices D G in the points a, 6, Y, 8, the seg
ments a 3, 3 y subtend angles at the centre, which are together
equal to two right angles.
    When the section becomes a circle, the minor directrices
recede to an infinite distance, hence the lines Oa, O3, Oy,
O 3 are parallel respectively to the sides a, b, c, d of the qua
drilateral; and therefore the angle between a and d is equal to
the angle & O 3, and the angle between c and b equal to the
angle y O 3; hence we infer, that the opposite angles of a qua
drilateral inscribed in a circle are together equal to two right
angles.
   II.  When two of the sides of the quadrilateral a and d,
suppose, are fixed, the point of intersection of b and c upon
the curve being variable, the angle 3 Oy is constant; or if two
fixed points be assumed on a conic section and a third va
riable, the cords which pass through the latter and the two
former intercept on one of the minor directrices a segment
which subtends at the centre a constant angle; hence we may
infer, as in the last proposition, that the angle in a given seg
ment of a circle is constant.

                       there are drawn two tangents to the

conic sections having the same minor directrices, somewhat
analogous to those of confocal conic sections; we cannot on
the present occasion give more than a few of them. Let k be
the distance between the common centre and one of the direc
trices, then the axes are connected by the relation

lopes a circle; and if tangents are drawn to the curves through
the points where the central radii vectores intersect them, the
locus of the intersection of those tangents will be a conic sec

former.

 ter, which is in the circuit of the induced wire, indicates an
 instantaneous current equal to the difference which that
 lengthening has produced.
    61. Two cases might present themselves between the limits
 of induction, which correspond to zero and to an infinite length
 of the additional wire, applying the word infinite to that which
 compels the current to discharge itself wholly by the constant
 wire. If for constantly increasing lengths we should find the
 values of the induced current constantly increasing, or inter
 mittent values, one while greater, at another less, then only
 there would be interference in the induced circuit.             Now, a

     The   quantities           of
                               oxygen which were then separable from the
 blood    by  the   air-pump     were but small. The author has now en

 blood, especially with regard                 oxygen.      With this object, the

 blood was agitated with continually renewed portions                   atmospheric                of
 air, and    to ascertain    subsequently     how much air          contained from           it
 absorption,      itwas placed           vessel filled with mercury, and which
                                             in   a
 was closed with               an
                           iron stop-cock.       This was then screwed upon                                       a
second    vessel,   likewise closed with         stop-cock, and containing car
                                                                a
 bonic acid. On           opening    the  cock,   the mercury fell out and the
 carbonic acid ascended              the blood. The vessels were then sepa
                                            to
 rated, and the blood continually agitated with the carbonic acid.
 The vessel was then screwed upon another completely filled with
 mercury, and the gas was allowed                 collect       to
                                                              this. Carbonic acid      in
 was then          the same manner again mixed with the blood, which
                  in
 was then agitated and the gas also conveyed into this vessel; and
this process was repeated several times.                Finally, the collected gas
was examined, the carbonic acid being absorbed                      caustic potash,          by
the oxygen being detonated with hydrogen, and the remainder con
sidered      asnitrogen.
    Although these experiments appear                   simple,     was  so first im         it         at
possible     to carry them out, because the time which                 was requisite              it
to  allow for the subsidence                      of
                                          the froth after each agitation was                                      so
great that decomposition commenced                    the blood before the com
                                                                     in
pletion   of  the experiment.
    This difficulty was subsequently removed                    adding      drop        by              a         of
oil, which when placed                   on
                                     the surface                     of
                                                       the blood soon caused the
disappearance             of
                        the froth.
    Numerous and repeated experiments, made                    this manner,       the  in                    on

results, the minimum                of

 no  air had entered the vessels from without during the experiment.
Had this been the case, the quantities                      the two gases found   of

whole of the absorbed gas; but the more frequently fresh carbonic
acid is added to the blood, the greater must be the quantity of gas.
This is also true in practice; but after renewing the carbonic acid
3 or 4 times, the increase in the quantity of gas was found to be so
small, that it fell within the limits of error of observation.           More
over, all the experiments were carried out under the same conditions.
About 400 cubic centimetres of blood were usually employed; a
smaller quantity was only used for some experiments.              Too small a
quantity could not be applied, as the amount of gas obtained is very
small. The volume of carbonic acid, which was each time shaken
with the blood, was never less than that of the blood itself; nor could
much larger quantities be taken, because the vessels when com
pletely filled with mercury would be managed with too much diffi
culty, and would be readily broken. Even in their present size con
taining about 700 cubic centimetres, they must be made of exceed
ingly strong glass.         They are tall and cylindrical, with a narrow
neck, and are graduated in cubic centimetres.

the blood was capable of absorbing,               the author has proved, suf
                                                       is,   as

spired      absorbed         the blood; but        doubtful whether the arte

                                                        as
atmospheric air, and whether the quantities obtained were but                                       a
small portion          of
                      the oxygen really absorbed.
   To decide this, the experiments were varied,                         so
                                                              that the blood
was first agitated with constantly renewed quantities                 carbonic       of
acid,   to  remove the whole              of
                                       the oxygen and nitrogen absorbed.
The blood was then repeatedly shaken with measured quantities                                       of
atmospheric air, and the remaining air was again measured, and the
quantity         carbonic acid, oxygen and nitrogen ascertained
                of                                                           the              by

   In   one       of
                   these experiments calves' blood was uninterruptedly
 shaken with      atmospheric     air;    was then repeatedly agitated with

    These experiments show that the blood is capable of absorbing
14 times its volume of carbonic acid, a result which has also been
obtained by other observers. They moreover show that it is capable
of absorbing from 10 to 12.5 per cent. of          volume     oxygen                        its                of

                                ANALYSIS OF SPHENE.
    M.  Rose remarks, that the difficulty which exists in separating
silica and titanic acid occasions the few analyses of sphène which
have been made to differ considerably from each other.
    Klaproth first analysed the sphène of Passau by fusing it with hy
drate of potash; the mass dissolved in water, supersaturated with
hydrochloric acid, left the silica as a residue, and the filtered solu
tion was precipitated by solution of carbonate of potash; the pre
cipitate after drying was digested in hydrochloric acid and left an
additional residue of silica; ammonia poured into the filtered liquor
precipitated the titanic acid, and after its separation the lime was
obtained by carbonate of potash.
    Klaproth afterwards analysed the sphène of Salzbourg by digest
ing with heat in hydrochloric acid; the insoluble residue was fused
with carbonate of potash, treated with water, and the solution was
saturated with hydrochloric acid; the hydrochloric solutions were
mixed and precipitated by ammonia, and the filtered liquor was
freed from lime by carbonate of potash. The mixture of silica and
titanic acid, precipitated by ammonia, was moderately dried and
treated with hydrochloric acid, which dissolving the titanic acid, left
the silica undissolved.
    The results of these analyses were as follows:–

    These results differ greatly from each other; it could not be other

adapted than the first to give approximative results; but yet the

and afterwards the lime by caustic potash. M. Rose observes, that
these three analyses, which have been made for a considerable time,
are not entitled to great confidence; he afterwards states, that Fuchs
has recently given an analysis of the sphène of Schwartzenstein in
Zillerthal, by a very ingenious method. The action upon it by hy
drochloric acid not succeeding, he fused it with potash, and boiled
the calcined mass in distilled water, in order to get rid of the excess
of potash, and separated by the usual processes a small quantity of
silica dissolved in the operation. The residue was dissolved in con
centrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution out of the contact of
air was left for several days in contact with copper turnings at a
moderate temperature. The silica formed a jelly, whilst the titanic
acid, reduced by the copper to the state of oxide of titanium, re
mained dissolved in the liquor, which became of a deep blue colour.
    The silica being separated, the oxide of titanium contained in the
liquor was converted into titanic acid, and precipitated by ammonia;
an oxalate poured into the filtered solution precipitated the lime.
The quantity of copper dissolved by the hydrochloric acid gave that
of the titanic acid.
