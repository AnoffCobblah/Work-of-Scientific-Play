A PRECIPITATE            is washed either by filtration or by decan
       tation: in the former case the portion of liquid not mecha
nically retained is allowed to drain from the precipitate; in the
latter it is separated by simply pouring it away, the foreign sub
stances contained in the precipitate being then removed by the
repeated addition of some washing-fluid, in each successive por
tion of which the pre-ipitate            is,
                                       far    possible, uniformly sus
                                               as         as
pended, this process being continued until the amount              im                        of
purity becomes         sominute that       presence its

4.            Prof. R. Bunsen on the Washing of Precipitates.
      I by far prefer using   this Table to employing the method ge
 nerally followed of ascertaining the completion of the washing
 process by evaporating a quantity of the filtrate on platinum-foil,
 since in the latter case it is only possible to obtain an infallible
proof when we have to deal with a precipitate possessing an ex
 tremely high degree of insolubility; if the precipitate be soluble
to any marked extent, the result is completely illusory.
    In the process of filtration as hitherto conducted, the time
required is so long and the quantity of wash-water needed so
great that some simplification of this continually recurring ope
ration is in the highest degree desirable. The following method,
which depends, not upon the removal of the impurity by simple
attenuation, but upon                      its
                                   displacement          forcing the wash by
water   through   the  precipitate,     appears      me          to
                                                             combine        the to          all
requisite conditions and therefore             satisfy the need.

unfrequently happens, even in the hands of experienced mani
pulators, in consequence of the agitation it is necessary to give
to the contents of the filter to effect their complete washing,
that the surface of the filter becomes injured and torn, so that
the precipitate becomes mixed with filaments of paper; this is
particularly the case in using hot water.            Supposing the preci
pitate to consist of mixed hydrates of the sesquioxides (for ex
ample, iron and alumina), it will be found, on redissolving in an
acid, that the filaments, like tartaric acid, prevent the complete
separation of these substances by subsequent precipitation; thus
the alumina will contain iron, and on precipitation by means of
ammonium sulphide will be coloured black.                  On the other
hand, by employing the new method the precipitate coheres so
firmly that the introduction of this source of error is impossible,
even by using common grey filter-paper.              The most gelatinous
precipitates, as hydrated ferric oxide, alumina, &c., adhere to the
filter in a thin coherent layer, and may be removed, piece after
piece, so completely that the paper remains perfectly clean and
white.      The advantage thus gained where it is necessary to
transfer mixed precipitates to another vessel in order to effect
their subsequent separation is evident.
    The filter-pump, moreover, is exceedingly serviceable in sepa
rating precipitates or crystals from syrupy mother-liquors. Thus
honey-sugar may be so completely separated from the thick
 viscid liquid in which it forms by a filter of coarse grey paper,
 that it remains only slightly coloured, and by a single crystalli
 zation from alcohol may be obtained in small white shining
 needles.     And since the bulk of the moist precipitates, particu
 larly that of the more gelatinous, is so much diminished under
 the high pressure, the precipitate only occupying one-third to
                        its
                      bulk under ordinary circumstances,

  The upper surfaces of the plates may afterwards be rendered

     By the aid of these pumice-stone filters many chemical pro

 almost impossible.          For the sake of example             take the prepa      I

 possible to filter, wash, and dry crystals of this substance an inch
 in length. A solution of 2 parts of potassium dichromate in
 20 parts of water mixed with 10 parts of concentrated sulphuric
 acid, deposits, after standing about 24 hours, numerous brilliant
 needles of chromic anhydride.                These may be drained from
 adhering mother-liquor upon the pumice filter by means of the
 pump, and in a few minutes completely washed by a small quan
 tity of fuming nitric acid free from nitrous acid. A covering of
 tolerably strong sheet copper provided with two arms, as shown
 in fig. 5, is then placed round the tube; by hanging lamps upon
 the arms the tube may be readily heated to about 60° or 80°C.;
 and by connecting a chloride-of-calcium tube with the upper
 end of the glass vessel, a current of dry air may be drawn through
 the apparatus by means of the pump, and thus in a compara

comes somewhat rarefied; and in order to employ the consequent
difference in pressure (amounting to a column of mercury about
0-2 metre in height) for the purpose of filtration, it is only ne
cessary to connect the mouth of the upper bottle with the tube
of the filter-flask.  When the water has ceased to flow, the po
sition of the bottle is reversed, when the operation recommences.
So small a pressure as 0.2 metre suffices to render the filter and
its contents   far dry that they may

surrounding it with iced water.   A cloth dipped in iced water is
now wrapped round the neck of the flask, and the bulb placed
in the water-bath for a few minutes until the first signs of reac
tion are visible. It is then removed from the water-bath and
wafted about in the air.   As soon as the chief part of the reac
tion is over, the flask is replaced in the water-bath for a few
minutes. This process is repeated with fresh supplies of mate
rial in clean flasks. The contents of the flasks are now dissolved
in water, and the solution so obtained distilled with excess of
potash.     This solution is very dark in colour.      The alkaline
distillate, which smells strongly of pyridine, is rendered acid with
sulphuric acid, and boiled to expel traces of neutral oily matters.
It is then considerably concentrated by evaporation in the water
bath, and finally pieces of potash are added.        The oily liquid
which rises to the surface is pyridine.   It was recognized to be
such by       its
            extreme  stability,       odour, and  by   its

             Hofmann’s recent researches                          on

now recognize two distinct kinds            isomerism amongst the ni
                                                       of
triles:—first, isomerism dependent             the linking   onthe carbon         of
inter  se; second,     isomerism    dependent        the atomicity on  the             of
nitrogen.
    As   anexample         the first kind
                             of                isomerism, we may men

                      isopropyle

tion   cyanide                      and  cyanide

nitriles independently          the atomicity

     (1) N'" C" C" N".         this case the two equivalents
                                             In                                              of
cyanogen which constitute the molecule are held together                               by   the

           C"                            In this    case the equivalents       are held
together by the nitrogen.
   (3) C" N" C" N".          In this case the equivalents are held
together by one carbon and one nitrogen.
  If the first of these assumed compounds were to be combined
with a monatomic body, it would yield a compound (M = mon
atomic body) of the following constitution, N"C" M, the mon
atomic body being attached to the C. The second would yield
C"N"M, “M”           being attached to the nitrogen. The third
would obviously yield a mixture of the first two in atomic pro
portions.    By assuming the existence of the first two of these
different forms of cyanogen, we are enabled to give an account of
the difference between the two classes of nitriles; and we think
that some grounds exist for making this assumption.
   We find that the action of the iodides of the alcohol-radicals
on different metallic cyanides produce different nitriles.    For
example, as Meyer showed many years ago, the cyanide of ethyle
produced by the action of cyanide of silver on iodide of ethyle
yields ethylamine when treated with an acid. Hofmann has
shown that the complementary product in this reaction is formic
acid; and we, who have also examined this action, can corroborate
the observation.   Again, cyanide of mercury under some cir
cumstances may be made to yield both of the isomeric cyanides
by the action of the alcoholic iodides. We have not completed
the examination of this reaction.  A volatile mercury compound
is formed at the same time. As Hofmann has pointed out, the
isomeric nitriles are reproduced when the sulphovinic salts act
on the metallic cyanides, though not in quantity.
   The above facts appear explicable only on the hypothesis of
two distinct cyanogens, or, in other words, on the assumption
that in some cases cyanogen unites by                        its
                                           carbon and sometimes
by   its
       nitrogen. The two cyanides      ethyle would thenof     re                   be
presented       thus:–
                     (2) (1)

                                                        of

    The first two of these methods may also give rise to the so-called
pseudo-cyanides; or perhaps we should say that analogous opera
tions on differently constituted metallic cyanides give rise to the
pseudo-cyanides.         It proves nothing against this hypothesis
that one and the same metallic cyanide may give rise to both, or
now one and now the other of the cyanides; for the metallic
cyanides themselves may be very liable to change their internal
arrangement in accordance with external circumstances.
    The third process gives us but one cyanide—the normal one.
    The question naturally arises, is there any analogue of this
last process which will give rise to the pseudo-cyanides? Perhaps

   The agitations to which I ascribe the heating are communi

gularities in the working of the axes and wheels, and are snch

continually moved backwards and forwards.
   Such      oscillation cannot escape observation; for the radius
                 an

          the disk.
   Stewart and Tait have,             true, noticed this phenomenon;

both sides      the edge*. They explain this,

assumption that disk and axis were not fastened                each other             to
exactly      right angles.
                 at                consider
                                          I      not less probable that

an oscillation of the axis was the cause.
      If,
       however, this assumption           correct,      is necessary con
                                                                       it     is a

                                                         bybe
disk. This,        fact, was noticed
                       in                   Stewart and Tait; for they
                                                   go
                                           as of                                                as by
found that while the disk             inch thickness deviated        0.015
inch, that which was half          thick moved        and down       muchup
as 0.02 inch.              -
  It  follows, moreover, from this assumption that the vis viva
which was communicated           the disk    to  the wheelwork must by
have been the same         both cases. The quantities
                                     in                        heat re                      of
sulting from these equal vires viva must have been equal; that
is, the one           of
                half the thickness must have been twice          hot                            as             as
the one which was double.      This,   however,      exactly what has       is
been observed              by
                    Stewart and Taiti.
   After this confirmation         the hypothesis,
                                              of        seemed worth           it

          calculate the  magnitude                       of

into heat         by
               agitations and impulses.
   In this calculation we are concerned both with the number of
the impulses and with their strength.
   Since the wheelwork runs with constant velocity, the impulses
occur regularly.    The axis      the disk rolls, therefore, with re

 Stewart and Tait have observed that the heating               the disk                        of                  is

 we  might       temptedbe    conclude that the heating

cillation k is therefore inversely proportional to the thickness,
and it follows that the heating of the disk must also increase
inversely as the thickness.
    All the magnitudes occurring in the formula are known from
Stewart and Tait's measurements, or may easily be calculated
from them, including the constant h which defines the thermal
radiation.    No direct statements have been published; so much
the more    interesting, therefore, does it appear to deduce their
value from the observations in question.

   In this formula  S denotes the temperature of the surrounding
medium, t the excess of the temperature of the heated body, p the
pressure of the surrounding air; the other signs denote constants,
   From the formula adduced, the value of the coefficient of
thermal radiation is obtained by division by the value t, assumed
to be very small. We have thus

surface, in case p is expressed in atmospheres, is for atmospheric
all”
                           m   = 0.0168.
   The first number is deduced from his own observation, the
latter from occasional statements of Dulong and Petit.  Both
numbers refer to Paris lines and minutes as units.
   Using these values, and taking from Stewart and Tait's ob
 servation
                     p=0.010 atmosphere,
                     t=0°45 C.,
and putting S = about   20°C.,    we get from the above formula the
value
                           h=0.0013,
expressed, again, in millimetres and seconds of time.
  The concordance of the value deduced above from Stewart and
Tait's observation with this directly found is greater than was to
be expected from the multifold uncertainty of the observations.
   Another beautiful agreement is also met with. According to
a communication of Professor Neumann, for a metallic surface
                       m= about 0.5,
that    is,
       about one-seventh that        lampblack surface. We get

The consequences of this hypothesis are developed in an elabo
rate mathematical      memoir to be found in the twenty-fourth
volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society. But
the reception of the doctrine seems to have been based rather on
faith in          its
             author than        any critical examination
                                           on                      logical                  of       its

 the nearest centre will be behind the other. This apparent oscil
 lation of the two centres is indeed an immediate effect of the
 moon’s libration in longitude.                    -
     Now the inequalities in the moon’s motion, computed from
 the theory of gravitation, are those of a supposed centre of gra
 vity.   But the inequalities given by observation are those of the
 centre of figure.     Hence, in the case supposed, the inequalities
 of observation will be greater than those of theory. Also their
 ratio will be inversely as that of the distances of the centres
 which they represent.
    Professor Hansen, in comparing his theory with observations,
 found that the theoretical inequalities would agree better with
 observation when multiplied by the constant factor 1.0001544.
 Supposing that this result could be accounted for on the hypo
thesis of a separation of the centres of gravity and figure, he
thence inferred that the hypothesis was true. But the result
cannot be entirely accounted for in this way, because the largest
 inequality of theory (evection) has a factor (excentricity) which
 can only be determined from observation; and therefore even
the theoretical evection is that of the centre of figure, and not of
 the centre of gravity.     It must not be forgotten that the excen
tricity, which is not given by theory, is subject to be multiplied
by the same factor that multiplies the other inequalities. To be
 more explicit,
    Let e be the true excentricity of the orbit described by the
moon’s centre of gravity.       Then the true evection in the same
orbit will be
                                ex A,
 A being   a factor depending principally on the mean motions of
the sun and moon.        And on Hansen’s hypothesis, the apparent
evection, or that of the centre of figure, will be
                         ex A x 1.0001544.
On the same hypothesis, the excentricity derived from observa
tion, being half the coefficient of the principal term of the equa
tion of the centre, will be
                            ex 1.0001544,
and the theoretical evection       computed   with this excentricity
will be
                          ex 1.0001544 x A,
which is the same with that derived from observation.         Hence
    The theoretical evection will agree with that of observation, not
withstanding a separation of the centres of gravity and figure of the
1720072.

  That Hansen overlooked this point is to be attributed to his
method of determining the lunar perturbations by numerical
computation from the various elements of the moon’s motion, so
that the manner in which the inequality depends on the elements
does not appear.  It is only when we determine the perturba
tions in algebraic form that this dependence appears.
    Passing now from the evection, the next great perturbation of
the moon’s motion is the variation.         But the value of this per
turbation has not been      accurately   determined from observation,
because, attaining             its
                         maxima and minima          the moon's octants,   in
it   iscomplicated with the moon’s semidiameter and parallactic
inequality.      Even   the semidiameter

The differences are too minute to found any theory upon. .
   Leaving the evection and variation, the other inequalities are
so minute that their product by Hansen's coefficient is altogether
insensible.
   Summing up the results of our inquiry, it appears that in the
case of the evection the supposed discordance between theory
and observation would not follow from Hansen’s hypothesis, and
therefore, even if it exists, cannot be attributed to that hypo
thesis as a cause.  In the case of the variation no such discord
ance has been proved.    In the case of the other inequalities the
discordance would be insensible.
   The hypothesis is therefore devoid of logical foundation.

36              Mr. R. Edmonds              on Eartraordinary       Agitations
respectively lower and higher than on any other day of the year
up to June. The maximum of the thermometer at Plymouth
this day was 74°, the minimum of the preceding night 44°,
showing a range of 30°, whilst at Penzance the contemporaneous
range was only 15°. The weather at Plymouth this forenoon
was very foggy, and of such an unusual character that on going
out of doors into the street I felt as if entering a hothouse. The
above readings of the barometer and thermometer are from the
registers kept at Penzance by Mr. Richards, and at Plymouth
by Mr. Merrifield.
    On the following morning, the 7th of May, at the Plymouth
Great Western Docks, when the gatekeeper went to close the
gates at high water about 7.30, he observed to his surprise an
extraordinary current rushing through them into the dock, and
rising to the perpendicular height of one foot above the proper
level of the tide at that time.     When it ceased he immediately
closed the  gates, and did not wait to see if it were succeeded by
other such currents. The thermometer this day in Plymouth
was 78°, the maximum of the year up to the 11th of June.
     I
     have, in my last paper (read before the Society in 1865%),
described a similar but much greater disturbance of the sea in
Mount’s Bay and Plymouth on the 14th of October, 1862, and
have therein referred to those of the 31st of May and 8th of June,
1811, 5th of July and 30th of October, 1843, 23rd of May,
1847, and the 25th–26th of June and the 4th of October,
 1859—which also occurred contemporaneously in those places,
                  I
and which had previously describedt, together with the accom
panying states of the atmosphere.
   The only simultaneous disturbance of the sea of this nature
in Mount’s Bay and Plymouth during the last century which                                        I
can find recorded besides those on the days of the two great
earthquakes of Lisbon, is that of the 28th of July, 1761, when
the sea in Mount’s Bay rose             feet above   six proper level.   its

bay, Plymouth, informed me that,        the huge waves rolled         as                                                 in
and the vessels outside the docks mounted over them, great parts

 and at high water the waves swept over the gates into the docks,
 a thing never known before.      The cause of this unusual disturb
 ance was no doubt a storm from the south-west, some hundreds
 of miles off in the Atlantic, which never reached us. These huge
  breakers would have commanded the attention of every one, how
  ever unobservant, who happened to be near and in sight of them.
  But the tide-like currents which I have described, when occur
  ring on an open shore would not attract the attention of any one,
 however observant, even if he were close to them, unless he
  watched them for some time, or unless he knew whether the or
  dinary tide were then coming or going, and saw that this extra
 ordinary current was moving in an opposite direction. This
 quiet tide-like motion of the water up and down an open beach
 was strikingly shown during one of the extraordinary agitations
 of the sea in 1843, by the conduct of some children, who were
 then amusing themselves on the beach and rocks, near the
 Chimney Rock in Penzance, and had been there long enough to
 observe that the sea was flowing in and out very differently
 from usual, and at intervals of about ten or fifteen minutes.
 Instead of running home at once and telling their parents
 what an extraordinary thing they had seen, they preferred
 making use of their knowledge for some new kind of play;
 and accordingly, when they were joined on the beach by other
 children who had not been present long enough to make the
 same discovery as themselves, they told them to go out on the
 rocks to see something. These new comers, therefore, suspecting
 nothing, and observing, as they thought, that the tide was going
 and had left the rocks dry, and not dreaming that there was any
 possibility of the sea coming in again for some hours, went on
 the rocks as they were told by their playfellows; and before they
 could return, the current surrounded them.      After waiting a few
 minutes in a great fright lest they should be drowned, the sea
 began again to ebb, and in a few minutes more they reached the
 beach in safety.
     P.S.—These phenomena commence generally with an efflux
 or retirement of the sea.    And it appears from the newspapers
that those accompanying the great earthquake of the 15th of
August last along the western coasts of South America began
with an efflux, as did also those on the same day in New Zealand,
when “the sea rushed out and in with extraordinary violence,
and in some places in the South Island great damage was done
by the sea going far over the usual high-water mark.”          This
rushing out and in of the sea in New Zealand and on the South
American coast was in    all  probability occasioned     each place
                                                           in

   But because no earthquake shock was felt on that day in Cali
fornia, nor in New Zealand until a day or two afterwards, the
writer of the article in the ‘Times           of the 3rd of November,
beginning with “There are earthquakes in divers places,”
boldly states, without referring to any authority, that “on the
15th of August the most terrible earthquake ever known wrecked
and then drowned many hundreds of miles of the South-Ame
rican coast, sending a wave as far north as California, and right
across the Pacific (8000 miles) to our own countrymen in New
Zealand.”      This untenable hypothesis I have already fully dis
proved in my last paper above referred                                  to,

VII.    Eaperimental Proof that the Electric Spark is an Electro
                       motor.     By E. DDLUND*.
       former paperst I have proved
 INwhich     the voltaic current exerts
                                          that by the mechanical work
                                         in disintegrating the poles in
producing the electric light, an electromotive force results which
sends a current in a direction opposite to that of the principal
current. As, in an electric discharge, when sparks are formed in
the air there is also a disintegration of the polar surfaces, the idea
readily suggested itself that the electric spark, like the voltaic
arc, might possibly be an electromotor. To investigate this point
more minutely, I have, in common with Dr. Lemström of Helsing
fors, made the following experiments.
    A Holtz's machine, made by Ruhmkorff of Paris, was used in
the investigation. The rotating glass disk had a diameter of 55
centims, and each of the jars belonging to the apparatus had a
coated surface of 42 square centims.         The copper galvanometer
wire was 1 millim. in diameter, and was surrounded by a layer
of gutta percha 2 millims. in diameter.        The entire thickness of
the wire, the insulating layer included, amounted to 5 millims.
This wire was coiled in forty turns round a wooden frame. The
aperture inside the frame, in which the needle was suspended by
a cocoon-thread, was 5 centims. in length and 3 centims. high.
To protect the needle from draughts, the instrument was enclosed
in a glass jar.
    2. If the voltaic current which, it is assumed, is produced in
the electric spark, is to be investigated by the aid of the galva
nometer, the spark must be connected with the galvanometer by
a closed circuit.     This necessary condition was satisfied, after
many vain attempts, in the following manner:—
   In the following figure, AB represents the rotating disk, and ab
the two combs.       An insulated copper wire a c is directly con
nected with a, while the insulated wire de terminates in a brass
knob d in the neighbourhood of b.          From c and e insulated wires
pass to the knobs      f and g.    Two other conducting-wires lead
from the points c and e to the galvanometer G. At m a rheostat
is introduced, which consists of an insulated thin German-silver
wire.     If the machine is charged and the disk A B put in rota
tion, and if moreover the resistance at m and the distance between
the knobs fg and b d is suitably adjusted, sparks pass simulta

b and d.       If the
                 wires are connected                             4                          re
in the simple manner represented by
the figure, a difficulty is met with
which at first          I
                  could not entirely
remove.        The electric discharge does
not, of course, entirely pass through
the spark fg, but part passes through
the galvanometer G. The galvano
meter-wires coated with gutta percha
acquire thus an electric charge which
acts electroscopically upon the mag
netic needle and draws it on one side.
This charge was retained for some
time after the machine was at rest,
and caused a deflection. It is possible
that this charge might have been
avoided     if the   galvanometer             had been
differently constructed, and the con
ducting wire had been otherwise                         in
sulated.     The charge in question
was ultimately quite removed, and the position of equilibrium of
the needle made quite independent of                              it,   by
                                                       directly connecting

turned.     This was    always   the  case;  and when the disk rotated

each other so closely that the equilibrium    of the needle was con
stant. The    position  of equilibrium  could not, of course, be                      di
rectly observed, because the needle constantly oscillated; but a
knowledge of it was attained by observing the points on the scale
towards which the needle turned. If the positive electricity
passed from the comb a to the conduction, the deflection of
the magnetic needle was always towards the left of the scale.
                              f
When now the knobs and g were pushed so close together that
sparks ensued between them, the deflection ought to have been less
than before, because part of the current would pass through the
                                                     f
conduction cfge. If the spark at g were only a conductor of
electricity, this must have been the case. But instead of this the
 deflection was from fifteen to twenty times as much as before.
The deflection was in the same direction as if no sparks had been
formed between         f
                     and g. When the positive current starts from
a it divides at  c; part flows through the spark at fg, and another
part through the galvanometer in the same direction as indicated
 by the dotted arrows. Now, if there is in the electric spark, as
 there is in the voltaic arc, a galvanic current in a direction op
posed to that                     it will traverse the conductors
                      of the discharge,
in the direction indicated  by the arrows; hence there must be
deflections of the magnetic needle in the same direction as the
discharge; and this was always the case. From this the con
clusion must be drawn that in the electric spark there is an
electromotive force which sends a current in an opposite direction
to the discharge which the spark causes.
   To test more completely the correctness of this conclusion, the
connexion between the spark-apparatus and the conducting wires
was altered as follows.      This apparatus was removed from the
bridge between c and e and inserted at n instead.       In the bridge
between c and e the rheostat was inserted which had hitherto
been at m.    As is at once seen, the galvanic current of the spark
must now produce a deflection in the magnetic needle in a di
rection the reverse of that of the original current; the experi
ments showed also that this was always the case. The magni
                                                                                 on

                                       ascertain whether the voltaic
spark could produce chemical decompositions.         For this purpose
the conductions      the galvanometer were removed, and instead

of the rheostat wire      voltameter was inserted between

  44               Prof. E. Edlund’s Eaperimental Proof that
  obtained.    Thereupon the same experiment was made with a
  battery of a few Bunsen’s elements, after so great a resistance
  had been interposed in the conduction that the deflection of the
  galvanometer was about as great as that produced by the voltaic
  spark current. But just as little with this current was there a
  certain proof of the decomposition        of water. The currents in
  both cases were too feeble to produce distinct ascending gas
 bubbles; the gas which is produced by so feeble a current is so
  small in quantity that it is partially retained by the platinum
  disks and partially absorbed by the liquid. It was next attempted
  to ascertain whether the voltaic-spark current was sufficiently
 strong to produce a polarization in the platinum disks. With this
 view a glass vessel was filled with water containing sulphuric acid,
 in which were placed two pieces of platinum-foil, one connected
 with i and the other with k. While the electrophorus disk was
 turned, the conducting-wires of the galvanometer were separated
 from i and k, but by means of a commutator could be again joined
 with these points as soon as the comb a was connected by means
 of a brass rod with the comb b and therefore all flow of electri
 city to the polarization-vessel ceased.       If the discharge was now
 allowed to pass through the polarization-vessel for a given time

 between them, a feeble polarization-current was always obtained

polarization-current was obtained which was much stronger than
before.    The deflection took place towards the proper side, and

joined by the rheostat wire of German silver, which had pre
viously been at m. The deflections thus obtained were now to
the right of the scale, instead of to the left as the others had been
—a deportment which can only be explained on the assumption
that the spark is electromotive.

    The deflection amounted thus to 17-8 divisions.
    The reason why the deflections were smaller than before was,
that the resistance in the bridge only consisted of the rheostat
wire m, in consequence of which the greater part of the electric
discharge took this path. The distance between the knobs must
therefore be small if the sparks are to jump across.

of h.   While the disk was being turned, and the current there

was removed.         After a definite time the machine was made in
active by directly connecting the combs a and b. Thereupon the
galvanometer-wire was connected as rapidly as possible with the
polarization-vessel, and the successive positions of equilibrium of
the magnetic needle were observed.

   To obtain a measure for the magnitude of the electromotive
force, the conducting-wires of a battery were interposed between
e and m. When a spark passed between       and g, the voltaic cir    f
cuit was closed by the conducting spark, but was open in the
other case; and the current which formed in the spark had to
pass through the voltaic battery.    Both currents had therefore
to traverse the same   circuit, and both only existed during the
time in which the   spark passed between   and g. The ratio be       f
tween the deflections which each current produced in the galva
nometer must be equal to the ratio between their electromotive
forces.    By means of a commutator the current of the battery
might be reversed; so that it either went in the same direction as
the spark-current, or in the one opposite to           the deflection     is        If

       the battery consisted of ten elements, the electromotive

force of the spark was equal to that of 582 Bunsen’s elements.
   It must here be at the same time remarked that the deflection
a is not exclusively caused by the spark-current, but part de
pends on the electrical discharge of the machine. To obtain at
any rate a limiting value for this part the following experiments

    The electromotive      force   amounts therefore to 51°5 elements.
If  6-3 is subtracted from 880, we get as the limiting value for
the same force that of 47-8 elements.

arc. From     a   former determination, this, when the poles were                                            of
brass, was about equal            that        to elements; but of     15

electric spark, from what has been above said,        amounts       from        it
 50   to 60 elements; and yet the disintegration         the poles with           of
the luminous arc appears               very much stronger than with
                                              to       be
the spark.
    Two circumstances must here be taken into account.            In the
first place, the voltaic arcis continuous and the spark discontinuous.
The duration      of the spark,       well known, depends
                                               as      is         several                       on
circumstances.          Under the circumstances                            of   the present          experi

              the Electric Spark is an Electromotor.               53
ments it cannot be more than the 0-0001 of second.         The num
ber of  sparks   which passed   in each second did  certainly not ex
ceed 10. With this assumption we arrive at the conclusion that
the passage of sparks from one pole to the other does not occupy
more than 0-001 of the time during which the machine is being
worked.     Moreover it must be considered that each spark, as
Feddersen has shown, is no continuous whole, but consists of
a number of partial sparks. In order to compare the mechanical
activity of the luminous arc and that of the current of sparks as
regards the disintegration of the polar surfaces, we must on these
assumptions first multiply that of the latter by 1000; and it is
possible that in fact a still larger number must be taken.      And,
secondly, the metallic polar surfaces on the luminous arc have
so a high temperature that they are often near their fusing-point,
while with the spark they are only slightly warmer than the sur
rounding medium.       Hence in the latter case the disintegration
requires much more work than in the former. Taking into con
sideration this circumstance, the difference between the mecha

motive force the distance between the knobs b and d was un

distance  might  produce, the following experiments were made:–
   Eageriment 25. The battery consisted this time also of ten
Bunsen’s elements.      The distance between the knobs b and d
was about 8 millims.       Formation of sparks between      f and g.

    The electromotive force is equal to that of 44.5 elements.
    From the last two experiments it follows that the electromo
tive force is independent of the distance between the knobs b
and d. As is at once seen, y represents the conducting-power in
the entire circuit; and this depends principally on the conduct
                                 f
ing-power in the sparks at and g, and on their number. In ex
periment 25, y was almost twice as great as in experiment 26.
Yet this is easily explained if we consider that the sparks in the
first case followed each other much more rapidly than in the latter.
    The subject    I have here undertaken to treat is by no means
completely exhausted by the experiments adduced.                   Several
questions which are in the closest connexion with it require fur
ther investigation.      It is only after these questions have been
answered that it can be settled whether the electromotive force
may in the future find a practical application.

           discovery of the property which I am about to describe
THEarose        out of the efforts which have been made, during the
last two years, to reduce the internal heat generated in an electro
magnetic machine by the induction-currents set up in the elec
tromagnet and armature by the rapid magnetization and demag
netization of the latter. This heating of the armature (as is well
known) was first observed by Dr. Joule in 1843, as the result of
a delicate investigation on the quantitative relation existing be
tween ordinary mechanical power and heatt.                In the electro
magnetic machines of my invention this phenomenon unfortu
mately manifests itself on an alarming scale, so much so that
the armature of the 10-inch machine rises in the course of a few
hours to 300°F. and upwards; and were the action of the ma
chine to be continued for any lengthened period, the insulation
of the armature-coils would be in great danger of being destroyed.

Mr. H. Wilde       on a Property      of the Magneto-electric  Current.   55
   One method of mitigating this evil was to construct the ma
chine of smaller dimensions, so as to afford greater facilities for
the dissipation of the heat by radiation and conduction.                 But
even in the smaller machines an inconvenient residuum of heat
still remained when the machines were worked continuously for
a considerable time, such as to render it desirable to adopt some
means for abstracting the heat more rapidly.                 By means of a
current of water circulating in the hollow brass segments which
form part of the magnet-cylinder, Mr. Charles E. Ryder, the skil
ful manager at the works of Messrs. Elkington and Co., has
happily succeeded in so far reducing this heating as to permit
of the machines being worked for days and nights together with
out intermission, and without any sensible diminution of the
                                                                           -
power of the current.
   The machines which have been found to be the most efficien
and economical in their working are those which have armatures
from 3% to 4 inches in diameter.              The armatures are driven at
about 2000 revolutions per minute; and the water, after having
passed through the magnet-cylinder, is used for supplying the
boilers which furnish the power for driving the machines.
   I  have already shown elsewhere that the current from a small
magneto-electric or electromagnetic machine is sufficient to ex
cite the great electromagnet of the 10-inch machine; and it has
been further found, by my friend Mr. G. C. Lowe, that the cur
rent from one small machine is sufficient to excite simultaneously
the electromagnets of several small machines.               In a number of
3}-inch machines which have been constructed under my direc
tion for Messrs. Elkington and Co., for the electrodeposition of
copper on a large scale, the currents from two 3-inch electro
magnetic machines are made to excite the electromagnets of
twenty similar-sized machines to a degree sufficient to bring out
the maximum dynamic effect of each machine.                 The electromag
nets of the two 3-inch           exciting   machines are charged by the
current from a small 24-inch magneto-electric machine; but I
have found that nearly as good a result may be obtained from
the twenty machines by dispensing with the small magneto
electric machine, and employing the residual magnetism of the
two 3}-inch exciting machines in a manner similar to that de
scribed, almost simultaneously, by Mr. Farmer*, Messrs. War
leyt, Mr. Siemens f, and Sir Charles Wheatstone $.

                have adverted principally to the means by which a
    very serious defect in the practical working of the new induction
    machine was remedied, a defect which many of my friends, who
    were unacquainted with the efforts which have been made to over
             to it,

    from the heating was now obviated, the subdivision               the mate                     of

    means       straps, yet when the combined direct current from
                 of
    several commutators was required, the want              perfect synchro             of

      It  was while experimenting with     pair  machines   geared    a         of                     so
    together, that   first observed the phenomenon which forms the
                           I
    subject    this communication. These machines were arranged
                of
    for producing the electric light, with     view    their application   a          to
    to lighthouse illumination. The armatures were inches           dia                    4                in
    meter, and each     them was coiled with copper-wire conductor
                                 of                                         a
    280 feet long and               inch       of    an
                                             diameter.    The currentsin
    were taken from the armatures        means                 by
                                                    copper brushes rub          of
    bing against metal rings connected respectively with the ends
    the armature-coils, and were therefore      alternate directions.      in                                     It of
    has been found that  alternating  currents are much better adapted
    for the production       constant electric light
                                      of                  fixed point
                                                                                                                  a in

  The clutch,                   by   which the armatures were connected, consisted
    of   two iron disks about              inches
                                           4        diameter, having,

ne, two iron pins which could be guided into two corresponding
holes in the face of the other. These disks could be engaged or
disengaged either when the machines were at rest or in motion.
The relative positions of the pins and holes in the disks were
such that the armatures might be engaged in reversed positions
of half a revolution when required.
   Each of these 4-inch machines, when making about 2000 re
volutions per minute, was of itself capable of producing a very
efficient electric   light; and whenthe two armatures were clutched
together in such a position that the united positive currents
from both machines proceeded from one polar terminal simulta
neously with the united negative currents from the other polar
terminal, the sum of the currents of the two machines was ob
tained. On the other hand, when the armatures were clutched
together in the reverse position without any change being made
in the armature connexions, no current was produced outside the
two machines.
    These experiments, besides exhibiting the necessity of syn
chronous rotation, further showed that the armatures must also
occupy the same relative position in the magnet-cylinders in
order that the combined current from the two machines might
be obtained.     It now occurred to me to see to what extent the
want of synchronism in the armatures would affect the magni
tude of the current.     The armatures were therefore unclutched
and allowed to revolve independently of each other, in the same
manner as when the attempt was made to take the combined
direct current from the commutators.           After the alternating
current had been transmitted     through  the electric lamp for some
time, I was surprised to find that there was no perceptible dimi
mution in the amount of light produced from the carbon points,
and that the current would melt very nearly the same quantity
of iron wire as when the armatures were clutched together. On
examining into the circumstances attending this unexpected phe
nomenon,     I first observed that, whenever the machines were
 stopped, the pins and holes in the respective disks were exactly
opposite each other, and that, while the armatures were revol
ving, the two disks could at      all
                                   times    be
                                             engaged and disengaged
 with the greatest facility. Moreover, even when, before starting
 the machine, the disks were set        quarter
                                        a          half

was obtained,    itwas found that, after the armatures had been
 revolving for   afew moments, the disks resumed their normal
 position with respect    toeach other (as indicated    by

 the clutch)—thereby exhibiting not only the synchronous rota
 tion of the armatures, but also that the machines contained             a
 principle of self-adjustment      the position

mum effect of the combined current was obtained.     It will there
fore be evident that this property of the current, to maintain the
synchronism of the armatures, renders it unnecessary to employ
mechanical gearing of any kind for that purpose.
  Proceeding further in this investigation, I found that, in order
to produce synchronous rotation, it was not at      essential that                      all
the circuit which conveyed the combined currents for producing
the light should                    be
                      completed, provided that the ends        the                                         of

    Although the synchronous rotation was preserved when the
terminals FH, from which the combined current was trans

the coils themselves.     Now, when the coils DD happen to be
at the same moment in that position during their revolution in
which they are producing the maximum and minimum amount
of current respectively, as must often be the case where there is
no synchronism, that current which is at the maximum rushes
through the coil which is producing the minimum current, as is
shown by the spark at the point where contact is broken be
tween G and H. The effect of this passage of the current from
one coil to the other is to accelerate or retard the rotation of the
armature (according to the direction of the current) until syn
chronism is established.
   That this influence of one coil upon the other operates in the
manner described was easily shown by the following experi
ment:—The driving-strap of one of the armatures was removed,
so that only one of the armatures should be producing a current,
while the magnetism of the electromagnets of both machines
was, as usual, maintained to the same degree.     On placing the
stationary armature with          coil its suitable position

to that which tends to impart an accelerating or retarding im
pulse to the armatures.
   Having obtained the full effect of the combined alternating
currents from the two machines without any mechanical gearing,
it yet remained to obtain the combined direct currents from the
machines in the same manner. A pair of rings and a commu
tator were therefore fitted upon one of the armature-spindles,
which was made sufficiently long for the purpose, and metallic
connexion was established between the rings of each machine
and the commutator on the prolongation of the armature-axis.
As the commutator necessarily revolved synchronously with the
two armatures, it was found that the combined alternating cur
rents were rectified just as if they had proceeded from only one
machine, and were consequently available for electrodeposition,
or for any other purpose for which a direct current might be
required.
   Although this property of synchronous rotation has as yet
been observed only in the case of several pairs and a triple com
bination of machines, yet there is no reason for supposing that
it may not be extended to any number of machines that may be
conveniently worked together from the same prime mover.          It is
necessary, however, to observe that as the controlling power of
the current is only calculated to correct such minute deviations
from synchronism as it is beyond the power of mechanical skill
to prevent, the driving and driven pulleys should be respectively
as nearly as possible of the same diameters, as the correction of
any considerable difference in the number of the revolutions of
the armatures, caused by differences in the diameters of the
pulleys, must necessarily be attended by a corresponding dimi
nution of the useful effect of the current outside the machines.

                                                wish to direct atten

    P.S.—Since this paper was read, it has occurred to me that
a comparison      might be attempted to be drawn between the       con
trolling power of the magneto-electric current over the rotations
 of a number of armatures, and that of the voltaic current over
the oscillations of a number of pendulums.            Beyond the fact
that synchronism is produced in both cases through the agency
 of an electric current, there is no further resemblance between
 the two actions.       In the case of the armatures the synchronism
 is produced    by  the mutual action of several rotating bodies upon
 one another, or by the dominant influence of several bodies upon
 one; whereas in the case of the pendulums the synchronism of
 the system is produced by the influence of one body alone upon
 several.     Again, the synchronism of a number of pendulums is
 only accomplished by the skilful adaptation of means to an end,
 while the synchronous rotation of a number of armatures is a
 phenomenon which exhibits itself without the exercise of any
 ingenuity whatever; and, so far as        I have studied this peculiar
 electromechanical action, no amount of ingenuity can produce
 the synchronous rotation of the armatures by means of the vol
 taic current, as magneto-electric currents and circuits seem ab
 solutely essential to the attainment of this result.

           different chemical manuals which appear from time to time
 THE    seem to be written from two distinct points of view—the author
  desiring either to display some original mode of considering his sub
 ject, or to make an average statement of the chemical knowledge
 which is accepted, in a given year, as useful to the student. Manuals
  of the former class are, from their nature, not very frequently
  written; while those belonging to the latter constitute the great
 majority of such publications.      To each kind a special merit apper

                            Notices respecting New Books.                                                                  63
tains; but while the one has the narrower limit of an individual
effort, it is included in the other, which hands down to the historian
the general character of a time.
    The present edition of Fownes's ‘Manual of Chemistry’ has the
curious property of blending both these distinctions.                It does this
by adhering to the design of the late Professor Fownes, which, if
interpreted from the first edition and preface, was to lead to the prin
ciples of chemistry by an inductive ascent, and convey as complete
an impression of the entire range of the science as could fairly be
expected.     Hence we find a special place allotted to the analytical
characteristics of the elementary bodies, brief notices of laboratory
operations, of higher researches, of the relations of chemistry to
physics and biology.       Such a plan was not then a novelty abroad;
but no students' book of this kind had, so far as we are aware, ap
peared in this country.        The sale of nine editions in twenty-four
years, and the almost universal approval of English teachers, are
gratifying proofs both of the value of the original conception and of
the manner in which it has been carried out at subsequent intervals.
    Though succeeding editions have thus been invariably prepared
upon the primitive model, the progress of science has made con
siderable readjustments and amendments necessary to them; and
                        be all
the influence of       the great ideas which have arisen                chemistry                       in
 since 1844 may         readily observed here         the appropriate epoch.

dust and effort of his pilgrimage.    It is to be hoped that something
may be done in the next decade to disencumber chemistry of the        in
convenience and reproach of want of generalization.        Meanwhile,
however, a contrivance which has been frequently resorted to of late
years has a certain temporary value; we allude to the statement of
general formulae for series of bodies, followed by the particular de
scription of the constituent members. This is the method pursued
in the organic part of the work now before us, and adds much to its
clearness of exposition; but it is impossible to avoid feeling that
there is a great deal of matter given which the average student never
reads and never will be called upon to read with advantage.     There
is scarcely a single group of substances of whose individuals it is
desirable or necessary for him to know more than a few ; and an
excess of information has the demerit of making chemistry positively
less accessible to him.     Accordingly the removal or abridgment of
one or several   paragraphs   in the description of the various series
would, in our opinion, render Fownes's manual a much more useful
aid to learning.    The inorganic part, though of course admitting of
very little seriation, would obviously allow of considerable curtail
ment of a like mature.
   The chapter on the General Principles of Chemical Philosophy has
been very carefully rewritten, and is as compact and lucid an ex
pression of the prevailing views as could be desired.     The reader's
attention is frequently called to such matters in connexion with
special instances which subsequently occur; and, in the organic sec
tion more particularly, characteristic reactions of groups are pointed
out with exemplary copiousness and accuracy.         Such is the case
under “Alcohols,” “Aldehydes,” “Ketones,” &c. The manner in
which this task is performed is one of the best criterions by which to
estimate the value of a manual, and the care and talent of its writer;
for here he is performing his highest duty, namely, developing the
idea of a chemical function. We do not remember any book of the
kind where that duty has been so well fulfilled as in the present
instance.
   Among the novelties in this edition we notice Erlenmeyer's judi
cious definition of an equivalent (a definition which did not appear
too early), with the consequent division of the elements into “mono
genic and polygenic.” The primary classification of the elements is
of course based on their “equivalence or atomicity;” but the secon
dary classification seems to have been made on the natural-history
principle. The nomenclature employed in this manual partakes
quite appropriately of both of the existing usages; so that we find
such names as “sodium phosphate” (taken from the mode advocated

province when we say that, while the entire volume has received
admirable supervision from both of the gentlemen to whose care it
mas been entrusted, most of the labour has fallen to the share of Mr.
Watts, a chemist whose long experience and high literary ability
have conferred on the work a completeness and finish it could not
otherwise have possessed.       The result of his attention is a faithful
portrait of modern dogmatic chemistry.          Hereafter (when dynamical
theory shall have displaced or greatly modified the atomic and other
statical speculations) we may look upon this picture with regret, but
its truth we shall never be able to deny. The science is a prisoner in
the enchanted castle of the Absolute, and still awaits some knight
to rescue and deliver her.

       subjected to a decrease of pressure similar to that to which they were
       subjected in these experiments:—

   These results, when compared with the previous determinations for
these same instruments, would seem to show that a somewhat better
result is obtained when the exhaustion is carried on more slowly, and
hence that the corrections depend, to a considerable extent, on the
mature of the treatment received.    No. 8 seems to be more constant
under different treatment than No. 9.
   From all these experiments we may perhaps conclude as follows:—
   (1) A good aneroid of large size may be corrected for temperature,
by an optician, so that the residual correction shall be very small.
   (2.a) If an aneroid correct to commence with be used for a bal
loon- or mountain-ascent, it will be tolerably correct for a decrease of
about 6inches of pressure.
   (2 3) A large aneroid is more likely to be correct than a small one.
   (2 y) The range of correctness of an instrument used for mountain
ascents may be increased by a previous verification, a table of cor
rections being thus obtained.
   (3.a) If an aneroid have remained some time at the top of a moun
tain, and be supposed correct to start with, then it will give good
results for about 8 inches of increase of pressure.
   (33) A large aneroid is more likely to be correct than a small one.
   (3y)   Ifthe aneroid has been previously verified, it is likely to give
a better result.
   (4) After being subjected to sudden changes of pressure, the zero
of an aneroid gradually changes; so that under such circumstances it
ought only to be used as a differential and not as an absolute instru
ment—that is to say, used to determine the distance ascended, making
it correct to begin with, or to ascertain the distance descended, ma
king it correct to begin with—it being understood that the instrument
ought to be quiescent for some time before the change of pressure is
made.
   Before concluding I ought to mention that most of the experi
ments herein described were undertaken and executed in a very careful
manner by Mr. T. W. Baker.

         ON THE DISPERSIVE POWER OF GASES AND WAPOURS.
                              BY M. CROULLEBOIS,
          measurement of the dispersive power of gases, which has long
THEbeen      obscurely foreseen, has not yet been supplied by any phy
sicist by the aid of a convenient and accurate experimental method.
The illustrious mathematician Cauchy, in the month of August
 1836, even sent to the Academy a memoir which concluded, as a
necessary consequence of his able theory of light, that this dispersion
had no existence.          Arago announced that in this there was an error
of fact, and he promised to publish a memoir on this subject con
taining numerous delicate measurements; but this memoir never
appeared, and it has not been met with in his papers. We are lost
in conjectures as to the method employed by this illustrious physicist
to measure the dispersion of colours in elastic fluids. Doubtless

Arago had no absolute confidence in the measurements obtained by
his then method, and sought a more delicate process for the obser
vation of such delicate phenomena than the one he had used. This
opinion gains in plausibility when we consider that it was by a sub
sequent discovery that he became possessed of a method of observa
tion (that of interference) which has never been equalled in delicacy.

     It will be remembered that M. Le Roux has recently found that
 through the vapour of iodine the spectrum is reversed.           I propose
 to ascertain whether the dichroism noticed          by  M. Le Roux is met
 with in the vapour of bromine ; but this investigation presents diffi
 culties, and requires a knowledge of physical constants which have
 not yet been determined.
    The subject of these researches, which tends to fill up a void in
 science, was suggested to me in the laboratory of investigation in
 the Sorbonne by Professor Jamin.         I have been fortunate enough to
 be able to execute them in the physical laboratory of the Faculty of
 Sciences at Dijon, and under the eyes of Professor Billet, who has
 aided me by his advice, which is so valuable to all who are engaged
 in optical researches.—Comptes Rendus, October 5, 1868.

ON.   THE GENERATION OF OZONE IN OXYGEN AND IN AIR, UNDER
     THE INFLUENCE OF THE CONDENSED ELECTRICAL SPARK, BY
     MM. L'HoTE AND ST.-EDME.
    Some time ago Mr. Ladd devised an electrical condenser which he
proposed as capable of producing large quantities of ozone by elec
trifying oxygen. This apparatus consists of a wooden box 14 by 7
inches by    14  inch, inside which are six glass plates coated inside
with tinfoil, arranged      so that the spark furnished by an induction coil
whose poles are connected with the two extreme plates sweeps by
condensation all the intermediate spaces.             It is known that oxygen
which traverses Ladd's apparatus at the moment of discharge ac
quires a powerful odour of ozone; hence the inventor has proposed the
use of the apparatus for injecting electrified oxygen into the ventilation
passages of large buildings—amphitheatres,             hospitals, theatres, &c.
     The interest   attaching    to such a  producer     of ozone has increased
since General Morin called attention to the utility which the addition
of suitable quantities of ozone in ventilation might have as a de
 stroyer of miasmata.
     MM. Becquerel and Fremy have determined the proportion of
 ozone which the electric spark produces when it strikes directly be-,
 tween two platinum wires fused in a glass tube full of pure oxygen.
 It is also known that under these circumstances the air becomes
 charged with nitrous products; but we are quite ignorant of the
 extent to which a spark from a powerful induction-coil, striking in
 a cascade condenser like Ladd's apparatus, modifies the gas in con
 tact with its multifold surfaces.
     We began by arranging Ladd's apparatus so that it could rigo
 rously retain the pressure of the gas to be investigated, and then we
 estimated the proportion of ozone formed in equal volumes of oxygen
 and air circulating with the same velocities in the condensing-appa
 ratus, and under the influence of a spark of the same force (20 to 25
 centims. in air).
     It has been established that the modified gas (oxygen or air) does
 not attack tin. Solution of iodide of potassium is immediately
 attacked in both cases; silver is oxidized.               It is difficult to ob
 serve any difference between the odours of oxygen and of air.
     The measurements were made in the following manner:—The
 gas emerging from the condenser passed through a Will's apparatus
 containing a pipette of sulphuric acid in which was 0.061 grim. of
 monohydrated acid, to which was added a cubic centimetre of solution
 of neutral iodide of potassium containing 0: 1 gr. of iodide. The quan
  tity of ozone was determined alkalimetrically from the proportion of
  potash formed.      The following are the results obtained :—
     (1) The   oxygen     which passes into the condenser is pure and dry.
  Six estimations    gave   for 10 litres of gas the proportions of ozone—
                    milligrammes.            miliigrammes.
                           28-7                     26-3

                           26.9                     15-9
      In other experiments the odorant gas was collected, on emerging
  from the condenser, in a small gasometer containing distilled water.

 For        10 litres     of odorant gas the proportions of ozone found were—
                                                 milligrammes.
                                                       36-00
                                                        3.90
                                                        9:00
  (2) The same experiments made in air prove that no nitrous com
pounds are formed in the atmosphere which emerges from Ladd's
 condenser.
        The proportion             of ozone formed is less than with
                                                                  -

 For        10 litres the numbers found         are—
                                                  milligrammes.                                                 .
                                                            3.8
                                                            3.7
                                                            2.7
   The successive diminution in the numbers quoted is due to the
 decreasein the intensity of the electrical source, since the results of
 experiments made near each other are almost identical.     In a subse
quent research we shall give the relation which may exist between
the degree of ozonization of the atmosphere and the length of the
spark. We can even now say that the discharge of a coil far smaller
than that used for the above experiments (producing a spark of 3 cen
tims. instead of 20) communicatesalmostas strong an odour to the gas.
   This point is the more interesting to clear up, since experiments
prove that this condenser is a continuous source of ozone for air tra
versing        it;
             and since this air does not become charged with any trace                                     of
nitrous compounds, the detrimental influence        which on the organs     of

   with other simple substances to form compounds—acids
with bases to form salts, quicklime with water to form slaked
lime, carbon to burn in air, iron to become covered with rust 7
    This force we do not know. We are merely aware that it is
only exerted when bodies are in apparent contact, that it be
comes inappreciable when the distance of the bodies is appreci
able, that, although the mass of bodies may come into play in
the phenomena which it produces, their nature exerts the pre
ponderating action. We designate it as affinity.
    I do not propose to retrace here the history of affinity since the
first appearance of this word in the doctrines of chemistry, now
more than two centuries ago.               I
                                       have explained elsewhere the
successive  interpretations   which have been given to it by Barchu
sen, who first used      it,
                          Boerhaave, who fixed the meaning, Geof
froy, who thought      had discovered the laws, and Berthollet, who
                       he

82                    M.   Dumas's Remarks on Affinity.
   But having, for my own part, been led to pay homage to the
power and accuracy of his chemical knowledge, it seemed to me
that at the moment in which they have been brought to the atten
tion of scientific men by our illustrious dean, when he communi
cated to the Academy his very interesting philosophical studies,
I  might anticipate by a few weeks a publication in which they
play an important part.
   Newton, it is known, had made numerous chemical experiments
which have been lost. The conclusions which he had drawn
from them have been summed up by himself. They served as
basis for the chemical doctrine of Bergmann and for that of
Buffon, who, by a premature use of Newton’s principles, have not
a little contributed to prevent chemists from according to them
the respect they merit. Thus the name of Newton has disap
peared from treatises on chemistry; and I think, with M. Chevreul
as well as M. Trouessart, that it ought to be restored, as he
was the first to comprehend the nature of affinity.
   Lavoisier, contemporary with Buffon, but more reserved with
regard to a subject with whose difficulties he was better ac
quainted, never expressed himself definitely on the subject of
affinity.  He even considered this branch of science too high
for the reach of the chemists of his time; and he recommended
them, before busying themselves with         settle  it,  solid basis

 salts possess     absorbing water from the air, and the difficulty

        “When salt of tartar per diliquium (potash) being poured into
 the solution of any metal precipitates the metal and makes it
 fall down to the bottom of the liquor in the shape of mud, does
 not this argue that the acid particles are attracted more strongly
 by the salt of tartar than by the metal, and by the stronger
 attraction go from the metal to the salt of tartar 7 And so when
 a solution of iron in aqua fortis dissolves the lapis calaminaris
 and lets go the iron, or a solution of copper dissolves iron im
 mersed in it and lets go the copper, or a solution of silver dissolves
 copper and lets go silver, or a solution of mercury in aquafortis
 being poured upon iron, copper, tin, or lead dissolves the metal
 and lets go the mercury, does not this argue that the acid par
 ticles of the aqua fortis are attracted more strongly by the lapis
 calaminaris than by iron, and more strongly by iron than copper,
 and more strongly by copper than by silver, and more strongly
 by iron, copper, tin, or lead than by mercury?”
        “.
        . . . And when metals corroded with a little acid turn into
rust, which is an earth tasteless and indissolvable in water, and
this earth imbibed with more acid becomes, a metallic salt, and
 when some stones, as spar of lead, dissolved in proper men
struums become salts, do not these things show that salts are
dry earth and watery acid united by attraction, and that the
earth will not become a salt without so much acid as makes it
dissolvable in water.”

      think that no chemist contemporary with Newton had such
just and sound notions of chemistry as are summed up in these
lines. It is doubtful whether any one at that time understood
their force and import.
    We may then regard the following considerations of Newton
not as vain hypotheses, but as the fruit of a very advanced expe
rience, of long and substantial studies:–
    “Now the small particles of matter may cohere by the strong
est attractions and compose bigger particles of weaker virtue;
and many of these may cohere and form bigger particles whose
virtue is still weaker; and so on for divers successions, until the
progression end in the biggest particles, on which the operations
in chemistry and the colours of natural bodies depend, and
which by adhering compose bodies of a sensible magnitude.

ton states the true philosophy of science —
   “To tell us that every species of things is endowed with an
occult specific quality, by which it acts and produces manifest
effects, is to tell us nothing; but to derive two or three general
principles of motion from phenomena, and afterwards to tell us
how the properties and actions of                                all

   Without solving the question propounded                Newton, Ber                   by
thollet subsequently discovered one            any rate     the general at                  of

     If,

acid which has taken place, not      more energetic affinities, but

of affinity would have seemed impossible so long as statical elec
tricity alone was known to physicists; but Volta's discovery and
the investigation of the properties of dynamical electricity opened
out a new path. It seemed natural to suppose, for example, that
there was a close connexion, for instance, between the force of the
spark which determines the combination of oxygen and hydrogen
in the formation of water, and that of the battery which, effecting
in silence and without intermission the decomposition of this
liquid, transfers hydrogen to the negative and oxygen to the
positive pole.
    Reversing the decomposing mode of action of the pile, should
we not obtain the most natural representation        of the attractive
force which unites the elements of water?
   Davy was the first to endeavour to give by means of electricity
an explanation of the permanent effects due to chemical attrac
tion, and of the transitory phenomena which accompany the com
bination of bodies.      He supposed that at the contact of an acid
and a base their  particles  become charged with contrary electricities,
and that at the moment of combination these electricities suddenly
reunite. The compound formed, the light or the heat developed
at the moment of combination are readily explained on this hy
pothesis.    Davy supposes, then, that it is attraction which unites
the particles of bodies, but that placing in contact sulphur and
copper, for instance, they take opposite electrical conditions,
that by heating them the electrical tensions are increased, that,
lastly, the two electrical fluids acquire so high a tension that
they attract one another and unite, producing heat and light,
while the sulphur and the copper, being approximated by this
contact, remain united by the attraction and thus form sulphuret
of copper.
    Ampère, modifying this hypothesis, regards the atoms as
being endowed with an electricity of their own, and as being
surrounded by an electrical atmosphere of the opposite kind.
These electrical atmospheres, when they neutralize one another,
produce heat and light; the electricities peculiar to the atoms
produce the combination by their mutual action. Ampère has
thus no need to bring into play general attraction; he refers to
the operation of a single force both the transient and permanent
phenomena of chemical action.          But Ampère would willingly
have   sought  in electricity  the cause of universal attraction itself.
   Berzelius, finally, regards the molecules as being not merely
electrified but polarized.
    These various conceptions have had only one single practical
consequence.      Davy, convinced that the force which united the
elements of   compound      bodies was of electrical origin, concluded
that, by opposing to the electricity of combination the electricity

           Beyond this term combination becomes                              impossible,      as   we
know; and crystallized alum appears the last product which can
be realized with this order of compounds.
           Conversely:-
   Crystallized alum heated to 120° becomes anhydrous.
  Anhydrous alum heated to redness is converted into sulphu
rous acid, oxygen, alumina, sulphate of potash.
   Sulphurous acid, sulphate of potash, and alumina, when raised
to extreme temperatures, are themselves converted into oxygen,
sulphur, potassium, and aluminium.
   The elements which combine lose heat. Therefore the ele
ments of a chemical compound which separate must be raised
to a temperature which is higher the greater the heat they have
emitted in combining.
    Heat being regarded as motion, combination would consist in
a diminution of this motion; it would cease to be possible when
the molecules of the compound had no more heat to lose.

formation and destruction of chemical compounds, we must see

attractive force which precipitates atoms against each other.

Their shock at the moment of contact would produce heat, light,
electricity. The union of atoms once produced, in order to se
parate these, molecular forces must intervene capable of separa
ting them and carrying them to the limit at which attraction, be
coming null or even negative, would cease to act or be changed
into repulsion.
  Thus we are led to the simple views of Newton and of Lavoisier.
Chemical combination takes place between ponderable bodies;
the permanent effects are due to attraction;                  transitory              its

   Proust, who maintained the contrary, succeeded in establishing
his view. Dalton's atomic theory, soon confirmed by Gay-Lus
sac’s laws of gaseous combination, by Wollaston’s experiments
on salts in various degrees of saturation, by Berzelius's immense
researches, and especially by the simple and constant ratios which
he pointed out, in salts of the same acid and in the same state
of saturation, between the oxygen of the base and that of the
acid—all these striking events have powerfully contributed to
lead chemists to continue to regard affinity as having a character

   Viewed with regard        masses, affinity does not admit that

   (3) That Meyer has shown how the impact                  molecules,                         of
striking against each other with extreme velocity              produce                              to
combination, may give rise          the phenomena   to  heat,     light,                  of             of

   (5) Finally, that the doctrines with the aid of which it has been
attempted to explain chemical phenomena by a distinct unknown
cause, or by electricity, have yielded no fruit; while those which
tend to bring it under the laws of universal attraction consoli
date themselves, approach more and more to the facts, and indi
cate better and better the path of progress.
   It would then be natural, just, and useful that Newton’s
name, and the definitions he gives, both of molecular attraction
and of chemical atoms, should be retained in works intended for
instruction in chemistry. In my opinion (but I give it with                                            all
the reserve which such subjects demand), heat      the real measure       is
of chemical energy, while light and electricity may for the pre
sent    beregarded             by
                       the chemist either      agents     which     as                  of             he
makes use,         or     as
                    phenomena whose appearance      ascertains.                he
   Matter and heat would still be,       Lavoisier's time, the de
                                                        as   in
finition     the two objects
             of                  which the thoughts

should   especially            be
                       directed.
    The time will doubtless come when, the laws which molecular
 attraction obeys being themselves known, we shall                 able                  be            to

same time to remark    incidentally upon some of the fundamental
principles of the theory advanced by Professor Bayma.        This
can be most briefly and effectively done by taking up the differ
ent objections urged by him in due order, and commenting upon
them in succession, having a care not to dissociate remarks that
should properly be presented together. The quotations made
will be indicated to the eye by being printed in smaller type.

rific, electric, and luminous phenomena, assume that aether pervades

atoms of the other.     Professor Bayma assumes equally great
differences to subsist between his two attractive forms of mat
ter. He remarks, “the distinction of such a medium ” (a me
dium for the transmission of light) “from any ponderable sub
stance is not an hypothesis, but a necessary inference drawn
from observed facts;” and again,                            “I
                                        do not see how such a
fact” (that light can pass undisturbed through air notwithstand
ing the immense number of air-particles it encounters) “can be
accounted for if aether is not immensely denser than atmospheric
air.” The reason for the conclusion is groundless; but it is
the conclusion itself that we have here to notice.      He adds,
“with this great density acther possesses also a very great sub
tilty.”
     I
     might also reply to Professor Bayma by asking him why we
should admit, in order to explain electric and optical phenomena,
two substances so distinct as the repulsive envelope of molecules
and the attractive luminiferous aether.     The evidence of their
similarity is much greater than of their dissimilarity.
   In speaking of the two aethers as subtile, it was meant that a
large number of their atoms occupied the interstices between the
atoms of gross matter.     It was also, of course, recognized that
the velocity of propagation of a wave is much greater through
either of the aethereal fluids than through a mass of ordinary
matter.    The only apparent force in the question under consi
deration is derived from the fact that a vague conjecture is apt
to be raised by              it,
                     that single aether may  a     equal       the            be             to   all

matter, which we have already proved      impossible.                      to   be
             have the following replies
        To this    I                      offer:-                               to
      Professor Bayma assumes that every point
        1.                                             matter acts                                     of
instantaneously upon every other point        distances, however                   at     all
great        or
         small, with   force having the same character
                                        a                     dis                                              at     all

tances, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
This may seem probable, but is not self-evident; and in fact no
reason can be assigned why one material point having no extent
should act upon another with a force decreasing with the dis
tance, according to any law whatever.         The law of inverse
squares is a consequence of wave propagation, or of radiations
along definite lines, received on a molecule of definite size, and
cannot be predicated of a force that acts instantaneously between
two mathematical points. To suppose such a law is an arbitrary
assumption.
   2.      If matter consists of material points, as supposed by Pro
fessor   Bayma,     it is no more difficult to conceive of an atom of
continuous matter than of the space coextensive with                                                   it.

                is                       conceive of an indivisible atom

            a   whole   upon   another atom with certain energy, than          a
ofa   mere    point   acting   upon another point, and causing                                                   it   to

               place,     the same time transferring
                                at                                new point all         to   a

 directions, and that the attractive action upon an atom of aether
was neutralized at minute distances by the resistance developed
 at the point of contact.          The existence of such a resistance
 necessarily implies that the elementary parts of the attractive
 atom, whether finite or infinite in number, act repulsively at
 very minute distances.         But another conception may be formed
 of the mode of      operation    of an atom of gross matter, which
 involves no other supposition than that it acts equally outward
 in   alldirections from centre, and takes                             geo        no                            its

the aether is not repulsive. For, in the first place, if the mole
cules of the planetary mass have the constitution I have attri
buted to them, the impinging aether must take effect upon either
the aethereal or the electric atmospheres of the molecules, and
so may be mostly expended in the generation of heat and elec
tric currents.            I
                      have in fact undertaken to show, in my paper

  possible attraction, that our author should ask the question,

110          Prof. W. A. Norton on Molecular Physics.
   We have already seen that the principle that one material
point acts upon another instantaneously, without the interven
tion of any medium, is opposed to the fundamental idea that the
force exerted is inversely proportional to the square of the dis
tance.   This law, to say the least, is an arbitrary assumption in
the premises.    The author also conceives that the mutual action
of two material points is in no degree and under no circum
stances intercepted by another intervening point.     But we know
that, in the case of the molecular forces, the amount of vis viva
expended in imparting motion to one particle is abstracted from
the force in action; and, according to Professor Bayma, the mo
lecular forces are of the same nature as the forces subsisting
between the material elements.    The force of gravity, it is true,
is not sensibly intercepted; but this does not prove that a ten
 dency to interception does not exist; for, upon the supposition
 of a wave-transmission of the force, the effective attraction of
 any molecule may be the mere differential of the actual force
 transmitted, and, besides, in the circular revolution of a planet
 the distance from the sun remains unchanged.
    My own doctrine is that the molecular forces, including the
 heat-repulsion, are dynamical forces transmitted by wave-pro
pagation and developed by the primary forces of attraction and
repulsion subsisting between the atoms of gross matter and those
of the electric matter and the aether of space. The primary
forces determine the electric and aethereal atmospheres of mole
cules, originate the molecular forces proper, and also, when an
 inequality of electric condition is produced on two contiguous
 molecules or bodies by molecular actions, gives rise to the spe
cial forces of electric attraction and repulsion. The waves of
heat and light originate in the aethereal atmospheres of mole
cules, and are developed by vibrations of the atoms of the elec
tric atmospheres toward and from the centre of each molecule
and the region of aethereal disturbance. By reason of the vary
ing conditions of equilibrium, the rate of vibration increases, and
 itsintensity       or
                    vis viva decreases,in   proportion      as
                                                            the electric
atom   is more remote from the centre of the molecule.          Thus of
the different coloured       rays  the red proceeds from the lowest
depth  in   the electro-aethereal atmosphere.      The obscure heat
rays originate       atstill lower
                         a          depth.  Heat and light may also
originate           space                                         of

the different modes of electric excitation (that of the galvanic
current included).  The secret of the intimate relations between
electricity and heat and light is obvious in view of what has
been stated.
   The aethereal atmospheres of molecules, besides playing the
part already signalized, are the chief determining cause of the
diverse phenomena that attend the transmission of light through
transparent media.     Thus refraction is chiefly due to the retar
dation   attending the propagation of the ray around from one
side to the other of the molecular atmospheres; dispersion of
the rays in the spectrum to the fact that the rays of the greatest
intensity and slowest rate of vibration penetrate to the greatest
depth in the molecular atmospheres, pass around in smaller
circles, and thus suffer the least retardation; and double refrac
tion to the fact that the atmospheres have a spheroidal form,
owing to unequal molecular compression on different sides.

sodium, which         ordinarily yellow and monochromatic, that
lithium, which           is is
                       usually red, both become white; they then
contain    allthe rays or, we may say,         the brilliant linesall  every                  of
refrangibility.     They thus become luminous when the metal
burns
        at
        a     high temperature.
   This observation         exact also for the invisible rays—for the
                                     is

proportion as luminous sources at higher temperatures are used
to produce them. This is a cardinal observation due to M.
Mascart.     Thus the number of lines increases in the proportion
in which the temperature rises in the flames which produce them;
and when the temperature attains a certain intensity, these lines
merge into one another and give a continuous spectrum. The
flame then necessarily becomes white, brilliant, and luminous.
   A fact of the same kind is produced in Professor Frankland's
experiment. The lines increase in number and in intensity in
the hydrogen flame in proportion as the pressure on the explosive
mixture within and without the blowpipe itself increases. What
more rational conclusion can be drawn than that the tempera
ture itself increases in the flame in proportion as the pressure         in
creases? This is a prime fact, the demonstration of which may
seem sufficient; but it is full of consequences so important that
direct verifications should still be demanded. I shall revert sub
sequently to the consequences and the methods of verification
which  I                             I
          think of using; but desire to show at once that these
considerations, deduced from spectrum-analysis, will explain the
fact of the great illuminating power of arseniuretted hydrogen—
a power that Davy’s theory, which I think is incomplete from
this point of view, can only explain by the supposed presence of
a solid body in the flame.       It is sufficiently evident that gases
in burning   give lines.   If these lines are brilliant and numerous
for reasons depending on the special nature of the substances
observed, it is clear that the flame of these gases will be brilliant
and the more luminous the greater the difference in the refran
gibility of the lines these spectra contain. Here we have to do
with a phenomenon belonging to arsenic in vapour contained in
the flame of arseniuretted hydrogen; and in the explanation of
such a fact it seems to me useless to bring in the consideration
of densities, invalidated moreover by the objection urged by
Professor Frankland himself in the case of the flame of phos
phorus burning in chlorine.
   Thus the illuminating power of an entirely gaseous flame is a
specific property connected with the production of lines furnished
by the substances it contains; it is as inexplicable as the specific
properties of the bodies themselves—the density, colour, &c.
Professor Frankland’s idea, moreover, relative to the production
in ordinary flames of very dense carburetted hydrogen seems to
me difficult to rest on experiment. We know, in fact, that                all
these carburetted hydrogens decompose         at   the lowest tempera
tures into hydrogen   and carbon—the latter     hydrogenized,  it  true,
                                                                    is
but opaque”.   I    think, then,   that Davy’s   theory  remains intact.

tion takes place itself increases.   Let us now see what are the
consequences of this fact, supposing it to be well established.
   M. Debray and I have proved that the temperature of combi
nation of hydrogen and oxygen, under the ordinary pressure,
is 2500°. We determined this fixed point by throwing into water
a kilogramme of melted platinum raised to the highest tempera
ture which could be produced in a lime-furnace, taking into
account the increase in the temperature of the water, the specific
heat of platinum and the law of     increase given     M. Pouil

appear that the absolute ethylates of the alkali-metals are en
dowed with an extraordinary degree of stability, being among
the most permanent compounds belonging to organic chemistry.
   Passing on to the description of my research:—A small glass
retort, of 75 cubic centims. capacity (see figure), was cleaned,
dried, and weighed.    Into it was put
some  freshly cut sodium,  the weight
of which was ascertained.     (Sodium
admits of being accurately weighed,
the thin film of oxide with which it
 so soon becomes covered being of
insignificant weight.)    Anhydrous
alcohol was next poured into the
retort, and the reaction between it and the sodium allowed to
take place.  The apparatus was then heated in the water-bath
as long as any alcohol distilled over, and then cooled, dried, and
weighed.    The apparatus was a second time placed in the water
bath and subsequently cooled, dried, and weighed. The follow
ing are the numbers given by two experiments:—
                                                                                       I.                 II.

   Absolute ethylate of soda (Na C*H*O) is a perfectly white
amorphous solid.      It is non-fusible, differing totally from the
crystals. Its specific gravity is very low ; it swims in ether.    It
is almost insoluble in ether, 1000 parts of ether not dissolving
more than 2 or 3 parts of the ethylate.        As has been hinted, it
becomes brown on exposure to the air; otherwise it may be
heated to a very high temperature, 275°C. (and probably much-
higher), without losing              its

   It    was necessary to assume in this discussion that the two
metals do not contract nor expand, but remain of their proper
volume on uniting.      Dr. Matthiessen has shown that in the for
mation of   alloys generally the metals retain approximately their
                                     –
original densities*.
   In the first experiment already described, probably the maxi
mum absorption of gas by wire, amounting to 935-67 volumes,
is attained.    The palladium may be charged with any smaller
proportion of hydrogen by shortening the time of exposure to
the gas (329 volumes of hydrogen were taken up in twenty mi
mutes), and an opportunity be gained of observing if the density
of the hydrogenium remains constant, or if it varies with the
proportion in which hydrogen enters the alloy.      In the follow
ing statement, which includes the three experiments already re
ported, the essential points only are produced:—

appear that the hydrogenium becomes sensibly denser when the
proportion of it is small, ranging from 1708 to 2:055.   But the
last experiment of the Table is perhaps exceptional; and     the                            all

   Those who are not accustomed to experiments of this kind
can probably most easily succeed as follows.    we look on the               If
floor and place the finger  between the  eye and the floor, the
finger will of course be seen double. Now move the finger up
or down until we find a place in which the two images of the
finger will exactly fall on contiguous figures of the pattern; the
finger now indicates the position of the first plane. Now look
steadily at the finger instead of the floor until the image of the
floor rises to it and becomes distinct, then withdraw the finger.
To get the second plane, look again at the floor and raise the
finger until       images fall upon figures separated from one an
                    its
other      by    intervening
                   an          figure and then look steadily          the                   at

distance of two feet from the object I obtained the image very
clearly and without much difficulty; but on approaching to
within ten or twelve inches it was only by patient trial for some
time that it could be brought out with perfect distinctness.
When the object was twelve inches from the eyes, the image, by
calculation, was found to be about thirty inches distant. By
turning the diagram so that the diagonals were horizontal, and
similar points therefore more than two inches apart, the image
was seen at the distance of about six feet. It had the exact ap
pearance of a tessellated marble pavement made up of squares
nine inches on a side.

 138                      Prof.   J.   LeConte on      some Phenomena
 tain peculiar conditions under which the first two laws may be
 violated, but none in which the last is violated.      For many
 years     I
          regarded these experiments as confirming the ordinary
 doctrine.           I
                had observed in my first experiments on the carpet
   that each successive plane became more and more indistinct.
 I   accounted for this by supposing that both the optic axes and
   the lenses were adjusted for vision on the plane of the image,
  while the light diverged from the floor five feet distant. It
  seemed to me a crucial experiment, proving the necessity of focal
  adjustment and the inseparable association of it with axial ad
 justment.      On recommencing these experiments a few weeks
  ago, however, I was struck with the fact that the figures of the
  images were far more distinct than the real figures were when a
  small object was viewed in the position of the images.         To test
  this  point  fairly, I placed   two bone buttons in similar posi
 tions and on similar spots on the pattern, and then brought their
  images into coincidence.    At first the united image was indistinct,
 but   gradually  it became   perfectly  defined, every thread-hole as
 clear and distinct as it is     possible   to conceive.     succeeded,         I
 though with greater difficulty, in getting a perfectly distinct
 image of the buttons on                 all
                                 the planes.        was evident there

much more    ease, and the lines were defined with the most per
fect sharpness, even when the image was brought nearly       the                          to
root of the nose.
      Inall cases, however, the image when first obtained was                                   a

 viz. that the optic awes and the lenses are adjusted    entirely dif.     to
ferent distances. The three      adjustments       the eye,  viz. theof
axial adjustment, the focal adjustment, and the contraction                                    of
the pupil, have been       associated through successive genera

a single act of volition accomplishes them all.   Under ordinary
circumstances they are so indissolubly associated that neither
can be accomplished without the others.          But the experiments
described above   prove  that under certain circumstances the first
two at least may be completely dissociated. In these experiments,
when the image is first obtained, the optic axes, the lenses, and
the pupil are              all
                   consensually adjusted for vision        the distance                       at

Elementary Lessons in Astronomy. By          J. NoFMAN Lockyer,      F.R.A.S.
                London and Cambridge : Macmillan and Co.
THE        schools of our country are much indebted to the author of
        this little work both for the substance and the shape of the          in
formation which he has given them.
    The amount of thought which he has bestowed upon the arrange
ment of his materials has not been thrown away, but has produced
a work which will give the young student (as well as children of a
larger growth) a clear and more complete idea of that great whole
called the universe than most works of greater pretensions.
    The custom hitherto has been for writers on astronomy to direct
their readers' attention rather to the instruments by which observa
tions are made, and to the principles according to which they are
discussed, than to invite them to begin by taking a bird's-eye view
of the Cosmos. We are told how to adjust a transit, and how to
measure the sun's distance from the earth; but our energies are so
much used up in understanding these things, that we have little
strength left to contemplate as a whole the grand reality which they
disclose.
    But our author adopts a different method, and beginning with
 what we see, and first of all with the stars, we have a series of les
 sons in which the reader has clearly put before him a view of the
 magnitudes and distances of these bodies, as well as an account of
 their occasional peculiarities, such as colour and variability.          In the
 nebular hypothesis, which is then described, we receive a hint of the
 process by which matter has been wrought from the state of pri
 meval chaos into a sun or star.
    When the reader has by this means become properly impressed
 with the magnitudes with which we deal in astronomy, one particular
 star is singled out for especial consideration.           Our own star or sun
 is that one of all the host of heaven with which we are most inti
 mately acquainted.         His appearance and habits are therefore de
 scribed, and we receive an insight into his chemical constitution.
     Still proceeding downwards from greater to lesser magnitudes, we
 are next invited to consider the minor bodies of the solar system;
 and just as the sun was singled out as the type of the stars, so the
 earth is singled out as the type of the planets.            Astronomers have
 been fond of       drawing   attention   to the    adaptation   implied in the
 fact that the      gravitating   centres of the various      systems   are also
 the centres of       light  and  heat;    but   it is only of late  years   that
 we have come to         recognize   that both these facts    can  be  explained
 by the operation in two different ways of one and the same law.
  Accordingly we have another definition of planets, and one to which
  the author has given considerable prominence, namely that planets
  are cold while suns are hot, just as truly as that they are wandering
  while suns are fixed.

rTh;“Onfollowing
         the Lightning Spectrum.” By Lieut. John Herschel,                R.E.
   I  have had two or three opportunities of seeing this spectrum to
 advantage of late. The storms at the period of the setting in of the
 south-west monsoon here are very frequent, and supply for a time
 almost incessant flashes, many of which are of course very brilliant.
                   I
 The first time examined the light in the spectroscope I had no idea
 of measuring, but was content to realize the principal facts of a con
 tinuous spectrum crossed by bright lines; but subsequently           I
                                                                    made
 several attempts (with some success) to obtain measures. That was        I
 unable to do more in this line is due partly to the difficulty of utili
 zing the short-lived appearance, partly to that fascination of waiting
 for “one more ” bright flash to verify the intersection, which can
only be thoroughly appreciated by the aid of a similar experience.
    The principal features of the spectrum are a more or less bright
 continuous spectrum crossed by numerous bright lines, so numerous
 indeed as to perplex one as to their identity.       This perplexity is
increased by the constantly changing appearance due to a variable
illuminating-power.     This variable character of the appearances is
unquestionably the peculiar feature of the spectrum.       It is not that
the whole spectrum varies in brightness in the same degree, but that
the relative intensities are variable, not only among the various lines,
but between these and the continuous spectrum. The latter is some
times very brilliant; and when that is the case, the red portion is
very striking, though in general the spectrum seems to end abruptly
at D+0.34 (E=D-- 1:38, Kirchhoff’s 1207–D–H 0.55).
    There is one principal line which I found equal to D+2:20 as the
result of five independent measures.        The probable error of this
value is about +202.      The general  mean of          all

                                                                      the

                      noted below.

   The next in prominence is situated about D+3.58 (F= D +2.73,
Kirchhoff's 232°5 = D +3°50). It is broader and less vivid, and not
so well defined at the edges.
  There are several other conspicuous lines, but none comparable
to the first. I noticed a sharp line in the red, but did not get a
measure.
     Isaid that at D+0:34 the continuous spectrum ends abruptly.
A   faint continuation, however, is frequently seen in bright flashes,
very bright ones bringing out a brilliant red end crossed by a bright
line.
   The whole of the ordinary spectrum seems green and blue, or
rather greenish blue; but as the usual prismatic order of colours is
recognizable in bright flashes, it is to be inferred that the region from
E to F is so much brighter as to give the character in question.
What strikes one most, however, is the varying relative brightness
of the continuous and linear spectra; sometimes the lines are
scarcely seen, and sometimes very little else is seen.        This may be
nothing more than an illusion; but in the absence of any certainty
that it is so, the impression left on the mind is worth recording.
   The difficulty of discriminating between the many less prominent
lines is immensely increased by the momentary character of the
phenomenon.       Before the mind has selected an individual, the feeble
impression on the retina has vanished; and before another flash
succeeds, the memory of the half-formed choice has vanished with
it it,                                         to on
    and there      nothingis  which      found     selection.    to

 that the C line, and the D line do not; and he enlarges upon the
 importance of this fact, taken in connexion with the researches of

 stating at the same time that he is engaged in researches on gaseous
 spectra which, it is possible, will enable us to determine the tempe
 rature and pressure at the surfaces of the chromosphere, and to give
 a full explanation of the various colours of the prominences which
 have been observed at different times.

 an  eruption     of

explosions, took place about every seven minutes.              Immediately

French Academy relative to the chemical products of the eruption,
and their relation to those of Vesuvius and other volcanoes.
   Mr. For BEs directed attention to the fact alluded to in the late
President's anniversary address, that the lavas of this volcanic out
burst were, at its commencement, trachytes, or of highly silicated
character, but afterwards were basic lavas—thus proving that rocks
of totally different characters and chemical composition (respec
tively analogous to the granitic and trappean rocks of former
periods) might proceed from a volcanic focus during an eruption.
   Prof. ANSTED called attention to the probable connexion of the
eruptions in these islands with those of Vesuvius and Etna, and
mentioned that Baron von Waltershausen        had presented to the
Society photographs of his magnificent original drawings of the
whole region of Etna, which were upon the table, of which only
three copies were taken on a larger scale than the published maps.

had been prepared with the aid            Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys. Taking

                     Mr.    J.   Prestwich on the Red Crag                      of Suffolk.                       147
the local conditions into consideration, eliminating the extraneous
fossils of the Red Crag of Sutton, Butley, &c., and excluding the
freshwater fossils of the more northern districts, the author regarded
the remaining fossils of the two divisions of the Red Crag as being
so closely related that the whole group must palaeontologically be
treated as one. Mr. Searles Wood had given the total number of
species of            its
                  mollusca      239;      these Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys has
                                             as              to
added six additional species;       the other hand,    on

belonging       the Red Crag.

   Dr. Cobbold stated that, from microscopic examination    a              the                            of
phosphatic nodules,                   he
                           had established the existence           them                         in                 of
Radiolariae and Diatomaceae, and especially            Arachnoidiscus coc       of

   Mr. CHARLEsworth commented on the remarkable fact that                                                      in  a
few thousand square feet         Coralline Crag we have fauna

tensive       as
            the whole British molluscan fauna.         He considered that
at  present the attempt       solve the question
                                            to         the age      the Red     of                 of

 148                       Geological  Society:—        -
 Crag was hopeless, mainly from the difficulty of recognizing ex
 traneous fossils. He expressed his disappointment at the fish-fauna
 of the Red Crag not having been noticed by the author. The
 teeth which were common to the Eocene and Red Crag had usually
 some phosphatic matter adherent.         Those, on the contrary, which
 only occur in the Crag, have never any phosphatic matter attached.
 He therefore regarded the former class as derivative, but the latter
 as belonging to the deposit in which they occur.
    Mr. SEARLEs Wood, Jun., denied that the Red Crag was the
 one homogeneous deposit divided into two beds represented by
 Mr. Prestwich; he protested against the Walton and Butley de
 posits being regarded as one and the same—the former bearing more
 affinity to the Coralline Crag, and being therefore probably the older.
    Mr. PRESTwich, in reply, explained that he did not intend to
 omit the lists of mammalian remains of the Red Crag, Tables of which
were appended to the paper, the greater part of them, however,
he regarded as derivative.        With regard to the relation of the
 Chillesford beds to the Forest-bed, he had never seen a section in
 which the latter underlay the former; the Chillesford beds at
Easton Bavent were underlain by sandy beds referable to the Nor
wich Crag.       He considered that some division in the lower      bed, as
 suggested by    Mr. Searles Wood, was to be found.

                               in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On some Genera of Carboniferous Corals.” By James Thom
son, Esq.
    Mr. Thomson gave       a résumé   of the diagnostic   peculiarities of
Cyathophyllum, Goldfuss, Clisiophyllum, Dana, Aulophyllum, Milne
Edwards and Jules Haime, and Cyclophyllum, Duncan and Thom
son. The author then noticed that the separation of these genera
was inevitable and necessary, from the ordinary rules of the classi
fication of the Zoantharia.      He concluded by remarking upon the
evident structural distinctions between Clisiophyllum, Aulophyllum,
and Cyclophyllum.
    Dr. DUNCAN said that the existence of a columella was a generic
distinction in recent and mesozoic corals, that the type of the palae
ozoic Cyathophyllidae was reflected in the Lower-Liassic coral-fauna
of South Wales and the west of England, and that there was a
necessity for the same principles of classification in the palaeozoic
and in the recent coral-fauna.        There was a gradation from the
Rugosa to the Aporosa.
    Prof. Huxley remarked that the structure of the specimens of
the different genera proved that there were great difficulties in ac
cepting Agassiz's opinion that these old forms were not Zoantharia.
    2. “On the Pebble-beds of Middlesex, Essex, and Herts.”             By
S. V. Wood, Jun., Esq., F.G.S.
   The author described some pebble-beds in the counties of Mid
dlesex, Hertford, and Essex, which, in the MS. memoir deposited

Mr.W.Topley on the Cretaceous Rocks of the Bas-Boulonnais. 149
in the Society's Library, he had described and referred to the age
of the Bagshot sands. Premising that there could be no mistake as
to the beds under discussion, as Mr. Hughes and the author had
found their lines of the Middle Glacial gravel (termed “gravel of
the lower plain” by the former geologist) to coincide, Mr. Wood
described the distribution of the gravels which he regarded as of Bag
shot age, and gave an account of the physical phenomena which he
conceived had led to their deposition and subsequent denudation.
He objected to Mr. Hughes's view, that the pebble-bed termed
 “gravel of the higher plain” by Mr. Hughes belongs to a period
 anterior to the gravel of the lower plain, as it involves the admission
that there has been a period intermediate between that of the Bag
shot pebble-beds and the Glacial, during which the sea occupied
these counties and deposited the gravel of the higher plain—an ad
mission which would be fatal to his view of the Bagshot age of the
pebble-beds described in this paper.
    Mr. PRESTwich was inclined to regard some of the beds referred
by the author to the Bagshot series rather as local drifts derived
 mainly from those beds than as the beds themselves.
    Mr. WHITAKER saw a difficulty in classing the pebble-beds at
Brentwood and elsewhere among the Bagshot beds, as in the London
 district, at all events, no such pebble-beds occur in the Bagshot
SerleS.
    Mr. Evans pointed out the difficulty in supposing that the
 gravels at the high level could have been deposited at a later period
 than those of the low level without, at the same time, overlying the
latter.
    Mr. SEARLEs WooD considered that there was not that broad
 line of distinction to be drawn between the gravels of the higher
 and lower level; he maintained that the pebble-beds when truly in
 situ were free from Quartzite, and truly of the Bagshot age.
     3. “On    the Cretaceous    Rocks  of the   Bas-Boulonnais.”     By
 William Topley, Esq., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of England
 and Wales.
     After a résumé of previous notices on the subject, the author
 described the Physical Geography of the district and the Cretaceous
 beds below the chalk, comparing them with their English equi
 valents.
     Each great division of the Kentish series was stated to be repre
 sented in the Boulonnais, although, in every case, in diminished
  thickness.   The Upper Greensand and Gault were shown to sur
  round the district at the base of the chalk hills; and a fossiliferous
 phosphatic bed was described at the bottom of the Gault, as in Kent.
 This bed was regarded by the author as a passage between Gault
 and Lower Greensand, as nodules with fossils often occur in the
  sands below; and it was shown to be frequently impossible in
  sections to mark off accurately the Lower Greensand from the Gault.
  The marked change in the faunae of these formations was regarded
  by the author as due to the complete change in the conditions of
 deposit.
     The sands which occur below the Gault were shown to belong

 150                      Geological  Society:—
partly to the Folkestone beds (or highest division of the Lower Green
sand) and partly to the Wealden—the intermediate stages being
absent, although well developed where last seen on the Kentish
 coast. The ferruginous sands, with variegated clays and iron-ore,
 which cap the hills in the interior of the Bas-Boulonnais, were re
 ferred by the author to the Wealden series, as were also the pebble
 beds of St. Etienne and elsewhere, hitherto regarded as “drift.”
    The Wealden beds were shown to rest upon the Portland around
 Boulogne, and upon lower members of the Oolites in the west and
 north; while in the north-west corner they fill “pipes” in Palaeo
 zoic limestones.   The Wealden beds, thus proved to be unconform
 able to those below them, were shown to underlie conformably the
remaining Cretaceous beds above, thinning away, however, against
 the old ridge, where, by overlapping the Lower Greensand and finally
the Gault, they rest immediately upon the Palaeozoic rocks.
    The paper was illustrated by a map, showing the probable out
crop of the Cretaceous rocks beneath the English Channel.
    Sir Roderick MuRCHIson, without doubting the correctness of
the author's views, wished that fossil evidence had been forthcoming
to identify more conclusively the Wealden strata of the Boulonnais
with those of England, and suggested their correlation with the
Beauvais beds.
    The Rev. Mr. WILTs HIRE remarked that in Kent the Ammonites
mammillaris was contained in large nodules, and occurred only
below the lower phosphatic band.
    Mr. WHITAKER, who had been with the author in the Boulonnais,
had been, contrary to his predilections, compelled to regard the beds
referred to the Wealden as belonging to that formation, and not to
the Lower Greensand.
          Note on the Mendip Anticlinal.”      By C. H. Weston, Esq.,
F & s.
    The author called attention to the discovery of igneous rocks in
the north-western portion of the Mendip Hills long previous to Mr.
Moore's discovery of them in the south-east; and he stated that this
fact left no doubt about the persistence of this upheaving agent
throughout    the entire anticlinal of the Old Red and Carboniferous
Series.                                 -
        June 17th, 1868. –Prof. T. H. Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S.,
                         President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Distribution of Stone Implements in Southern India.”
By R. Bruce Foote, Esq., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of India.
    The chipped stone implements of Southern India are found in,
or associated with, two formations—the coast-laterite, which is a
marine formation, and a freshwater deposit, occurring inland at
greater elevations above the sea.        Most of them have been found
either in situ in the laterite of the eastern coast, or distributed over
its surface; several have been collected off the surface of older
rocks, in places where the laterite had been removed by denudation;
others have been discovered on the surface at great elevations in

       Mr. B. Foote    on Stone   Implements in Southern      India.  151
other parts of the country, where no distinct traces could be seen of
the formation from which they had weathered out, and which had a
 different origin (possibly freshwater) from that of the marine coast
laterite; while a few have been obtained from unquestionably
fluviatile deposits.     None have been collected from formations
 known to be either    younger  or older than the coast-laterite.
    The author inferred that during the latter part of the laterite
period the land was raised to the extent of 500 or 600 feet, that
 this elevation was followed by a period of quiescence during which
 the laterite was extensively denuded, that this epoch was succeeded
by a period of depression during which the recent coast-alluvium
was formed, and that a subsequent elevation brought the land into
its present position.
    The PRESIDENT referred to the evidence of physical geography
 to prove that the Deccan was once an island, and to ethnological
data to prove that the people who made the quartzite implements
were probably not the original Aryans, but were the ancestors of
the Hill tribes, whose nearest affinities are with the aboriginal Aus
tralians of the present day.      He was of opinion that the two popu
lations were once nearly or quite continuous, having been sub
sequently cut into segments by geological changes, and that the
makers of the quartzite implements came from the same stock as
both these recent tribes, which present the most rudimentary civi
lization known.
    Prof. RUPERT    Jon Es called attention to the similarity in the type
of   these  quartzite implements to that of the flint implements of
Europe.
    Sir Rod ERICK MURCHIsoN doubted whether the laterite was a
marine formation, as neither in it nor in the lacustrine deposits
alluded to had any organic remains been found.
    M. DE NorMAND stated that Obsidian knives, like Mexican types,
were found by him, with domestic implements cut out of volcanic
stone, under 70 feet of tuff of the primitive volcano of Santorin;
and he considered that before the formation of the first volcano
ceramic pottery was brought to Santorin from foreign shores,
and, of course, by sea.
    Dr. MERyon remarked that the occurrence of the same type of
implement in Europe and Asia proved a dispersion of the human
race in very ancient times, and that man originated from one centre;
while in later times a divergence of type in the worked objects was
a result of the dispersion.
    Mr. PRESTwich was inclined to believe that greater physical
changes had occurred in India since the Pliocene period than in
Europe. The implements were so like those of Europe, that their
fabricators seemed to have been taught in the same school.
    Mr. Foote, in reply, stated that he regarded the laterite as a
marine formation, because it occurred all round the coast. All the
implements were quartzite, with perhaps one doubtful exception,
which was formed of basalt.       Stone circles and kistvaens had been
found on the surface of the laterite in some localities.

           “On worked Flint flakes from Carrickfergus and Larne.”
G. W. Du   Noyer, Esq.
  These flakes have been found by the author in two very distinct
positions, namely:—the older in the marine drift (sand and gravel)
skirting the shores of the county Antrim and county Down, the
maximum elevation being about 20 feet above the sea; and the more
recent in the subsoil clay at all elevations up to 600 feet, near Bel
fast, Carrickfergus, Larne Lough, and Island Magee.       The former
are of the rudest forms, highly oxidized or white on their entire
surface, but, though imbedded in marine drift, having the chippings
around the sides and angles generally sharp.       The latter have a
comparatively fresh look, though still possessing the characteristic

Esq., H.M. Consul at Tamsuy.
  The first shock felt in the northern end of the island took place
on the morning of the 18th of December, 1867.       Many buildings
were destroyed and many lives lost in Tamsuy.       About fourteen
minor shocks were felt during the same day, and on the 20th
another violent shock occurred.
   At Kelung the whole harbour was left dry, and the water return
ing in one vast wave rushed into the town itself. Large landslips
have taken place, and several villages between Kelung and Tamsuy
have been destroyed.

   The author described in detail the rocks of which the district
under consideration is composed, namely:-1, the Upper Quader
Sandstone; 2, Pläner Limestone; 3, Pläner Marl; 4, Lower Quader
Sandstone; and gave a list of their chief fossils.
   The peculiarities of this region consist, first, in the abrupt and
marked variations of altitude without any corresponding inclination
or dislocation of the strata; secondly, in the remarkable regularity
of the fissures by which the rocks are divided, which cross them at
right angles; thirdly, in the phenomena observable along the
line of separation between the Quader and the Lusatian granite,
the Quader being overlain by the granite and syenite ; fourthly, in
the disposition of the basalt, which rises through the granite and
the stratified rocks above, indurating the latter, but not contorting
them.

          ON THE TEMPERATURE OF FLAMES AND DISSOCIATION.
                          BY E. WICAIRE.
      URING    the combustion of a gaseous mixture in an enclosure
        which is impermeable to heat, the heat evolved is employed
solely in heating the mass, and we may easily calculate the tempe
rature which it will have attained after the combustion of a certain
fraction of the combustible element.
    Supposing this combustion to be complete, we obtain the ordinary
formulae of the temperatures of combustion.          But these formulae
furnish results far higher than the temperatures which are actually
observed, and the beautiful investigations of M. H. Sainte-Claire
Deville clearly show us the reason of this; it         is,
                                                      that after   certain
                                                                      a
 point the elevation    the temperature places anobstacle
                          of                                      the way
                                                                     in
 of   amore complete combustion, because no combination can take
 place without causing    dissociation which exactly compensates
                               a                                           it.
   If  we have determined the temperature by experiment, we easily
 deduce from     the quantity
                it                gas that has been burnt,
                                   of                                by

 equation which,     we knew the quantity burnt, would give the tem
                     if
perature.
     But this equation, which      establish
                                   I          in   arather more general

perature of combustion of a given mixture; for it includes two mag
nitudes which are equally unknown beforehand—the quantity burnt,
and the temperature.
   To determine these two magnitudes for a given mixture is the
problem which I have set myself, assuming the phenomenon of dis

                                               Although this assumption

sesses henceforth    certain amount
                            a            interest, inasmuch of      enables                    as   it
us   toaccount for the circumstances which may influence the tempe
rature     combustion, and the direction
          of                                   this influence.    of will                           It         be
seen, moreover, that     suggests various means

foreign gas, but humid, the real temperature of combustion will be
less for the latter.
     It is clear that these formulae apply to oxide of carbon with mere
numerical modifications.       They likewise suit, whatever be the pres
sure, provided this is constant in each case.
     Without trying prematurely to indicate the arrangements by
 which I hope to realize some, at least, of the cases under consider
ation, I pass to the examination of a recent memoir by M. Bunsen
 on the present question.
     M. Bunsen detonates gaseous mixtures in a valved eudiometer,
 and calculates the temperature from the pressure which is developed
 at the moment of the explosion.        This case differs in two points
 from those which we have considered : in the first place, we must
introduce into the formulae specific heats at constant volumes, and
not at constant pressures ; and then the pressure does not remain
 constant, but it increases up to the moment of the maximum of
 temperature.      These two circumstances tend to augment the real
 temperature of combustion, at least if we assume that pressure tends
 to diminish the tension of dissociation.
     It will thus be understood how M. Bunsen finds for the gas of the
 pile 2800°, and M. Deville, operating under the ordinary pressure,
 only 2500°.
      I  next discuss M. Bunsen's theoretical conclusion, according
 to which dissociation is not a continuous phenomenon, but one
 varying suddenly at certain temperatures, in the interval of which
  it remains constant, varying moreover in such a manner that there
  is always a simple proportion between the dissociated part and that
  which is not dissociated.     I show that this conclusion has but little
  probability & priori; for this instantaneous production of a phenome
  non which induces an evolution or an absorption of heat, when the
  exchange of heat with surrounding bodies is necessarily continuous,
  must cause sudden variations of temperature such as we do not
  observe.
      M. Bunsen shuns the difficulty by assuming that, during the pas
  sage from one simple proportion to another, the temperature remains
  constant.     But we ought to observe this period of constancy. Thus
  in the flame of a blowpipe with mixed gases, of which the various
  parts offer precisely the successive conditions of a mixture in com
   bustion which is cooling, we ought to observe a very appreciable
   space during which the temperature would be constant.        Now the
   accurate experiments of M. Deville upon the blowpipe with oxide of
   carbon indicate a continuous decrease of both the temperature and
   the dissociation.
      Moreover, during this period of invariable temperature, which
   should represent a very noticeable fraction of the total duration of
   the refrigeration, there would be a gradual, and not a sudden, passage
   from one simple proportion to another.         The simple proportion
   would therefore not be an absolute natural law.
       Finally, even the discussion of the experiments leaves, at least,
   much doubt as to the legitimacy of the conclusion.—Comptes Rendus,

    The author exhibited to the Academy of Sciences a new generator
 of electricity founded upon statical induction reduced to its simplest
 expression, the action of which he considers may aid in more clearly
 defining this phenomenon.
    It consists of the friction-plate of the old electrical machine turn
ing slowly between two cushions; above and parallel to this plate
 turns a larger disk of non-conductive matter, in such a position that
 the superior and inferior sectors of the two plates reciprocally cover
from two-fifths to three-fourths of each other's radii.
    The inferior plate fulfils the function of an inductor, the charge of
which is kept constant by                       its

pressure  of the atmosphere is not a fixed term, but that many
circumstances cause it to vary; that it is much more inconstant
in vessels of metal than in vessels of glass; and that the action,
more or less direct, of the external air on the sides of the vessels,
especially when of metal, as upon the surface of the water, pro
duce considerable changes in the degree of heat that it may
receive in boiling.    As the construction of the thermometer
depends on the fixity of the boiling-point, it is not surprising
that thermometers made on this supposition, with the greatest
possible care, should not always agree.”
   4.    I
         have given these details at some length, because French
and   English  writers of authority assign to Gay-Lussac the merit
of Achard's discoveries. Biot seems to have led the way in this
respect.  Writing in 1816*, he says, in reference to the boiling
of water, “Il y a aussi quelques différences dans le degré de
l'ébullitionselon la nature des vases que l’on emploie, et selon
celle des substances qui se trouvent mêlées à l’eau, meme quand
elle ne peut les dissoudre.   Cette remarque est due à M. Gay
Lussac.”
    5. The effect of insoluble substances on the boiling-point was
also first noticed by Achard, in 1784+. The water was boiled in
a glass vessel; and when the mercury in the thermometer was
steady, a drachm of the solid to be tried was thrown in, and the
effect noted in tenths of a degree on Réaumur's scale. When the
temperature had again become steady, a second drachm of the
substance was thrown in, and so on until no further effect was
apparent. A large number of substances were tried in this
way, and the results are given in Tables occupying fourteen
quarto pages.     Each Table contains six columns, for recording
the name of the substance, the height of the barometer, the
boiling-point of the water before the addition, the weight of the
water, the weight of the substance added, and, lastly, the effect
on the thermometer in tenths of a degree Réaumur. Thus 1
drachm of iron-filings lowered the thermometer ten tenths, or
 —10 as Achard writes it; a second drachm had no further effect;
copper-filings —8, tin-filings —13, white sand 0 to            calc      -3,
spar — 13, quicklime —9, rosewood —ll, limestone in powder
 —13, the same in a lump —3, bismuth in powder –12, the
 same in fragments —8, and so on. Achard does not pretend to
 offer any satisfactory explanation of these results, but he                        di
 stinctly claims the merit of having originated them.

air expelled.  After continuing these operations of shaking and
heating the tube in order to get rid of the air, the tube was
raised to 212°; and the point being broken so as to reestablish
atmospheric pressure, the water was further heated to 234}º F.

   8. Proceeding in the order of time, we come to Gay-Lussact.
While engaged in his experiments on solubility, he seems to
have rediscovered the two facts respecting the influence of the
vessel on the boiling-point, and also of the effect of an insoluble
body in lowering the boiling-point.       But it is remarkable that
in both his    papers  Gay-Lussac   refers to Achard’s results, or
rather to his  faulty conclusions, with a view to contradict them,
without giving him credit for those points that were true. It is
quite possible that Achard’s fame was more injured by his friends
than his opponents, since an attempt had been made by Gmelin
and others, in answer to Gay-Lussac’s paper of 1812, to show
that in a number of vessels of different material, all sunk to the
same depth in a sand-bath, water boiled at the same temperaturel;
while in 1817 Muncke stated $ that copper-filings appeared to
have no influence in lowering the boiling-point, and that sand did
so only to the extent of one-tenth of a degree. Gay-Lussac in 1817
noticed these papers, and reasserted the original facts with even
more decision than he had done in 1812.         But even in this his
first notice of the subject, his language    is not to be mistaken.
His paper is on Deliquescence, and he says:–“In determining
the boiling-point of saline and acid liquids        observed a very         I
singular phenomenon which deserves to be known.            Water or
any other liquid boils later in a glass vessel than in a metallic
one, except when we put into the former some turnings of iron,
copper, or other metal, or carbon in powder, or pounded glass.
The difference in the case of water may amount to 13°C. and
upwards.”     In 1817 he states|| that water boils later in glass
and earthenware (faience) than in metal vessels.        He does not
give the measure of the difference, but believes it to vary with the
mature of each body, and, with the same substance, according to
the nature of             its
                 surface: “car      est probable qu’elle dépend

ebullition, a peculiar noise shows that the boiling goes on with
difficulty; large bubbles of steam proceed from certain points
only of the surface, and a thermometer plunged into the water
shows frequent variations.          In a tinned-iron vessel, on the con
trary, the bubbles of steam are not so large, but they are more
numerous, the variations of the thermometer are less consider

served as a basis for further inquiry by subsequent observers.
But the difference between him and some of them consists in
this, that he would originate an idea, examine, and discard it
when seen to be no longer tenable; they clung to the idea even
though it carried them into the region of error. It is the dis
tinction between genius and talent, that the one originates capital,
and the other trades with it.
  ll.   In 1825 Dr. Bostock published some facts respecting the
boiling-point of ether*.    Ether (spec. grav. 0.755) in a matrass
over a spirit-lamp boiled at 112°F. ; but in a test-tube put into
hot water it did not begin to boil until it had reached 150°,
and on one occasion 175°.      Some bits of cedar-wood were put
into the   ether, and it boiled at 110°; the wood was covered
with bubbles, until it got soaked and sank. Bits of quill, feather,
wire, pounded glass, &c. also lowered the boiling-point consider
ably.   After stating that copper-filings, chips of wood, &c. ap
peared to produce ebullition in the ether after it had ceased to
boil, Dr. Bostock says, “Plunging a thermometer into ether
caused the production of the bubbles at a temperature many
degrees below the point at which ebullition took place without
the thermometer; but the effect of the thermometer after a short
time was no longer perceptible, and                   I
                                         observed that by alter
mately plunging the thermometer into the ether and removing it
from the fluid, the bubbles were produced at each immersion.”
The various nuclei above referred to are said to act by carrying
down air into the ether, and as soon as the air is discharged they
cease to act.
   12. Dr. Bostock’s interesting paper called attention to some
processes in the useful arts adopted with a view to facilitate the
process of boiling.  Thus Mr. Baldt notices a practice among
the engine-keepers of Scotland, when the ordinary supply of
steam cannot be raised from the boiler, of throwing in about a
bushel of the radicles of barley, separated during the process of
cleaning the malt and called “comings.” When steam is again
raised, the effect is immediately apparent; “for not only is there
a plentiful supply of steam for producing the full working speed
of the engine, but an excess going to waste at the safety-valve.
This singular effect will continue several days.” So also in dis
tilling ardent spirits on a large scale, when converting the fer
mented wash into “low wines,” it is usual to throw a bit of soap
into the still every time it is charged.  This causes the steam to
rise more quickly, and to be freer from the residual matter of the
process.                                          -

(Ersted%, that gas resulting from chemical decomposition is never
disengaged from a liquid except in contact with some solid body;
and he proposes to apply this principle to the disengagement of
vapours. He says:–“If a metallic wire be suspended in a
boiling fluid, it instantly becomes covered with bubbles of va
pour.”      To show the application of this fact, ten pounds of brass
wire, one-fifth of a line in diameter, were put into a still contain
ing ten pints of brandy; seven pints came over at a heat which
without the wire would have sent over only four.
    14. In 1835 Le Grandt remarked that “when water is boiled
in a glass vessel the boiling goes on at first regularly, with the
production of numerous bubbles, and without noise; but as soon
as the water has lost the greater part of the                                        air

170           Mr. C. Tomlinson’s Historical                        Notes on some
sulphuric acid the boiling-point of water rose to 106°C.; so
much had the internal surface of the glass become modified by
the acid; but by simply heating the flask to 300° or 400° C. a
similar result was obtained.  The conclusion arrived at was that
“ the  effect was due to a species of molecular modification of the
surface of the glass, brought about by the acid, of such a nature
as to increase the adhesion of the water and so delay     boiling.”                       its

          Phenomena connected with the Boiling                                    of Liquids.                          171
pletely, points will be found where the water does not adhere,
where in fact the adhesion is less than the cohesion of the liquid
molecules.    The same is true of glass, though cleaned with boil
ing sulphuric or nitric acid. In a platinum vessel cleaned first
with fused caustic potash and then with sulphuric acid, the boil
ing-point of water was higher than the temperature of the steam,
but not so high as in a glass vessel; but in this the boiling-point
was not so high as in Marcet's experiments (19).       The reason
probably was that the platinum vessel used was much worn, and
contained cracks and scratches (Risse und Schrammen) which
probably acted like pulverulent bodies in lowering the boiling
point.

they are not pure. Heat liberates bubbles           air nearest     the           of                             to

172               Mr. C. Tomlinson’s Historical                                    Notes on some
cohesion of the molecules of water being superior to a pressure
of three atmospheres, or a column of water of 30 metres. This
conclusion was arrived at by heating water in a chemically clean
tube in a bath of chloride of calcium as high as 138° C.
 (280°4 F.). The tube was 8 millims. in diameter (<U+017F>º, or lºo
inch), curved at an angle of 100° at the end where the water
was heated, the other end being furnished with two bulbs.               The
water was first boiled so as to expel the air, and the extreme bulb
was then sealed.      The portion of the column of water contained
in the short covered end was then put into the chloride-of-calcium
baths, of which there were four, one at 113°C., another at 121°,
a third at 128°, and a fourth at 132°, and this rose to 138°, at
which temperature the water suddenly burst into steam and con
densed in the bulbs at the other end of the tube.
   24. From 1843 to 1863 it was considered a settled point in
physico-chemistry that, in proportion as water is deprived of air,
 the character of              its

176           Prof.  J. A. Wanklyn on the Compounds of
understood that the methods which have answered in the             in
stances already known are not likely to answer in the present
case.     Kakodyle was obtained from chloride of kakodyle by
driving out kakodyle by means of zinc. Supposing, however,
       I
that had got the chloride of ethylene-sodium, what metal could
I   expect to be capable of driving out ethylene-sodium ?
     Zincethyle was obtained by the distillation of the double zinc
compound of iodine and ethyle, when, as is well-known, zinc
ethyle distils over.      The non-volatility of ethylene-sodium is a
bar to the establishment of a parallel process.
     The only hope which       I have at present of isolating the new
radical is the   hope   of finding  it among the products of the de
 structive distillation of the double compound of sodium-ethyle
 and zinc-ethyle, not, however, in the distillate, but in the resi
 due, along with the finely divided zinc and sodium which results
 from the destructive distillation in question.
      With respect to the chemical constitution of ethylene-sodium,
 there are two modes of representation          which will commend
 themselves to the chemical mind,       viz.:-
                 ((C2H4), Nal), and (C2H4), Na<U+017F>l).
     Against the first, and in favour of the second formula (that
 to which I have given the preference) may be urged the fact
 that sodium appears to be a trivalent metal; and also that the
  first method of representation would necessitate the assumption
 that in the hydrated oxide there existed oxygen not in direct union
 with sodium, whilst the second formula represents the sodium as
  directly combined with oxygen.        Another reason for giving the
  preference to the second formula will be mentioned on a future
  occasion.
      In support of the statement that sodium is a tri-valent metal,
  a statement which will be looked upon as a chemical heresy
  in certain quarters,     I  would bring forward the cases of the
  double zinc-sodium-ethyle and of sodium-triacetyle.
      The analysis of the first of these compounds led to the em
  pirical formula (Na C*H*-i-Zn(C*H*)°)*,         as will be seen on
  reference to my paper on the subject.        It will also be remem
  bered that   I altogether failed to effect a separation between the
  sodium-ethyle and the zinc-ethyle. The real constitution of the
  compound is:—
                                  Nall<U+017F>—C2H5

    Therefore by experiment,   ratio of water to alcohol produced
                           = 1.00 : 2-309.
Theory requires
                             1.00 : 2°55.
     This experiment shows very plainly that there is no forma
tion of anhydrous soda.        If Na” O were formed, double the
quantity of alcohol should have been given.           Furthermore,
experiment with alcohol slightly moist, i. e. containing 3 per
cent. of water, has shown that the new compound is very sen
sitive to the presence of traces of water, the smallest quantity
 of water effecting an equivalent decomposition according to the
 equation just given.
     With iodide of ethyle:—It is well known that an alcoholic
 solution of potash or soda, as also the crystals containing alco
 hol and ethylate of sodium, effects an easy decomposition of
 iodide of ethyle into ether and iodide of the alkali-metal.
 The hydrate of ethylene-sodium behaves in a very different
 manner.     I took 5-849 grims. of the hydrate and 10 cubic cen
 tims. of iodide of ethyle and heated very gradually up to 210°C.
 in a small retort open to the air; 9 cubic centims. of iodide
 of ethyle distilled over, and were condensed and measured.
 The product was subsequently weighed and found to be 5'948
 grms., showing that there had been no sensible action, the small
 difference of 0.1 grim. being only that which would be occasioned
 by the difference of weight between the apparatus partially
 filled with vapour of iodide of ethyle and the apparatus filled
 with air.     In this experiment, although the temperature of the
 oil-bath was 210°C., still the temperature of the interior of
 the retort must have kept very low, owing to the evaporation
 of the iodide of ethyle until near the end of the experiment.
 The conclusion to be drawn is that there is no rapid action
 between iodide of ethyle and hydrated oxide of ethylene-sodium
 at moderate temperatures.      Under similar circumstances, either
 the crystals or alcoholic solution of potash or soda would have
 decomposed a very considerable quantity of iodide of ethyle.
     When iodide of ethyle and the hydrated oxide of ethylene
 sodium are sealed up together and heated up to between 120°C.
 and 150° C. for an hour or two, there is very complete decom
 position.

his theory      molecular physics. My remarks were designed
                  of

 not rest upon sufficient proof, and contained a good deal of
 arbitrary assumption. Professor Norton, of course, is not of
 my opinion, and argues that my objections “are destitute of
any real force.” This was his undoubted right; and, had he
confined himself to the defensive, I should have deemed a reply
unnecessary; but, as he goes on to attack my own theory with
arguments which have a plausible appearance, I think it worth
while submitting his article to examination.
   The contents of his ably written paper may be summarized,
as it appears to me, in the three following propositions:—
   1st. That in molecular science                          all
                                        our general principles are
but probable hypotheses.
   2nd. That his own principles are not arbitrary assumptions.
   3rd. That       my “Elements
                     I   in                           of
                                     Molecular Mechanics’ assume
principles destitute    sufficient proof.
                               of
   To these three propositions beg leave       offer
                                                 I    short reply,          to          a

     And    to    begin with the first proposition, Professor Norton
says:
   “No theory      molecular physics can,

hypotheses that have been rendered more         less probable, either  or
induction from observation,       by   priori reasonings. Molecular
                                              or      a

    These words express          opinion, which
                                        an                   means un       is    by    no

184                     Prof.      J.   Bayma         on the          Fundamental
saying (“Molecular Mechanics,” p. 2) that a work which was
intended to lay down the very first foundation of a molecular
theory, could not possibly rest on hypothetical ground, and that                                                     I
had embodied in the work, as principles of molecular mechanics,
those propositions only which were evident, or which              thought                   I                        I
had the power of rigorously demonstrating from known laws of
nature; a proposition which seems to have amazed Professor
Norton. But even he will allow, hope, that, in my capacity       I
                                               I
of Professor of Philosophy, can aspire to something better than
 those hypotheses which are the lot of mere experimentalists.
    And now to come to his assertion.               would observe in the      I
first place that, if “no theory of molecular physics can have any
 other foundation than general principles to be regarded as hypo
theses,” then no physical theory can lead to any other than
hypothetical conclusions; and as hypothetical conclusions can
not be called “established truths” in any true sense of the
                                                                                                                   of to its
words, it follows that neither Professor Norton’s theory nor
principles are “established truths.”           And this would suffice
justify my stricture that his theory rests upon “a great deal
arbitrary assumption.”
    But must add secondly,            justice      molecular science, that
                                                   of in

Professor Norton's       opinion               far from being accurate.

ciples are, in my opinion, not sufficiently probable, contains
undoubtedly a great deal of “established truth.”
   But “molecular physics,” says he, “cannot be erected, like
mathematics,   upon a foundation known from the first to be
eternally sure, that of self-evident truth.” This remark of my
learned critic does not show that molecular physics cannot be
erected on certain truth, but only that physical science, whether
molecular or not, does not deal, like mathematics, with truths
which consist of necessary relations, but with truths dependent
upon contingent facts.    The first are known mainly by reason,
the secondly mainly by observation: and no one demurs to
physical certainty on the ground that it is not mathematical.
   Professor Norton adds:
  “Mechanical axioms may exist as mere figments of the mind, and
have often risen like bubbles in the minds of speculative philosophers,
shone with an evanescent splendour, and suddenly burst at the touch
of a hard fact.”
     I do not deny   that axioms may exist as mere figments in the
minds of “speculative” philosophers;           but the learned Professor
has surely forgotten that                   all
                                     philosophers, who build theories,
are “speculative” philosophers.            Otherwise how           possible            is   it
        on he

186                    Prof.     J.   Bayma on the Fundamental
supreme test of scientific hypotheses: and if our men of science
were less afraid of speculative knowledge than they appear to
be, we should be less familiar with the sight of “bubbles shining
with an evanescent splendour, and suddenly bursting at the touch
of a hard fact,” or, let me add, of a still harder principle.
   Professor Norton thus continues:
   “Our author is another instance of a learned philosopher, who
has faith in such unsubstantialities, and thinks to substitute them,
as a proper basis for a theory of molecular mechanics, in place of the
general conceptions, to which the progress of science leads, and by
which alone      its
                  highest inductions find any explanation—regards the
latter as arbitrary  assumptions, and his own mental convictions                             of
                                                 the only reliable foun

what matter must        and how     must act    it                 as

   This passage      madeis                up    of
                                   assertions which may easily                               be

                        6). Let Professor Norton read again the

    He states likewise that regard those general conceptions (to

may easily understand that        cannot but do the same.I      But
such mental convictions as he attributes to me are     quite  impos
sible; for if a man, in matters dependent on facts and laws of
nature, should disregard “the general conceptions to which the
progress of science leads,” how could he ever find a ground on
which to rest his mental convictions f
   The truth is that Professor Norton has failed to realize to
himself the spirit in which my “Elements of Molecular Mecha
nics’ were written. He is mistaken in his assumption that I
virtually claimed for my method a superiority which he is not
ready to recognize.     The geometrical method, which adopted,                                 I
has    its
         own  advantages, independently   the writer who employs   of
it,   aseveryone must allow    but   was    far from claiming any

and deductive, which consists of reasoning based on observation.
This is the method which I followed in establishing the funda
mental principles of molecular mechanics.   The a priori method
would have been absurd. Professor Norton may consequently
show his horror of the a priori method as much as he likes:
after all, it is only a matter of taste, about which     am not                              I

    He continues:
   “Having proved, as he conceives, his propositions, and clinched
each one of them with a Q. E. D., he insists that obvious intimations
of nature are to be discarded, because the stamp of infallibility can
not be put upon them at once, before the test of availability in the
explanation of phenomena has been applied.”
  This language is rather severe. Let the learned Professor
show, if he can, in the first place, that I have not sufficiently
proved my fundamental propositions.           should consider it a  I
great favour, as I love nothing more than truth.       Secondly,                                           let

190                    Mr. R. Moon           on the Theory           of Sound.
velocity of sound has been calculated to be 916:322 feet per
second*, the true velocity being about one-fifth greater.
   The discrepancy thus evinced between the results of theory
and of experiment was long supposed to have been removed by
the celebrated correction of (3) on account of temperature pro
posed by Laplace, by means of which the theoretical and the as
certained values of the velocity of sound were conceived to have
been brought within a very small fraction of each other.
   A most competent judget has pronounced, however, that the
experimental processes of Clément and Desormes, and of Gay
Lussac and Welter, upon which this supposed coincidence has
been founded, are worthy of no confidence whatever; “de sorte
que l’explication de Laplace n'est encore aujourd’hui qu'une
hypothèse, très-ingénieuse sans doute, mais qui a besoin d’être
confirmée par l'expérience.”
   A further and decisive objection may be taken also to La
place’s correction in the form in which it is actually presented to
us on the following ground.
   The correction depends upon the assumption that “for very
small condensations the rise of temperature will be proportional
to the increase of density” (Encyc. Met. No. 72).
      Now       if t
               denote the excess of temperature at the time t
above the mean temperature, it is clear that in any case of mo
tion the value of T at a given time and place must be known, i. e.
we must have
                                   T= funct. (y, t);
and if s denote the condensation and v the velocity at the time t
at the point whose ordinate is y, we shall have in like manner
      -   -

                                   v= funct. (y,
Hence, eliminating             y   and   t    between the last three equations,            we
have
                                   T= funct. (s. v);
and since        it   is   evident that   T    will not become infinite when either
s     or
      v        vanishes, we are warranted              in    concluding that, when the
motions are small,

the velocity a(1+e), which is represented by the equations (16)
and (17).      The disturbance so propagated will retain the same
invariable   form;  and (17) shows that it will be either a conden
sation or rarefaction, according as v is positive or negative.
   We have hitherto been considering what takes place to the
right of the original disturbance when the motion is represented
by (12), a being supposed positive when measured to the right.
   For points to the left of the original disturbance we shall have
                          w—a(1+e)t    -  0,
and therefore
            F{w—a(1+e)t}=0,          f(z-a(1+e)t}=l
for all values of t.
   Hence the motion to the left of the original disturbance will
be represented by the equations
  •=    #F#420-04-#11-fºr-40–94),
#=      * F#24 a<U+017F>i-e);         +  #1–4 (1+y=440-941,
and adopting a mode of treatment similar to that employed in
the former case, we shall find that when the equation (12) is ap
plicable to the motion, there will be propagated with the velocity
a(1-e) to the left of the original disturbance a- disturbance re
presented by the equations
   (1+e)v-#F(a + a(1—e)t}– adjo [1—f{r+a(1–e)t}],
        —as-(1+e)v;
from which last it results that the disturbance so propagated will
consist of a rarefaction when v is positive, and vice versd; which
is the opposite of what obtains with regard to the disturbance
 propagated to the right.                                              -

    The results which occur when this equation is applicable to the
 motion will obviously be found by changing the sign of e in the
 results obtained on the assumption that (12) is the differential
 equation applicable to the motion.
    In this case, therefore, we shall have a disturbance propagated

It onlyremains, therefore, to determine under what circumstances
(12), and under what circumstances (18) is to be taken as the
equation of motion.

then in the other case, the particle-motion being to the left, a
being measured as before, the pressure must be represented by

the (11) is thus at once accounted for. It still remains to
be determined, however, whether, when the particle-motion at a
given point is to the right, the coefficient of v in the expression
for the pressure should have a positive or negative sign affixed
to it.
   Suppose that, the air being of uniform density and at rest, a
disturbance is suddenly impressed upon a limited portion of it
of this kind, viz. a velocity which beginning at zero gradually
increases till it attains the value                       vi,

     It appears, therefore, that we have to choose between two things,
viz. on the one hand a diminished pressure where there is
throughout a tendency to expansion, and an increased pressure
where there is throughout a tendency to condensation; or, on
the other hand, an increased pressure where there is throughout
a tendency to expansion, and a diminished pressure where there
is throughout a tendency to condensation.                     That this latter
 alternative should be true appears incredible.                  We may with
 safety conclude, therefore, that when the motion is to the right,
 a being measured positively in that direction, the lower sign is
 to be taken in (19), and vice versd.                                      -
      Applying this conclusion to the results previously obtained, it
 follows that, when the motion is represented by (12), the par
 ticle-motion is to the left, and v is negative ; so that any disturb
 ance propagated to the right of the original disturbance will be
 a rarefaction, and                its

        XXVI.            On the Physical Cause of                             the     Motion of Glaciers.

I         HAVE just seen an abstract of a most interesting paper
      by the Reverend Canon Moseley “On the Mechanical
Possibility of the Descent of Glaciers by their weight only,”
which was read before the Royal Society on the 7th of January
last f. In that memoir he arrives at the conclusion that, owing
to the great resistance offered by the solid ice to shearing, it is
impossible that glaciers can descend by their weight alone.
   “All the parts,” he remarks, “ of a glacier do not descend
with a common motion; it moves faster at its surface than
deeper down, and at the centre of its surface than at                edges.                                      its

     The correctness of the above conclusion, that the weight of the
 ice is not a sufficient cause, depends upon the truth of a cer
 tain element taken for granted in the reasoning, viz. that the
 shearing-force of the molecules of the ice remains constant.                  If
  this force remains     constant,   then Canon    Moseley’s    conclusion is
 undoubtedly correct, but not otherwise; for if a molecule should
 lose         its
           shearing-force, though          were but for      moment, it                               a                       if    no
 obstacle stood        front    the molecule,

 of      its
        weight.

of “crevasses”    in glaciers.   Take, for example, the transverse
crevasses formed at the point where an increase in the inclina
tion of the glacier takes place.   Suppose a change of inclination
from, say, 4° to 8° in the bed of the glacier. The molecules on
the slope of 8° will descend more rapidly than those above on
the slope of 4°.    A state of tension will therefore be induced at
the point where the change of inclination occurs.       The ice on
the slope of 8° will tend to pull after it the mass of the glacier
moving more slowly on the slope above. The pull being con
tinued, the glacier will snap asunder the moment that the cohe
sion of the ice is overcome.     The greater the change of inclina
tion     is,
           the more readily will the rupture                        of

many such striated rocks have become sea-bottom; the conse
quences of which would be that the glaciers would have melted,
and the stratified rocks would retain their striations, which would
be well protected by the thousands of feet of sea-water they
might have above them. Their moraines of erratic blocks would
be sure to be deposited at the sea-bottom also.     And the ground
may have risen again since, and even in some cases risen and
sunk again and again. Denudation would, fully agree, oblite                  I

This cannot be so.                     An iceberg 100 feet thick when afloat will
displace  water weighing (suppose)     100 tons, but one a mile

  When Swan published” his investigations on the prismatic
spectra of the flames of compounds of carbon and hydrogen,
which are remarkable for their completeness in the then (1855)
state of our knowledge in spectrum-analysis, the only known
observations were those of Fraunhofer, Brewster, and Draper
on the spectrum of the cone of the blowpipe-flame, and those
of Fraunhofer, Herschel, and others on the spectrum of a wax
or oil-flame; moreover the means of making this kind of ob
servation had not at that time attained            present high degree          its
    perfection. Under these circumstances, the service rendered
byof

210                     Prof. A. Lielegg on          the Spectra             of the
as near as possible to the slit in the apparatus, exhibited the
spectrum of coal-gas with extraordinary sharpness and brilliancy
of colour, and furnished the means of observing the five red
lines spoken of with great distinctness.
   The successive development of the spectrum of coal-gas,
which can be easily proved by comparing the spectra which are
produced by a Bunsen's gas-burner, then by coal-gas with
oxygen in small quantity, and lastly by coal-gas with oxygen in
sufficient quantity to create combustion, leads to the conclu
sion, which has now been known for some length of time, that
increase in the temperature of the flame causes a great change
in the form of the spectrum ; that is to say, continued aug
mentation of the supply of oxygen adds more and more lines,
whilst at the same time greater intensity of light and brilliancy
of colour is shown throughout, and this without any percepti
ble appearance of change of an opposite character.              Beginning
with the flame of       a Bunsen's  gas-burner,    and  passing  on to the
hottest   gas-flame     inflamed  by  oxygen,    a series of  spectra may
be followed which show no essential difference, since the dif
 ferent degrees of their development cannot be considered such ;
for the lines which are produced by Bunsen’s gas-burner
preserve their position unchanged, other groups being as it
 were filled in, so that this successive completion of the spec
trum can be distinctly followed as the temperature is increased.
    It can only be ascribed to this gradual change of the spec
trum of coal-gas proceeding from a change of temperature that
 the group of five lines mentioned above has never before been
 observed and described as it is in this paper.           The flame must
 be brought, by a sufficient supply of oxygen, to the maximum
 of   itstemperature and intensity           light; this group then ap

     Itis thus seen that the group of five red lines is situated
between the lithium and the sodium line; the three first lines
are at equal distances from each other, and are sensibly of
equal breadth; the distance of the third line from the fourth,
and of the fourth line from the fifth is somewhat less, as is also
their breadth, though in a degree less evident to the sight. As
regards intensity of light, this group is circumstanced like the
others; that is to say, the first or least-refracted line is the
brightest, whilst each succeeding line is fainter, the last being
faintest of all; this diminution of brightness, however, is not
so striking as it             is,

212              Prof. A. Lielegg on the Spectra of the
   The pea-green line, 201 of the group y, and the last violet
band, 101.5–98, which (as is well known) nearly coincide with
Fraunhofer's lines C and G, are also those lines which are
always visible if we use as a source of light a flame of spirit of
wine, or the lowest non-luminous blue part of the flame of a
wax-light, or the spherical light of the gas-flame of a Bun
sen’s burner; in the two latter there can also usually be di
stinctly observed, under favourable circumstances, the second
line (198) of the group y, the first line (233) of the group 8, and,
lastly, the whole group 6; only the individual lines of the latter
are not to be distinguished, the whole group appearing to stand
out from the background as a faint broad band.
   It is moreover to be remarked that, when the combustion of
the coal-gas takes place with an insufficient quantity of oxygen,
the group of five red lines cannot be even momentarily discerned,
and the red and yellow part of the spectrum generally is not
perceptible, the space corresponding to it being quite dark up to
the first line of the group 8.
                          Spectrum    of Olefiant Gas.
   If we burn olefiant gas with oxygen in the same manner as
we have described for coal-gas, we obtain a spectrum which
agrees perfectly with that of coal-gas, and presents only in the
development of the extreme violet part (appropriately called by
Brücke” lavender-grey) a form quite peculiar, in that it is                            in
tersected by a great number of strong black lines, which are
arranged near each other in the dark violet part fine and narrow,

214                      Prof. A. Lielegg on the Spectra of the
teresting investigations also of Frankland *, according to which
the intensity of light of a flame depends upon the density of the
ignited vapours, cannot but lead us to hesitate in supposing
carbon to exist in a state of vapour in such flames; so that it
appears simpler to refer the flame-spectrum           of the compounds
of carbon with    hydrogen,     and of oxygen with carbon and hy
drogen, to the ignited vapours of carbon combined with hydrogen
                                                     -
than to those of carbon alone.
   Since, then, it would seem that no independent spectrum of
carbon exists, and that, instead of this, every gas containing
                      of its
carbon has       own peculiar spectrum, and since the quantitative
proportions      any compound have            effect upon the character   no
of the spectrum,         have       we
                                 sufficient explanation why

                           Flames of Gases containing Carbon.                                                    215
   Having already described this in my previous papers on this
subject, I will only add here those remarks which are suggested
by a comparison with other spectra of gases containing carbon;
they may be summed up in the following points:—
   1. The lines of a flame of carbonic oxide (Bessemer-flame)
appear on a continuous spectrum, and contain several groups of
bright lines and some dark absorption-streaks, which are irre
gularly distributed from the red up to the violet end.
   2. The groups of lines coincide neither with those of coal-gas
and olefiant gas, nor with those of cyanogen.
   3. The strongest lines are situated, as in the spectrum of
coal-gas, in the green and blue-violet part.
   4. The increase in the intensity of light of the individual
lines of the groups, when such an increase is perceptible at all,

not difficult if the moon’s orbit is supposed to be an exact circle.
The centrifugal forces arising from the movement of the earth and
the moon around the common centre of gravity between them,
must have a resultant in a line passing through the centre of gra
vity of our planet. In the absence of tides, the resultant of the
attraction between the two great bodies would, in                mean posi                    its

sists between the changes which the spheroidal form of the earth
occasions in lunar and terrestrial motion.
     It
      is easy to estimate with more accuracy than is common to
this  department   of science the ratio between the minute errors
of the earth and the moon in recording mean time, and thus to
derive important information respecting the portion of these
errors discoverable by observation.     As the moon, while only ºn
of the earth in  respect  to mass,  moves in     orbit with about                  its                           2%
times the diurnal velocity      our equator, our planet, supposing

it   to     be
         homogeneous, would derive from        rotation about fifteen          its
times the momentum which the moon owes to her orbital motion.
Now, the action       which each body
                                 to        exposed from tidal move       is

220             Mr. D.   Waughan on the Secular Effects
 would indicate a reduction of nearly 4 per cent. in the estimate
 deduced for the earth’s loss of diurnal motion, on the supposition
that the lunar orbit coincides with the plane of the equator.
 Had we taken the actual case, in which the moon’s path has a
 small inclination to the plane of the ecliptic, I should be regarded
as variable, and the investigation would be more complicated;
yet it may be easily seen that the result would not materially
differ from that given in formula (4).
   While the inclination of the moon’s orbit to the equator re
 duces the change in the earth’s diurnal motion 4 per cent, an
 opposite effect arises from the increasing density of the matter
 towards the central region of our world. The law to which the
 variable density of terrestrial strata conforms is not at present
sufficiently well defined to serve as a basis for an accurate mathe
matical investigation; but judging from the effects of this cause
on the form of the earth and the precession of the equinoxes, we
may safely state that it cannot add more than 12 per cent. to
the secular loss which the tides occasion to the motion of our
globe; and accordingly a little less than one-third of this loss
would be made known by a comparison of the observations on
the moon in ancient and modern times.          How far these results
are liable to be vitiated from the action of a resisting medium in
the celestial space, or from the slow contraction of our globe as
it constantly parts with internal heat, is a question which cannot
be embraced in the present inquiry.
   To obtain from the preceding equations a numerical estimate
of the extent to which lunar and terrestrial motions are affected
by tidal action, it is necessary that the value of l should be
known.     The most reliable data for determining this value might
be derived by observing the small amount of deviation which
the position of the moon or the swelling of the tides occasions in
the direction of plumblines extending from the top to the bot
tom of deep mines in various localities. But for obtaining such
 an estimate from the results of observations already made on the
tides a different mode of investigation must be adopted.     This
I  shall now  present in the most  simple   form, my object being
not   so                  how much the length of the day or
           much to determine
the path of the moon has changed during long periods of time,
as to afford the means for showing the manner in which the
power which the tides supply comes indirectly from the immense
stores of force which our globe and       its
                                      satellite derive from their
great velocities.

This insignificant force acting on the moon for three millions of
years would change her velocity a little more than 1 per cent. ;
and through the indirect influence on her orbit an increase of
about 3 per cent. would be then occasioned in her period of re
volution around our planet.      If in this estimate have assigned         I
too low a value for the      height   of the equatorial tides, there is
an  ample  compensation    for the error by giving to the angle A
the value necessary for producing a maximum effect.
   The relation already exhibited between the change in lunar
and terrestrial motion may be also deduced by investigating the
loss in the earth's rotation from the reciprocal attraction of the
moon on the protuberant tidal waters in a channel either coinci

This is the loss of terrestrial momentum in the instant of time

were wholly unimpeded by friction.            It thus appears that the
waste of motive force is     sixty   times as great to the earth as to
the moon, as may be seen        by   comparing the last formula with
equation (9) after multiplying the latter by m. The same con
formity to the law for the preservation of areas may be shown
for zones of water parallel to the equator in every latitude.

THE“On       the Measurement of the Lumiuous Intensity of Light.”
By William Crookes, F.R.S. &c.
   The measurement of the luminous intensity of a ray of light is a
problem the solution of which has been repeatedly attempted, but
with less satisfactory results than the endeavours to measure the
other radiant forces. The problem is susceptible of two divisions,
the absolute and the relative measurement of light.
   A relative photometer is one in which the observer has only to
ascertain the relative illuminating powers of two sources of light, one
of which is kept as uniform as possible, the other being the light
whose intensity is to be determined. It is therefore evident that one
great thing to be aimed at is an absolutely uniform source of light. In
the ordinary process of photometry the standard used is a candle,
defined by Act of Parliament as a “sperm of six to the pound, burn
ing at the rate of 120 grains per hour.” This, however, is found to
be very variable, and many observers have altogether condemned the
employment of test-candles as light-measures.
   The author has taken some pains to devise a source of light which
should be at the same time fairly uniform in                        its
                                                         results, would not
vary   by keeping, and would        capable

of sp. gr. 0-805, and pure benzol boiling at 81°C., which are mixed
together in the proportion of five volumes of the former and one of
the latter.   The wick-holder consists of a platinum tube, and the
wick is made of fifty-two pieces of platinum wire, each 0-01 inch in
diameter.    The flame of this lamp forms a perfectly shaped cone,
the extremity being sharp, and having no tendency to smoke; with
out flicker or movements of any kind, it burns when protected from
currents of air at a uniform rate of 136 grains per hour.
   There is no doubt that this flame is very much more uniform than
that of the sperm-candle sold for photometric purposes. Tested
against a candle, considerable variations in relative illuminating
power have been observed; but on placing two of these lamps in op

   The instrument devised for measuring the relative intensities of
the standard and other lights is next described ; it has this in com
mon with that of Arago described in 1833, as well as with those
described in 1853 by Bernard, and in 1854 by Babinet, that the
phenomena of polarized light are used for effecting the desired end”.
But it is believed that the present arrangement is quite new, and it
certainly appears to answer the purpose in a way which leaves little
to be desired. The instrument cannot be described without the aid
of drawings, which accompany the original paper; but                       mode                       its             of

sible to obtain that absolute equality of illumination in the instrument
which is requisite for a comparison. By the unaided eye one cannot
tell which is the brighter half of a paper disk illuminated on one side
with a reddish, and on the other with a yellowish light; but by using
the photometer here described the problem becomes practicable.
When the contrasts of colour are very strong (when, for instance,
one is a bright green and the other scarlet) there is difficulty in
estimating the exact point of neutrality; but this only diminishes
the accuracy of the comparison, and does not render it impossible,
as it would be according to other systems.

 senting the internal work in respect to a given elementary prism,
 determines the whole internal work of the trapezoid, in terms of the
 space traversed by the middle of the surface in one day, the spaces
 traversed by the upper and lower edges of the side, and a symbol
 representing the unit of shear. Well-known theorems serve to de
 termine the work of the shear and the friction of the bottom and
 side in terms of the same quantities.         All the terms of the equation
 above referred to are thus arrived at in terms of known quantities,
 except the unit of shear, which the equation thus determines. The

creased, the sodium-line is added to the spectrum of the gas, as it
is seen that while using the induction-current the capillary part
of the spectrum-tube in front of the slit is heated. With a suitable
striking-distance, the sodium-line is so bright that it far exceeds in
intensity the lines of the gas-spectrum if a hydrogen-spectrum tube
has been taken.     If the striking-distance be slightly increased, the
bright lines of the calcium-spectrum occur with a beauty and preci
sion which can scarcely be obtained in any other way.       Passing be
yond the striking-distance which has furnished this spectrum, the
entire phenomenon changes. The luminous line in the spectrum
tube is of such dazzling brightness, that even looked at by daylight
it leaves a long-continued after-image in the eye. This luminous
line, looked at in the spectrometer, shows a considerably bright con
tinuous spectrum, in which, however, the position of the sodium-line
appears quite dark ; we thus obtain an artificial spectrum with one
dark line, or, since the mode of formation is the same, with one Fraun
hofer's line.
   That this line is formed in the same manner as, according to
Kirchhoff, Fraunhofer's are in the solar spectrum, is at once seen on
looking at the tube after the experiment; the inside of the capillary
tube is seen to be very strongly corroded by detached glass splinters,
so that after the experiment has been often made the glass has be
come quite dull. These glass particles, which each discharge de
taches, are at the same time raised to incandescence, and the light
of these ignited solid particles furnishes the bright continuous spec
trum. These solid particles glow, however, in an atmosphere of
sodium-vapour, and this holds back the same light which was ob
served before the solid particles were detached; hence where this
light ought to be in the spectrum there is a dark part. There is here
seen     in    its
           individual stages the formation     Fraunhofer's line; for the

  TROPHORUS MACHINE EXPRESSED                        IN ABSOLUTE MEASURE.

selves to the   limiting case in which the conductors are in metallic
contact (which in some cases might possibly be applied instead of
voltaic electricity), the quantities of electricity produced are easily
obtained in absolute measure if the magnetic actions of the current
they form are observed. The reduction of the measurements of the
intensity of the current to mechanical units, which my father and
Weber executed, renders it easy to express quantities of electricity
in electrostatic units.
    The machine investigated was constructed by Schultz of Berlin,
according to the pattern described by H. Holtz in vol. xxx. of this
Magazine.      The fixed disk has two coatings; the moveable one has
a diameter of 400 millims. Where it is not otherwise expressly
mentioned, only two of the four combs which were opposite the coat
ings were at work.
    By velocity of rotation is understood the number of turns of the
handle in a second, one of which corresponds to six turns of the
glass disk.
    The two conductors were connected (a moist thread being inter
posed) with the ends of the wire of the same multiplier as was ar
ranged for the research of Weber and my father, and which is de
scribed in the fifth volume of the Proceedings of the Royal Academy
of Saxony, pp. 259 & 289. The 5635 turns of             wire, amounting      its
to   about three miles, were completely protected against the forma
tion     of

As both machines can be turned with the same velocity, Holtz's
is more productive in the ratio 10: 3.
     In reducing the current to absolute magnetic measure, the deflec
tion must be multiplied with 0:00000251.                Owing to agitations, the
greatest velocity observed, of three turns in two seconds, would be
almost the maximum for continuous use with the above machine.
If instead of the deflection 137 we take as the maximum 150 divi
sions, the intensity of the current in magnetic measure is
                          150 × 0.00000251     – 0.000376.
Changed into mechanical measure, we have
                    0.000376      x 155370   × 10°=58 million
wnits of positive electricity in a second, or a little more than one
charge of the small Leyden jar used in the measurements of Weber
 and my father.                       -
     Yet how small this quantity is as compared with that set in mo
 tion by voltaic currents is seen from the fact that the current 0-000376
 only decomposes         in      of a milligramme of water, or that, in order
 to obtain a cubic centimetre of explosive mixture, the strongest cur
 rent of our electrophorus machine would have to be passed for about
 forty hours through water.
     I have incidentally found the electromotive force of a Grove's ele
 ment in absolute measure to be = 17:9, assuming the magnetic as
 unit of current-intensity, and Siemens's as unit of resistance.              H.

  too high, a battery of two elements would furnish the current

      GENTLEMEN,                           -
     N   the 8th of this month, in    a  lecture delivered before the
                                              I
        Cambridge Philosophical Society, ventured to enunciate
a speculation regarding the origin and deportment of visible co
metary matter.     I had been led to reflect on the subject by those
experiments, on the decomposition of vapours by light, which        I
have already described in abstract in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society. The speculation was introduced and communi
cated to the Philosophical Society in the following words:–
   “In the course of my experiments on actinic action I have
been often astonished at the body of light which a perfectly infi
nitesimal amount of matter, when diffused in the form of a cloud,
can discharge from it by reflection.    I   have been repeatedly per
plexed and led into error by the action of residues so minute as
to be simply inconceivable. In order to get rid of these residues,
my experimental tubes, after having been employed for any va
pour, are flooded with alcohol, sponged out with soap and hot
water, and finally flooded with pure water.          Let me give you
some idea of the   quantities of matter that here come into play.
The tube before you, which is 3 feet long and 3 inches wide,
was so thoroughly cleansed that when filled with air, or with the
vapour of aqueous hydrochloric acid, no amount of exposure to
an intense light produced the least cloudiness.          Having thus
assured myself of the perfect purity of the tube, I took a small

bit of bibulous paper, rolled it up into a pellet not the fourth
part of the size of a small pea, and moistened it with a liquid
possessing a higher boiling-point than that of water.         held the                            I
pellet in my fingers until it had become almost dry, then intro
duced it into a connecting-piece and allowed dry air to pass over it
into this tube.   The air charged with the modicum of vapour thus
taken up was subjected to the action of light. A blue actinic
cloud began to form immediately, and in five minutes the blue
colour had extended quite through the experimental tube. For
some minutes this cloud continued blue, and could be completely
quenched by a Nicol's prism, no trace of          light reaching the          its
eye when the Nicol was                     in   its
                                 proper position.    But      particles                          its

Nothing could more perfectly illustrate that ‘spiritual texture’
which Sir John Herschel ascribes to a comet than these actinic
clouds.     Indeed the experiments prove that matter of almost
infinite tenuity   is competent to shed forth light far more intense
than that of the tails of comets.           The weight of the matter which
sent this body of light to the eye would probably have to be
multiplied by millions to bring it up to the weight of the air in
which it hung.

for consideration than in that of the enormous sweep which it
makes round the sun in perihelio, in the manner of a straight
and rigid rod, in defiance of the law of gravitation, nay, even of
the received laws of motion, extending (as we have seen in the
 comets  of 1680 and 1843) from near the sun’s surface to the
 earth’s orbit, yet whirled round unbroken—in the latter case
 through an angle of 180° in little more than two hours.      It
 seems  utterly incredible that in such a case it is one and the
 same material object which is thus brandished.         would espe                  [I

   3. Professor A. Daubrée has greatly added to our knowledge
of meteorites, both by enlarging the collection of the Muséum
d'Histoire Naturelle (somewhat neglected in this respect pre
viously *), and by his theoretical investigations on this subject,
especially by experiments concerning the artificial production
of meteoroid substances.       He has lately published his notices
on the meteoric fall of  Orgueil   (May 14, 1864), communicated
to the Paris Academy at eight meetings, between May 16 and
November 14, 1864, together with notices on those of Tourinne
la-Grosse (December 7, 1863), of Aumale in Algeria (August
25, 1865), of St. Mesmin (May 30, 1866), and of Setif, in
Algeria (June 9, 1867).      It must, however, be remarked that
the learned Professor of the Jardin des Plantes never men
tions von Haidinger’s observations or views about meteorites,

   The igneous globe becomes stationary the moment the action

                                direct observation, although                           its

252      Chevalier    W.        von Haidinger on the Luminous, Thermal,
certainly an authority in physical questions, expressly asserts,
with reference to the phenomena in Geissler's tubes, that “there
is no electrical light in the abstract sense of the term,” and that
“the particles of the gaseous substances become incandescent.”
   At the moment when the cosmical velocity, as well as light
and heat, is exhausted, the tension of the vacuum within the
igneous globe, entirely depending on this velocity, comes to an
end, and the meteor obeys only the law of gravitation, causing it
to fall on the earth's surface.
   b. Acoustic Phenomena.-The sudden irruption of the sur
rounding atmosphere into the vacuum of the igneous globe
causes a violent sound, in the same way as when gunpowder
explodes, or whenever longitudinal oscillations take place.    One
or more detonations are heard, sometimes at intervals, the last
one being the most intense.                         If
                                      previously masses, or groups
of meteoric    swarms,   have separated  from each other, repeated
detonations  may be expected.   At     events these phenomenaall
still require repeated and close observation before general con

 having undergone the intense cold of cosmical space before their
 arrival in the earth's atmosphere, it is a new proof with what
 caution facts must be ascertained and asserted by future obser
 vers: in the first, superficial reports on the fall of Knyahynia
 in Hungary (July 9, 1866), the meteorites were said to have
 been as cold as ice; further inquiries elicited that the few speci
 mens collected immediately after the fall had been of no higher
 temperature than any other stones exposed to the sun for some
 time would be.

     and Acoustic Phenomena attending the Fall               of Meteorites.          255
   nomena hitherto observed.             The fall of Knyahynia, July 9, 1866,
   may serve for an example.              The meteor approached the terres
   trial surface with only 6° zenithal distance, in a direction N. 76°
   30' E. to S. 76° 30'W.              It is certainly not to be supposed that,
   subsequently to the explosion, a portion of the meteor would
   have left the atmosphere under the same angle; nor is such a
   supposition admissible in the fall of Orgueil, as described by
   Professor Daubrée.            The following data are taken from his
   communications to the Academy of Paris+: fig. 5 is the plan

   Laussedat’s report to Professor Daubrée gives the important
   fact that the meteor was seen falling down “vertically” at Ichoux
   (Département des Landes). The line B C in fig. 5 represents con
   sequently the projection of the meteor's course on the surface of
   the earth.    M. Lajous’s report to M. Petit, dated from Rieumes
   (Haute   Garonne),      supplies the following data:—Beginning, azi
   muth N. 24° W., altitude 22°; final term, azimuth N. 20°E., alti
   tude 164°; and hence we have, in fig.6, AB=29.49%iloms. (3.973
   German geographical or 17.81English miles), CD = 17-77 kiloms.
   (2.394 geogr. or 11:24 English miles). Light first appeared at an
   altitude of 29:49 kiloms. (3.973 geogr. or 17.18 English miles);
   and the phenomenon ended above Orgueil and Nohic at an altitude
   of 17-77 kiloms. (2:394 geogr. or 11.24 English miles). The fall

is therefore = 11° 26', and the zenithal distance of the fall =

having been annihilated by atmospheric resistance, fell down as
any other heavy body would have done.         Had they pursued
their course to the  last,  they would have touched the ground

   The effective formation of the mass of meteorites falls entirely
within the third period; it can, however, only proceed very
gradually.    At the moment of a destructive catastrophe many
substances, different in nature or in progress of evolution, may
coexist,       all

    11. Professor G. W. Schiaparelli.-This illustrious astronomer
of Milan has published (1867) “Notes and Reflections on the
Astronomical Theory of Falling Stars” in the Memorie di Ma
tematica e Fisica della Società Italiana delle Scienze, ser. 3,
vol. i. part 1, p. 153.       The author treats only collaterally of
the formation of meteorites and the phenomena connected with
their fall, his chief purpose being the development of his re
markable discovery concerning the concordance of the course
of meteoric currents with the orbits of some comets.                   This
subject, merely alluded to with great reserve by that noble pa
triarch of science, Alex. von Humboldt, in his “Cosmos” (vol. i.
p. 142), could only be discussed by way of numerical com
parison subsequent to the preparatory investigations of MM.
 Leverrier and H. A. Newton.             Professor Schiaparelli (p. 198)
 admits the transmutation of the vis viva into heat and light, and
alludes (p. 255) to the probability of the meteoric iron having
 at first been gaseous, as the existence of crystals of olivine in
the interior of the “Pallasian iron’ could not be explained
 by means of any other supposition.           Alexander von Humboldtf
 declares inadmissible, even in the regions of mere probability,
 any unproved arbitrary opinion; and, indeed, those who have
 specially studied the substances composing the solid crust of our
 globe will explain the fact here in question rather by the mobi
 lity of the minutest particles of even solid substances in the
 course of their successive development than by ascribing to matter
 such proprieties as they are not known to possess at present.
     12. Dr. E. Weiss begins his paper “On Falling Stars”f with
 the words, “It can no longer be doubted that the igneous phe
 nomena connected with falling stars owe their existence merely
to the resistance of the atmosphere.” He assumes that every year
the earth gives to innumerable meteors a direction which takes
them out of the solar system into the region of the fixed stars.
The contrary process may likewise take place, as Professor Galle
  (see above) has proved the meteoric swarm of Pultusk to have en
tered the solar system with a velocity of at least one or two geogra
 phical miles per second. Dr. E. Weiss supposes the nuclei of the
 falling-star meteors to be small, without determining their size;

but, indeed, applied to cosmical bodies, the conception of magni
tude will always be relative. . He concludes, further, from the
more intense emission of light in higher atmospherical strata, that
such meteors have a greater amount of velocity than those appear
ing with less splendour in the lower regions of the atmosphere.
Director Julius Schmidt came to the same conclusion from his
observations of the meteors in the course of 1851*.         These
observations induced Haidingert to suppose a connexion between
the accelerated formation of the luminous envelope in the pro
gress of motion and the tenuity of particles of agglomerations
of cosmical pulverulent substance, in conformity with the views
expressed in Mr. A. S. Herschel’s letter on the nature of pla
 netary corpuscles, addressed to Abbé Moignot. Dr. E.Weiss has
 still some doubts about the explanations of the prevalence of fall
ing stars or of meteors, according as the meteoric bodies and the

observations of several meteors, and his discovery of the spectrum
line of sodium as distinct as in the spectrum from a gas-flame of
a Bunsen’s burner or of a monochromatic flame richly fed with
common salt, together with his observations on the forms and
modifications of the luminous remains of meteors, deserve special
attention, as they seem to confirm the supposition of a gaseous
envelope forming around the progressing nucleus.                   Mr. Her
schel says”, “Each new acquisition of knowledge, however un

     1GNITE-In         the eastern part of the province there are
        found in the carboniferous districts, but apart from the
beds of coal, sulphides of metals associated with coaly matter
having the characters of lignite.          The sulphides are relatively
large in quantity, and frequently consist of iron and copper py
rites, with a very rich sulphide of copper, apparently vitreous,           .
though called grey. The enclosing rock of such specimens of
these copper ores as I have seen is sandstone, and it is generally
more or less impregnated with green carbonate.             In one instance
galena occurs with iron pyrites in a conglomerate of limestone
and siliceous pebbles.     The masses composed of the carbonaceous
and metallic minerals generally exhibit the form of branches and
trunks of trees; and Dr. Dawson points outt that those con
taining copper result from the action of vegetable matter on
waters containing sulphate of the metal.                The formation of

galena would involve some secondary action. The deposits are
not thought to be of mining-importance, except in two instances,
in which the ores of copper are considered to exist in promising
quantities: in one of these, indeed, lately discovered there is
said to be a bed some feet thick; a sample of the ore sent me
gave 29.5 per cent. metallic copper.
    I have not been able to find more than one complete ultimate
analysis of a lignite; this is one of the fourteen analyses given
by Danaº.       In a minority only of the others is the existence of
nitrogen mentioned; the quantity is given in no case but that re
ferred to, the analysis of Vaux, who found 0.57 per cent.           From
this result and the    following ultimate    analysis  of a lignite  from
one                                                       I
       of the deposits above mentioned, for which am indebted
 to Professor Anderson of Glasgow, it appears that the quantity
of nitrogen is somewhat less in this mineral than in black coal.
    The lignite selected for examination occurs in the carbonife
 rous district of Pictou county, with copper ore and common iron
 pyrites. It is nearly black, and retains on some faces a fine
grained woody structure, not very obvious to the naked eye, but
distinct under a glass: these surfaces are dull; those at right or
oblique angles are black, of almost resinous lustre, and without
structure: it is sectile, and easily broken into angular fragments
which receive polish under the burnisher.         The mineral evidently
belongs to the variety of brown coal called jet. Boiled in potash,
it scarcely colours the fluid. Ignited, it gives a transient feeble
yellow flame, and afterwards glows for a considerable time, evol
ving the greasy odour often observed with lignite; in a closed
tube the product is chiefly water with a little yellowish matter;
the vapours have an alkaline reaction. Ultimate analysis gave          :-

    It  does not appear that any inquiry has been made as to
whether lignites vary in composition according to their geolo
gical age. As the circumstances under which they were formed
 must have been analogous, the only differences to be expected at
the corresponding stages of conversion are those depending on
variations in the original material.        Hence nothing like strict
 comparison can be made; the following, however, is not without
 interest. The large deposits of brown coal found in Germany

are of tertiary age; and Liebig has shown” that there is a nota
ble difference among these in chemical composition. The more
complete the obliteration of the woody structure, the greater the
departure from the relative proportions of the organic elements
in the original material. The wood-coal from Ringkuhl, near
Cassel, is seldom found with the structure of wood, and is there
fore more comparable with the Pictou lignite than any in which

The residue, or “coke,” consisted of a powder unchanged in ap
pearance from that put into the crucible.
    The foregoing results indicate a semibituminous coal: the
mineral differs widely from the bedded coals of the province,
which, as before mentioned, are bituminous; some, indeed, are
so in rather a high degree.        The mode of occurrence of this coal
 (the only one I have met with here approaching anthracite) is
curious, and worth further investigation.
    Cannel Coal—A specimen “from an 18-inch seam at Little
Glace Bay, Cape Breton,” had the appearance of cannel coal,
gave a brown powder and a brownish-black streak, burned alone
when well heated in a flame, in a closed tube gave much volatile
matter, and left a rounded swollen coke.                  Proximate analysis
gave   me:—

    The amount of ash here, though considerable, is smaller than
that in the well-known Scotch cannel from Capeldrae, which
gives, according to Fyfe, 25.40 per cent.              The volatile combus
tible matter is evidently high enough, in proportion to the fixed
carbon, to mark the class of minerals to which the specimen be
longs. This is the first example of Nova Scotian cannel coal yet
examined, unless, as would be right according to some authorities,
now perhaps diminishing in number, the remarkably rich oil-coal
which   I have called stellarite * is made to belong to the class.
    Turgite.--This well-defined species may be recorded among
the minerals of iron met with in the province. It occurs with
brown haematite at Terry Cope, and at another locality, probably
in the same county of Hants, according to my own examination
of specimens sent me, and it will doubtless be found frequently
elsewhere in the same association.          Both the specimens in ques.
tion afforded red powder, gave water on ignition, and decrepitated
violently in the forceps before the blowpipe. The mineral from
the last-mentioned locality was mixed with siliceous and calca
reous matters; when these were deducted, the constituents of
the air-dried substance were:—

    Delessite?—There are frequently seen in the amygdaloidal
traps of the western part of the province masses of a soft, dark
green, chlorite-like mineral ; or perhaps there are more species
than one having these characters, sometimes filling rock-cavities
more or less completely, and occasionally coating or partly com
posing zeolites, as, for example, analcime, which in different loca
                Atits

   As epichlorite occurs in veins in serpentine, and Delessite is
found coating and filling the cavities of amygdaloid, the mineral
now described is probably the latter, perhaps                                            mixed with some
free silica.
     Fahlunite—On the road between Windsor and Chester gra
nite is found, at some point not mentioned to me, containing
crystals which present the characters of chlorophyllite, or one of
the varieties of Fahlunite.        They are many- (perhaps 12-)sided
prisms, sometimes half an inch across, greenish brown and dull
externally; the distinct basal cleavage shows faces of a grey
colour and vitreous lustre; weathered surfaces of this kind have
the appearance of mica; hardness of the fresh faces about 3;
streak grey and earthy.        The mineral fuses before the blowpipe
on the edges to a black slag, yields a little water on ignition,
gives abundance of protoxide of iron to cold hydrochloric acid
on standing for some time, and a very small quantity of peroxide;
                                                                 a its

mineral is reported to be most abundant in a “black band” of
gypsum, and to be met with in nodules which are sometimes
very much larger than any seen by myself near Windsor; a good
deal is said to have been thrown away by the quarrymen as being
of no value compared with the plaster; this is worth about 90
cents a ton, shipped, while the borate would probably realize
nearly as many dollars,           roughly,           or,

   The fundamental idea which regulated the construction of the
apparatus  was the following.    In order to limit a defined quan
tity of the liquid investigated, a siphon tube had to be filled
with      it,
         and this connected with the electrodes and the conduct
ing liquids,          so
                that the values for the resistance    the liquid                       of                  in
the siphon tube were           great       possible

                     two   siphon  tubes.    With three siphon
tubes, therefore, the three possible quotients must give the

     Dr. Paalzow          on the Galvanic Resistance            of Liquids.              273
was possible; for, from the difference of the liquid resistances, by
the aid of the mercurial resistances the entire resistances of the
liquids   in the siphon tubes    could be calculated without the
accessory   magnitudes.    Deducting these resistances from the
observed values, the difference represented the magnitude which
was due to the resistance of the conducting vessels and the                               in
equality and polarization of the electrodes.    In one and the same
experiment this  magnitude    must be the same for       the siphon        all
tubes used.

                     prepared
                    his
   attack, Professor Norton       comes to my objections against
his third and fourth principles, which the reader will find in the
Philosophical Magazine (February 1869, p. 99).
    Three forms of matter.—I had asked: On whatevidence are we
to grant that matter exists in three forms essentially different
from each other ? The learned Professor gives two answers.
The first is that such forms of matter are admitted even by me,
though in different words. And to prove this, he remarks that
I, in my “Molecular Mechanics,’ admit these three things:—
 (1) the nucleus of a molecule, (2) the envelope of the nucleus,
(3) the universal aether: and from this he infers that the differ
ence of doctrine between us, from the present point of view, is
in name only. I am sorry to say that the difference lies not in
the name only, but in the thing also.
    According to my doctrine, the matter of which the nuclei (I
say nuclei, not nucleus; for there are many in each molecule) are
made is exactly of the same form as the matter of which the
envelope is composed and the matter which is to be found in
luminiferous aether. For in the doctrine of simple elements,
which    I
         have advocated, the matter in each element is a single
unextended point: and unextended points cannot differ in form.
  If  however Professor Norton in his notion of matter implies
the force also (which I doubt, as he in his first principle speaks
of matter and force as of distinct things), then the form of matter
would be       its
            principle           ofactivity, which         is   the formal constituent
ofmaterial substance.                In
                                      this case        I   am ready      toallow that
                                           T 2

 276                      Prof.    J.   Bayma on          the Fundamental
there are two forms or kinds of matter, attractive and repulsive.
But this can hardly be his meaning: as he distinguishes kind
from form, and says the kinds are two, whilst he maintains that
the forms are three.
   Tastly we might understand the word form as meaning the
result of a kind of composition. But if we accept this meaning,
the forms of matter cease to be three, and they become as many
as there are primitive compounds in nature.     And thus the as
sumption of three forms of matter can find no explanation in my
doctrine, whatever the meaning we attach to the word form.
   This shows well enough how much Professor Norton is mis
taken when he says that                      I
                           “proved to my own satisfaction that
matter does in fact exist in three essentially different forms.”
I had said indeed that luminiferous aether is “a special sub
stance,” in the same sense as                        I
                                 say that oxygen and carbon are
special substances, but                 I
                         never said nor implied that aether was
“a distinct form of matter;”                          I
                                  rather taught the contrary by
stating (Molecular Mechanics, p. 174) that aether, though a spe
cial substance, was not “a new specific matter.”
   Professor Norton’s second answer runs as follows:
     “But  to reply to others who may be disposed to adopt the objec
tion urged.      No one will deny the existence of gross or ponderable
matter, or of something which has                         all

matter.     That an aether exists       space and within transparent media

                     Gross matter! What         it?     said                        It   is             to   be
that which possesses “all the mechanical attributes       matter.”                           of
I will not  say  the  contrary:  but    may   remark that material

activity, passivity, and inertia: and these are     found    aether           to   be              in

matter and aether, as if the matter of the one had attributes not
shared by the matter of the other?
   The author will say that his “gross matter” has other mecha
nical attributes besides the three mentioned. True: but I main
 tain that these other attributes are not attributes of matter itself
 as such, but of a mechanical compound of material parts.              For it
 is only on account of      mechanical itscomposition     that the so-called
 “gross matter” possesses different properties               different sub              in

                          Professor    Norton,        attractive: and yet     is

 which   implies   repulsive   powers.      Now,   the learned Professor
 acknowledges that attractive matter and repulsive matter are two
 kinds     matter. He must therefore acknowledge that gross
           of
 matter      notis   primitive form
                           a                matter, but      compound
                                                             of                          a                           of
primitive elements, some attractive, and others repulsive. This
remark would seem sufficient           expose the fallacy
                                                        to         Professor                     of
 Norton’s   argument.      He calls    “gross     matter” that which                                                 is
not   a primitive unit, but      number                             of
                                               material units: and then
                                               a
concludes that such gross matter having special properties must
 be  “an essentially different form         matter.” We mightof          well                                  as
 say: Let      company

such   a gross man has some attributes which are not predicable
 of each individual,             let
                             conclude that “gross man”
                                       us                             essen                          is   an

two other distinct forms of matter.          The learned Professor him
                              physicists  are striving           away with                       do

would tend        prove that the existence

fessor Norton adds:

 unjust. Besides, the serious examination that          has given  the sub         he

                                to                          what     would              of                he

   My preceding remarks about the three forms           matter make                                 of
any further answer unnecessary.          may, however, add (1) that

it would appear that his examination might have been more

pulses are originated that constitute the force of heat repulsion.”
These views, which in the present controversy have only a                                                          se

be said upon points of greater moment.
   A molecule.—One of my remarks about Professor Norton’s
theory was that “Had Professor Norton known the impossibility
of continuous matter, he would have found out that what he
calls an atom of gross matter comprises already not only the
central element of a molecule, but        nuclei and       envelope; its                         its
and consequently       already endued with the properties and
                                  is                                                                               in

attraction and repulsion upon other molecules, without requiring
any new and special atmosphere             electric    luminiferous  of                     or
aether.”   To this he answers:

   my “Molecular Mechanics.” Now these differences are too
substantial and too radical                          to    be   passed over            in   silence.        On the

contrary, should we differ only in the question whether or not
luminiferous aether is condensed around a central atom (or rather
around the nuclei) the difference would be comparatively unim
portant, as it would bear simply on a point of detail.
    Accordingly, when Professor Norton states that this last point
is “ the only essential point of difference between us,”         I must
deny the truth of a statement which tends to shift the ground
of our discussion and to substitute a question of facts for a ques
tion of principles.      I have shown that the point touched upon
by the learned Professor is not the only point of difference: and
 moreover    I do not consider it an essential point in the present
                         I
 controversy whether can or cannot “escape the conclusion that
 my interstitial ather, which is attracted by the central nucleus,
 is condensed around it.”                     I
                                 Of course, am confident that can  I
 escape the conclusion; for I have never admitted the existence of
 any interstitial aether between the nuclei and the envelope of a
 molecule. But to proceed.
     I had expressed my opinion that the examples by which Pro
 fessor Norton illustrates his theory “do not imply the existence
 of extended atoms or of two distinct aethereal substances.” To
 this he answers thus:
    “When he has shown this to be true of even the ordinary calorific
 and electric phenomena, we will admit that his objection to a second
 aethereal atmosphere interpenetrating the first may have some force.”
     But this is not a sufficient reply.   The onus probandi evidently
 rests with him who makes       positive  assertions, not with him who
 asks for a proof of them.         Now, it is Professor Norton that
 started his theory by positively affirming that the existence of his
 three forms of matter was an established truth.        If then we hap
  pen to find nothing like a sufficient ground for his affirmation,
 it is not for us to prove that we have found no grounds; it is for
 him to point them out.
     He adds:
     “He   has given no hint of the general manner in which he sup
  poses electric phenomena to be evolved.       Heat he conceives to ori
  ginate in the vibrations of the molecules of bodies; but it can be
  proved, almost to a demonstration, that heat cannot originate in this
  manner.”
     Electricity is a branch of science scarcely a century old, and
  electric theories are as yet, as everyone knows, obscure and un
  certain. Such being the case,       I  did not think it convenient to
  devote to conjectures more or less probable space in a book of so
  positive a character as   I  intended my “Elements of Molecular
  Mechanics’ to remain. Hence it is perfectly true that I gave
  no hint of the evolution of electric phenomena. But the state

282               Prof.    J.   Bayma on the Fundamental
ment that     I conceive   heat      “to originate” in
                                               the vibrations of the
molecules   of bodies is not equally correct.   I said indeed that
“the first cause of calorific motion is to be found in the very
constitution of molecules . . . . which are always subject to vibra
tory motion ” (Molecular Mechanics, p. 264): but the first
cause is only one out of many, as nothing is called first without
reference to a second.    On the other hand, when speaking of
vibrativity, to which I trace the phenomena of heat, I state that
vibrativity, as a general property of bodies, implies the capability
of making vibrations determined “by an extrinsic agent” (Ibid.
p. 171). In fact, I conceive heat to consist, though not to origi
nate, in certain vibrations of the molecules of bodies, and these
vibrations to depend first on the molecular constitution of bodies,
secondly  on any extrinsic causality that is brought to bear on
their velocity and intensity. If Professor Norton proves “almost
to a demonstration ” that this view is untenable, I shall be thank
ful to learn in what his proof consists.   Should he however, as
I  am afraid he will, argue from the supposed existence and work
ing of universal aether between the molecules of bodies,      would      I
tell him beforehand that such a proof, besides other considerable
objections, might admit of a reply drawn from the well-known
law of calorific capacities.
    Luminiferous ather.—One of my objections against Professor
Norton’s theory was that luminiferous aether, according to him,
was a repulsive and resisting medium, which                 I
                                                  had shown to be
irreconcilable with astronomical facts. He answers:
   “The principal astronomical fact here referred to is that the
planets do not encounter any sensible resistance in their motion
through space. The evidence of an aethereal resistance afforded by
Encke's comet, Professor Bayma strives to explain away without
success.”                       -
     I
     give to the reader the opportunity of judging for himself of
this point of our controversy, by transcribing the passage referred
to by the learned critic,    “How do we know that Encke's comet

say only that with the scanty knowledge we have of the bodies
that move in heavenly spaces, and after the discovery of so many
new planets, the existence of which had never been suspected
before, it would be too rash on the part of a man of science to
pronounce that no other cause exists in the heavens to which we
can trace the change of Encke's comet course, except a resisting
medium. The more so, since Encke's comet shows a regular acce
leration of its motion, instead of a retardation. Now acceleration
does not proclaim, but refute, the theory of a resisting medium;
and therefore Encke's comet and all the other celestial bodies with
one loud voice proclaim, and witness in fact, the absolute non
existence of a resisting medium ” (Molecular Mechanics, pp. 178,
179).
  Professor Norton goes on arguing:
    “The   fact that no sensible resistance is experienced by the pla
nets does not necessarily imply, as he supposes, that the aether is not
repulsive.    For, in the first place, if the molecules of the planetary
mass have the constitution                    I
                                have attributed to them, the impinging
aether must take effect upon either the aethereal or the electric atmo
spheres of the molecules, and so may be mostly expended in the ge
neration of heat and electric currents.                       I
                                              have in fact undertaken to
show, in my paper on Molecular Physics, that the earth may derive
 its
   magnetic condition and         certain portion
                                              a            heat from theof   its
impact   of the aether   space.”
                             of
    Inthis argument the learned Professor assumes (1) that the
molecules    the planetary masses have the constitution which

has attributed    them, and (2) that the impinging aether spends

284               Prof.   J.   Bayma on the Fundamental
cules, of a change by which the conditions of the molecular
equilibrium have been violated.      Hence, before we speak of a
possible generation of heat and electric currents in the move
ment of a planet through a resisting medium, we must admit
the full efficiency of the impact in retarding the motion of the
molecules directly exposed to the resistance of the medium.
The generation of heat and electric currents may, or even must,
follow, according to the assumption: but that which follows can
not entail the least decrease of intensity in the retardation which
precedes, and    of which it is the result.
     Professor Norton here employs a second argument. He says:
   “Again, if the action of gravity be not instantaneous, it will take
effect in a direction slightly inclined to the radius vector, and, in the
existing state of the planetary system, the tangential component
resulting from this inclination may be in equilibrium with the feeble
overplus of resistance from the aether.”
           I answer (1) that, if luminiferous aether is supposed to
     To this
be  repulsive, the study of the phenomena of light leaves no
room whatever for any hypothesis implying that such aether op
poses a feeble resistance.            I
                            This have proved in my “Molecular
Mechanics’    (pp. 176–180).    As to the overplus,         I
                                                       have shown
just now that it would be the whole of the resistance.                 (2) That
the hypothesis concerning the successive propagation of the action
of gravity is utterly false, as       I
                                     have fully shown in my work
(pp. 63–65), and has no other foundation than the confusion of
two things perfectly different, viz. action and motion, cause and
effect.   (3) That, independently of the two preceding remarks,
and  granting  (only for the sake of the argument) that the said two
assumptions might be admitted, it would still be false that the
action of gravity “will take a direction slightly inclined to the
radius vector” and have “a tangential component.”           The case
of gravitation is not parallel to that of the aberration of light, as
Professor Norton’s argument seems to imply.          Gravitation              in
vests continually the whole mass of the planet, and              its
                                                            resultant
passes through the centre       it: hence
                                 of           tangential component
                                                       no
of gravitation    conceivable consistently with the received prin
                 is

approach of the two, their relative velocity will be equal to the sum
of the velocity of the earth and that due to their mutual attraction,
and, during their separation, will be equal to the difference of the same
velocities, and hence that the atom of aether will continue to attract
the molecule during a longer interval of time while the two are se
parating than while they are approaching.       The molecule will there
fore on the whole be retarded by the action of the atom.            If the
attractive aether be ‘immensely denser than the atmospheric air,’
the resistance should certainly not be less than that of a subtile re
pulsive aether.”
   This argument has one great defect: it        is based on a false alle
gation.   It is not “my idea,” nor has it       ever been, that a mole
cule of the earth’s mass passes through          the atom of aether and
leaves it behind.   The earth in    path        its

pointed out that this aether, being repulsive, could not attract
luminiferous aether; and yet the author seemed                    hold this        to
contradiction.
   He replies thus:
   “Professor Bayma has here entirely misunderstood me, and re

  “The    real fundamental principle was that the atoms    electric                     of

 by  supposing that the axle had        slight bend,  a      that the pinion        or

and pinions striking one another and then again being thrown

against me, I will willingly retract my calculations, the more
so because they are only approximately correct. This may be
brought about either by the new experiments of Messrs. Stewart

of the radiation of heat in absolute measure. But so long as this
experimental test is wanting it would be idle to continue a dis

        WILLIAM MARCET, M.D., F.R.S., Assistant Physician to the
        Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, Brompton*.
         HE consideration of the cause of the head-notes of the
         human voice is of much interest, not only in a physiolo
gical point of view, with the object of accounting for the produc
tion of those wonderfully soft and penetrating sounds in which
Swiss and Tyrolese singers are so remarkably proficient, but also
for the purpose of explaining certain morbid changes of the hu
man voice not unfrequently met with.              Let me premise that, by
means of the      laryngoscope   (a small mirror so constructed as to
allow the observer to view the inside of the larynx and the action
of      its
        various parts      the production
                               in                sound), the phenomenon

of phonation can              be
                         investigated with great minuteness. There
are, moreover, certain changes                     of
                                         form the larynx undergoes                                  in
the act       phonation, and bearing
                of                             the subject on   the present           of
communication, which can                     be

by the removal of the mucus which constantly moistems the rim
of the cords; their edges thus become sharper and their weight
less, while, their elasticity remaining the same, they are shaken
into more rapid tremors”.      The observations   have had the op        I
portunity of making appear to show that the head- or falsetto
sounds are really caused by the vibrations being confined to the
rim of the cords; and              I
                             have been able to determine with the
laryngoscope the conditions of the larynx which give rise to
these sounds.
    When the larynx is examined with the laryngoscope during
the act of phonation, the vocal cords are seen to approach each
other throughout their whole length and parallel with each other,
till they appear in contact, or very nearly so. Any circumstance
which interferes with this mutual approximation of the cords, such
as weakness of certain of their muscles, as shown by Dr. Morell
Mackenzie, or swelling of some parts of the larynx, causes the
voice to become very weak or entirely suppressed; and this is a
frequent source of aphonia. When the cords do not meet in
their entire length, either an anterior or posterior portion of one
of them remaining apart, a sound is produced, but instead of a
fair chest-note we have a falsetto or head-sound.
    If a finger be applied to the throat, a depression will be felt
between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages; now on singing the
notes of the scale, beginning with the lowest, this depression will
be felt to contract, on account of one of the cartilages ap
proaching the other, until with the highest notes it has entirely
disappeared—this being due to the action of two of the laryngeal
muscles (the crico-thyroid), which tightens the cords, thereby
raising the sound of the notes.              however,    If,

in bringing back immediately a fair chest-sound, the difference
being so remarkable that anybody in the next room could not
have believed the same person was speaking; an inspection of
the larynx now showed both cords to meet well throughout their
whole length.         For some time, however, my patient did not re

firming the correctness of this observation.               I then lost sight of
him for some       weeks,    during   which time his voice remained good;
but he finally again applied to me, his speech having relapsed
into the falsetto sound. I now observed with the laryngoscope
that the anterior half of the left cord was at fault, a chink re
maining visible between the anterior portions of the cords during
the act of phonation.          On the application to the larynx of a so
lution of iodine in        olive-oil,  the chest-voice was again brought
back, and both cords were seen to come into mutual contact
throughout their whole length. The cause of this relapse was due
to a swelling of the left side of the larynx (left false cord), extend
ing to the true cord and interfering with                        its
                                                          movements.        find        I

communication to the explanation of the mode of formation of
head-sounds f
   We must first admit that clear falsetto or head-notes are har
monic sounds; then we must consider how harmonic notes can
be produced by the laryngeal instrument.                 -
    If the vocal cords be regarded in the same light as the vi
brating “tongue’ of a reed-instrument, their nodes” must be
parallel to their edges; when the whole breadth of the cords
vibrates, the harmonics are not heard, and the sound emitted is
said to be from the chest; but if the cords meet only on a por
tion of their length, then the vibrating-power of the blast will be
entirely spent in distributing the vibrations in a longitudinal
direction to those portions of the cords which are kept apart.
Hence the edges only of the cords will vibrate; the vibrating
body may then be regarded as a narrow strip of elastic mem
brane included between the edge of the cords and one of the nodes
nearest and parallel to that edge. An harmonic note, or a head
or falsetto sound, will be the result of these vibrations. Now this
head-sound may be clear, sharp, and well defined, or it may be
cracked and even painful to hear.       This appears to me due to
the circumstance that the vocal apparatus, being reduced to a
narrow strip limited on one side by          edge and    itsthe other                 on
 by   node, becomes      true vibrating  cord with nodes        longi                  in

    of the Tyrolese singer; but I believe it can be due to no other
    cause than the close apposition of the arytaenoid cartilages through
    the action of a special muscle, the arytaenoideus proprius; and
    this would account for the formation of harmonics. The vocal
    cord may be regarded as fixed to these two cartilages poste
    riorly, which in some measure act as parts of the cords; so that
    these two bodies, by pressing against each other, will reduce the
    length of the cords, very much in the same way as when a finger
    is applied lightly to a vibrating violoncello-cord. The skill of
    the singer who wishes to pass very quickly from a chest to a
    head-note, and to strike the right clear sharp falsetto sound, will
    be an acquired dexterity of regulating the motion of the arytaenoid
    cartilages so as to cause the air from the chest to act on the length
    of the cords required for one of their harmonics. If he should
    in any way miss the exact spot, a cracked sound will be emitted.
    This will account for the present mode of singing requiring a
    great deal of practice to be done in perfection. The fact that
    the cricoid and thyroid cartilages remain nearly motionless, on
    passing from a chest- to                  its
                                     corresponding falsetto note, would

served in continuously dry weather, while increased transpa
rency is regarded as a sign of approaching wet weather.
   With these facts and observations are connected the two prin
cipal views which at different times have been propounded as to
the greater or less transparency of the air. A. De la Rive ascribes
the less transparency of the air in dry weather to the presence of
opaque dust and vegetable germs.        If the air becomes moist by
south-west winds setting in, these corpuscles become more trans
parent, and at the same time heavier, owing to the absorption of
aqueous vapour, so that they fall to the ground more rapidly,
which is more completely the case when the rain begins; the air
thereby becomes purified and at the same time more transparent.
Marshal Vaillant, on the contrary, assigns as the chief reason                  air
 for the different degrees of transparency in the             north-east        in
 and  south-westerly    winds,  the circumstance that    during  the pre
 valence   ofthe latter, owing      the uniformity
                                            to          the temperature    in
of  the ground and the air, local vertical currents are far less than
with north-easterly winds.        Disturbed air, however,       far more                 is
opaque, because        the boundary

      The latter, which from the reasons stated is the more reliable
result, almost agrees within the limits of error with that previously
ascertained.   Without prematurely attributing too great weight
to this agreement, we may draw the conclusion that by                                means        of
my photometer              it
                         is possible to determine the absorption of air in
tubes      of   no great length,  those, for instance, which can be set up
in an ordinary room.

assumed.             In

                                         half saturated with aqueous
vapour and heated          about    24°C.,

   In  close connexion with the preceding investigation is another,
            I
of which wish here to communicate a preliminary result. It
refers to the difference in the colour of the waters of lakes and
rivers in summer and winter, as well as of the warm and saline
water of the Gulf-stream as compared with the surrounding
water.     I  consider that the darker or deeper and more vivid
colour in summer, and in the Gulf-stream, is not to be ascribed
to a greater quantity of salt, but essentially to the higher tem
perature. It is well known that in most bodies absorption              in
creases with increase of temperature.             To decide whether this
is also the case with water,       I first determined the coloration of
a paper surface illuminated by the sun, when looked at through a
layer of water 2-4 metres in thickness.             To judge the colour
the  better,   the tube was  only   half  filled,  so that the uncoloured
white paper above was visible. Ordinary well-water cooled to
7°C. gave a bright greenish-white tone, and at 50° C. a de
cidedly deeper bright green coloration; distilled water, too, at
20° C. exhibited a bright bluish-green colour, which at 58°C.
passed into a deeper and greener colour.
    The transparency of water at two different temperatures was
directly measured.       Between the photometer and the ground
glass pane of a front window, at one aperture two glass tubes
 (each closed by glass plates) of 50 millims, and 200 millims.
length were placed, at the other aperture of the photometer two
other such tubes of 100 millims. and 150 millims. length.
 The relative intensities with the empty and the partially filled
tubes were ascertained; in one case the tubes of 50 millims. and
 150 millims., and in the other those of 100 millims. and 200
 millims. were filled with distilled water filtered through coarse
filtering-paper.      The temperature of the water, of about 6°C.,
 was obtained by cooling the entire room to this temperature;
 with the higher temperature of 25°C., the room was at a tempe
 rature of 16°C.       From the experiments made on the 4th and
 5th of January, 1867, the following values were obtained for the
 coefficient of transparency of distilled water filtered through
 coarse   paper:—                 -
                       At 24°4 C. a-0-91790,
                       At 6°-2 C. a-0-94769,
 referred to 1    decim. as unit of path.      My former experiments in
 Königsberg had given for the same paper and a temperature of
 about 17°C., and referred to the same unit of path, the value
                           17° C. a-0-93968,
 which agrees well with the above.            Hence the transparency of
 water at low temperatures is in fact greater than at higher ones.

    appearance of this book may be regarded as one of the im
THEmediate results of the recent impulse in favour of teaching ex
perimental science, which has been felt in almost every school in this
country.    Two or three years ago common class instruction in che
mistry or physics could only be obtained in a few institutions of the
larger and more expensive kind; but it is now understood that these
subjects can be beneficially taught to boys, nay, that they are essen
tial elements in a liberal education.         Acting upon this belief (in
which he has our    hearty  concurrence),     the schoolmaster is naturally
exposed to two dangers, which are not inconsiderable, and really
deserve his serious attention.
   The first danger which the schoolmaster has to encounter             that                                         is,

mend as a school-book.    Too often devoted to the exposition of the
fancies or whims of the hour, or to a wonderful confusion of the
creeds of independent apostles, most of our manuals of chemistry
are like copies of some manuscript legend in which the original
sentences have been repeatedly misplaced and rendered almost un

this the romance of nature ? So much censure certainly does not
attach to the current physical manuals; but they are almost                      far                                 all

seams of coal.    The chief Secondary deposits are of Oolitic or
Liassic age, and agree with those of the Petchora region, which is
the next adjacent tract on the west to the Siberian region in ques
tion.   Similar rocks are found in Spitzbergen.       The banks of the .
Jenissei are covered with Postpliocene accumulations similar to
 those found near Archangel.     It is thus seen that the vast, slightly
 undulating, and to a great extent horizontal and unbroken forma
tions, each of which occupies so wide an area in European Russia,
are repeated on the eastern side of the Ural Mountains.         In this
range of mountains only are to be found igneous and erupted rocks.
   In conclusion, Sir Roderick referred to the discovery of fossili
ferous white chalk in parts of the great Sarmatian plain by M.
Grewinck.                      -
    Sir RodeRICK MURCHIsoN, in explanation of the paper, referred to
a geological map of Russia, and gave a general sketch of the bearing
of the paper on the previously known geology of that country.     He
mentioned the    discovery by M. Grewinck of beds of brown coal
containing amber, and overlying true chalk.      The amber in the
Baltic had been supposed to have been washed out of beds beneath
the sea; but Count Keyserling has suggested that the amber may
have been brought down by the rivers from the interior, and depo
sited in the Baltic. Sir Roderick also called attention to the ab
sence of igneous rocks in Russia to the west of the Ural Mountains.
  2. “On a Section of a        Well at Kissingen.”      By Prof. Sand
berger, For.Corr.G.S.
  Taking   as a starting-point a bed of dark-blue limestone, the
author  proceeded to describe the various beds passed through in
sinking the Schönbern well, both as regards their petrological cha
racters and chemical constitution.   He considered that this bed is
on the same horizon as the  uppermost Plattendolomite of the Zech
stein formation    in the Harz and Thuringia.        Above this  lie the
lowermost beds    of ofthe Bunter (containing   dolomites), and below  it
the upper part       the Zechstein formation.    Below the Plattendolo

     3. “On the Formation of Deltas; and on the Evidence and
  Cause of great Changes in the Sea-level during the Glacial Period.”
  By Alfred Tylor, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S., &c.
     The first portion of this paper was devoted to a comparison of the
  delta-deposits of the Po, Ganges, and Mississippi.    The surfaces of
  these deltas and the alluvial plains above them were compared
  together; and it was stated that a parabolic curve drawn through the
  extremities of each river, and through one point in its course,
 nearly represents its longitudinal section—the greatest deviation
 being 30 feet in some of the largest deltas.
     The littoral deposits around Great Britain described by Mr. God
 win-Austen were next investigated, to ascertain whether the hypo
 thesis of a fall of 600 feet in the sea-level is tenable. The ice-cap
 at the poles was also alluded to as a probable cause of a great reduc
 tion of the sea-level during the Glacial period.
     The upper 600 feet of deposits in the Pacific Ocean, made by coral
 zoophytes, were quoted as cases which might be explained as well by
 oscillations in the sea-level as by the received hypothesis of the sub
 sidence of the sea-bottom,
     Prof. E. Forbes's investigations into the origin of the fauna and
 flora of the British Isles were next alluded to, and the author con
  sidered that the hypothesis of a fall in the sea-level better accords
 with the facts of migration than Forbes's suggestion of changes of
 the level of the land and sea-bottom.
     The origin and age of the English Channel was discussed at some
 length; and the occurrence of the Crag and fossiliferous gravels
 and raised beaches near the same level, although of different ages,
 together with the evidence afforded by the dredging up of fresh
 water and littoral shells in the North Sea and English Channel,
 were adduced in support of the theory of the depression of the sea
 level.
     The parabolic curve not only represents the curve of deposition;
 for the author had measured other sections, and found that the
 curves of denudation and deposition approximate often to that of
 the parabola.
                                Discussion.
    The PRESIDENT called attention to the fact that in the neighbour
hood of coral reefs the dead corals extend to such a vast depth
that, supposing them all to have been formed near the surface, and
that surface only lowered by abstraction of water to the Poles,
the accumulation of ice must have been so great as to become         in
credible.
    Sir CHARLEs LYELL had already suggested to Mr. Croll that, as
suming the accumulation of ice at the Pole depressing the centre of
gravity of the earth, the submergence that would have resulted had

                Mr. A. Tylor   on the Formation of Deltas.                  3.11
the quantity of water in the sea remained the same would, to some
extent, be counteracted by the reduction in volume consequent on
the formation of the ice.  With regard to the delta of the Missis
sippi, the data on which he argued had considerably altered since
first he wrote on the subject, inasmuch as recent calculations had
doubled the estimated volume of water flowing into the sea, and
thus it was capable of producing the same effect in half the pre
viously calculated time. The progress of the delta at any spot was
of necessity variable, as the position of the mouth changed. The
American engineers had allowed only 40 feet as the depth of the
fluviatile deposits, whereas from boring Sir Charles had concluded
it to be at least 500 or 600 feet. There was now reason to suppose
that it was much more, possibly as much as 1500 feet. This
being the case, notwithstanding     the amount of work done by the
river being doubled, his calculation as to the time required for the
formation of the delta might not after all be so excessive.
   Mr. PRESTwich suggested that Mr. Croll's theory only involved a
transfer of ice from one Pole to the other, and not a diminution of
volume of the sea. The raised beaches round the coast of Britain
varied considerably, and were not on one uniform horizon, as they
would have been had they resulted from a lowering of the sea.
The elevation of the old sea-beds during the Glacial period were not
accounted for by any supposition of the mere alteration in the
volume of the sea.
  Mr. Evans pointed out that, the Cyrena being a freshwater shell,
itsposition     at certain level was not connected directly with the
                     a
height  ofthe sea.    He doubted the curve    the rivers being
                                                     of                    in   all
cases parabolic.
    Mr. MALLET had already remarked that the beds                      rivers,
                                                                      of
especially near their sources, appeared              to
                                                    assume curves     closely
allied
       to
       a     parabola.    He considered that the form was due rather
to   the elevatory forces than       to erosion.    He doubted, however,
whether   they  were   really parabolic   curves,     indeed any other ma
                                                      or
thematical curve.
    Mr. TYLoR replied that     he had not found definite evidence          as   to
the extension        of
                    corals downwards       to such      depth
                                                          a       that men

most closely with the longitudinal section           of

               ON     THE COLORATION OF PEROXIDE                               OF NITROGEN.
                                   BY M. SALET.
                          of nitrogen (hyponitric acid) has several
THE  vapour of peroxide
  remarkable properties.    Its density rapidly decreases up to 43°;
the decrease then becomes slower, and it ceases at 150°.        It is
at the same time observed that the colcur of the    vapour gradually
deepens; from yellowish brown it becomes reddish brown and then
deep red.
   It may be asked whether the same cause cannot explain these two
peculiarities.
   Wurtz supposes that the molecule of peroxide of nitrogen at a low
temperature contains N’ O'= 2 vols., and that on being heated it is
gradually dissociated into 2 molecules, NO", each occupying two
volumes (Chimie Moderne, p. 156).       This decomposition, which is
the inverse of polymerization, is not without examples in chemistry;
the cases of cyanic acid, styrolene, &c. may be adduced.
   Supposing that NO” and N*O' expand regularly, it is easy to cal
culate the composition of a mixture of these two bodies which for a
given temperature would have the density found for peroxide of
nitrogen.
   Let D be this density referred to hydrogen (that     the weight                           is,               of

 that it then attains a maximum, because the increase in specific co

of this decrease predominates, so that the coloration itself decreases

     These consequences of our hypothesis have been experimentally
 verified.    By means of a special calorimeter we determined the values
 of a with a sufficient degree of approximation; the means of the
  experiments are met with in the last column of Table B.                         We

     Our apparatus consists of two prisms for total reflection, which
  send the light of the zenith through two horizontal tubes closed by
  glass plates and placed in the same right line.              These tubes contain
  vapours under the ordinary atmospheric pressure;                  they are heated

in an air-bath; and one of them may be lengthened or shortened at
pleasure.   In the space between them two other prisms for total re
flection are placed, which send the two coloured beams parallel, so as
to form two tangential images as in the saccharometer. The tube of
fixed length is gradually heated; and equality in colour is obtained
by varying the length of the second tube, which is kept at a tempe
rature of 26°7.
   It was previously ascertained that the principle of compensation
adopted was applicable; for two columns of vapour, the one hot and
short, and the other cold and long but presenting the same colour to
the eye, gave the same spectrum when the same image was examined
by a direct-vision spectroscope the refracting edges of which were
                                                -
horizontal.
    Spectroscopic examination showed that the colour of a column of
nitrous vapour cannot be compensated by that of a column of liquid
peroxide of nitrogen.    The spectrum of this latter does not present
bands of absorption, only a maximum of intensity in the reddish yel
low.—Comptes Rendus, August 8, 1868.
         ON   THE MAGNETISM OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS.
                   BY PROFESSOR: WIEDEMANN.
   The magnetic deportment of chemical compounds of magnetic me
tals is highly interesting, inasmuch as the metals in them frequently
retain to a greater or less extent the magnetism which they possess in
the free state, and thus, by a determination of this magnetism, conclu
sions may frequently be drawn in reference to the properties of the
metals themselves in their combinations.       From this point of view
the author had determined in a former investigation the degrees of
magnetism of various oxygen and haloid salts of the magnetic me
tals, and had found that in analogous salts of the same metal the product
of the atomic weight with the temporary magnetism excited by the unit
of magnetizing force in the unit of weight of the salt (that          theis,
magnetism   of   an
                atom        of
                          these salts)   almost constant.
                                             is                    If

 particularly that of cupric bromide, a salt both whose constituents
 (copper and bromine) are feebly but decidedly diamagnetic, as direct
 determinations show.     Two diamagnetic elements can thus by their
combination give a magnetic compound.
   That this magnetism of copper salts is to be ascribed to the copper
itself is proved by          its

depends on an alteration in the density of the whole mass, or only
on an alteration of the magnetic atomic group itself.

netic metals investigated are, with the exception of sulphide of                       man
ganese, very feebly magnetic.
     X. Nickel cyanide and cobalt cyanide have an atomic magnetism
which is only about 0.4 to 0:6 of the atomic magnetism of the other
salts of nickel and cobalt. When these cyanides are dissolved in solu
tion of cyanide of potassium, their magnetism almost entirely disap
pears. This cannot arise from the formation of a simple double
salt; for the magnetic constituents in the double salts retain their
atomic magnetism unchanged;          the magnetic atomic group must
rather have itself   changed.    The salts formed have probably the
composition 2 KCy, CoCy”, and 2 KCy, NiCy”, corresponding to their
electrolytic deportment.      The analogous magnetic deportment of
potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferridcyanide favours this view.
From the experiments on the decomposition of magnetic salts by
double elective affinity, the potassium can be replaced by the magnetic
metals, which thereby retain their atomic magnetism unchanged as in
the ordinary oxygen and haloid salts.       From the analogy with the
latter they would also have to be regarded as consisting of an equi
valent of potassium combined in potassium ferrocyanide with a dia
magnetic atomic group (Cy--4 FeCy), by which the salt itself is dia
magnetic, and in potassium ferridcyanide with a magnetic atomic
group (Cy--Fe3Cy), by the addition of which the salt becomes
magnetic.

the subject of the occurrence and distribution of the noble metal

    It must be remembered, however, that gold in minute quan
tity is undoubtedly contained in some of the English lead and
copper ores, especially when these ores are strongly argentiferous,
as will be hereafter noticed.         Still the total amount of gold
present in such cases is so extremely insignificant as neither to
entitle them to the appellation of gold ores proper, nor even, in

     It
     has long been known, however, that the alluvial deposits in
the beds of many of the Cornish rivers contain native gold in the
form of nuggets and small rounded or flattened grains or scales;
and it appears not improbable that the gold forming the orna
ments of prehistoric origin frequently found in Cornwall and
the neighbouring counties may have been derived from this source.
A nugget of gold from these alluvial deposits in the collection of
the late Sir Charles Lemon weighs more than one ounce, and
the largest nugget recorded is stated to have weighed 2 ozs.
3 dwts. ; but these are quite exceptional instances, as in general
the weight of the particles does not exceed a few grains.
   Most frequently the gold is found associated with the so-called
stream-tin (cassiterite or oxide of tin); and when the stream
works were, as anciently, an important source of the tin-production
of Cornwall, a not inconsiderable quantity of native gold seems
to have been obtained during the washing of the alluvial deposits
for tin ore. As these deposits have now been nearly, if not alto
gether, exhausted, it has become extremely difficult to meet with
authentic specimens of Cornish gold at the present time.
  In the British Museum may be seen a specimen of stream-tin
 ore with gold from the Carnon stream-works; and Messrs. Greg
 and Lettsom mention gold being found at the Crow Hill stream
 works at Trewarda, Kenwyn, at Llanlivery near Lostwithiel, and
at Laddock near Grampound.                -
   As no analysis of native gold from Cornwall is to be met with
 in any of the works of mineralogy which           have examined,     I                    I
have for several  years  been endeavouring    to secure an authentic
specimen for the purpose of determining           chemical composi

                                         of
their aggregate weight was only 5:46 grains.

    Several large nuggets of the gold from the washings on the
river on the north-east side of the mountain Croghan Kinshela
in the county of Wicklow, on the borders of Wexford, are to be
seen in the British Museum ; and the largest nugget known to
have been obtained is stated to have weighed twenty-two ounces.                                                       .

826                  Mr. D. Forbes's Researches in
Kildonan.      It was only, however, towards the close of last year
that the localities which now are being somewhat extensively
explored were discovered by a Mr. Gilchrist, a native of Suther
landshire, who had but recently returned from Australia, where
he had been engaged in the gold-diggings for a number of years.
The consequent rush of adventurers to these auriferous deposits
has led to finding gold in the beds of many of the neighbouring
streams; but as yet no authentic information has been received
as to the occurrence of gold in situ in the rocks of this district.
     The first find was made in the Kildonan Strath, about ten
miles inland from Helmsdale, and a little later at Siesgill Burn,
 about two miles above Kildonan.       At the commencement of this
 year a further discovery of gold was made in the Strath of Dun
 beath in Caithness-shire, about the end of January, in two dif
 ferent burns between Ben Smestal and Gordonbush, and subse
 quently in Auldtoun Burn and at Kilcomkill (about six miles from
 Brora), in a tributary of the river Brora.
     Mr. James Haswell of Edinburgh kindly put me in communi
 cation with Mr. P. G. Wilson* of Inverness, who has furnished
 me with specimens of the gold produced from the Kildonan
 washings, and thus enabled me to submit them to a chemical
 examination.            -
     The gold from the Kildonan diggings, as they are called, which
I   received from Mr. Wilson, was in the form of minute grains
 more or less flattened, and varying in size from the smallest
 speck up to that of a split pea, the largest of them weighing
 about 5 grains.     I understand, however, that lumps of much
 greater size have been occasionally met with, and, amongst others,
 that the original discoverer (Mr. Gilchrist) had in his possession
 five nuggets varying in weight from one quarter of an ounce up
 to one ounce troy.
     The colour was an extremely beautiful pure golden yellow, very
 much resembling that of the South American alluvial gold; and
 from     its
            appearance     would
                          it        judged much richer

   The specific gravity, determined by weighing a large specimen
 (2024.5 grs.) out of and in distilled water, was found to be 3.431.
Another determination, made upon 38-26 grains in the powdered
state, gave 3'436 spec. grav, at 60° F.       After ignition for some
time at a red   heat, the  mineral,  which had lost 0.729 per cent.,
was found to    possess a specific gravity of 3:474.
   The blowpipe characters were found to be as follows:—Heated
in a close or open tube it remains unaltered in appearance, but
evolves a little water, which is probably only hygroscopic; if in
larger fragments, it occasionally decrepitates.     After heating, it
reacts alkaline to reddened litmus               and turmeric   test-papers
moistened with distilled water.
   Heated alone in the blowpipe-flame, either in the platinum
forceps or on charcoal, it melts at a pretty strong heat under 3
of Won Kobell's scale, quietly, without intumescence, to a brilliant
black globule which is not magnetic; with soda alone in the re
ducing flame it also fuses with escape of gas to a black non-mag
netic globule; on platinum-foil with soda and nitrate of potash
in the oxidating flame it affords the characteristic green reaction
of manganese.
   With borate on platinum wire in the oxidating flame it dissolves
completely to a clear reddish-yellow glass, which becomes colour
less on cooling, and in the reducing flame on charcoal produces a
greenish glass. With phosphate it gives the same colour-reac
tions as with borate, both in the oxidating and reducing flames; but
in this case a skeleton of silica remains in the glass undissolved
by the phosphate.
    Itis not, or at least very imperfectly, decomposed by acids.
The chemical analysis was conducted as follows:—The amount
of ignition loss was determined upon 38-40 grs., and after heat
ing for twenty minutes to redness found to be 0:28 gr., equivalent
to 0.729 per cent. 20:01 grs. of the mineral in fine powder
were fused in a platinum crucible with 80 grs. carbonate of soda
n    potash; a strong manganese reaction was observed.        The
fused mass was decomposed by hydrochloric acid, evaporated in
a  water-bath to dryness, and then heated in an air-bath to render
the silica insoluble; the silica, after being well washed and             ig
nited, weighed 7-83 grs., or 49'12 per cent. of the mineral;               its

1:604 per cent.    The oxides of manganese and iron were then
separated by carbonate of barytes and determined as usual, the
sesquioxide of iron obtained amounting to 4-82 grs., and the
manganosomanganic     oxide to 0:27 gr., equivalent to 1:25 per
cent. protoxide of manganese in the mineral. The solution, after
separating the alumina and oxides of iron and manganese, was
now precipitated by oxalate of ammonia, and the resulting oxa
late of lime converted into carbonate by gently heating to red
mess with the subsequent employment of carbonate of ammonia.
The amount of carbonate obtained was 7.46 grs., equal to 4.17
grs. lime, or 20.87 per cent. lime in the mineral. From the                                            fil
trate the magnesia was separated by addition of ammonia and
then phosphate of ammonia, and the precipitate converted into
pyrophosphate of magnesia by ignition; it weighed 2:04 grs.,
equal to 0.73 magnesia, or 3.67 per cent.
   As it was found that the iron contained in the mineral was
present        in the state of both protoxide and sesquioxide,                                          it
became necessary to determine        their respective amounts. For
this purpose a separate portion     of the mineral was employed and
treated as follows:—A portion of the mineral finely powdered
was mixed with four times          weight      its

 The convenience of this apparatus for every kind of mechanical -
 appliance in a lecture-room is wonderful.
   All bodies fall through the same height in the same time.
 This was Galileo's experiment from the top of the tower of Pisa;
 it   can be repeated on a small scale in the lecture-room                                      in       a   stri
king manner.
    A scaffolding is built up with the stool, beds, and bolts of the
 system; and thus at the height of 24 feet from the floor a pul
ley is supported through which passes a rope.       A piece of wood
the shape of an equilateral triangle, 9 inches each side, has two
electromagnets, each 3 inches long, attached to       base, the wire                     its
being continuous round the two magnets.          The triangle    at                                      is
               to by

pleasure.     The two wires communicating with the electromag
nets are sufficiently long      allow    the triangle and magnets
                                                 to                 of

 must at no place communicate with one another.      Each edge is
                             Fig. 3.

furnished with a binding-screw, to which               a wire   is attached.
Whenever the ball rests on the groove, the              tinfoil enclosing it
touching each edge completes the electric      connexion between
the two binding-screws, the ball acting as a   bridge along which
the current passes.    At D, and the similar point on the other
side, the two ends of a piece of india-rubber spring are fastened
so that the ball can be grasped by the spring.      When the ball
is pulled up along the groove and then released, the force of the
spring pulls it down and it darts off with a horizontal velocity.
This piece of apparatus may be about seven feet from the ground.
At precisely the same vertical height as C, and at a distance of
some feet, an electromagnet, M, is to be supported.       One wire
from this goes to the battery, the other is fastened to one of the
binding-screws on one edge of AC, the second edge being con
nected with the other pole of the battery.
   As long as the tinned ball P is on the groove, the circuit being
complete, the electromagnet, M, will sustain a second ball R ; but
the moment Pleaves the groove, R is released. Drawing back P
and the spring which embraces it and then releasing          main   it, P
tains the circuit until    arrives
                          it        at   C

 object interposed between B and A, and 1, 2, and 3 a screen

receiving images at the different positions shown, it will be appa
rent on inspection of the diagram that if the object C be moved in
the direction of the dotted line, the shadow will on 1 move in
the same direction as the object, and on 3 in an opposite direc
tion, while on 2 no shadow will be thrown, but the luminous
point B will be reproduced diminished in intensity.       If the lens
be replaced by the refracting media of the eye”, and 1, 2, and 3 be
positions of the retina, it will be evident that with the retina too
near A for distinct vision of B, (1) the motion of the shadow will be
seen in the opposite direction to that of C; and with the retina
too distant (3), it will appear to be in the same direction: with
the retina at 1 the shadow of C will appear inverted with respect
to C; with the retina at 3 it will appear erect. The different
relative positions of the retina may be due to any cause altering
either the refracting media or the figure of the eye, or both, the
diagram being a convenient mode of representation only: e. g.
transfer of the retina to 1 may represent a diminution of the re
fractive power of A, the retina not moving, &c.
   Applying this to optometric purposes, a method is afforded of
determining the effect of accommodation and refraction at any
moment with reference to any luminous point B. To find if the
retina is too near or too distant from the lens for distinct vision,
pass a pin or pen-point past the eye close to the cornea; if no
shadow is seen, the eye is accurately adjusted; if a shadow is
seen and moves    in the same direction as the object, the retina is
too far from the lens; if the shadow be inverted and move in the
opposite direction, too near; if the luminous point be far enough
distant for the rays to be considered parallel, the three cases are
emmetropia, myopia, and hypermetropia respectively.
   The degree of myopia or hypermetropia may be measured by
interposing lenses until the shadow is no longer seen, or lenses
may be applied and the luminous point approached or withdrawn
until the shadow is no longer seen; myopia may be measured
by merely approaching or withdrawing the luminous point         with
                  * A diagrammatic eye for simplicity.

 out the interposition of a lens; but hypermetropia cannot be so
 measured, there being no positive distance at which vision is
 perfect.    If a graduated series of lenses be not at hand, it must
 be first overcorrected by a lens, and then the distance of the
  focus of incident rays adjusted until the shadow is no longer seen.
     If two or more luminous points be used, they are removed
 until the shadows are erect and move in the same direction as
  the object (a convex lens being employed in hypermetropia). The
  object being held near the eye, as many shadows are seen as
 lights employed; the object is now removed until one shadow
 only is seen; the distance at which this occurs, and the effect
 of any lens introduced being known, the distance required may
 be at once arrived at.
     On comparing the methods last referred to with Father Shei
 mer’s method,     I  found in my own case a difference of one inch in
 favour of the proposed method in determining the far point—
 Sheiner's method giving rather more than seven, and the mul
 tiple-shadow method proposed more than eight inches.            I  found,
 in Sheiner’s experiment, that practice enabled me to render the
 object confused after it had apparently reached the far point, and
 that it became again distinct after further removal; but this dis
 tance was that referred to above, and was not the far point; for
                                                   I
 on regarding an approaching point of light, found the distance
 thus obtained agreed with the shadow indication, and exceeded
 therefore the distance given by Sheiner’s experiment.          In some
 hundreds of     experiments     Sheiner's method    invariably    gave a
 shorter  distance;     the interposition  of a concave lens removed
 the far point obtained by the shadow method to twelve inches;
 but that obtained by Sheiner's method under the same circum-
 stances was about an inch less than this distance.
    The method proposed appears to have the following advan
 tages over Father Sheiner’s experiment: it appears more accu
 rate; vision is natural, not being modified by the introduction of
 a diaphragm; it is at once seen what kind of correction is required;
 and the far point may be more readily found.         Most persons ac
 commodate for their far      point only   when actually viewing a dis
tant   object;  and the conditions of Sheiner’s   experiment   are there
 fore unfavourable to the determination of the far point; but no
 unfavourable conditions are introduced in the methods proposed,
 a distant object being viewed.        It also appears superior to the
 use of test-types, being more accurate, showing more certainly
 (to unscientific persons at least) the existence of confusion and
the kind of correction required.          In the last two respects it is
superior to the method recommended by Donders, viz. view
ing a point of light through lenses, the passing of the object
showing at once if perfect adjustment has been arrived at, and,

if not,  the kind of correction required, both of which, without
the application of the shadow method, must be left to trial and
the opinion of the observer, which (particularly in the case of his
being inexperienced) must render the process            -        tedious and the
result more or less inaccurate.
    As the methods described depend on the passing of a shadow
over the field, and are thereby distinguished from other methods
of determination in which the object is regarded directly, I have
called them shadow methods; and                                        I
                                                  suggest the name Shadow
 Optometer as appropriate to such instruments constructed on
 these principles.      The purposes to which the principles described
and    explained    are applicable,   and the manner of applying them,
 are   evident;    the  special   arrangements         in any particular case
 (upon which the accuracy of any method must in a measure de
 pend) will depend on the ingenuity of the experimenter.                       Pos
 session of a    pen-mib   and a set of lenses would enable              any   ordi
 narily intelligent person to find the kind of spectacles he re
 quired    (ifany) with great exactitude             viewing distant street  by            a
 lamp     inthe manner indicated.

XLVII.        On   the Cause    of a Pink Colour in White-Lead Corrosions.
   By WILLIAM BAKER, F.C.S., Associate of                          the Royal School
   of Mines, London*.
IN the
    some contributions to the metallurgy of lead, published in
       Philosophical Magazine in 1862, I attributed a certain
pink tint, occasionally seen in white-lead corrosions, to the pre
sence of small quantities of copper.  As the results of any expe
riments  upon  the corrosion of lead by the combined action of
fermenting bark, acetic-acid vapour, and atmospheric oxygen
can only be arrived at after the expiration of ten weeks or three
months, the progress of further investigation in this matter has
been necessarily slow.            I
                            have been unable to isolate the colour
                       I
ing-matter; but wish to correct the statement that the pink
colour is due to copper, and to detail some conclusive proofs that
it is caused by finely divided silver.
   Having obtained many tons of lead which contained only
traces of copper,       I
                      found in several instances the pink colour
still quite evident in the corrosions.   By the method which had
been employed for refining the metal, there could be only silver
left as an impurity in any perceptible amount.            therefore           I
sought for evidence that this substance could produce such a
result.   Upon analyzing 5000 grains of a perfectly white corro
sion, and one which was distinctly and uniformly pink, the
result showed that the composition of the two samples differed
mainly in the amount of silver:-
                                  CuO.      Fe0.          NiO.          Ag.

   A   small quantity of silver was then added to a portion of the
lead which had produced the white corrosions, and this was again
submitted to the corroding action.           The result was a decided
pink carbonate.       This  synthetical  experiment   was repeated many
times with a like result upon various samples of lead which had
before produced a white carbonate; and                        I
                                                    find that the pink
colour  begins    to show at the     edge  of the metallic portion left

 segregated       out at certain faces of the lead crystals. By the ad
 dition of a small quantity of arsenic or antimony the pink colour
was replaced by a dull purple; and a clear pink tint was only ob
tained when all the oxidizable metals had been removed.
    I come now to the discussion of the state in which the silver
exists to cause a      pink or reddish reflection of light. Silver does
not oxidize under the conditions of exposure to acetic-acid vapour
and oxygen of the air.           Moreover oxide of silver and silver car
bonate     are themselves       decomposed      and reduced to a metallic
state by a heat below that attained in the stacks of fermenting
tan. The silver must consequently be in the metallic state. . As
confirming this statement           I   made the following experiments:—
 Silver carbonate was triturated with white lead and water and
then dried. Upon increasing the temperature, a delicate pink
tint became visible upon the reduction of the oxide of silver. If
a small quantity of silver carbonate be precipitated along with
lead carbonate, the colour upon drying and heating is more uni
form, and it may be obtained exactly resembling the tint seen on
white-lead corrosions.
    The colour of the photographs obtained by means of silver
salts is also evidence in favour of the metallic state of the silver;
and   I  may also adduce the fact that a ray of light, when reflected
ten times from a polished silver surface, is distinctly of a reddish
colour.

       MY    DEAR TYNDALL,                            Geneva, March 31, 1869.
    N thanking you for your letter and the pamphlet you                  sent
       me,    I  take the opportunity of communicating to you an
observation which may interest you.
    Whilst dealing with a different subject,           I was led to consider
whether the blue colour and the absorption of certain rays of light
by water are due to the liquid itself or to the therein suspended
solid particles. This question has been often discussed by others,
as well as by yourself in your work “The Glaciers of the Alps.”
Your memoirs on the polarization of the blue light of the sky
have suggested to me the idea that if the blue colour of the
water be due to suspended solid particles, phenomena of polari
zation will be produced analogous to those observed by you on
the light of the sky.
   The water of the Lake of Geneva, owing to the well-known

beauty of        its     colour,     is     very favourable                   to   investigations         of   this
kind.
   For this purpose had                             very simple apparatus constructed.

 IN Physics”
         his paper on the “Fundamental Principles of Molecular
                     Professor Norton undertakes not only to answer
 my objections against his theory, but also to show, as far as he
 can, that some of my own views on the same subject are question
 able, and others inadmissible.          Having in my last article exa
 mined briefly his system of defence,         I come now to a rapid re
 view of his means of attack.
     The reader, if he has watched attentively the progress of our
 controversy, will have already noticed the striking ability dis
 played by my learned opponent in framing arguments out of
 objections. The last example of such tactics        I have reserved for
 this part of my reply as a natural introduction to what shall    I
 say concerning his other arguments.
    Bulk of atoms.-As Professor Norton had assumed the atom
 of “gross matter’ to be indivisible and spherical in form,            I
took the liberty to object that atoms “indivisible * cannot be
either extended or spherical in form; for “if they were extended
and indivisible, they would be so many pieces of continuous
matter, which we have already proved to be impossible.”
    To this the learned Professor gives no less than six distinct
replies, which I am now going to examine.               The first is as
follows:

     “It is not

as a whole  upon another atom with a certain energy, than of a mere
point acting upon another point, and causing it to change its place,
at the same time transferring to a new point           the properties           all                             it

    Yet have
        I             need   noinsistingof    this point. My objection
                                                            on

it was the best course he could have followed                order     con        in                 to

still remains unanswered.

the atom may in every instance be so inappreciable in comparison
with the distance between the nearest atoms, that there may never
be any inequality of extraneous action on different points of the
same atom, imparting different velocities to them, and so tending to
break up the continuity of the matter.      Besides, we have already
seen that no  inequality  of elementary action, by reason of a differ
ence of distance, is legitimately deducible from Professor Bayma's
premisses.”
   According to this process of reasoning, the nature of the force
of action is supposed, for the sake of the cause to be defended,
to be occult; then, for the sake of the same cause, it is supposed
to be such that the intensity becomes indefinitely small at inde
finitely small distances: lastly it is inferred that, if this suppo
sition be admitted, “gross matter” will be possible, and will
consist of an infinite number of points invariably united.            But
1st. The nature of the active powers of matter is by no means
so occult as to allow of our inventing any law of action we may
be pleased with.      2nd. If the nature of the active powers be
occult, them the new law of action imagined by Professor Norton
has no ground whatever in the nature of things; and on this
account it must be, even in his opinion, “an arbitrary assump
tion.” 3rd. Such a new law is irreconcilable with all mole
cular and non-molecular science: and on this account it is evi
dently antiscientific, as it tends “to discard the obvious intima
tions of nature * and violates the exigencies of the “inductive
method.” 4th. The same hypothetic law leads to the avowed
conclusion that “gross matter” would consist of an infinite
number of material points: which conclusion implies not only
that continuous extension can be made up of unextended points
 (a proposition openly and notoriously false), but also that a
finite being, almost an infinitesimal being, an atom whose size
is inappreciable even in comparison with molecular distances,
which are themselves almost inappreciable, would consist of an
                                                        I
infinity of beings: a proposition, which, make bold to say, not
even Professor Norton, who can conceive so many things, will
be able to realize,      5th. In the same supposition the material
points of which the atom of gross matter is said to be made up
would not be invariably united, being                    all
                                                    compelled          to
                                                                    move
towards the centre       ofthe atom, and           to
                                               vibrate           to
                                                           and fro.   For
those material    points   are      all
                                  supposed          attractive,
                                                    to      be  and actu
 ally to  attract one another; hence they must approach one
 another and move         allaround     central point. And therefore
                                          a

grant the supposition          possible, however much our reason may
                               as

that Professor Norton proves that his fundamental doctrine is
not an “arbitrary assumption” and deserves the name of “esta
blished truth” f
  What he says about the “size” of his atom is directed against
an argument by which                  I
                         proved the impossibility of imparting
motion to a globule of continuous matter (Molecular Mechanics,
pp. 28, 29). Of course, if the size of the atom were smaller
than any assignable finite size, my argument would cease to be
applicable: but then such an atom would be a mere material
point, and gross matter an unreality and an empty name.               But,
if the size of Professor Norton's atoms remains finite, my           argu
ment remains unanswered.            For there will be a finite amount
of  inequality  in the  intensity    of the extraneous actions (espe
cially molecular) on different points of the same atom, impart
ing to them velocities, the difference between which will be
finite and appreciable, and so “tending to break up the conti
nuity of matter.”                 -
    In my “Molecular Mechanics’ I had given (pp. 30, 31) a se
cond and,          I
               think, very conclusive proof of the impossibility of
continuous matter.       The learned Professor says nothing of                                              it,

       am sorry that I interpreted the word “indivisible” contrary
to the now expressed intention of the learned Professor. Cer
tainly, if “gross matter” is to be considered as an aggregation of
a finite number of material points being in either a statical or a
dynamical equilibrium, I allow that                    indivisibility will not   its
imply continuity.           Yet     “gross    matter’

mention this in order to make up for Professor Norton’s silence
on this point.
   The sixth and last answer by which the learned Profes
sor strives to weaken the force of my objection is an explana
tion of the words “spherical in form * applied by him to
his atom of gross matter.      To say that “all bodies of matter
consist of separate indivisible parts called atoms, each of which
is conceived to be spherical in form,” as Professor Norton says
in his 3rd principle, was virtually to say that such atoms were
pieces of continuous matter.    Such at least was my impression.
But he answers:
   “The assumption that each atom is spherical in form was adopted
merely as the simplest embodiment of the fundamental principles
that the action of the atom was equal in all directions, and that the
attractive action upon an atom of aether was neutralized at minute
distances by the resistance developed at the point of contact.     The
existence of such a resistance necessarily implies that the elementary
parts of the attractive atom, whether finite or infinite in number, act
repulsively at very minute distances.”
i    I have      already allowed that, whenProfessor Norton himself
explains the meaning attached by him to his own words, am                                       I
not entitled to contradict him.      It is strange, however, that the
expression “spherical in form * which is drawn from geometry,
and conveys the clear notion of something geometrical only,
should have been in need of an interpretation drawn from me
chanical considerations.      However this anomaly may be ex

The   principle      this: “The attractive action upon

 such minute distances: but when two atoms are                  minute               at   a
 distance, they are not      contact; and therefore,
                                     in                  the attractive        if

of CO2 on Na C*H* O at high temperatures.                Carbonic acid
therefore only forms carbonate of ethylene-sodium when made
to act on the hydrated oxide of ethylene-sodium.
                   Action of Owide of Carbon, CO.
    It is stated in many of the chemical handbooks that carbonic
oxide and ethylate of sodium give propionate of soda. What the
authority may be for this statement I have never been able to
ascertain.     Some years ago several chemists, including myself,
made the crystals of so-called ethylate of sodium and subjected
them to the action of oxide of carbon at 100° C. We were un
 able to observe any formation of propionate of soda.          Another
 statement respecting the action of these substances is that they
 give a pseudo-propiomate of soda, which on treatment with water
 gave formiate of soda and alcohol.
     I have therefore studied the action    of carbonic oxide on the
 hydrated oxide of ethylene-sodium with the special object of as
 certaining whether or not there was formation of a soda-salt.
     I employed 2:032 grims. of sodium, which was dissolved in
 absolute alcohol, and the resulting product heated up to 220°C.
 for some time in a current of dry carbonic oxide.         The weight
 of the   product  after this  exposure  to the action of the gas was
  5'898 grms., being only the unaltered hydrated oxide of ethy
  lene-sodium.     Calculating the percentage of sodium in the pro
  duct from these data, we have Na per cent. = 34°45.                The
  theory for hydrated oxide of ethylene-sodium is Na per cent.
   =33-82. Therefore no absorption of CO takes place even at
  220° C. In further confirmation of this result, water was added
  to the product and a titration made with normal acid. It satu
  rated 82°5 cubic centims. of normal acid, and therefore con
  tained 1897 grim. of sodium in the caustic state—a result
   which confirms the statement that there is no action between
   carbonic oxide and hydrated oxide of ethylene-sodium.
                          Action of Ammonia.
      A  quantitative experiment showed that at 240° C. there is no
   action between hydrated oxide of ethylene-sodium and ammonia.

   The values of the constants u, A, B may be determined by ob
serving the quantities Qi, Q2, Qs of fluid discharged through the
same channel with three different supplies, and therefore three
different depths of the fluid in the channel or values of b.
These constants being determined, the velocities 2, and 2, at
the bottom and sides are known from equation (1).                           That
equation shows the velocity to increase from the bottom to the
surface and from the sides to the centre, which corresponds with
observation.
LIII.   Note on a new Continued Fraction applicable to the Quadra
                ture of the Circle.      By   J. J. SYLVESTER+.
       a recent note inserted by the author in the Philosophical
INMagazine          it was virtually shown, and indeed becomes almost
self-evident    as soon as stated,    that the equation u,41=            º+  ur–1
possesses two particular integrals, 2, 3, which are the products
of a terms of the respective progressions
                  [1,    1,   §,   l,    #,    l,   #,  ...];
                  [1,    3,   1,   #,    1,    3,   1,...].
   Now any continued fraction                 whose    partial    quotients are
}   #y    - - -
                 .. will be equal     to the ratio of some two particular
values of u,     in the above equation, i.e. of two linear functions of
a,  3, ; and in especial when k=1 it will be found very easily that
this fraction is     8.-2:.
                         04:
                                          8.
   But, on supposing         w infinite,  ºf
                                          24.
                                               becomes    equal to the      well
known factorial expression for #, viz. #.            3. 4.    . .  . . . . Hence
we may deduce the following value for               º, under the form of a
continued fraction, viz.
                    Tr         I

      Nowadays most educated people can understand to some extent,
   and are prepared to believe in, oscillations of the land, and can even
   master the idea of the English Channel and the German Ocean having
   enlarged their areas by subsidence within some appreciable period of
   time; such a book as the present gives them proofs enough of this
   having occurred, and supplies much other matter for useful thought.
   The geologist, of course, can accept the facts and conclusions
   readily; for he knows that these changes which have happened in
   the relative level of land and water during historic times are but
   modern repetitions of movements that have long affected this por
   tion of the earth's crust. Some of the results of these normal dis
   turbances of level, in the prehistoric and pliocene periods, have been
  described with scientific accuracy by Mr. R. Godwin-Austen (in the
  Journal of the Geological Society of London, in 1849–51), well
  known among geologists for his mastery of the geography of the past,
  and as a delineator of the old hydrographical conditions of the earth's
  surface, altered again and again by heavings and sinkings of the
  land.    Thanking Mr. Peacock most heartily, therefore, for the valu
  able  repertory  of facts his book presents, we need not be at all
 astonished at the changes that have occurred in North-western
 Europe in the last few centuries, whether ten, twenty, a hundred,
  or more; for already we have learnt from Godwin-Austen's good
  geological observation and reasoning “that the area of the present
 English Channel was in the condition of dry land previous to its
  occupation by the waters of the Pleistocene sea, or during the period
  of the Pliocene (Crag) accumulations of the German basin, and that,
  together with a large area beyond, it served to connect the British
 Islands with France on the south, and Ireland on the west, into a
 tract which had a far greater amount of elevation than any portion
 of it has at present.”     Books and parchments are wanting for these
 long-past pre-historic times, but kitchen-middens and flint imple
 ments, and even human bones, have already supplied some indica
 tions of early man and his occupation of Europe and Britain when at
 an elevation greatly differing from what now exists; and much more
is still to be learnt of this highly interesting subject by careful work
in the line of research that has been followed by Mr. Peacock among
                                                                        -

 On Steam as the Motive Power in Earthquakes and Volcanoes, and on
     Cavities in the Earth's Crust.      By R. A. Peacock, Esq., C.E.
     8vo. Jersey, 1866.
     Bound up with the foregoing, and accompanied with a Preface
dated 1867, is a tract with the title given above.             In it the
well-known fact that the vapour of water is the cause of volcanic
explosions and other phenomena is enthusiastically insisted upon.
The many quotations from observers and writers brought forward in
illustration of this long-accepted theory would delight Woodward,

Mitcheli, and the other old vaporists, were they to rise now amongst
their successors and take part in discussions on the earthquake
question.
   The author offers a new formula for calculating the temperature
of high-pressure steam, and some carefully worked-out tables of tem
peratures and pressures of high-pressure steam, and says (in his
Prospectus), “it has been ascertained that, within known limits at
least, the force of saturated steam increases as the 44-power of the
temperature, this being an enormously rapid ratio of increase.    For
example, the 44-power of the number 10 is equal to 31,622 and
a fraction.   In this way we may understand how melted lava, which
has a temperature of about 3000°Fahr., may, when water gains
access to         it,
               produce steam sufficiently powerful    account for the                to

I      now beg           to   draw the attention                 of   the Royal Society                  to   two

                   of   the   Sky, and           on the        Polarization of Light.                           385
questions glanced at incidentally in the abstract referred to–the blue
colour of the sky, and the polarization of skylight.       Iteserving the
historic treatment of the subject for a more fitting occasion,      would                              I
merely mention now that these questions constitute, in the opinion
of our most eminent authorities, the two great standing enigmas of
meteorology.     Indeed it was the interest manifested in them by Sir
John Herschel, in a letter of singular speculative power, that caused
me to enter upon the consideration of these questions so soon.
   The apparatus with which                           I
                                     work consists, as already stated to
the  Society, of a glass tube about a yard in length, and from 2% to 3
inches in internal diameter. The vapour to be examined is introduced
into this tube in the manner described in my last abstract, and
upon it the condensed beam of the electric lamp is permitted to act
until the neutrality or the activity of the substance has been declared.
   It has hitherto been my aim to render the chemical action of light
upon vapours visible. For this purpose substances have been chosen, \
one at least of whose products of decomposition under light shall have
a boiling-point so high that as soon as the substance is formed it
shall be precipitated. By graduating the quantity of the vapour,
this precipitation may be rendered of any degree of fineness, forming
particles distinguishable by the naked eye, or particles which are
probably far beyond the reach of our highest microscopic powers.
    Ihave no reason to doubt that particles may be thus obtained
whose diameters constitute but a very small fraction of the length of
a wave    of violet light.
    In   all   cases when the vapours                     of
                                               the liquids employed are suffi

cloud-texture has become sufficiently coarse to approximate to that
of ordinary clouds, the rotation of the Nicol ceases to have any sen
 sible effect on the quality of the light discharged normally.
    The perfection of the polarization in a direction perpendicular to
the illuminating beam is also illustrated by the following experiment.
A Nicol's prism large enough to embrace the entire beam of the
electric lamp was placed between the lamp and the experimental
tube. A few bubbles of air carried through the liquid nitrite of butyl
were introduced into the tube, and they were followed by about 3
inches (measured by the mercurial gauge) of air which had been
 passed through aqueous hydrochloric acid.               Sending the polarized
 beam     through   the tube,  I placed   myself   in front of     my eye being                               it,

          had noticed, as before stated, that as the clouds formed in the
    experimental tube became denser, the polarization of the light dis
    charged at right angles to the beam became weaker, the direction of
    maximum polarization becoming oblique to the beam. Experiments
    on the fumes of chloride of ammonium gave me also reason to sus
    pect that the position of the neutral point was not constant, but that
    it varied with the density of the illuminated fumes.
       The examination of these questions led to the following new and
    remarkable results:—The laboratory being well filled with the fumes
    of incense, and sufficient time being allowed for their uniform diffu
    sion, the electric beam was sent through the smoke.          From the track
    of the beam polarized light was discharged, but the direction of
    maximum polarization, instead of being along the normal, now en
    closed an angle of 12° or 13° with the axis of the beam.

twists the plane of polarization 90°. On these and kindred points
experiments are still in progress*.
    The idea that the colour of the sky is due to the action of finely
divided matter, rendering the atmosphere a turbid medium through
which we look at the darkness of space, dates as far back as Leonardo
da Vinci.      Newton conceived the colour to be due to exceedingly
small water particles acting as thin plates.               Goethe's experiments in
 connexion with this      subject  are well known and exceedingly instruc
 tive. One     very   striking   observation of Goethe's referred to what is
 technically called “chill” by painters, which is due no doubt to
 extremely fine varnish particles interposed between the eye and a dark
 background.       Clausius, in two very able memoirs, endeavoured to
 connect the colours of the sky with suspended water vesicles, and to
 show that the important observations of Forbes on condensing steam
 could also be thus accounted for. Brücke's experiments on preci
 pitated mastic were referred to in my last abstract.                Helmholtz has
 ascribed the blueness of the eyes to the action of suspended particles.
 In an article written nearly mine years ago by myself, the colours of
 the peat-smoke of the cabins of Killarneyt and the colours of the
 sky were referred to one and the same cause, while a chapter of the
 “Glaciers of the Alps,’ published in 1860, is also devoted to this
 question.      Roscoe, in connexion with his truly beautiful experiments
 on the photographic power of sky-light, has also given various in
 stances of the production of colour by suspended particles.                  In the
 foregoing experiments the azure was produced in air, and exhibited a
 depth and purity far surpassing anything that                  I have ever seen in
 mote-filled liquids.      Its polarization, moreover, was perfect.
    In his experiments on fluorescence Professor Stokes had conti
 mually to separate the light reflected from the motes suspended in
 his liquids (the action of which he named “false dispersion”) from
 the fluorescent light of the same liquids (which he ascribed to “true
 dispersion”). In fact it is hardly possible to obtain a liquid without
 motes, which polarize by reflection the light falling upon them, truly
 dispersed light being unpolarized.           At p. 530 of his celebrated me
 moir “On the       Change     of the   Refrangibility      of Light,” Prof. Stokes
 adduces some significant facts, and makes some noteworthy remarks,
 which bear upon our present subject.               He notices more particularly
 a specimen of plate glass which, seen by reflected light, exhibited a
 blue which was exceedingly like an effect of fluorescence, but which,
 when properly examined, was found to be an instance of false dis
 persion.     “It   often struck me,” he writes, “while engaged in these
  observations, that when the beam had a continuous appearance the
 polarization was more nearly perfect than when it was sparkling, so
    * Sir John Herschel has suggested to me that this change of the polarization
 from positive to negative may indicate a change from polarization by reflection to
 polarization by refraction. This thought repeatedly occurred to Ine while looking
 at the effects; but it will require much following up before it emerges into
 clearness.
    t I have sometimes quenched almost completely, by a Nicol, the light dis
 charged mormally from burning leaves in Hyde Park.           The blue smoke from the
 ignited end of a cigar polarizes also, but not perfectly.

 as to force on the mind the conviction               that it arose merely from
 motes”. Indeed in the former case the polarization has often appeared
 perfect, or             all
                     but perfect.           possible that this may

F.R.S.E.
    Chemists have long endeavoured to answer the question, What
is the relation in which the constituents stand to one another in a
compound 2 and numerous hypotheses, more or less ingenious, have
been devised for this purpose.           Two of these modes of representing
chemical     phenomena     occupy     so prominent a place in the history of
the science as to merit       special  notice, even in so slight and hurried
a sketch as this must be.           These are, 1st, the Electro-chemical and
Radical Theory; and 2nd, the Theory of Atomicity and Chemical
Structure.
    The first was the product of the genius, learning, and laborious
research of Berzelius; it was soon adopted by                         chemists, and        all

    The Theory of Atomicity regards chemical phenomena from an
 altogether different point of view.          In it the various substances are
 considered as modifications of one another rather than as compounds.
The rise of this mode of viewing chemical phenomena may be traced
 from the early papers by Dumas, and by Laurent, on Substitution.
 It appears more prominently in the position given to double de
 composition as the representative of all chemical action, by Laurent
and Gerhardt, in the types of Gerhardt and Williamson, in Frank
 land's theory of the organo-metallic bodies, and in                   extension             its                        by

   From this examination of chemical exchange, it will be obvious
that no operation of this kind can produce a change in the “atomi
city” of an atom; for every relation ruptured a new one is en
tered into.    But we have no reason to suppose that all chemical
action is of this kind ; and there are numerous phenomena which it
is very difficult to explain, except by the assumption that there is an
other kind of chemical action, in which the number of relations of
an atom is increased or diminished.         Such actions are those by
which we pass from one series of compounds to another.         Thus the
ferrous salts are connected together by processes of exchange ; but
it is only by making new hypotheses that we can thus explain the
passage from the ferrous to the ferric salts.    Similar relations exist
between the manganous salts, the manganic salts, the manganates,
and the permanganates, where a consideration of each group, apart
from the others, would lead us to a different atomicity for manga

pressure.
    Such comparisons            boiling-points have been made, and from
                                  of
them have been          deduced,  especially       Kopp,      seriesby    very in       a               of
teresting and certainly not fortuitous coincidences.                  That dis
tinguished chemist and physicist has shown that,                       very large              in   a

             Dr. A. Crum Brown on Chemical Constitution.             399
number of instances, the change of chemical structure produces
nearly the same change of boiling-point. These “laws” of Kopp
are only approximate, and are not even approximate in the cases
where the boiling-points of the substances compared are very dif
ferently changed by change of pressure.
    Turning to the other physical character which has been mentioned,
namely, colour, we see at once a marked regularity.            As a rule,
substances     belonging   to the same series differ from one another in
degree rather than in kind of colour; while in passing from one
series to another, we observe that the colour undergoes a total change
of character. This is well illustrated by comparing the colours of
substances belonging to such series as the ferrous salts, the ferric
salts, the ferrates—the manganous salts, the manganic salts, the
manganates and the permanganates—the cupreous and cupric salts,
the chromous and chromic salts, the chromates and perchromic acid.
Possibly such changes of colour as we see in the transformation of
rosaniline and its derivatives into leukaniline and analogous bodies,
and of blue into white indigo, may be cases of the same kind. It is
 also interesting to note that, while the nitro-substitution    products
 of the aromatic series are generally yellow, all the known substances
 of the same kind in the fatty series are colourless.
    These considerations of colour would naturally incline us to re
 gard the operations which lead from one series to another as dif
ferent in kind from those which lead from one member to another of
 the same series; and when we examine the physiological action of
 bodies of the same and of different series, this impression is greatly
strengthened.
    The speaker described in some detail a few of the observations
 made within the last two years by Dr. T. R. Fraser and himself,
 pointing out the similarity of the action of substances belonging to
 the same series, and the remarkable change of physiological action
 produced by those chemical changes which lead from one series to
 another.     The illustrations were drawn from the natural alkaloids
 (a  group  of substances containing trebly related nitrogen), and those
 derivatives of the alkaloids which contain fivefold-related nitrogen.
 It was shown that the salts of the alkaloids, although containing
 fivefold-related nitrogen, were not adapted for this comparison, on
 account of the readiness with which they lose acid in the presence
 of alkaline substances, their nitrogen thus returning to the trebly
 related condition.     The bodies formed by the addition of a com
 pound of methyl have not this disadvantage; and as the nitrogen
 in them is permanently fivefold-related, their physiological action
 may be satisfactorily compared with that of the alkaloids them
 selves.
    The experiments leading to a knowledge of the action of strychnia
 and of the salts of methyl-strychnium       were described; and it was
 shown that while the former acts by exciting the origins of the motor
 nerves in the spinal cord, the latter act by diminishing the action and
 ultimately paralyzing the terminations of the same nerves in the
 muscles. Similar relations exist between brucia and methyl-brucium,
 thebaia and the salts of methyl-thebaium, morphia and the salts of

400                 Intelligence         and Miscellaneous                     Articles.
methyl-morphium,      &c.    Indeed it may be stated generally that, as
far as observation goes, compounds of trebly related nitrogen exert
an action totally different in kind from similar compounds of five
fold-related nitrogen, that a similar difference exists between the
triatomic and pentatomic compounds of other members of the nitro
gen family, and that this principle appears to be of still wider, and
probably general application.
   The speaker, in conclusion, drew attention to the peculiar interest
attaching to those regions of science which                the frontiers be    lie     on
                                                                all on

would depend the ultimate fusion                        of as

erect image showing the whole building.       Over Boulogne, in the
air, were two images of the double funnels and the mast of a tug
boat, the lower image being erect and the upper inverted, the two
lines of smoke bending, the one upwards and the other downwards,
and both towards the W., till they joined together. The only tug
boat near Boulogne at the time, so far as I could learn, was in the
harbour.    The cathedral was plainly visible, but only gave a single
image.     Towards the S.W., and beyond the French coast, some
fishing-luggers were observed hull down, so that the position of the
horizon could be ascertained; up to 3 o'clock they presented no un
usual appearance; but over these were pairs of images of vessels
which ordinarily would have been invisible.       In some instances
three and even four pairs could be observed placed in a vertical line,
 the lower image in each pair being inverted.     With the exception
of the uppermost pair, the images seemed to represent the maintop
gallant sail only, and that considerably elongated; but the highest
erect image showed the mizen- and the fore masts and the jib, but
in no instance could the hulls be seen.     In all cases the inverted
images were of about twice the height of the erect.      Soon after 3
 o'clock vessels between the observer and the horizon began to be
affected. The Warne light-ship, which is about 84 miles from the
English coast, had her mast-flagstaff and stanchions elongated to
some three times their proper length : this effect lasted for about ten
minutes, when they shrank to less than half their usual size, and
the hull began to rise till it was nearly as high as it was long, and
formed a most conspicuous object even to the naked eye.                   then           I
looked towards Dover: the pier seemed completely disorganized;
it appeared to be divided in half longitudinally, with the sea in the
midst, and the stone coping moved as if huge waves were agitating
it.    A steam-boat entering Dover harbour was shrunk               less than  to
half her proper vertical dimensions, but elongated horizontally.
Captain Paull,      the S.E.R. steam-boat ‘Napoleon III.,’ crossed the
                      of
Channel between the hours              and 4; and he told me that he saw

with certainty be stated. Experiments have shown that any excess

ance of a tail to the comet.     If the shape of the comet be irregular
there may be more than one tail. The comet after its perihelion
passage recedes from the sun and at the same time gradually cools
and contracts; the tail therefore ought to be greatest and brightest
at or shortly after the perihelion, and then slowly diminish and fade
away.    This is in accordance with observation.

      GENTLEMEN,
   In the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine Professor Tyn
dall has propounded the theory that the visible head and tail of a
comet is an actinic cloud, resulting from the decomposition of vapour
by the solar light. This theory accounts for the extreme tenuity of
comets, their polarization, and the motion and development of their
tails.
   Now if all our knowledge of comets were derivable from observa
tions with the unassisted eye, this theory would account for the ob
served phenomena; and, as it                  is,
                                           valuable it   increasing our

                           a      Also the matter which forms the tail
usually streams out from the head towards the sun; this was especi
ally noticed      Halley's comet
                      in                1836. inBond also, speaking                              of
Donati's  comet,  says,   “the material, after being  thrown off from the
nucleus, instead          once being driven into the tail, formed
                            of   at                                 dense                    a

                                  in
issuing from other envelopes, formed the two branches          the tail.”          of
Then, too, we have several series        envelopes which rise up towards
                                                of

line exactly corresponding to the dark line F ; and Hy a bluish
violet line which corresponds to a delicate dark line just in front
of G ; this M. Angström<U+017F> also designated as belonging to hy

406                     M. A. Wüllner                  on the Spectra      of
refracting angle with great dispersive power, and through a tele
scope of about twelvefold magnifying-power, this field is resolved
into about from fourteen to sixteen bright dark-edged and beau
tifully shaded bands, which are red, orange, yellow to yellowish
green. With different hydrogen-tubes this part is seen of differ
ent degrees of brightness, so that Plücker originally ascribed it to
the last traces of air still present in the tubes.
   Plücker subsequently recognized that this part of the spectrum
also belonged to hydrogen.        In an investigation made with M.
Hittorf on the     spectra   of  ignited  gases and vapours”, they
show that several elements, as      nitrogen  and sulphur, have two
different spectra—a continuous one with shaded bands, and one
consisting of bright lines separated more or less by dark spaces;
these are designated by them as spectra of the first and of the
second order.    In this investigation they describe this bright field
as a special spectrum  of hydrogen of a peculiar character. Plücker
says there, in reference to this spectrum:-“In an old spectrum
tube which contained very rarefied hydrogen, the ground against
which the three characteristic lines stand out is not always of the
same degreedf darkness; sometimes new and brilliant lines appear,
especially near the sodium-line. We confirmed the existence of
a new hydrogen spectrum, which corresponds to a lower tempe
rature, but exhibits no similarity to   the other spectra     all

essentially at the blue end which is so characteristic of nitrogen.
The first observation, which I communicated in 1866 at the May
meeting of the Niederrheinische Gesellschaft für Natur- und
Heilkunde, was an accidental one. In an experimental investi
gation on the relation between the refractive indices and the
 densities of bodies,                       I
                         used in determining the refractive indices
the spectrum of ignited hydrogen consisting of the three bright
lines. On this occasion a hydrogen-tube, which had previously
been used for frequent measurements, became one day suddenly
altered:       previous beautiful red light became white; the violet
                    its
line disappeared        the spectrum; and instead
                                     in                  the former                             of
spectrum      continuous one was formed
                   a                         which, especially  the                                        in
green, was most beautifully shaded. The first supposition, that
the tube had begun        leak and had admitted some air, was seen
                                            to
to      be

nitrogen, and       further experiments which had for their object
                              in

as  spectrum the three well-known bright lines only. Hence                                                       it
was established that, under circumstances which     yet were not                               as
determinable, hydrogen could furnish     continuous spectrum.               a

408                M. A. Wüllner    on the Spectra of
    To the reddish-yellow part succeeds, first of all, a feebly  illu
 minated green field bounded on the right by a brighter green
 band. Then follows, as far as the line H 8, which always remains
 visible, a beautiful green multifariously shaded field, which by its
 shading and the bright bands standing out from the darker back
 ground, four of them being particularly bright, makes quite a
 stereoscopic impression. The character of this part is so like
 that of the green in the first nitrogen-spectrum, that only a
 closely detailed comparison makes the difference perceptible.
     From H 8 on the blue side, the spectrum reaches to about the
 middle of the space between H 8 and Hy; and here also against
 the faint blue ground four brighter bands stand out, of which
 the second and the fourth are the brightest. Hºy can only be
 occasionally faintly seen.
     I have  since then observed just the same spectrum in a tole
 rable number of other hydrogen-spectrum-tubes when, after
 being for a long time used with a well-working induction-appa
 ratus, they were illuminated by a feebler current.
    The observation of MM. Plücker and Hittorf, that continuous
 spectra of the first order belong to a lower temperature than the
 spectra of the second order (consisting of individual bright lines),
 led to the supposition that this spectrum also belonged to a
 lower temperature, which might result from the circumstance
 that, after lengthened use (perhaps through partial melting of
 the electrodes), the induction-current on entering the gas met
 with a greater resistance.    If  this supposition were correct, the
 method    already  adopted  by  Plücker and Hittorf for producing
 the second spectra (the simultaneous interposition of a Leyden
jar into the current of the induction-apparatus) must also again
 produce the spectrum of hydrogen consisting of the characteristic
lines. This supposition was so far confirmed that, on introdu
cing a Leyden jar, the above-mentioned spectrum-tube exhibited
a flickering, alternately red and white light, and that, viewing
the flickering up of the red light with the spectrometer, the well
known three lines were observed.
    The change of the continuous spectrum into that consisting
of the three lines was effected with the aid of Holtz's machine.
If  the current of such a machine without a condenser was allowed
to pass through the hydrogen-tubes, their light appeared white,
and, viewed with the spectrometer, the continuous spectrum ap
peared, though faint, yet distinct, especially in the green.        If
the condenser was laid upon the machine, so that the spark tra
versed the tube in individual discharges, the light of the tube at
once became red and exhibited only the characteristic lines. The
same was of course seen when, by means of a Holtz’s machine,
the discharges of a small Leyden jar with a small striking-dis

                        certain Gases in Geissler’s Tubes.                                               409
tance were allowed in quick succession to pass through the tube.
By these discharges the resistance in the tube appeared even to
be permanently diminished; for shortly afterwards the simple
induction-current of the small Ruhmkorff, passed through, again
produced the red light of hydrogen, which, however, again
changed into the white one with a continuous spectrum when
the current had passed for about a quarter of an hour through
the tube.
   3. After it had thus been established that the light of ignited
hydrogen, according to                 its
                            different temperatures, which depend
 on the mode           of
                 discharge,  might       different,   was   be  ex                  it         to   be

pected that there would                    a
same discharge, the density       the gas        of
                                              the tube varied.   To
                                                                 in

with Dr. Bettendorff, which not only confirmed        but also gave                 it,
a new spectrum quite different from the preceding ones.

               the spectrometer    spectrum-tube was fixed, which
                                                  a

the spectrum     of
                 the hydrogen-tube exhibited oxygen-lines when the oxygen
was collected and thus the acidulated water saturated with oxygen was
allowed   topress out       of
                        the tube surrounding the anode and mix with the
other liquid.   The absorbed oxygen which then, diffused throughout the
entire apparatus, escaped over the cathode was quite enough     produce                   to              in
the  spectrum the most distinct oxygen-lines.

410              M. A. Wüllner    on the Spectra   of
being gradually exhausted, the pressure of the enclosed gas being
read off on the mercurial column of the pump.
   In this way it was found that the current of the small induc
tion-coil can, under a pressure of 135 millims., strike across the
tubes, the electrodes of which are 1:4 decim. apart; the tube
shines with a white light, the intensity of which is too small to
analyze it prismatically.
   When the pressure of the enclosed gas is diminished, the
brightness of the light steadily increases, and under a pressure
of 100 millims, it is bright enough to be investigated with the
prism.    Under this pressure the light of the tube is bluish
white, and sometimes it appears for a moment reddish-tinged.
It gives a continuous spectrum, upon which, when the light ap
pears reddish, the bright lines H 2 and H 8 distinctly stand out.
   Under a pressure of 70 millims. the light of the gas is reddish
white, and in the spectrometer the continuous hydrogen-spec
trum is seen as above described.      It shows first of all H. 2; as
far as half the distance between H & and D the field of view is
dark; then follows a reddish-yellow to a greenish-yellow part,
consisting of a series of beautifully shaded bands; then another
dark one, and then as far as H 8 a feebly bright green field, on
which four brighter green bands stand out. Behind H 8, as far
as Hy, the field of view is illuminated by a feeble blue light, in
which two bands stand out more brightly—the first at 0.3 of
the distance H 8 to Hy behind H 8, the second in the middle
between these lines.
   If the pressure be further diminished, the light in the tube
increases in brightness, the colour becomes redder, and the spec
trum continually more beautiful. Even under a pressure of 52
millims. the spectrum is developed just as has been already de
scribed; it becomes brighter and more beautiful as the gas is
still further rarefied, until the pressure amounts to about 30 mil
lims., at which the spectrum appears extremely brilliant.
   On further rarefaction the brightness of the continuous spec
trum decreases, while the three hydrogen-lines become continually
brighter.    Under a pressure of 21 millims. the lines H 2, H 8,
Hy were very beautiful, the reddish-yellow part of the continuous
spectrum also beautiful, but the green part of the spectrum much
enfeebled, only the bright bands in them being visible.         Near
H 8, towards the more refrangible side, only the two brightest
                                                                      *.
lines could be recognized.
   Under a pressure of 10 millims. the reddish-yellow part could
still be seen in   its  brightest bands;   in  the green, individual
bands were still    faintly indicated;  beyond  H  8  scarcelya band
was visible.
   Under pressure
          a          of  6  millims, the reddish-yellow part was just

                 certain Gases in Geissler’s  Tubes.              4ll
visible, besides the characteristic hydrogen-lines; at two places
in the green a bright glow was to be seen; and also between H 8
and Hy the two previously mentioned bright bands were              vi
sible.
    On further rarefaction to 3 or 2 millims. the characteristic
lines retained the same brightness, and everything else disap
peared almost entirely from the spectrum; yet, with a simulta
neous enfeeblement of the bright lines, part of the continuous
spectrum reappeared in the green, in the form of about five bright
fields, when the gas was rarefied to fractions of a millimetre pres
sure. These observations show that the hydrogen-spectrum de
scribed belongs, in fact, to a lower temperature than that consist
ing of the three lines; for with increasing density of the gas in the
spectrum-tube the temperature must become lower, since the
induction-current experiences a greater resistance in the denser
gas, and a larger quantity of the gas has to be heated.          But,
just as a great density of the gas does not permit the full inten
sity of the current to be developed, so the current is also enfeebled
by great rarefaction; for by adequate rarefaction the current in a
 spectrum-tube may be completely stopped.            The occurrence,
therefore, of the continuous spectrum both with greater density
and with greater tenuity of the gas proves that it belongs to a
lower temperature.
   4. By the experiments communicated in the preceding, the proof
has been furnished that the continuous hydrogen-spectrum be
longs to a lower temperature; and the question arises how it hap
pens that Geissler's spectrum-tubes,       which contain hydrogen
under a pressure of from 5 to 10 millims. (a pressure favourable,
therefore, for producing the line-spectrum), yet after some time,
after lengthened use, may yield the continuous spectrum.         The
observation that this spectrum is especially seen when, after
lengthened use, the tube is exposed to the action of a feebler
 current, led to the supposition that (possibly owing to a super
ficial melting of the electrodes) greater resistance was offered to
the passage of the induction-current.      That such a fusion of the
 electrodes has an influence of that kind was established by a
 series of experiments.     In the extreme degrees of exhaustion
 mentioned above, and which are to be subsequently discussed,
 the resistance in the spectrum-tubes was so great that the whole
 of the positive electrode became incandescent.        It thereby be
 came quite bent, and after some time was partially fused, so that
 it looked like a series of small pearls on a thread. After this de
formation of the electrodes had occurred, the tube, on gradual ex
 haustion of the hydrogen, always exhibited the continuous spec
trum, even under pressures at which the green light was other
wise scarcely visible. The continuous spectrum was extremely bril

412                        M. A. Wüllner             on the Spectra          of
liant under  a pressure of 30 millims., 21 millims., 16 millims. ;
and even under a pressure of 8 millims. it was doubtful whether
the continuous part was really fainter, or whether it only ap
peared so in comparison with the dazzling lustre of the line H 8.
   Several observations which we made on a phosphorus-tube and
a sulphur-tube,   prepared by Dr.Geissler, favour, I think, the view
that the nature of the electrodes exerts an influence on the pro
duction of the continuous spectrum.       These tubes also contained
hydrogen.     If the induction-current was allowed to pass without
heating the tubes to the melting-point of phosphorus or of sul
phur, they exhibited a beautiful continuous spectrum exactly as
has been previously described; the spectrum of phosphorus or
sulphur only appeared on stronger heating. In these tubes the
electrodes are always more or less covered with phosphorus or
sulphur, by which, since these substances do not conduct, the
resistance to be overcome is greater, and therefore the intensity
of the current must be less.
   5. It has already been mentioned, in § 3, that when the pres
sure of the gas in the tube only amounted to fractions of a milli
metre the continuous spectrum of hydrogen was again formed,
particularly in the green.                      If
                                   the tube was then still further
exhausted by means of the Sprengel’s pump, the light in the
tube first became feebler and                    its
                                     colour paler; and         the spec                in
trum, while          all
                  the rest was weakened,    the  green  part  stood out
still more beautifully.       appears  It the form        in beautifully     of    six
shaded bright bands, which are connected with each other             less                         by
bright intermediate spaces.         the  brightest

some sulphuric-acid vapour had entered the tube.
   Our spectrum cannot be confounded with that of phosphorus
or mercury, as follows from Plücker’s descriptions, and as we
have convinced ourselves by experiments.      Phosphorus exhibits
in the green only one group of bright lines, about 8' broad, the
most refrangible of which has the minimal deviation of 63° 38'.
The mercury-spectrum consists of a series of bands, of which a
yellow one is particularly characteristic; moreover, in a tube
containing mercury, this spectrum
                             -      is only formed when the tube
is considerably heated.
   To compare the spectrum in question with that of aluminium,
wires of this metal were fastened to the ends of the wires leading
to the induction-apparatus, and the induction-spark was allowed
to strike between these, which were placed in front of the slit of
the spectrometer.      It was then observed that, according to the
distance of the   electrodes, the aluminium-vapour might have two
essentially different spectra. When the distance of the electrodes
was only about two millims., the spectrum consisted of four
green splendidly shaded fields. The fields are brightest on the
more refrangible side, and gradually diminish towards the less
refrangible side; at distances of 5 minutes these fields are tra
versed by sharp bright lines, and these give quite the appear
ance of fluting to the fields. The right limit of these fields was
found, in the minimum deflection, at :—

   8. The spectrum which a Geissler’s tube filled with pure oxy
gen gives consists, according to Plücker's% description, of a
series of bright lines, the least refrangible of which lies in the red
orange, and which, more or less close, extend thence to the violet.
Plücker described only this one spectrum, and in the subsequent
investigation, made in common with M. Hittorf, obtained only
the same. In communicating these experiments he saysf:—
“We obtained only one spectrum of oxygen working in the
same manner as with nitrogen, with this difference, that under
the same circumstances an equally brilliant spectrum was only
obtained with a stronger discharge.          He further states that,
especially in oxygen, the gradual appearance of the bright lines is
noticeable—that at first the least refrangible show themselves, and
at last as the temperature rises the most refrangible come out—
that a drawing, therefore, which represents as simultaneously
appearing those lines which are only successively formed, gives an
ideal picture of the spectrum rather than accords with nature.
   The experiments previously communicated on the spectra of
hydrogen, the observation that the spectrum may materially alter
with the density of the gas and the mode of discharge, led me to
investigate oxygen in this direction.
   The method of experiment was the same as that described in
§ 3. The lateral tube of such a spectrum-tube as is there de
scribed was connected with the tube placed over the anode of the
apparatus for decomposing water.        In order to dry the oxygen
supplied, a tube containing phosphoric acid and a bulb filled with
strong sulphuric acid were interposed.      The production of a per
fectly pure oxygen-spectrum, however, is almost always attended
with great difficulties; the three characteristic lines of hydrogen
were almost always observed, arising from the moisture condensed
on the inside of the spectrum-tube.       It could, however, be ex
pelled by strongly heating the spectrum-tube and then repeat
edly drawing pure oxygen through                it.

4.18             M. A. Wüllner    on the Spectra       of
same dimensions as had been used for the experiments with hy
drogen, the density of the gas had to be much smaller to allow
the current of the same induction-coil to pass through when the
same number of elements were used. While hydrogen allowed
the current to pass even under a pressure of 135 millims, several
experiments showed that with oxygen continuous passage only
took place when the pressure was diminished to 45 or 47 millims.
The light is whitish, but far too weak for a spectrum-investiga
tion; this was only possible when the density was diminished to
28 or 30 millims.    The light appears even then whitish-coloured.
The  spectrum   presents six bright lines—a red line (the flesh-red
one characteristic of oxygen and designated by Plücker O 2),
two green and two blue lines, and a violet one. The brightest
have then the following positions of least deviation          :-

After a longer passage of the current, the second red line               in
dicated by Plücker is recognized.
   When the pressure is diminished to 25 millims. the tube still
shines with a whitish light, the brightness of which, however, has
greatly increased.   Besides those previously observed, there are
seen in the spectrum three fainter green lines, at about 64° least
deviation. Under a pressure of 18 to 20 millims. the colour of
the light somewhat passes into violet, the brightness is increased;
there appear besides the former lines two orange-coloured ones,
two very faint yellowish green, a faint blue, at about 65° 10',
and a faint violet line at the end of the spectrum.
   The pressure being diminished to 6 millims., some new lines
occur—a bluish green, and a violet which is somewhat further
deflected than those previously mentioned.
   At the same time the background on which the lines stand
out no longer appears quite dark, but here and there distinctly
continuously illuminated.      Such a continuous field probably
forms the background against which the previously mentioned
three faint green lines at about 64° are formed.
   Without these lines disappearing, the continuously illuminated
fields stand out more distinctly when the pressure is further di
minished; and when it only amounts to fractions of a milli
metre, the background of the spectrum has become changed into
a spectrum of the first order, consisting of several beautifully
shaded fields.   The colour of the light has become more green;
and in accordance with this the continuously illuminated parts
 lie  the green and
       in              inthe blue.
   The first, very faint yellowish part appears        just   on   the right

seen, sharply defined on the left, and gradually shading off on the
right, among the yellowish-green lines which appear under a
pressure of 20 millims.
    On the right of the bright-green line at 63°28', and sepa
rated from this by a dark space, there is a splendid green field
consisting of several beautifully shaded bands. It has a simi
larity to the violet part of the nitrogen-spectrum, inasmuch as                                                 its
individual parts are brightest and most sharply defined             the                                    on

   12.   If the condenser    be placed upon Holtz's machine, the conti
nuous spectrum       changes at one stroke into the line-spectrum :
groups of lines stand out in places which were previously dark;
the bright fields split up; and on the field (2), for instance, bright
lines start out right and left of the brightest part, while the
brightest part itself becomes dark.
    The colour of the light becomes bluish green.
    The positions of the individual groups of lines are, from several
concordant measurements, the following:—
    1st group of lines, left boundary              .   .    .  .  63 li  20
               93           right boundary         .   .    .  .  63 19 30
    The right boundary is formed by a very bright line about 3'
 distant from the preceding.
tº  2nd group of lines, left boundary               .  .     . .  63 47 30
       In the middle a    very  large    bright   double line.    63 58 00
                              Right boundary            .    .  . 64 8 40
    This group is formed from the green field which was before
 designated as (2); it gives the impression that the brightest part
 has been torn asunder at the left limit and separated into indi
 vidual lines.
    3rd group, of six lines         .   .   between 64° 37' and 64° 46'
    The right boundary is the brightest.
    4th group of lines. It starts from the field
        designated in the preceding section as (3),
        yet in such a manner that the brightness of
        the lines increases towards the more refran
        gible side; the brightness has thus a distri
        bution the reverse of what it has in the con
        tinuously illuminated field. The left limit of
        this group cannot, therefore, be quite sharply
        determined; several measurements furnished
        values between 64° 58' and 65°; so that the
        beginning of this group does not coincide
        with that of the bright field. The right                   o  /    II

       however, cannot be arranged in groups, and are not of great

       A bright violet       line . . . . . . . at 67 36 30
  If  the discharges of a small Leyden jar be passed through a
Geissler's tube filled with highly rarefied oxygen, just the same
spectrum is obtained; with a stronger charge it becomes more
brilliant without otherwise changing.
   When the spectrum obtained with a Holtz's machine is com
pared with that described in § 9 as obtained with the Ruhmkorff’s
coil, it is at once seen that both are identical, although, owing to
the greater brightness in individual groups with the Holtz's
machine, a few lines become visible which could not be seen in the
former case.
    It therefore follows that in this case, as also with hydrogen,
three distinct spectra may be obtained with induction-currents,
according as the gas in the tube has greater or less density. That
this difference in the spectra is solely due to the different tem
 peratures of the gas follows from the experiments with the Holtz's
 machine.       The same considerations which in § 7 led to the
 continuous spectrum being regarded as that corresponding to
 the lower temperature, and that consisting of groups of lines as
 corresponding to the highest temperature, lead here to the same
 conclusion. The continuous spectrum belongs to the lowest
 temperature (although it is not seen with gas of great density),
 because it is formed by the continuous discharge of the Holtz's
 machine.     The spectrum described by Plücker, which with gas of
 suitable density may also be produced in                      its
                                                    essential features
 with the small Ruhmkorff's     apparatus, belongs        higher tem  to
                                                                       a
 perature.  .  The last mentioned, which     attained with gas
                                                      is           the              of

                              the Ruhmkorff's coil and         Leyden       of  a
jar, belongs therefore      the highest temperature.

    Using the same induction-apparatus as in the previous expe
riments, the current just began to pass through the tube filled
with air when the pressure was 94 millims; yet the light was
not continuous.      A continuous passage of the current only oc
curred when the     pressure  was diminished to 64 millims, though
the luminous     intensity  was so small that a prismatic investiga
tion of the light was not possible.        On a further diminution of
the  pressure, the  brightness of the  light  gradually increases; and
under a pressure of 46 millims. the luminous intensity is ade
quate for spectrum-investigation.         The less refrangible parts of
the   spectrum  in the red and   yellow   are barely visible; only from
the green is the spectrum     distinctly   present; most beautiful are
the violet parts, which are so characteristic of the nitrogen
spectrum.
    The red and yellow parts occur first under a pressure of 30
 millims. ; but they are so faint, that the shaded bands which
 Plücker has described in the nitrogen-spectrum of the first order
 are at most scarcely perceptible.       The green part with         rich                   its
 shading stands out more; but the blue and the violet are the
 most beautiful;        them the individual flutings are completely
                            in
developed.

the many astonishing discoveries made during the course of
these investigations, probably the most remarkable is the occlu
sion of hydrogen by palladium. This metal, whether in the form
of sponge or hammered foil, when heated and cooled in an atmo
sphere of hydrogen, absorbed between six and seven hundred
times     its
           volume, increasing                           to

nature of the  gaseous  state, on the other   hand, is in no need of
a limit of expansion; for if we grant, out of deference to Pro
fessor Norton’s opinion, that the molecules of hydrogen instead
of having a limit of expansion can expand indefinitely, what in
the world would prevent such hydrogen from being a highly
gaseous substance       Surely, it would not cease to be an expan

permanent substances,           that their molecules, though perma

434              Prof.  J. Bayma on the Fundamental
matter” has nothing to do with my conceptions, and is the ex
                                              I
clusive property of my learned critic, as have made clear on a
previous occasion.       If however by gross molecules he means
molecules of    ponderable   bodies having the constitution which  I
pointed out in my treatise, then I allow (though protesting
against the epithet “gross”) that the heat of such bodies con
sists in vibrations of such molecules.       I do not know just now
what “insuperable objection” the learned Professor will urge
against this view on another occasion: when those objections
arrive, we may think of them.          Meanwhile an objection which
my opponent,       I  fear, will not solve is the following.    The
learned critic, while defending his three forms of matter, de
clared emphatically that my repulsive envelope is essentially his
 “electric aether,” and consequently that my repulsive envelope is
not his “gross matter.”         If therefore in my theory the mole
cular envelope is the sole agent directly concerned in the com
munication of heat from molecule to molecule, it is evident that
 heat in my theory does not originate in the vibrations of gross
 matter.     Now such is exactly the case. He may read in my
 treatise that “calorific motion is communicated from molecule
 to molecule mainly through their respective envelopes, which
 are in the best condition for strongly influencing one another.
 The rest of the molecular masses, i. e. the nuclei, move in con
 sequence   of the motion to which the respective envelopes have
 been   subjected,   according to the nature of the molecular con
  stitution; and therefore the difficulty of communicating calorific
 motion to a body does not depend, except in a very secondary
  degree, on the inner part of the molecules (Molecular Mechanics,
  p. 205). This inner part is what my critic assumes to be
  “gross” matter. So long as this objection remains unanswered
  I  have reason to question the exactness of Professor Norton’s
  statement and the conclusions      drawn therefrom.
     And now with regard to light. Is it true that I conceive
  light “to originate in vibrations of gross molecules 7" I need
  not repeat that gross matter has nothing whatever to do with my
  conceptions.     What I had said was this: “Luminous bodies
  cannot excite luminous undulations of a certain period in the
  surrounding acther, unless they themselves move at the same
  period and make as many undulations. With regard to non-lu
  minous bodies, they either transmit or reflect light; and there
  fore although they are incapable of setting themselves into spon
  taneous vibrations suitable to make a sensible impression on our
   organ of vision, yet they are prepared, when acted upon by impin
  ging rays, to take up the same kind of vibratory motion, at their
   surface at least, if they are opaque’’ (Molecular Mechanics,
   p. 209).    This view we are now going to examine.

   Transmission   of rays.-My critic says:
  “The   doctrine that transparent bodies transmit rays of light by
the motion of their own molecules, will hardly be accepted, we
think, by physicists.”
  The author knows,        I assume,      that   Mr. Grove, who is an eminent
physicist, holds in his ‘Correlation of Physical Forces’ that the
phenomena of light can be explained without any intervention of
aether, and consequently by the vibratory motion of ponderable
matter. And although             I
                             think, as              I
                                           have remarked in my
* Molecular   Mechanics,” that Mr. Grove has failed to establish
the non-existence of aether as a special substance, his arguments
have still sufficient weight in the case of the transmission of
light through solid bodies, as the reader will see in my treatise
 (pp. 190–192).
   The author adds that it would be “a waste of time” to argue
against this view.     I
                       cannot subscribe to his opinion, nor pro
bably would Mr. Grove.      A view unsupported by reasons may
be passed over without arguing, as it might be a waste of time
even to mention it: but when reasons are adduced, a critic
should at any rate mention the fact of their existence and bear
ing, before he decides that arguing against them is a waste of
time: a decision which should rather be left to the reader him
self.   The principal reason adduced by me in support of my
view was that “in the hypothesis that the ray is transmitted by
the motion of the aether intercepted between the molecules, the
regular arrangement of these would not explain the fact of the
transmission of a ray in any other direction than that deter
mined by molecular interstices in a straight line. Now the ray
is in fact transmitted in        all
                              other directions. Accordingly we
maintain that the transparent bodies transmit the rays       light               of
by                                                                                     in
    the motion    of
                  their own molecules, not      the motion    p. by               of
tercepted aether” (Molecular Mechanics,        191). Had Pro
fessor Norton transcribed this argument, and then declared his
repugnance “to waste time” about                   it,
                                          the reader would have
been able  tojudge    the matter: but my opponent did not give
                       of
the reader any such satisfaction, although,   venture    say, this
                                                         I                  to
would not have been     waste of time.

   Professor Norton adds:
   “The notion that certain substance radiates light
                       a                                         certain    of

colour, because its molecules are made            to
                                            vibrate    unison with thein
ray  of that colour, will not stand; for the results    spectral analy of

                               a    which are  capable  by vibration                   of
giving out any colour are precisely those which absorb and stifle that
colour.    This fact, we may add, also proves conclusively that the
rays cannot  be  transmitted         by
                                 the motion              of

436                    Prof.        J.    Bayma on the Fundamental
   I                        I
    confess that cannot see the conclusiveness of this proof: first
because the fact referred to regards incandescent substances
only, whilst the molecules to which the author alludes in this
conclusion are not supposed to be incandescent; and therefore
he has not the right of applying to the second the law of the
first phenomenon: secondly because spectral light is a light
elicited from the substance which is being burnt or made self
luminous, whilst the light simply transmitted is a light received
from without ; and it is obvious that what is truly said of a self
luminous body with regard to         own light cannot     said truly
                                                         its                             be

fact that heat alters,    least for   time, the molecular constitu

                                          what theoretical basis have
we for the existence of distinct primitive molecules for every differ
ent substance, the number of elements associated together being
exactly the same for each primitive molecule of each substance, and
different for primitive molecules of different substances 2 The na
tural tendency would be to a fortuitous association of elements in an
endless variety of numbers into groups.     No controlling principle
by which uniformity would be evolved from chaotic confusion, is fur
nished by the theory. The hand of the Creator must be supposed
to have miraculously interfered, and guided each element to its pre
cise place in the formation of every molecule of matter.”
     I
     have brought in this passage, though                 I
                                               have no necessity of
giving it a reply, only because it shows what style of reasoning
is sometimes adopted by men of scientific merit.          Professor
Norton starts from the assertion that my elements act, under
the same circumstances, with equal intensity ; and the assertion
is false.  He then draws a conclusion; which accordingly has
no foundation.    He assumes that the conclusion must be rejected
in order to give a theoretical basis to molecular science, and
does not reflect that the existence of distinct primitive molecules
is in no need of a theoretical basis à priori, it being quite suffi
ciently established as a matter of fact by a posteriori reasonings.
He implies gratuitously that elements must have existed in a
previous state of dissociation; and therefore considers them as
having a natural tendency to a fortuitous association, and speaks
of chaotic confusion with no controlling principle.      He comes
to the consequence that “the Creator must be supposed to have
miraculously interfered ;” and seems either to regret the neces
sity of the fact, or to imagine that in the work of creation there
has been nothing miraculous.        Lastly he supposes that the
Creator must have interfered “by guiding each element to
precise place,”    asthe elements could not have been created
                        if                                                in its
those precise places without any need                he of
                                           miraculous guidance.
   To strengthen this first argument,    adds:          a
     “The objection here urged derives still greater force from          the
consideration that both the nucleus and envelope              of
                                                      each specific

                               to       ageometric form,  different

Thus far there is no harm. But is it true that the nuclei and
envelope of each specific molecule are “assumed” by me to have
a regular geometric form * The question is one of fact: every
one may easily satisfy himself that I in my “Molecular Mecha
nics’ have not simply assumed, but proved the regularity of mo
lecules in general, and clinched the demonstration by those
symbols Q. E. D., which Professor Norton has so well discerned
on a previous occasion (see Molecular Mechanics, pp. 150–
152). The critic may discuss my proofs if he likes; but deny                                          I
that he has the right of dissembling their existence.

  Again, have assumed, as the learned Professor says, that
the geometric forms of molecules are “different for each differ
ent substance?”      This is another question of fact; and the fact
is quite the reverse of the statement.       Not only never affirmed               I
what Professor Norton      imagines,    but on the contrary      went so                         I

  Finally Professor Norton insists that, though the force of
gravity is not sensibly intercepted “this does not prove that a
tendency to interception does not exist: ” and to prove the exist
ence of this tendency he argues from “the supposition of a
wave-transmission of the force.” To this I reply that nothing
proves the existence of the slightest tendency to the interception
of the action of gravity or any other action. Such an intercep
tion can moreover be demonstrated to be absurd, as there is no
power in nature which is calculated to intercept action.         As for
the “supposition ” (the author seems here as elsewhere to accept
suppositions as proofs) I reply that it is only a supposition:
which moreover has nothing to do with the exertion of active
power; since the propagation of waves is a phenomenon of mo
tion, not of        its
                 causality with which alone        are here concerned.            we
But  my  critic, who  employs   the indefinite word “force” instead
of “action,” could not help confounding the exertion             power                             of

442        Prof. Swan on          a   Metallic Connector to replace
    I cannot end without sincerely thanking the learned author
for the honour which he has bestowed on me by condescend
ing to criticise my “Elements of Molecular Mechanics.”     The
more so, as his criticism, whilst impugning a few points of
secondary importance, contains what to my great satisfaction
I  consider to be a virtual approbation of my leading princi
ples.   Nothing can be more gratifying to the author of a scien
tific work than to find his fundamental views shared by men
of such accomplishments    in science as Professor Norton is
known to be, whatever unavoidable differences may remain in
some matters      of detail.

is screwed on air-tight.        In order that the cylinder shall be
free to  oscillate, it is evident that the tube A does not admit of
being rigidly attached to any fixed piece of apparatus; and ac
cordingly, to connect A with the tube B communicating with
the pressure-gauge and air-pump plate, M. Bianchi employs a
flexible tube of vulcanite, which is prevented, by a helix of wire
inside, from collapsing with the pressure of the atmosphere when
the pump is working.
   Such a vulcanite connector, when of the quality furnished by
M. Bianchi and when new, answers             end most satisfactorily;      its
but, like          all

                   of

446         Prof. R. Clausius on the new Conception of
 guished mathematicians, by pursuing three different methods of
investigation, have obtained what is virtually the same result,
would seem to furnish a guarantee for the accuracy of the inves
tigation; and perhaps many physicists will thereby be led to con
sider the matter settled. Under these circumstances a publication
of the reasons on the other side can only have a useful effect, by
giving rise to further investigations made probably from other
points of view.
   The most complete of the above investigations is that of C.
Neumann, which appeared, under the title “Principles of Electro
dynamics,” as a publication on the occasion of the Jubilee of the
University of Bonn, after a preliminary notice of the results had
been published in the Proceedings of the Göttingen Royal Aca
demy of Sciences.      I will first discuss this.
   Neumann starts from the consideration of two points, which
move under their reciprocal action.        If the potential of one of
these points, (for greater accuracy we will at once say) the point
mi, is to be determined in reference to the point m, the time me
cessary for the propagation of the action must be taken into
account, which is done by Neumann in the following manner.
   The potential which the point m, exerts at the time the calls
the emissive potential, and denotes it by T. Assuming Newton’s
law in reference to the reciprocal action of the two points, namely
that the force is inversely as the square of the distance, we have,
according to Neumann, for the determination of the emissive
potential the equation
                                     7"
in which r denotes the distance of the two points at the time t.
   This potential requires some time to reach the point m, and
                                                                            in If,
hence arrives there not at the time t, but somewhat later.
 on the contrary,     we
                      want the potential arriving    at
                                                     the time          t

450                  Prof. R. Clausius on the new Conception of
and e, moving in the two conductors. The distance from each
other he calls r; but from the first he makes the distinction that
in determining r he considers the two quantities of electricity at
different times.   The distance between the position of e at the
time t and the   position of e! at the time t he denotes by r(t, t').
If  thus we wish to determine the potential emitted from e at the
time t—At, and which arrives at e' at the time t, we have, as
before, to denote by r(t–At, t) the value of r which then comes
into play. Thus the potential of e upon e' (if, with Riemann,
we use the minus sign, since similar electricities repel each
other) is
                                                            ee'

In  calculating with this expression, he distinguishes between the
differentiations which refer to the motion of e from those which
refer to the motion of           denoting the first
                                                e',    by   and the

mary reflection.
    Previous telescopic observations had shown that in several
bright comets the light of the head differed from solar light in
having a decided blue tint”.     In this part of the comet the po
lariscope has generally given but feeble indications of the pre
sence of reflected light.   These characters are in accordance
with the spectroscopic examination of the light of this part of
Comets.
        I will
        now describe the more complete analysis of the blue
cometary light which the brighter comets of last summer enabled
me to make.
   One of these was Brorsen’s comet at        return             its
                                                          1868, the              in

   Winnecke's comet (Comet II. 1868) presented         the telescope            in
a nearly circular coma surrounding     bright nebulous spot, where
                                                            a

458                  Mr. W. Huggins               on some Spectrum
comets—a difference sufficiently great to support the conclusion
that the conditions in the two comets by which the light was
furnished were not identical. The first band occurs about half
way from D to E of the solar spectrum; the second band begins
about b and extends nearly to F. The third band presents itself
between F and G.
   The three broad cometary bands differ greatly in refrangibility
and in character from the sharply defined narrow lines of the
nebulae, and appear to show a constitution                             distinct from that
of the nebulae.
  The morning after           I
                       had made the observations of Winnecke's
comet,     I was
             much interested to find that the comet's spectrum
appeared to be identical with one of a series of the spectra of
carbon, as obtained from the decomposition by the induction
spark of several         compounds of carbon which                          I   had prepared
some years before.
   The modification of the spectrum of carbon, which appeared
identical with the cometary spectrum, presented itself when the
spark was taken in olefiant gas and some other compounds of car
bon, and differs from the apparently more perfect spectrum which
is obtained by the decomposition of cyanogen and olive-oil, &c.,
in the one circumstance alone that the three bands in the bright
parts of the spectrum are not resolved into distinct narrow lines,
but the light in each band becomes gradually fainter without suf
fering any break in           its
                           continuity.
I    believe        we
                  have    right
                          a         consider this peculiar spectrum,
                                             to

          when     employed cyanogen.

the same, though less complete, was obtained, together with the
known lines         of
               oxygen, when carbonic acid and carbonic oxide
were employed.
     In
     the evening         of
                       the same day      compared the spectrum
                                                   I                                        of

                                              olefiant gas, the two
spectra being juxtaposed              in
                                the instrument.     Careful compari
sons made       on
               that evening, when my friend Dr. W. Allen Miller
observed with me, and        two subsequent nights, showed that

             the comet was similar       that   carbon.to         of
   The obvious and apparently well-founded conclusion from
these observations would             of be
                               that the cometary matter from which
this light comes consists     the luminous vapour       carbon.             of

    Itmust not be overlooked that on this supposition a formi
dable difficulty presents itself in the insufficiency of the degree of
solar heat to which this comet was subjected for the conversion
of carbon into vapour. We cannot, for several reasons, suppose
that the solar heat was supplemented by the heat of chemical
action which it called forth. The suggestion, however, that car
bon may possibly exist in an allotropic state in which it may be
much less fixed, and so capable of passing into vapour at a com
paratively low temperature, is not perhaps inconsistent with our
positive knowledge of other elements.       Even if this suggestion
were true to   fact, a  difficulty would  remain;   for, so far as we
know, vapour in the non-luminous state, though it would not trans
mit light of the refrangibilities which it would emit when heated,
would not give them back by reflection, so as to reflect light si
milar to that which is peculiar to it in the luminous condition*.
   It may be well to consider for a moment the principal pheno
mena which usually present themselves when a comet approaches
the sun.
   (1) Under the influence of the solar force the nucleus throws
out luminous jets which frequently assume the form of luminous
envelopes about it f.
   (2) The jets or envelopes rise, in the first instance, towards
the sun.
   (3) The envelopes are frequently separated from the head,
and from each other, by invisible spaces.
   (4) At the boundary of the head the envelopes behave as if
they had become subject to an intense force of repulsion from
the sun.
     (5)   The matter of the envelopes appears to be driven from the
sun on        all
            sides     the head, and
                          of               this way         in
                                                         form   hollow               to   a
conical tail.
   Though the feeble light                  of
                                  the comets hitherto subjected                                     to
spectrum analysis has permitted them                but imperfectly   to   be                       in
vestigated, we have learned that the matter which emanates
from the nucleus, and          distinguished
                                       is            blue tint, gives      by   a                   a
light which the prism shows                             be
                                         identical with that emitted

    the vapour           of
                    carbon.          certain, therefore, that the light
which has the blue colour         not due      is to
                                               reflection from    to

respond to a condition of the vapour too cool to emit light, and
yet not condensed so as to reflect light.
   The exterior parts of the coma and the tail, which have been
found to be polarized in a plane, showing the light to come from
the sun, may be supposed to consist of the vapour of the nu
cleus condensed into widely scattered particles of great mi
nuteness.
   The remarkable phenomenon of the great rapidity with which
the tail is seen to extend itself to enormous distances in a direc
tion from the sun remains unexplained.       It may be suggested
that the instant at which the matter appears to come under the
influence of repulsion from the sun, may be that at which the
vapour is condensed into discrete particles, and be in some way
connected therewith%.
     Many years since Benedict Prevöti suggested the following
hypothesis.   The head of the comet by the sun's heat is con
verted into vapour which is invisible, and expands to a great dis
tance from the head in all directions.   Behind the head, where
the vapour is sheltered from the sun's heat, it is condensed into
cloud, which reflects light and appears as the tail. This cloud
passes back into invisible vapour             the comet's motion,   as,   by                            it
becomes exposed again        the solar beams.   to
   This theory       obviously inconsistent with the observed ap
                                     is
pearances and forms        the tails, and especially with the rays
                                           of
which are frequently projected                                 in
                                        direction different from that
                                                                a
of  the tail, with the absence    tail immediately behind the head,
                                                          of

LXIV.      On Statical and Dynamical Ideas in Chemistry.—Part I.
     Acid, Alkali, Salt, and Base. By EDMUND J. MILLs, D.Sc.,
     F.C.S.-k
l.        history of chemistry exhibits, in one respect, a re
      THEmarkable parallel to the history of philosophy; for no
other sciences have transmitted to the present epoch so many
unresolved and kindred controversies.      The question of the One
and the  Many,  for  example,  is allied to that in which the unity
of matter is challenged  by   the variety of elements; discussions
as to Absolute and Infinite resemble those which have reference
to the divisibility of matter; Kosmos reappears in the law of
Definite Proportions; and the contest about general principles
was an echo of the battles of realism. Of the attempts to de
cide satisfactorily upon philosophical disputes, Ferrier considered
his own       f
           the best and purest; and it is a masterpiece among                                               its
kind: but     believe that
                  I                        no
                               chemist has ever proposed       enter                            an
prise like that    the philosopher<U+017F>.
                            of           Nevertheless there are pro
bably but few chemists who, amid the assault and confusion                                                  of
modern theories, would decline       criterion     which

considerations.

   In the year 1809 Avogadro published a most remarkable me
moir, entitled “Idées sur l'Acidité et l’Alkalinité”*, which ap
pears to have hitherto almost escaped the attention of chemists;
yet it embraces, with marvellous skill and simplicity, the whole
of this interesting question.        After pointing out the well-known
difficulties which stood in the way of the oxygen theory of acids,
he shows that the idea of acidity involves two factors—namely, an
antagonist force (reciprocated by alkalies), and a great tendency
to unite with bodies in general.             The latter seems to depend
chiefly on a certain state of aggregation, which may either allow
full play to the former or almost entirely prevent                   action;                         its
hence this state        aggregation

contributed (each from his own point of view) to the furtherance

   One result of these dynamical doctrines has been, that we have
now current among us a tolerably pure idea of a salt—as a sub
stance       prone     to double decomposition.

    The memoir of which the following is                   an abstract gives an account
of some experiments                       made by the author with the object of deter
mining the laws according to which heat travels by conduction
 through liquids.
    After pointing out the importance of the subject, and briefly re
capitulating the methods previously used and the results obtained
by other experimenters, the “Diathermometer” is described.
    This instrument, which may be employed for the examination
of the thermal resistance or conducting power of solids as well as
liquids, has the following form.         A hollow brass cone, having a pla–
tinum base, is screwed with                         its
                                       apex downwards into        tripod stand                 a

distance from the lower cone.          The brass cones and their platinum
faces are highly polished, and the latter are cleaned                  washing                          by

retaining it in a pure state. Nevertheless, by the contrivances de
scribed, and by placing the bottles in a cool cellar (never above a
temperature of 60°Fahr.), the author has succeeded in keeping the
liquid acid perfectly, without loss and unaltered, through the whole

    Numerous experiments were made of electrolyzing the anhydrous

 other kinds of wood, of palladium, platinum, and gold. The gas

             ON   THE VOLTAIC DEPORTMENT OF PALLADIUM.
                              BY J. C. POGGENDORFF.
 IN among
       his remarkable research on hydrogenium, Mr. Graham has shown,
                 other things, that palladium when it takes up hydrogen
 expands, and, when the hydrogen escapes, contracts apparently more
 strongly than it had previously expanded. A palladium wire which
 originally measured 609: 144 millims., and by absorbing hydrogen
 had become longer by 9.77 millims, after the hydrogen had been
 expelled, was found to measure 599:44.4 millims., and had therefore
 shortened to the extent of 9.7 millims.
    Where no exact numerical determinations are required, both phe
nomena may be very strikingly demonstrated if palladium is charged
with hydrogen by electrolysis, a very thin plate being used.             I used
a   plate  which was 118 millims.         long by 23 millims.  broad, and only
 1 millim.    thick,   placed    at a distance of 8 millims. from a   platinum
plate in dilute sulphuric acid.
    If  this be connected with a small Grove's battery of two elements,
so that the palladium becomes charged with hydrogen, the following
is observed.
    Even after     a few minutes the palladium plate begins to bend away
from the     platinum,      and gradually becomes greatly curved.         After
about a     quarter   of an hour this has reached its maximum.          A cur
vature then commences in the opposite direction, so that the plate
first becomes straight, and then curves towards the platinum, which

in a short time goes   so far that the plates come into contact, by which
the  electrolytic process,  of course, is stopped.
   These curvatures are obviously due to the fact that the sides of
the palladium plate are successively saturated with hydrogen, and
therefore expand, just as does a Breguet's spiral by an alteration in
temperature.
   Just as the expansion of palladium by absorbing hydrogen may be
rendered obvious by this experiment, so the contraction of the metal
by the escape of the gas may be shown even more strikingly.
   For this purpose the palladium plate, after having attained the
maximum of                 its
                  first curvature,     removed from the liquid, washed,
                                                            is

   Unpolarizable electrodes are obtained          using amalgamated zinc    by
and   sulphate             of
                      zinc. When         used zinc and commercial zinc

of the electrodes; and a flame kindled these bubbles, which showed
that the gas in them was hydrogen.      Assuming that free sulphuric
acid was  present in the  solution, I saturated it with carbonate of
zinc by adding this to the solution, which        I
                                              kept boiling for two or
 three hours. This is necessary; for experiment showed me that a sim
 ple addition has but a slight action. The filtered solution contained
 sulphate of zinc, an extremely small quantity of carbonate of zinc,
 and basic sulphate of zinc, which had been formed during the boil
ing. This mixture gave a far smaller polarization.
   I  then compared the polarization and the inequality which occur
in  ordinary sulphate of zinc and those which are exhibited by the
solution I had treated with carbonate of zinc, and measured these
various values.
   I  took for this purpose glass troughs 80 millims. in length, 30
millims. in breadth and in height.     The zinc electrodes measured
75 by 18 millims.      By means of a tongue on the zinc plate the con
ducting-wire could be fastened outside the liquid.
   By means of a commutator this trough could be inserted in a cir
cuit consisting of a mirror-galvanometer and of a Wheatstone's
bridge.    The same commutator placed the electrodes in connexion
when the apparatus was outside the circuit.
   The resistance of the galvanometer was 694 Siemens's units, that
of the trough only 3 to 4. The latter could be neglected as com
pared with the former.
    On the other hand, the Daniell's element which fed the bridge
was provided with a rheostat of 162 units, by which the variations
in the battery (the resistance of which amounted to about 1 unit)
could be neglected. This rheostat and the position of the slider
were so arranged that the battery could only yield a hundredth of its
electromotive force.
    Some preliminary experiments showed me that the battery was
sufficiently constant.

 Calculation of the electromotive force resulting from the inequality,
           and of that from the polarization of the electrodes.
   We have a circuit in which three electromotive forces may be in
troduced.    They are proportional to the deflection produced by each
of them.        If
               500 millims. is the mean deflection produced by the
hundredth of the battery, the electromotive force corresponding to one
millimetre will be 0:00002.
   We conclude from this that the electromotive force arising from
the inequality       is,          the first solution,

    We thus see that, using amalgamated zinc electrodes, sulphate of
zinc gives considerable inequality and polarization if it contains free
sulphuric acid and the resistances are small, but that the former is
reduced to a quarter and the latter to zero if the free acid is neutra
lized with carbonate of zinc.—Arch. des Scienc. Phys. et Nat. Nov.

      ON A DEVELOPMENT          WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE
                              OF HEAT
  BURSTING of    THE PRINCE RUPERT's DROPs. By M. DUFour.
   The bursting of a Prince Rupert's drop is accompanied by a vio
lent projection of the substance of the glass. A molecular repul
sion seems to be produced in the interior of the body, which is strong
enough to impart to the separating particles a great velocity.       At
 the moment of explosion there is a considerable development of vis
viva, quite out of proportion to the feeble mechanical effort consumed
in bursting the point.     From the latter point of view, the Rupert's
drops suggest a problem concerning the mechanical theory of heat;
and it is natural to inquire whether the work which accompanies
this explosion is not accompanied by calorific phenomena.
   At first sight it would seem as if there were some analogy be
tween the separation of the vitreous particles in a bursting drop
and the sudden dilatation of a gas which expands after compression.
The small amount of work which consists in opening a stopcock
renders possible a considerable amount of work in the expanding
gas, just as the small effort necessary to break the point of a tear
gives rise to the reduction to powder and the projection of a large
mass of glass.     Yet between these facts, the analogy of which I
point out, there are so many differences of an essential character,
that we cannot predict whether the explosion of the Rupert's drops
is accompanied by thermal phenomena like those which accompany
the expansion of a gas.
   This thermomechanical problem, which is difficult to discuss
à priori, appeared important enough to merit some investigation;
and   I have endeavoured to ascertain whether the explosion is ac
companied by a change in temperature of the substance of the
glass.
   In a first series of experiments a thermo-electric apparatus was
used, to ascertain whether there was any difference of temperature
between the drops and the powder they produce.           All the results
agreed, and showed a heating of the substance of the glass; the
method employed did not enable me to measure with accuracy the
increase of temperature, which, moreover, was very slight.
   In a second series of experiments the drops were broken in a small
                             oil
brass vessel containing      ofturpentine, which received the powder

                 Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.          479
after explosion.       The usual precautions were taken to avoid the
influence of the surrounding temperature, and to measure the quan
tity of heat produced in the vessel *. The observations, properly
calculated, have shown that the powder had always a temperature
higher by 0°-18 to 0°45 than that of the drops before the explo
sion.   By this method it was impossible to avoid a very violent
agitation of the liquid, produced by the contact of the bursting tears;
the results thus obtained are therefore liable to important errors.
    In a third series of experiments the drops were placed in a sort
of truncated cone of cardboard, the axis of which was almost verti
cal; the base of the cone was uppermost, and was closed by a sheet
of cadutchouc. The points just projected through this sheet far
enough to be seized with a pair of nippers and broken.          The vitre
ous powder fell into a very thin cylinder of brass, suitably placed
below the cone, and containing some grammes of oil of turpentine.
The temperature of the drops before bursting was observed, as well
as that of the turpentine before and after the fall of the powdered
glass. The apparatus was protected, of course, against the effects
of the surrounding temperature; and the observations were calcu
lated so as to furnish the difference between the temperature of the
fragments of glass and that of the drops which produced them.           All
the results indicate an increase in the temperature of the glass on its
bursting; the results, which are in better agreement than those of
the preceding series, are comprised between 0°26 and 0°35.
Control experiments were made with the view of proving that the in
crease of temperature could not be due either to the mere fall of the
glass into the oil, or to some capillary action between the liquid and
the powder of the solid.
   All the experiments made authorize the following conclusions:–
   (1) At the time of the explosion of the drops the glass powder
which is produced has a higher temperature than that of the drops
themselves at the time of the explosion.
    (2) A series of six experiments (third method) made with eighteen
drops having a mean weight of 4.8 grims. indicated a mean excess
of 0°-30.
    This heating probably derives its origin from the molecular
motion which accompanies an explosion; and I think it can be
brought into connexion with the phenomena produced when metallic
wires, having been elongated (without exceeding the limit of elasti
city), suddenly resume their original length. Mr. Joule has shown         f
that wires become cooler when drawn out, and then heat again when
they resume their original volume. In a recent memoir: M. Edlund
has published similar results, obtained by drawing out wires of dif
ferent metals, and then allowing them to cool.

        In the preparation of a Rupert's drop the sudden cooling solidi
 fies the external coating of the glass while the interior is still liquid.
 This layer surrounds, therefore, a volume greater than the volume of
the cooled glass will occupy.            During cooling, the internal mass is
 connected by adherence to the outside layer already formed.                      The
glass cannot, therefore, undergo its normal contraction; it undergoes
a traction which tends to keep its volume larger, and its condition
must greatly resemble that of a metallic bar elongated by an ex
ternal effort.      A Rupert's drop may be regarded as a rigid en
velope, inside which bars raised to a high temperature have been
fixed to the sides, these bars being in considerable numbers, inter
lacing one another, and connected by countless solderings.                    During
