of any metal having an atomic weight differing by more than 5
from that of sodium could be present, supposing it to be a chlo

accordant result was got. This convinced me that had a per                         I
fectly pure substance.
   § 3. Preparation of the Brine.—The clearest lumps of the
rock-salt were washed in common and then in distilled water.
With these     a large beaker was       Distilled water was poured
                                              filled.
on so as to fill the beaker about two thirds.         If part of the
salt is thus always  above the surface of the   brine,  the latter ap
pears to be saturated in twenty-four hours.        After forty-eight
hours the brine was poured into another beaker and allowed to
stand until crystals began to be formed. It was then transferred
to a stoppered bottle and was ready for use. Although Regnault
and others have shown that for temperatures above 0°C. the
solubility of chloride of sodium in water is constant, yet the
precaution was taken of suspending a muslin bag containing
some crystals of salt from a string passing through the cork of
the bottle so that the crystals touched the surface of the brine.
By this means the perfect saturation of the brine was assured.
At 18° C. this solution contained 26-2724 per cent. of salt.
The solution was weighed in a long-necked flask, and was eva
porated to dryness and heated to about 300° C.
   The following numbers show the results obtained                                       by some
other experimenters:—

   § 4. Cold produced on mixing saturated Brine with Water.—To
examine this point, a series of covered beaker-glasses containing
known weights of water, and a similar series containing satu
rated brine, were placed side by side in a             tray containing  tin

And it is seen that the greatest abasement of temperature occurs
when there is about 40–60 of salt to 160–140 of water (say 25
per cent. of salt). This result is what we should expect, remem
bering that the saturated solution contains 26-27 per cent. of salt.

   § 7. Specific Gravity of Brines of various strengths.-The
question as to the source of cold when brines are diluted can be
conveniently approached from an examination of the density of
brines of different strengths, and the comparison between the
observed specific gravities and the theoretical specific gravities,
supposing no change of volume to take place. The brine was
found to have a specific gravity of 1-2011 at 26°C., the tempe
rature at which the determinations were made.      In Table                                                     III.
the columns 1             and 2 give the weights in grams of the quan
tities of water and saturated brine. Columns 3 and 4 give
the percentage of the water and NaCl in the resulting brines.
Column 5 gives the specific gravity found, and column 6 gives
the specific gravity calculated under the hypothesis that no alte
ration of volume ensues.

     There is accordingly an increase of volume when a solution
of salt is diluted; and this is of course connected with the ab
sorption of heat examined in § 4, Table I.        When the ori
ginal temperatures  are restored, a mixture of strong brine and
water may have a volume two hundredths greater than the sum
of the volumes of its constituents.  And when the brine con
tains as little as 4 per cent. of salt,      specific gravity sen          its                                                is

     § 9. Another method of attacking the question is offered by
the examination of the boiling-points of various brines. Ac
cordingly I took solutions made by mixing saturated brine with
water; and waiting for a day on which the barometer stood
nearly at the mean, I determined the boiling-points of the brines.
The vessels were tall copper cylinders.      In the Table W. the
temperature of the steam, as well as that of the brine itself, is
given.   The boiling was, of course, only continued a short time,
to avoid the error of strengthening the brine.

a dilute solution of chloride of sodium evaporates at 15° C., and
that it suddenly converts itself into the cubical anhydrous salt
and water. At —22°C. the whole of this hydrate appears to be
removed.     The gradual impoverishment of the mother-brine

allowed to melt and  get to the temperature  of the air; they were
then evaporated in the usual way.    The portion which remained
to the last was not frozen, in order to see whether its composi
tion was the same as that of the parts previously removed by
solidification.

   § 14. In these the salient point is the composition of the
final mother-liquor, which is essentially the same as that of the
successively separated solids.
   Accordingly a salt-ice freezing-mixture is just capable of im
poverishing saturated brine by withdrawal of salt-rich ingre
dients (namely the bihydrate) to such an extent that the unso
lidified part is homogeneous, in the sense of being solidifiable
as a whole.     And such solidification takes place immediately
below the    temperature  —21° to -22°, which is the lowest
temperature to be got by an ice-salt freezing-mixture.       I pre
sume that if the two solids, ice and   salt, could be presented to
one another in a state of indefinitely fine division, this propor
tion of 23.6 of salt to 76.4 of ice would act most promptly and
continuously as a freezing-mixture, because the formation of the
bihydrate would not then occur.
  I   am disposed to think that the hydrate of salt, the genesis
of which is here described, may have the composition
                              NaCl-H 10 H,            O,

see one serious source    error; and that

this point we shall have to return.
   § 15. Physical Condition of a Freezing-mixture.—The fact that
the rationale of a freezing-mixture is the liquefaction of solids
seems to demand at once the conclusion that a freezing-mixture
(of say ice and salt) must always be partially liquid.
   Nevertheless, if a mixture be made of about three parts by
weight of finely powdered rock-salt and one part of finely crushed
ice, the liquefaction which ensues is followed by an apparent
regelation so complete that the whole can be handled as a solid
mass, and becomes indeed perfectly dry.      The cause of this                                                      is,

  § 18. General.—The discovery of the hydrate of chloride of
sodium which contains about ten molecules of water to one of
the anhydrous salt, caused me to look for similar combinations of
water with other salts.  This was of course all the more neces
sary, since if such combinations existed with the salts occurring
in the sea, and if such combinations had solidifying-points within
the range of the atmospheric temperature, the composition of
the solid formed when sea-water freezes would be partly that
of ice and partly that of the solid hydrates formed from the
brine which had been enriched by the removal of water as ice.
    § 19. It has long been known that the presence of a soluble
salt in water depresses the point at which the liquid solidifies

reached, and (2) the preservation of that proportion exhibited
by the identity of composition of any crop of the solid and the
mother-liquor.    It is clear that if ice and the hydrated or anhy
drous salt separated out in constant proportion and not com
bined, but merely mixed with one another, the mass would
 have a constant solidifying- and melting-point; and this would
 be below zero to the same amount as would be reached on mix
ing artificially the anhydrous or hydrated salt with ice in the
 same proportion.       But when we have distinct and unchange
able relation   by  weight   demanded by the constancy of the soli
difying- and melting-point, we have undoubtedly a numerical

solution of NH, Cl was cooled in ice and the liquid portion
transferred to a beaker surrounded         by an ice-salt freezing
mixture.   The  temperature    fell  continuously,  and anhydrous
chloride of ammonium     kept   falling down.    At — 15° the soli
difying part presented a different appearance.     It then took the
form of a brilliant white apparently flocculent mass lighter
than the unsolidified liquid.     After standing, with stirring, for
a  quarter of an  hour,  the  temperature    was still — 15°.   The
clear portion was poured off into a fresh beaker, to which the
cold was applied.    The solidifying parts are now seen to be
minute crystals, very much resembling                                ice-flowers, but opaque.
The sides of the beaker become studded with transparent crys
stals of four sides, which are striated parallel to the sides.         By

     This corresponds very closely with the composition
                        Zn SO, +20 H, 0.
     It
      is noteworthy that this cryohydrate, after standing some
days  in a hermetically sealed tube, deposits massive rhombic
crystals and a fine powder.        I have not analyzed these ; they
are possibly the monohydrate and one of the intermediate hy
drates insoluble in the fused cryohydrate.

    It appears, then, that under these conditions the freezing of
sea-water is little more than the freezing of ice, and that the
almost undiminished saltness of the unpressed ice is due, as
suggested by Dr. Rae, to the entanglement amidst the ice
crystals of a brine richer in solid constituents than the original
water itself.   Such brine, which is here squeezed out in the
press, drains in nature down from the upper surface of the ice
floe by gravitation, and also is replaced by osmic action by new
sea-water which again yields up fresh ice ; so that while new
floes are porous and salt, old ones are more compact and much
fresher, as the traveller observed.
   § 33. But, bearing in mind the existence of the cryohydrates,
certainly of sulphate of magnesium and doubtless also of chlo
ride of calcium at temperatures not far below 0°C., a rapid fall
of temperature may be accompanied by more complex pheno
mena of gelation; for if the ice be quickly removed from a
large mass of water by freezing, the resulting brine may easily
be so enriched as to throw out one or more cryohydrates, which
thus perpetuate in situ a definite amount of saline matter. How
far such cryohydrates are soluble in the chief cryohydrate,
namely that of NaCl, which by itself resists the cold the
longest, is an important matter for future research.    But there
can even, viewed in the light of the experiments given above,
be little doubt that the degree of saltness of a floe depends not
only upon         its
               age, but also upon the rapidity with which     was                                 it
at first formed, and upon the lowest temperature         which                            to            it
has subsequently been exposed.

                           By      EDMUND         J. Mills.,             D.Sc., F.R.S.*
       HE following  results in connexion with aniline derivatives
       were obtained during the course of an investigation for
 which the substances that will be referred to were required.
   Separation.—When chloraniline, bromaniline, &c. are pre
pared by acting on an anilide with chlorine &c., the function has
usually a double period; so that mono-, di-, and tri-derivatives
are generated in presence of each other.       In order to separate
these       I
        proceed  as follows.   The mixed  derivatives are immersed
in a very  large excess of aqueous hydric chloride (1 vol. common
fuming chloride to 9 vols. water) and heated to nearly 100°,
with frequent stirring, for about an hour in a loosely covered
vessel; the whole is then allowed to cool down until the next
day.   The clear liquid contains only mono- and di- derivatives,
the insoluble portion di- and tri-derivatives.       The latter is sub
mitted to  repeated     hydrochloric  treatment as before, until the
supernatant clear     liquid  no longer    gives any precipitate with
ammonia; it then consists of tri-derivative only—contaminated,
indeed, with some black tarry products.          This derivative can be
purified by distillation per             from   strong   se,

acetate for some hours so as to form acetanilide, which is then
purified by crystallization. The acetanilide is powdered, sus
pended in water, and treated with excess of bromine or chlorine
 (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. x. p. 589): the product is heated with
powdered potash, moistened with spirit. This method gives good
results. The product consists chiefly of mono- and tri-deriva
tives.
   (8) It is not necessary to prepare acetanilide; a solution of
dry aniline in glacial acetate answers equally well. Aniline is
dissolved in 2–3 vols. of acetate, and chlorine- or bromine
vapour passed over the surface of the mixture, which must be
well agitated.    [In the case of bromine-vapour, the operation is
performed in a warm closet, and the bromine is volatilized slowly
from a retort, which must be heated by a small flame placed a con
siderable distance below. It is very easy thus to manage so that,
while vapour comes over freely, no drops of bromine are delivered
from the tube of the retort. This tube should be bent vertically
downwards, and nearly touch the surface of the aniline mixture
in the flask where the operation is conducted.]       Considerable
heat is evolved at first. As the reaction proceeds, the mixture
becomes thicker, and partially solidifies; and at this point the
operator will arrest it if he requires a minimum of tri-derivative,
but continue until total solidification ensues if he wishes the tri
derivative to be a maximum.     The whole may, if desired, be again
submitted to further action by gently heating with more glacial
acetate, which causcs solution to occur.       The cooled mass is
heated to 100° under water, and afterwards cooled therewith.
The supernatant liquid is filtered off and precipitated with alkali:
this precipitate contains mono- and di- derivatives.     The inso
luble portion is mixed with powdered potash, moistened with
spirit, and then heated in order to destroy any traces of anilide
that may have been formed. The three derivatives are separated
from the dark mass as already stated.      The distinguishing fea
ture of this mode of reaction      that     is,

but it is difficult to purify. The only substance      was able to  I
separate, in two large operations, was volatile in a current of
steam, white, and crystalline; it was soluble in aqueous hydric
chloride, and precipitated therefrom by ammonia, but not by
platinic chloride after repeated crystallization from spirit. When
 melted, it gave no definite fusion-point.
   Properties.—Having contrived a very delicate apparatus for
the determination of fusion-point, l have been enabled to make
some interesting comparisons among these derivatives; but the
actual numbers (though otherwise completely corrected) have not
yet been converted into degrees of the air-thermometer.         All
the determinations are made upon substances repeatedly purified
by fractional methods; and in no case is the probable error of
the fusion-point greater than 0°-01.       The result of fifty-five
observations with monochloraniline from acetanilide was 69°69;
0°-03 higher than that of forty-eight observations with the deri
vative of the direct acetic process.   Dichloraniline could not be
obtained in sufficient quantity for systematic examination by
either of the methods (8) or (y).
   Trichloraniline was very easily made by the direct acetic pro
cess, and purified by distillation in a current of steam.      The
anilide process yields little, if any.  For the organic analysis of
this substance    Iam indebted to the kind offices of my friend
 Mr. Valentin.

   These numbers agree very well with theory.          The fusion
point, as determined by ninety-six observations with two mer
curial thermometers, was 77°05; and it occurs so sharply, that
the probable error of the result is only 0°-0014. Lesimple
 (Ann. Chem. und Pharm. vol. cxxxvii. pp. 126 & 127) describes a
trichloraniline which he obtained by reducing nitrotrichlorobenzol.
He states that it has a very unpleasant and persistent smell, and
that it melts at 96°5. On these two points my derivative differs
from his : it has rather a faint odour, but not very unpleasant,
and melts 19° lower.  In             all
                            the other reactions mentioned                        by
Lesimple the two bodies exhibit  complete agreement.

(28 obs., one thermometer).      Dibromaniline was prepared as
stated above (8): the direct acetic process yielded me little, if
any, with the same ratio of reagents.        The fusion-point was
78°82 (100     obs., two thermometers).       Tribromaniline from
acetanilide melted at 116°-22 (30 obs., one thermometer); that

                               in   the Modern Spectroscope.
                                                                                                       25
to be mapped.”   This, as italicized by him, is very clear; and
he finds such a reference in what he calls the carbon-spectrum,
but which others before him, whom he does not mention, have
called the spectrum of carbohydrogen, of acetylene, of marsh
gas, and of general blue base of flame.
   Impressed next with the importance of the places of the bands
of that spectrum being known to great accuracy, Dr. Watts pro
ceeds to give his own recent, and doubtless very good, measures
of the wave-lengths of certain fine lines therein, and concludes
with stating what substance the whole collection is the spectrum
of, and what it is not, both in chemistry and physics.
                                    The principle involved.
    Now to the principle of spectroscopic observation announced
in the first part of the paper I certainly cannot object, seeing
that it   is,
           step           by
                     step, the very method and the very reference
spectrum which       have been employing for four years past, and
                         I
am still  using      this royal observatory, and have often pub
                         in

                                       general adoption.    My first
attempt indeed was not very successful; for having sent paper                                 a
on   the subject      the Royal Astronomical Society
                          to                               May 30,                       on

the accursed thing for       free countries, secret committees)
chose to  keep my paper back for six months without rendering
any reason why.

trum’s lines,     far back too

lines into wave-lengths, agreeably with Angström's normal solar
spectrum.
    Afterwards, too,    not only printed the so-long-stopped paper
                              I
in  the thirteenth volume                of
                               the Astronomical Observations of the
Royal Observatory, Edinburgh (together with Professor Swan's
 wave-lengths      above), but
                     as             the beginning
                                                in      1872 practised         of
 the method still further       the zodiacal light
                                          on          Palermo, and            at                        on

26                  Mr. P. Smyth                  on Carbon and Hydrocarbon
twilight and phosphorescence in many seas, and then sent a
second paper to the Royal Astronomical Society.     And that one
they did print in the same year, with a very good engraving,
too, of my several pairs of spectra just as they were simultane
ously seen in my spectroscope—one member of each such pair
being, for reference sake, invariably the bands and lines of the
carbon- or hydrocarbon-spectrum,   precisely as Dr. Watts is now
proposing it in 1874, and as, too, I have since found that it
was used before my time in telespectroscopy by the eminent
Lewis M. Rutherford, of New York, and differing only in the
manner of producing the spectrum from what Dr. Huggins
actually accomplished on the comet of 1866 and on several others
since then.
     Truly, therefore,                I
                       have nothing to say against the principle of
the method    proposed  now by Dr. Watts as his own; but        am                                         I
sorry to differ from him in the instrumental description which
he gives of the visible spectrum concerned, and which will affect
the observations of       persons who use  all        standard               it   as   a                            of
reference.
                      Mensuration                of    the Spectrum referred            to.

     year, indeed, Piazzi Smyth has been informed by Mr. Rand
     Capron, of Guildford, Surrey, that the coincidence is never quite
     perfect, the aurora-line being slightly more refrangible than the
     second line of the citron band; and Piazzi Smyth is quite ready
     to bow before this correction from the superior spectroscope with
     much larger dispersion, and the evident practical ability of Mr.
     Capron. But the correction still leaves the reference-use of the
     line 5585-5, though the second of the band (which gradually
     goes off into invisibility), more important than the first—and just
     as accurate as before, if each observer will remember that a nor
     mal aurora-line reads on the comb-like natural scale of the citron
     band of the carbohydrogen-spectrum     not 2.0, but 2:2—the

                                                                                                        it. to
 formed prejudices                      of
                           the secret committee who passed

32     On Carbon and Hydrocarbon in the Modern Spectroscope.
had previously called the carbohydrogen-spectrum,    and declared
it to be the spectrum of the glowing and incandescent vapour
of carbon; wherefore the earlier announced truth of the Scottish.
professor was extinguished, and the error of the Royal Society
became so fashionable in London circles, that every one began
to talk thenceforth of that particular spectrum as the undoubted
spectrum of “carbon.”
   Hence, too, when so admirable an observer and inimitable a
spectroscopist as Dr. Huggins found the spectra of two small
comets resolvable into bands somewhat similar to those of the
carbohydrogen,  he boldly called them the bands of the carbon
spectrum; and it was approved by the secret committee of the
Royal Society and printed in their Philosophical Transactions
in 1868.
   But Dr. Huggins, as a good practical experimenter as well as
astronomical observer, knew full well the impossibility of the
spectrum of carbon being seen without an almost supernatural
degree of heat being applied to it; how, therefore, did he show
that such heat existed in the ultra-faint comets which he had
spectroscoped      2
   The method is worthy of the gravest note, as showing (from
its being actually printed with honour         the Philosophical
                                                               in
Transactions) what  equivocal  conclusions will pass the secret
committees     of

gons   in   keeping out any salutary doubt expressed                       on   a      favoured
topic. For this was the heat-agency announced, viz.:-
   That “some comets have approached the sun sufficiently near
to acquire   temperature high enough

 said, in the Philosophical Transactions, to be throwing off the
 incandescent vapour of carbon every night they were under ob
 servation, even in a dark and cold sky, had been taken thence and
 placed on the very surface of the sun itself, and had experienced
 there not only the heat which that other comet had experienced
of earth’s x 47,000, but earth's X 300,000, they could not have
shown a pure carbon-spectrum.
    As our sun, according to Father Secchi, ranks only among
the yellow stars, and they are supposed not to be so hot as the
white stars, perhaps the vapour of carbon may exist glowing and
incandescent in Sirius, which is so noted a member of the latter
class of stars.    We may, too, perhaps be privileged to see the
actual and real spectral lines of carbon there, in any good tele
spectroscope—but with the drawback that, however plainly the
lines may appear in themselves, we cannot recognize their chemical
origin and assign them their true name, because neither has man
ever yet volatilized pure carbon, nor has any angel (in default of
theory) ever told us the wave-lengths of carbon-lines when the
carbon has been volatilized by a higher power.

  The process of obtaining mean values &c. now consists in
measuring each individual with a standard that bears a scale of
equal divisions, and afterwards in performing certain arithmetical
operations upon the mass of figures derived from these numerous
measurements.                     I
                       wish to point out that, in order to procure a
specimen having, in one sense, the mean value of the quality
we are investigating, we do not require any one of the appli
ances just mentioned: that            we                  is,

The ordinate m at # represents the mean value of the series, and
p, q at 4 and #, taken in connexion with m, give data for estima
ting the divergence; thus q—m is the divergence (probable
error) of at least that portion of the series that is in excess of
the mean, and m—p is that of at least the other portion. When
the series is symmetrical, q—m=p-q, and either, or the mean
of both, may be taken as the divergence of the series generally.
No doubt we are liable to deal with cases in which there may
be some interruption in the steady sweep of the ogive; but
the experience of qualities which we can measure, assures us
that we need fear no large irregularity of that kind when dealing
with those which, as yet, we have no certain means of measuring.
   When we marshal a series, we may arrange them roughly,
except in the neighbourhood of the critical points; and thus
much labour will be saved.      But the most practical way of
setting to work would probably depend not on the mere dis
crimination of greater and less, but also on a rough sense of
what is much greater or much less. We have called the objects
at the 4, #, and # distances p, m, and q respectively; let us sort
the objects into two equal portions P and Q, of small and great,
taking no more pains about the sorting than will ensure that P
contains p and      all

nitudes differing from the mean value by such and such mul
tiples of the probable error, will occur with such and such
degrees of frequency.”  My proposal is to reverse the process,
and to say, “since such and such magnitudes occur with such
and sueh degrees of frequency, therefore the differences between
them and the mean value are so and so, as expressed in units
of probable error.” According to this process, the positions
of the first divisions of the scale of divergence, which are those
of the mean value plus or minus one unit of probable error,
are of course p and q, lying at the 4 and # points of the
ogive, or, if the base consist of 1000 units, at the 250th point
from the appropriate end.      The second divisions being those
of mean value   plus  or minus two units of probable error, will,
according to the usual Tables, be found at the 82nd point
from   the appropriate end, the third divisions will be at the
17th, and the fourth at the 3rd. If we wished to pursue the
scale further, we should require a base long enough to include
very many more than 1000 units.
               Remarks on the Law                 of Frequency of Error.
     Considering the importance                    of the results which admit of
being    derived whenever the law of frequency of error can be
shown to apply, I will give some reasons why        applicability                  its                    is
more   general than   might have been   expected  from the highly
artificial hypotheses  upon  which the law      based.      will         is                     It         be

mial grades will be a single grade, or, what comes to the same
thing, the difference of the effect produced by the plus and
minus phase of any one of the alternative elements, upon the
value of the whole.     The unit of the exponential curve will
 be q—m of fig. 1, or the probable error.         This latter unit is
equally applicable to what we may call the binomial ogive, which
 is the curve drawn with a free hand through the grades.            The
justification for such a conception as a binomial ogive will be
fully established further on. Suffice it for the present to re
 mark that, by the adoption of a unit of this kind, the middle
 portion of a binomial ogive of 999 elements is compared in the
figure with one of 17.
    The first three of the above-mentioned conditions may occur
in games of chance, but they assuredly do not occur in vital and
social phenomena; nevertheless it has been found in numerous

40           Mr. F. Galton on Stalistics by Intercomparison,
instances, where measurement was possible, that the latter con
form very fairly, within the limits of ordinary statistical inquiry,
to calculations based on the (exponential) law of frequency of
error. It is a curious fact, which                          I
                                       shall endeavour to explain,
that in this case a false hypothesis, which is undoubtedly a very
convenient         one to work upon, yields true results.
      In illustration of   what occurs in nature, let us consider the
causes which determine the size of fruit.      Some are important.
the chief of which is the   Aspect,  whose range of influence is too
wide to permit us to consider it in one of the simple alternatives
“good” or “bad.” It is no satisfactory argument to say that
variations in aspect are partly due to a multitude of petty causes,
such as the interposition of leaves and boughs, because, so far
as they depend on well-known functions of altitude and azimuth,
they cannot be reduced to a multitude of elementary causes.
There has been much confusion of ideas on this subject, and
also a forgetfulness of another fact—namely, that when we
once arrive at a simple alternative, there our subdivision of
causes must stop, and we must accept that alternative, how
ever great may be          influence,its  one    the primary ele

suppose a crown were our “small” unit, and we had a medley
of 10 crowns, 33 shillings, and 100 fourpenny pieces, with which
to make successive throws, throwing the whole number of them
at once: we might theoretically sort them into fictitious groups
each equivalent to a crown.    There would be 29 such groups,
viz.:-10   groups, each consisting of 1 crown; 6 groups, each of
5 shillings; 1 group of three shillings and 6 fourpenny pieces;
6 groups each of 15 fourpenny pieces; and a residue of 4 four
penny pieces, which may be disregarded.     Hence, on the already
expressed understanding that we do not care to trouble ourselves
about smaller sums than a crown, the results of the successive
throws of the medley of coins would be approximately the same
 as those of throwing at a time 29 crowns, and would be ex
 pressed by the coefficients of a binomial of the 29th power.
 Hence I conclude that all miscellaneous influences of a few small
and many minute kinds, may be treated for a first approxima
tion exactly as if they consisted of a moderate number of small
and equal alternatives.
   The second approximation has already been alluded to; it
consists in taking some account of the minute influences which
we had previously agreed to ignore entirely, the effect of whieh
is to turn the binomial grades into a binomial ogive.          effect                     I
it  by drawing  a curve with a free hand       through   the grades,
which affords a better approximation to the truth than any other
that can a priori be suggested.

      will now show from quite another point of view (1) that the
exponential ogive        is,   on

   Now, if we apply these results to observed facts, we shall
rarely find that the series has been due to any large number of
equal elements.    Thus, in the stature of man the probable error,
              is about 30, which                     makes it impossible                       that it can be
looked upon as due to the effect of more than 200 equally small
elements.    On consideration, however, it will appear that in
certain cases the number may be less, even considerably less,
than the tabular value, though it can never exceed        As                                        it.             an

  N   1842 Professor Joseph Henryf observed that when a
    needle was placed in a helix and magnetized by the dis
charge of a Leyden jar, the direction of the polarity of the
needle varied with the “striking-distance” of the jar; and
these observations led Henry to the discovery that the discharge
was multiple and oscillatory in          nature.      1862 Fedderits                   In

makes these holes lasts ºr   second;  and the holes are separated
by intervals which gradually decrease in size toward the end of
the discharge, so that the last spark-holes are separated about
one half of the distance which separates the holes made at the
 beginning of the discharge.    The average interval between the
spark-holes is Tºg second. After this portion of the discharge
has passed there is a period of quiescence lasting about Tºow

    This discharge also lasts 3, second, and is similar to the
 preceding, except that larger circles are made on the disk by the
 dissipation of the carbon, and that there are fewer flashes, viz.
 71. The total number of spark-holes in these flashes is 123.
 Thus there are fewer flashes than in the experiments with the
 platinum points, but the total number of spark-holes is the same
 in each case.   Hence there                         is,

is to say, by causing the sunlight, reflected by the large mirror
of a siderostat, to pass through an objective of 8 inches aper
ture, and then through a lens of short focus, I could perceive
the trace on this flame of carburetted gas fed by a larger pro
portion of oxygen than in the preceding case; but when the
oxygen became too abundant, the trace was no longer visible—
which, beside difficulties of observation, may be explained, 1st,
by the fact that, the flame having become quite white and even
bluish, there is no longer any difference of tint between the
part which receives the solar rays and the parts, which do
not receive them, the trace can only manifest itself by a differ
ence of intensity more difficult to perceive; 2nd, by the carbon
particles being immediately consumed at the moment of their
formation,  and consequently the reflecting matter becoming re
latively much rarer.
   In short, these experiments show that carbon retains               re                                     its

     M. Lallemand, however, in   a recent communication relative
to what he calls the illumination of opaque bodies with a dead
surface* (that is to say, on diffusion), seems to me to have taken
an important step towards my view.         In other interesting ob
servations, he has arrived, for a smoked surface, at a result

air. To perceive this it suffices to pour on the smoked surface
a drop of alcohol, benzine, sulphide of carbon—in a word, of a
liquid which moistens the lampblack; but in this case the po
larization-phenomena are impaired”.      It is better to operate by
immersing the smoked surface in a glass trough containing the
liquid. This causes, it is true, a little perturbation owing to
the circumstance that the liquids (such as alcohol and benzine)
dissolve a substance deposited at the same time as the carbon,
and become somewhat fluorescent; but this does not prevent
the diminution of the intensity of the diffused light (without
alteration of the polarization-phenomena)     from being distinctly
observed.    Is it not probable  that, if the index of refraction of
the liquid were identically the same as that of the lampblack,
there would be no light diffused ?
   It seems to me useless to insist further on this difference of
interpretation, to which                            I
                               attach only secondary importance.

themselves effective centres of vibrations, or if the action of these

to those which are realized in a more general manner.
    A black body is completely opaque. It is seen only by super
ficial reflection: if the surface is polished, the reflection is spe
cular; if the surface is dull, there is diffusion according to the
laws we have ascertained concerning polarization.            Between
 absolute polish and perfect absence of lustre we may have        the                             all

                       is                                            the                          in

                                     is     deviates;   the lampblack
 therefore does not receive          pencil  making a      right angle           a

and the polarization by refraction experienced by the diffused
light in passing through the glass to arrive at the eye”.
This fact involves as a consequence that, if we operate exactly
in the same manner, employing only a neutral incident pencil
instead of a polarized pencil, the diffused rays will be much less
polarized in the plane of vision than they are when the light
arrives at the lampblack without passing through the glass.
Phenomena of the same kind are generally produced when the
light has penetrated into the body; and when the latter has
no homogeneity and is not polished (chalk), very sensitive ap
paratus is requisite to discover a trace of polarization.
    In coloured bodies the course of things is the same as in white
bodies, except that, the body not being transparent to every kind
of ray, it is only by superficial reflection or diffusion that the
white light is sent back:                                all

Lallemand operated also by throwing a pure and polarized
spectrum   on the coloured diffusing surface: according to the
position of the eye, the different diffused colours are perceived
to be more or less polarized; and those which are the least po
larized correspond to the proper colour of the body.     But M.
Lallemand attributes this to fluorescence, while, according to
the theory which has just been explained, it is the result of
absorption and depolarization by interior reflections.
   In support of this theory must be mentioned first the fact
that the colour of a body by diffusion is always the same as by
transparence.              I    will here report some experiments which show
it in   astriking manner:—
   A horizontal pencil of sunlight, polarized in a vertical plane,
falls on the coloured diffusing surface. The observer views it
under a visual angle of 90°, the plane of vision being horizontal:
the colour, as we have said, appears very rich. But as the
asperities of the surface are rarely minute enough for the diffusion
to be perfect, and in certain cases the substance may be con
tained in a glass vessel, producing specular reflection, it is better
to pass the diffused rays through a Nicolor a Foucault, stopping
the rest of the polarized rays. The colour of the body then
appears with the maximum of saturation and can be analyzed
with the spectroscope.
    It is convenient to choose for the operation of diffusion a sub
stance the absorption-spectrum of which is discontinuous and
characterized by bands.
                                                                                                                be its

   4. In smoky quartz, when it is not too dark, the trace is in
general observed, but in very various degrees. When it is feeble,
polarization is complete.
   In a very fine brown specimen from Siberia, the defects of
homogeneity manifest themselves, through transparence to dif
fused light, under the form of cloudy strata, indicating unequal
distribution of the colouring-matter. With sunlight the trace
is very marked, very incompletely polarized, and with a lens a
multitude of defects and particles are distinguished. This                                                         in
complete polarization is a character always recognized when
we operate on a liquid holding in suspension         particles too
numerous or of too   great a volume.
   5. A small specimen of amethyst cut in the shape of a prism
with three sides, and with faces perpendicular to the edges, gave
no visible trace in the greater part of the crystal; but in a few
points small flaws are observed.
   The study of these phenomena in quartz is often complicated
by       its
        property    chromatic polarization.

first fringes, on the side where the pencil enters, are very bright
and distinct; they grow confused and are effaced towards the
other extremity.
   Calcareous Spar.—I have found, like M. Lalleinand, that fine
specimens of Iceland spar present no power of illumination
properly so called.    The trace of a pencil of sunlight manifests
itself solely by   the slight red fluorescence of this substance;
and no polarization is observed.     But if we operate on certain
crystals which exhibit minute defects, we can also obtain a white
trace.   The double refraction of the spar complicates the obser
vation of the polarization-phenomena; yet, with some attention,
it has appeared to me that the facts are in this case conformable
to what could have been foreseen.
   Rock-salt.—The only good specimen of rock-salt I have had
at my disposal is a very fine prism belonging to the Physical
Cabinet of the University of Geneva.        In it a pencil of light
produces a very slight trace, resolvable with the lens into small
bubbles or cavities.      The polarization is complete; and the
defects are visible or disappear according to the orientation of
the analyzer.    This is the same as           I
                                           have already stated for
quartz.

   In the other, less pure specimens which have examined, the
trace is visible, but unequal, and the polarization normal.
   Diamond.-I had in possession for a few days some large
diamonds    which form part of the collection of the Duke of
Brunswick, and which had been obligingly lent me by the
municipality of Geneva.       Unfortunately the season was very
unfavourable, and I was only able to avail myself, for the ob
servations, of a few moments during which the sun shone.
Besides, the diamonds being cut as brilliants renders the obser
vation very difficult: it gives rise to much false light; and on
account of the reflection of the facets, one may readily confound
the luminous trace with one of its images.
    (1) A white diamond of 39 carats gave rise to a trace very
visible and nearly white.    The greater part of the light emitted
by it is due to fluorescence;     but      I
                                          feel certain that another
part is due to illumination properly so called; indeed the trace
is partially polarized.

        Some yellow diamonds        29, 31, 42, and 80% carats gave
                                    of
rise      very visible bluish trace, principally due

      I do not hesitate to attribute these phenomena of polarization
to  foreign    particles. We know, indeed, from Dumas and Stas”,
that diamonds leave a spongy residue after combustion; and
Sir D. Brewstert recognized with the microscope cavities of
various shapes in their interior.
   Ice.—When very clear and compact, it exhibits very little
capacity of illumination.         When floating in water in a large
glass vessel through which the pencil of rays passes, the trace is
very pronounced in the water, but almost invisible in the ice.

Nature Series.                Polarization of Light.      By WILLIAM SPOTiswooDE,
     M.A., LL.D., F.R.S.,                &c       London: Macmillan and Co. 1874
     (crown 8vo, pp. 129).
      work contains an admirably clear and
THIS
  phenomena of Polarized Light. The author
                                                   exact account of the
                                                   explains, in the first
place, the various ways in which light is made to undergo the pro
cess of plane polarization (by passage through a doubly-refracting
crystal and by reflexion and refraction by glass), and then describes
the double-image prism, Nicol's prism, and Norremberg's apparatus.
The subjects of the interference of plane-polarized light, the me
thods of producing circularly polarized light, and the interference
of circularly polarized light are next discussed at considerable
length with reference to pencils of parallel rays. These subjects
fill two thirds of the volume; but, as well as the main subject, several
collateral points of great interest come under notice in the course
of the discussion: such are the various forms of the saccharometer,
Sir C. Wheatstone's apparatus for producing circularly polarized
light by reflexion at a metallic surface, and exhibiting the effects
of passing light in that state through crystal films, the phenomena
resulting from the action on polarized light of glass when unequally
cooled, or when in a state of stress, the phenomenon of atmospheric
polarization, the polar clock, &c.       The student who has made
out this part of the volume will be able to understand easily the
account which follows of the results arising from the use of a pencil
of divergent rays, and the beautiful phenomena of coloured rings
produced by the action of various crystals on such a pencil.         In
several places the author notices the results of an examination of
the spectrum of the pencil of interfering light which issues from
the analyzer; and a good deal of attention is paid to the produc
tion of complementary colours by polarized light. In fact the last
chapter of the volume is a reprint of the author's paper “On
Combinations of Colour by means of Polarized Light,” origi
nally published in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xxii.
p . 354.
    It will be seen from the above brief account of its contents that
the work before us passes in review        the main points    all
                                                               interest   of
in  the subject. The author speaks      his book   “a talk rather than
                                                         of         as

                 on                               contains “the sub it
stance     of

without the aid     mathematical symbols; and doubtless, when the
experiments described were actually exhibited, the lectures would
be  very interesting      any intelligent audience. This, however,
                                    to

itwould     easybe  point out passages which could not

votes to the study of a work like the present, which gives with
great clearness, accuracy, and brevity the facts of the subject
clothed, as far as may be, in the language of daily life.
  The illustrations are sufficiently numerous: some of them are little
more than diagrams; others are elaborate drawings of instruments,
and are very good, e.g. those on p. 60 and p. 102. There are also
two whole pages of coloured figures (which are very beautifully
done), showing the rings and brushes produced by polarized light
in the case of six crystals, two complementary figures for each
crystal.   In conclusion we can cordially recommend the book to
the somewhat select class of readers who take an intelligent interest
in this beautiful branch of science.

THE    1. “The Physical History of the Valley of the Rhine.”            By
Prof. A. C.   Ramsay,  LL.D.,  W.P.R.S.,  Vice-President.
   The author first described the general physical characters of the
valley of the Rhine, and discussed some of the hypotheses which
have been put forward to explain them. His own opinion was that
during portions of the Miocene epoch the drainage through the
great valley between the Schwarzwald and the Vosges ran from the
Devonian hills north of Mainz into the area now occupied by the
Miocene rocks of Switzerland.        Then after the physical disturb
ances which closed the Miocene epoch in these regions, the direction
of the drainage was reversed, so that, after passing through the
hill-country between the lake of Constance and Basel, the river
flowed along an elevated plain formed of Miocene deposits, the
remains of which still exist at the sides of the valley between Basel
and Mainz.      At the same time the Rhine flowed in a minor valley
through the upland country formed of Devonian rocks which now
constitute the Taunus, the Hundsruck, and the highland lying
towards Bonn; and by the ordinary erosive action of the great river
 the gorge was gradually formed and deepened to              its
                                                             present level.

 have an appreciable effect in producing or increasing its own apparent
 dip; but where a whole series of beds thin constantly in one direction,
 the amount of the dip of one of the higher beds, due to the sum of
 the thinnings of the underlying beds, is often very considerable.
    In illustration of this the author indicated the Lower Jurassic
 rocks between Leckhampton Hill and Burford.          The Inferior Oolite,
and the Upper, Middle, and Lower Lias thin out rapidly to the east
 along this line; the base of the Middle, Lias is nearly a horizontal
 line, the easterly “dip” of the Great Oolite being due to the easterly
 thinning of the Middle and Upper Lias and the Inferior Oolite. The
 base of the Lower Lias has a westerly dip.
    It is generally supposed that the dip of any bed is due to great
 movements of the earth's crust; from the facts mentioned the author
argued that our inferences as to such movements will vary according
 to the beds which happen to be exposed at the surface. In the
 example given we assume a westerly upheaval because we see the
Great Oolite dipping to the east.                 If
                                          over this area the whole of the
higher strata had been removed down to the Middle Lias, we should
perceive the beds to be flat; if the denudation had exposed the base
of the Lias, we should probably suppose that along this line there
had been an easterly upheaval.
    Under London the entire series of strata between the Palaeozoic
rocks and the base of the Upper Cretaceous is absent; as we recede
from the London Basin the intermediate beds necessarily come in
and gradually thicken, producing the dip of the Cretaceous beds
towards the London Basin.
    The Palaeozoic rocks under London are about 800 feet below
sea-level.    We now know, by the sub-Wealden boring, that under
the centre of the Weald the Palaeozoics are also below sea-level.
Supposing that they should be found at about the same depth as at
Kentish Town, then the Palaeozoic floor will be approximately a
straight line, whilst we know that the whole of the Wealden and
other cretaceous beds dip to the north, their dip being thus wholly
accounted for by the gradual thinning out of              the bedsall they        as
approach London.               In

are  of   freshwater origin; we must suppose that the area                             of
water within which they were deposited had some limit                   the       to

    Geological Notes on a Journey from Algiers to the Sahara.          75
    The beds which support Geological Basins frequently thin towards
 the centres of those basins, thus producing, wholly or in part, the
basined form of the strata.     It was, however, shown that the beds of
the basins themselves frequently thicken towards the centre of the basins.

    1. “Geological Notes on a Journey from Algiers to the Sahara.”
 By George Maw, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
    The author commences by describing the details observed on his
journey from Algiers to L'Aghouat, on the borders of the Sahara.
 The distance traversed was 285 miles, or about 210 miles in a
straight line, and in a direction nearly north and south. No eruptive
 rocks were observed.     The oldest rock is a boss of mica-schist and
 gneiss behind the city of Algiers; it forms a low anticlinal, with a
N. and S. strike. The pass through the gorge of the Chiffa in the
 Lesser Atlas shows hard slaty rocks dipping S. at a high angle;
 they are repeated as an anticlinal on the south side of the higher
 part of the Tell plateau, and are probably Mesozoic. In the plain
separating the Tell from the Hauts Plateaux, and on the south side
 of the latter, red and yellow sandstones form anticlinals; these
rocks resemble the Bunter in mineral characters, and are overlain
by red marls resembling the Keuper.         In the northern escarpment
of the Hauts Plateaux saliferous marls are exposed, interstratified
 between the sandstones and below the red and grey marls. Crystals
of salt and gypsum are intimately mixed with the grey marls; and
the so-called “Rochers de Sel” are capped with great blocks of
rock tumbled about in confusion, the position of which the author
ascribes to the failure of support due to the solution of the salt in the
underlying salt-marls. A thin series of bright red and green marls is
seen to overlie the Red Sandstones in several places; and above this
is an immense series of dark grey marls, interstratified with argil
lace0-calcareous bands, forming a great synclinal of the Hauts
 Plateaux, and a contorted mass on the Tell plateau. These are
probably cretaceous. At L'Aghouat they are overlain by fossiliferous
beds, probably of Miocene age.       Other Tertiary beds observed are
soft yellow calcareous freestones on the flanks of the promontory of
Algiers and of the Lesser Atlas, and some red and grey marls and
ferruginous freestone capping the Tell plateau, the former at a height
of 100–900 feet, and the latter of 2500–4000 feet above the sea
level. The plain of the Mitidja, between the Lesser Atlas and
Algiers, consists of grey loam with shingle-beds, of post-tertiary
age.    A similar loam covers the great plain of the northern Sahara,
and rises to a height of 2700 feet.    Raised beaches occur on the coast
up to an elevation of 600 feet above the sea-level; and similar beaches
are found inland, south of the Tell plateau, at a height of 2000 feet.
   The oldest land in the line of section is the anticlinal of mica
schist near Algiers, the strike of which is nearly at right angles to
that of the other rocks. The upheaval of the Mesozoic rocks was
contemporaneous with the first upheaval of the Lesser Atlas; it was
followed by a long period of denudation, and this by a subsidence of

at least 3000 feet in Tertiary times, during which the Miocene
deposits were formed. The Tell plateau was thus elevated at least
4000 feet, and the district north of the Lesser Atlas at least 1000
feet, the north face of those mountains probably marking a post
tertiary line of fault of 3000 feet. This operation was followed by
a long  period of denudation, and this by a post-tertiary depression,
which the author terms the “Sahara submergence,” after which the
land was reelevated at least 3000 feet, but perhaps considerably
more.    A gradual subsidence appears to be still taking place.
   2. “On the Trimerellidae, a Palaeozoic Family of the Palliobranchs
or Brachiopoda.”    By Thomas Davidson, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.,
and Prof. William King, Sc.D.
   In this memoir the authors describe in detail certain Brachiopoda,
for which they propose to establish a distinct family, discuss the
characters and affinities of the family, and indicate certain geological
considerations which arise from their study of its members.         The
first known species were described in 1853 under the names of
Obolus Davidsoni and 0. transversus; but in 1862 Mr. Billings de
scribed an allied form as constituting a new genus called Trimerella.
With this Gotlandia of Dall (1870) is identical.         In 1871 Prof. Hall
proposed the new genera Rhynobolus and Dinobolus; and in the
same year Mr. Billings established the genus Monomerella.            Rhyno
bolus is regarded by the authors as a synonym of Trimerella; and
several other proposed genera being similarly cancelled, the authors
retain only the genera Trimerella, Dinobolus, and Monomerella as
constituting their family Trimerellidae.
    The Trimerellidae are described as having a calcareous shell,
generally massive, with the umbo of the pedicle-valve often large,
pointed, solid or hollow; area usually of considerable size, with a
large solid deltidium; hinge of both valves slightly dentary; in
the interior of each valve there is a more or less elevated platform,
longitudinally placed, and either solid or doubly vaulted; and from
the middle of          its
                    anterior end     median plate occasionally projects
                                        a
into the anterior half      the valve, especially
                             of                            in
                                                       the brachial valve.
     Indiscussing the affinities     the new family, the authors enter
                                        of
in   considerable detail into the arrangement and functions               the     of
muscles      the Brachiopoda, and show, from the muscular indications
              of
and other characters       the Trimerellidae, that they are most nearly
                             of
allied    to
           the Lingulidae,  although presenting characters         sufficientof
importance       warrant their separation
                    is to                         distinct family.

    As far     as  present known, the Trimerellidae are confined
                    at                                                    the     to
Cambro-Silurian     and Silurian    systems;   but the authors indicate
the probability that          in
                              the Cambrian        early Cambro-Silurian

Lingula, and Obolus into close relationship,       regards their myology,
with each other and with Dinobolus.        Such         a as
                                                    form would constitute

 from the surface.                     There are other mines in the same vicinity in a
 like frozen state.
     From what we know of the depth to which frost usually pene
  trates into the earth, it does not appear probable that it could have
* reached the depth of 200 feet through the solid rock in the
  Stevens Mine, nor even through the crevice matter of the lode,
  which, as we have stated, is as hard as the rock itself. The idea,
  then, of the frost reaching such a depth from the outside being
                                   I
  utterly untenable, can see no other way than to fall back upon the
  Glacial era of the Quaternary.      Evidences of the Glacial Period
  are found         all
                 over the Rocky Mountains. Just above the Stevens
  Mine there are the remains           moraine nearly    mile long, and

  square and angular stones, clearly showing that they have not come
  from any great distance. And just over the range,           the Pacific                             on
  slope, there are the remains        the largest moraine  of  have ever                          I

This augmentation varies, too, a great deal, from one metal to an
other. We remark that tin, thallium, cadmium, zinc, lead, are
found together towards the upper part: at about 200° and 230° their
resistance has doubled. Still above them are found steel and iron :
the resistance of the latter has doubled at 180°, quadrupled at 430°,
at 860° is about nine times as great as at zero. Palladium and
platinum, on the contrary, approach the axis of the temperatures;
it is only in the vicinity of 400° and 450° that the augmentation
has acquired a value equal to that of the primitive resistance. Gold,
copper, silver, form an intermediate group.          It may therefore be
said  generally that, the less elevated the  fusing-point   of a metal, the
more   rapidly  does      conductivity  its

UP ofto the present time there does not exist complete theory    a

        the magnet.    Notwithstanding the relative simplicity
of the phenomena presented by soft iron, one could not expect to
explain these apart; and the study of steel magnets is still too
      advanced to supply the elements of a satisfactory physical
theory.
                                         I
    Such being the situation, thought that an experimental and
close investigation of the phenomena presented by steel magnets
 (e.g. those accompanying their production, union, or separation)
would not be devoid of interest.        The present is a first attempt
in this direction. The questions which form the subject of                               it,
though hitherto very little studied, would yet offer numerous
numerical verifications for any accurate theory            magnetism;  of
and this would suffice          to
                              render   highly  important  researches                     of

in the axis of a spiral excited by the current. Several of these
physicists treat also, subsidiarily, the same question for steel.
As regards the accessory phenomena accompanying magnetiza
tion, they are so numerous and varied that they constitute an
inexhaustible   mine which still, notwithstanding numerous
labours, has scarcely been touched.     We will cite only those
memoirs which have the closest connexion with the subject of
the present investigation.
   Queteletº studied the magnetism produced in a bar of steel
by friction with a magnet.     He established that the magnetism
increases, up to a certain limit, with the number of the frictions,
according to precise laws, to which we will return by-and-by.
Hermann               i
              and Scholzi, under the direction of Franken
heimS, proved an analogous augmentation       when a bar of steel
is brought near the pole (free or covered with paper) of an elec
tromagnet, or when a steel bar is several times introduced into a
spiral traversed by a current.

netic axis of the needle                  M   (fig. 1) makes, with the plane of the
magnetic      meridian             NS,      an angle a determined by the equation

If the moment a is sufficiently small in proportion to M, the
angle a can be determined by Poggendorff's optical method+.
For that purpose the support of the needles carries a small ver
tical silvered mirror, in which, with the aid of a telescope, the
image of a horizontal graduated scale is observed, which is placed
beneath and very near the objective, and perpendicular to the
optic axis of the telescope.
   The moment M of the directing needle may be made as small
as we please.    It follows that it is possible by this method to
measure the    magnetic  moment of very small needles, comparable
in their dimensions to particles of file-dust.     have been able                         I
to effect measurements relative to needles of 2 millims. length
and 0.2 millim. diameter.

  The optic axis of the telescope will be normal to the mirror
when the image of the objective occupies the centre of the field.
The other conditions, relative to the scale, may be fulfilled ap
proximately; and we shall see by-and-by how this is accom
plished.
     It
      is to be remarked that, when a needle is introduced into the
axis of the tube T, the centre of gravity of the suspended system
is in general displaced slightly; but it is easy to see that this
displacement has no influence on the readings.         In fact we can
produce the corresponding displacement of the suspended system
by the combination of two rotations:—one about an axis per
pendicular to the mirror, without influence on the phenomenon
of reflection; the second about a horizontal axis parallel to the
 mirror, the effect of which is to raise or lower the normal to the
mirror in a vertical plane—that           raise       is,

It will therefore be sufficient to take the mean of the two obser

   Again, in the preceding we have supposed that the magnetic
meridian is invariable, which is not rigorously true; besides, our
apparatus realizes a veritable compass of variations; consequently
the error resulting from the variations of the declination is an
appreciable quantity in the conditions in which we are placed.
   Except the case of abrupt and irregular variations, this cause
of error will be eliminated by making a third measurement after
restoring the needle to                          its

 values proportional  parts are taken.
    The masses of iron distributed, in fixed positions, in the labo
 ratory where the operations are carried on, have no influence on
 the measurements, provided that they are not too near the appa
 ratus; they merely modify the azimuth of equilibrium, which
 we take for our magnetic meridian.
    In short, a space of ten minutes is sufficient for accomplishing
 a good experiment; and the result of several successive measure
 ments of the same needle furnishes, in general, numbers equal
 within glo of their value.    Moreover the operation becomes so
 simple and convenient with practice, that we prefer to employ
 this method even in those cases in which the oscillation method
 would give good results.
   Comparison of several Apparatus, and Absolute Measures.—One
 has often to compare       several apparatus.    This is accomplished
 by effecting the measurement of the moment of one and the
 same needle by means of two apparatus which we wish to com
 pare.   Another needle, suitably selected (larger, for instance),
 will permit the comparison of the second apparatus with a third,
and so on.
   Further, all the relative measures can be converted into abso
lute measures: for this it is sufficient to determine, by the oscil
lation method, the magnetic moment of a needle, and afterwards
measure it by means of the apparatus which have been compared.
              II.   ON MAGNETIZATION BY CURRENTs.
                         1. On Eartra Currents.
   A coil of conducting wires possesses magnetic properties as
long as it is traversed by a current. During the time occupied
in establishing the current the production of this magnet absorbs
a certain quantity of work in addition to that which would be
necessary to establish the current in an equal linear resistance.
This absorption of work is manifested outside the coil by the in
Verse extra current.
   When the current is interrupted, the destruction of the mag
netic property of the coil restores the work absorbed in        itspro
 duction; hence the direct extra current, equal         quantity
                                                       in          to

inverse.    As experiment shows that the first     is shorter in dura
tion than the second,       wecan affirm that the magnetic property
of the coilis  lost more  quickly than         produced.

     The curious augmentation in question has been already ob
  served by Hermann and Scholz”.                   They wrongly confound, in
  their researches,      the effect of a    magnetizing       spiral and that of a
  horseshoe    magnet,      to the   poles of which     they   apply the needle to
  be magnetized.          In the first case, indeed, if the needle is thin
  enough, it may be regarded as placed in a magnetic field of con
  stant intensity, which it certainly is not in the second; and as it
  is impossible to place the needle in precisely the same manner in
  a great number of successive experiments, the law of the increase
  is masked by a phenomenon of a different kind.                       These authors

  Thirty passages to the spiral did not raise much the magnetic
moment of this needle *.   The results obtained by the disrup
tive discharges are less regular than the preceding, although the
empiric formula still represents them.      The irregularities doubt
less proceed from the difficulty of working these discharges in
 perfectly identical conditions.
    The preceding experiments already establish that the extra
 currents are without magnetic action within the coil which pro
 duces them.     If it were otherwise, interruption would be a more
 efficacious process of magnetization than passing the needle to
 the spiral; now augmentation of the magnetic moment has never
been observed when needles magnetized by a great number of
passages have been submitted to repeated breakings of the
clfcult.
      II.
      The circuit comprises, besides the pile, two coils P and Q.
  The phenomena observed on account of slow passages are the
same as in the case of a single coil; but the effect of the extra
currents complicates the phenomena                         arising from interruption.
We will suppose the coil P much more powerful than Q. If the
two coils are placed one after the other, two needles p and q,
magnetized, each in the corresponding coil, to the limit relative
to the passages, acquire a greater magnetic moment through the
interruptions; but the relative increment is much greater in the
less powerful coil.  Example:–

    Therefore, conformably to the observations we have previously
given, the extra current proceeding from P is sensible in Q, that
from Q in P, but the magnetic effect of each is nil in the coil
from which it emanates.
    If the coils   P and Q are placed as derivations with respect to
one    another,   the direct extra current of each coil traverses the
other in a direction contrary to the current from the pile.                  In
this case experiment shows that the interruptions occasion a                 di
minution of the magnetic moment, and the establishments an
augmentation, as might have been foreseen from what precedes.
    III.  The circuit comprises a coil and a condenser.
    This   case  is realized with a Ruhmkorff coil in the following
manner: the condenser C (fig. 4) is fixed in a derivation desti
tute of resistance, on which the interruptions are practised.
The coil B may also be placed in the derivation, and the inter
 ruption be produced in a point of the principal circuit (fig. 5).
                     Fig. 4.                              Fig. 5.
  In   each   of these arrangements the condenser forms with the
  coil a closed circuit apart from the interruption, either directly
  or by the intermediation of the pile. It would not be the same
  if the interruption were made in the principal circuit with the
  arrangement of fig. 4, or in the derivation in the case of fig. 5:
  these last two arrangements are useless, as experiment has
  shown; but if one of the former be employed, the rupture of
  the circuit is observed to produce a diminution of the magnetic
  moment of the needles magnetized by being passed to the coil.
      The effect observed cannot be attributed to the extra currents
  of the condenser; for these act in a direction contrary to the
  result obtained.     The condenser employed 4 behaves, with respect
  to the production of extra currents, like a coil of negligible
 power.
     * That of a Ruhmkorff   coil, of which the explosion-distance is 3 centims.

    But it must be remarked that the intensity of the extra current
 of the coil is superior to that of the principal current. The
 direct extra current strongly charges the condenser, which must
 consequently discharge itself after the extra current has ceased.
 The coil thus receives, by reflection, the extra current which it
 has produced, and is traversed by it in the opposite direction to
 that of the principal current.      The reflex effect       for given                          is,        a
 condenser, the more intense the more powerful the coil em
 ployed; and experiment shows that with             very feeble coil the         a
 effect  of
          the  interruption   vanishes.

freely admit the force of Professor Piazzi Smyth's remarks on
the difficulty of volatilizing carbon; but that does not appear to
me to affect the experimental evidence for my assertion that “this
spectrum is the spectrum of carbon, and not of a hydrocarbon
or any other compound of carbon.” That evidence is very
simple; this spectrum can be obtained alike from compounds of
carbon with hydrogen, with nitrogen, with oxygen, with sulphur,
and with chlorine.
    Whether or not the spectrum is produced by the vapour of
carbon is another question; but if this spectrum                  Professor                     is,   as

    These are strong terms, especially when penned by an Astro
nomer Royal, and with the deliberation involved in the circum
stances of serial publication.    Very strong experimental evidence
obtained by himself would surely scarcely justify an Astronomer
Royal in the employment of such terms.            Yet (will it be be
lieved?) not a tittle of such evidence is   forthcoming.    Nay, the
spectrum which I stated to be that of carbon, a statement con
firmed over and over again by eminent chemists and physicists
(Plücker, Morren, Marshall Watts), Mr. Piazzi Smyth asserts is
not only not that of carbon, but solely that of a hydrocarbon—
again an assertion unsupported by any experimental evidence what
ever.    It is true that Mr. Smyth quotes Lielegg and Crookes
against me.      But Lielegg supports me, and Crookes is cited be
cause of an editorial footnote in the ‘Chemical News’ appended to
a notice of Morren’s paper, asking experimentalists what they
meant by the “vapour of carbon ’’ existing in a flame.         As for
Lielegg,   I will quote without comment the last sentence but one
of his paper (Eng. trans. in Phil. Mag. March 1869, p. 216:—
“Therefore tubes filled with combinations of carbon and hydro
gen show the lines of carbon and those of hydrogen; tubes
filled with carbonic oxide or carbonic acid gas show those of
carbon and oxygen, giving, in fact, a spectrum of carbon, be
cause the extremely small pressure and the high temperature co
 operate in reducing the carbon to a gaseous condition.” Plücker,
 who, with Faraday, General Sabine, and Geissler, spent two or three
 hours with me at the Royal Institution minutely examining my
 spectra—Plücker afterwards writes, on Nov. 12, 1862: “Je suis
 d’accord avec vous sur l’existence du spectre de la vapeur de car
 bone.” Morren says, on page 6 of the paper already mentioned,
 “Je me mis done au travail avec la pensée précongue de com
 battre l'assertion émise par le savant anglais; mais il résulte, au
 contraire, des expériences auxquelles je me suis livré, que M.
 Attfield a raison, et que c’est bien la vapeur du carbone qui
 donne le spectre indiqué plus haut.”
    I might just refer to some minor statements made by Mr.
 Piazzi Smyth.      He says, in a paper to which he draws atten
 tion as not having been accepted, as he desired, by the Roysl
 Astronomical Society, but afterwards printed in the ‘Observa
 tions’ of his own observatory, that the question put by Crookes
 was never answered.       I answered it at once, and the reply was
 inserted in the ‘Chemical News’ a fortnight after the question
 was asked.      I did not work “in a rich London laboratory.”
 With   ordinary  induction-coils, borrowed, the one from a captain
 in the army, the other from Mr. Gassiot; with a spectroscope

   The resistance of the b branch in each station       can now be
easily calculated from the balance equations and the values given
for g' and g”.
   The value of the b branch must be calculated in order to be
able to ascertain that marimum part of b which will have to be
made variable in increments for the purpose of adjusting balance;
and to this interesting question we shall revert further on.
   The general solution of the problem might now be considered
complete if it were not for the currents which produce the sig
mals, of which we do not know as yet with certainty that we have
the maxima in the solution given above.        It must, however, be
understood that this solution   represents   the only true one from
our  physical point of view, and that, if it should not be identical
with that giving the maxima currents when considered generally
 by themselves from the beginning, the solution would not be
 thereby invalidated, but only the duplex method in question
 would prove to be not quite so perfect as could be desired. The
 sequel, however, will show that the relation a-d=g=f repre
sents also the maxima currents that are possible under the cir
cumstances.      As this investigation is of great importance in
forming a correct opinion of the value of the method, it will be
fully gone into.
    Maxima Currents.--When considering the question of cur
rents for any telegraphic circuit, the two conditions which inva
riably should be fulfilled are:—
   First. Greatest possible constancy of current.
   Secondly. Maximum current.
    How far these two conditions can be fulfilled simultaneously
depends clearly on the special circuit and the special arrange
ments adopted; but so much is certain, that, from a practical
point of view, the first condition (constancy of current) will
always be of far greater importance than the second, inasmuch
as the required strength of currents can be obtained by employ
ing cells efficient in kind, sufficient in number, and properly
arranged to suit requirements.
   Thus in our case, when we consider the currents which pro
duce the signals in duplex telegraphy, before going to the condi
tion of maximum current we must ascertain first the condition
of greatest possible constancy of current.
   Now it has been proved before that immediate balance in each
station is requisite in order to make the effect of any disturbance
on the receiving instrument as small as the circumstances will
allow of.     But as these disturbances were considered with
respect to one and the same instrument   (i.  independently
                                               e.              of the
magnetic moment), these disturbances are then simply due            to
the disturbances  in the signalling current; from which   it follows

                                    of Dupler Telegraphy.                                         121
at once that the fulfilment of the immediate balance condition is
required also in order to have the greatest possible constancy in
the signalling current. Thus, when investigating the question
of maxima currents, we are justified in presupposing the rigid
fulfilment of the immediate balance for both stations, i. e.
                                              ad—gf=0.
  Further, as it has been shown before that the fulfilment of the
regularity-condition
                          a   d =g=f              -
for both stations does make the effect of the disturbances still
smaller, we have only to investigate the current at balance, and
to show that the condition of maximum current becomes iden
tical with the regularity-condition, whence it would follow that
the duplex method under consideration is perfect in every con
ceivable respect.
   The question to be solved stands, therefore, as follows:–
   Two signalling currents, the expressions of which are known,
have to be made simultaneous marima, while the different variables
are linked together by four condition equations.
   Thus

publication in the Journal of the Society, I was unacquainted
with the fact that a most complete history of duplex telegraphy
had been published by Dr. Karl Eduard Zetzsche” (Leipzig,
1865). According to Professor Zetzschet, the bridge method of
duplex telegraphy was already invented in 1863 by Maron, a
Prussian telegraph-inspector;       and Dr. Zetzsche very truly
remarks that the    bridge  method would seem to be that least
affected by variations in the resistance of the line. To this, from
an historical point of view, most valuable book I refer the reader.
It is to be hoped that an English translation of it may soon be
published.

July 12, 1874; also Bullettino del Vulcanismo Italiano, fascicolo
6, 7, Rome, July and August 1874; also Bollettino del R. Comi
tato Geologico d’Italia), of the eruptive phenomena which have
been observed since last May in the interior of the great central
crater of Etna,    expressed an opinion which attracted such ge
                      I
neral attention as to be quoted in the principal Italian and foreign
journals, to the effect that an early outbreak on the Mongibello
 side, and a great eruption immediately after, were to be expected.
 This opinion has been fulfilled in less than two months, but for
 tunately (as    I
                 am about to relate) under such conditions as not
to produce serious damage, except the consequences of the fear
and terror which are generally excited by the more formidable
phenomena of this mighty volcano.
    After an uninterrupted succession of eruptive phenomena in
the central crater, which has in consequence undergone remark
able modifications, at 4 o’clock on the morning of Saturday,
August 29, the rural population scattered round the base or on
the slope of the mountain on           its

hasty retreat into the open country, might observe near the crest
of the mountain a column of thick black smoke and burning
matter which was driven into the air with great impetus and
fell again, scattered by the wind, the lighter portions in the
form of small scoriae and sand at a considerable distance.
Shortly afterwards this column appeared, to those looking from
north to south, as if it became larger at the base, whilst looking
from east to west there seemed to be numerous columns inclined
slightly towards the north. These, like the first, consisted of
thick smoke and burning matter, which in the darkness of night
looked like a grand display of fireworks with a constant emission
of colossal rays.
   This phenomenon      was at the same time accompanied by
those rumblings which usually manifest themselves when the
lava is about to burst forth from the earth, and lasted with great
intensity for seven hours on the 29th, from 4 till 11 A.M.        For
the rest of that day, and during the night of the 29th, the violence
of the outbreak diminished; and on Sunday the 30th              force                 its

 incessantly for the first eight days.     Those who         this time           at
visited the country lying north                of
                                       Etna received      most dismal        a
impression.       All the inhabitants, poor and rich alike, have
forsaken     their dwellings; the streets and squares and the

128                 Prof. O. Silvestri on the Eruption of Etna
neighbouring fields are encumbered with beds and tents, and
with huts formed in a thousand ways, in which whole families
have taken refuge, and temporary altars as a substitute for the
churches now closed to the worshippers.        This forced emigra
tion of the inhabitants from their houses is perhaps no longer
necessary, as the shocks of earthquake have become less felt and
less numerous; and in fact even during the first few days, when
they were the strongest, the shocks, being simply undulatory
and not upheaving, did little damage beyond some cracks in a
few old walls.   But experience, by which the people are ruled,
has habituated the country folks to dread their burning moun
tain, which, however, being with its fruitful soil the cause of
their wealth, they will not abandon.     They rather resign them
selves with a sort of indifference to the tribute of sacrifice which
Etna sometimes requires of them.
    After this preface I will now give an abstract of the observa
         I
tions made on the scene of the eruption, which contains the
exact details of the volcanic disturbance we have witnessed at
Mongibello.
    On the day in question (August 29), at 4 P.M., when the two
powerful shocks of earthquake were felt, starting from the ele
vated base of the great central crater, at a point on the north
side where the crest which surrounds and limits the hollow
 (known as the elliptical crater) presents a remarkable depression,
and descending for a distance of five kilometres to the level of the
so-called “Timpa Rossa” and of the Monte Nero, the earth was
rent by the violent shock, which, to judge from                                a its
                                                         effects, must
have been       extraordinary force; this produced

                                  on the        29th of August, 1874.                                         129
300 metres and a diameter of about 100 metres, and a height of
50 metres from its base: this, with an inclination of the sides of
about 30°, gives us a base of 860 metres circumference; and
the mound occupies therefore an area of 117,734 square metres.
This crater, which looks like a new mountain, is formed of a
heap of fragments of doleritic and prehistoric labradoritic lavas
of a grey colour, which have been brought up from a great
depth by the force of the outbreak of modern lava, which seems
in parts to have kneaded the other together. It is singular to see
all round this new crater for         area    half kilometre radius,

widely distant epochs brought into contact—one representing                                                       an

                      man can have witnessed, the other produced
 by    eruption
         an          today.
   The interior        the crater exhibits the usual funnel-shaped
form; but           its
                depth has                          no
                               visible limits. We look across      dark                               a

another.     The structure and     origin     this crater are     great of                           of
scientific interest.
   Moving from this culminating point and following the chasm
 on which        placed, we find that for some distance
                   it   is                                 passes                                    it

slightly tortuous       direction, the most

extends for a length of 3 kilometres, with a width varying from
60 to 3 metres. This is set in the direction N. 8° E., and if
extended upwards would join on to the central crater of Etna
like a sort of ray, which, prolonged downwards to the extreme
circumference            of the mountain, would meet the old crater of
Majo.             Besides     this principal            chasm there are innumerable
cracks which seem collateral                         and radiating from the centres of
strong dynamic action.
   2nd. Next to this chasm the principal effect of the eruption is
the new mountain, raised up in a few hours, which constitutes the
crater, formed of a regularly shaped heap of blocks and frag
ments of old labradoritic lavas brought up by the shock from
the great depths and partly cemented together by the new lava.
Then also there are the      groups          six
                                       small craters, numbering of
in    all
        thirty-five, which, following the eruption, constitute                                                    a
system       of
           elevated crater-shaped mounds.

that which      spread over
                    is          vast belt  the form

scoria, and sand, also constitutes two torrents, one 150 metres
long, the other 400 metres.

when the shocks are felt.
     It
      suffices to mention the earthquakes which agitated the east
ern side of Etna when the external manifestations of the erup
tion of 1865 had just ceased, specially that terrible one in the
neighbourhood of Giarre, which destroyed the village called
Fondo Macchia. These earthquakes gradually decreased in
 number and intensity in the direct ratio which is observed in the
 movement of the lava in an eruption, which by gradually checking
 itself soon ceases altogether. The eruptive apparatus, still hot and
 smoking and placed thus along an abyss of lava, we must believe
 will now remain inactive, and that a great eruption is not to be
 expected as imminent; since it seems strange to admit that
 when the intensity of the volcanic force has reached the point of
 creating this imposing apparatus, it should then have chosen to
 interrupt          its
                  course after        few hours' eruption,

     -
solar spectrum with Fraunhofer lines was formed by a diffraction
grating, I have resorted to the following method of forming such
solar spectra, a description of which may prove of interest to
those who are experimenting in the same field.
   The grating generally used was made by Mr. L. M. Ruther
furd : it is ruled on speculum-metal, 6481 lines to the inch ; it
gives spectra by reflection.  Other gratings on glass, now in my
possession, give spectra by reflection and by transmission. The
method answers equally well for both.     It may be briefly stated
as   follows:–

   A beam of light is directed by the silvered plane mirror of a
heliostat (A) into a darkened room.
   It is received on an achromatic lens (B) 10 centims. in dia
meter; focal distance from posterior surface 70 centims.
   A slit (C) is then placed within the focus of this lens, the
distance being 48 centims. from the lens (B).
   After passing through the narrow slit, which is about one tenth
of a millimetre wide, the light is received upon a second achro
matic lens (D), of the same diameter as the first, but with a focal

distance of 115 centims. The distance of this lens from the slit
is 164 centims. ; and the focusing of the lines of the spectrum on
a paper screen or on the ground glass of the camera is accom
plished by moving the lens (D) nearer to or further from the
slit (C), or by moving the camera or screen (F) itself.
    The grating (E), mounted on a suitable stand, is placed at a
distance of 80 centims. from the second lens.    All parts of the
apparatus being carefully adjusted, so that A, B, C, D, E are
on the same horizontal axis, the grating is then arranged on                                                           its

extremities of each spectrum.     In the spectra of the first order
on each  side, the screen is placed very nearly at right angles to
a line drawn from the grating to B in the spectrum.        As each
order in succession is examined, the divergence from this angle
is greater and greater, and at the same time the focal distance
of the lines moves nearer to the grating.
   The lenses                I
                 have employed were those of a very fine photo
graphic combination; they give with the rest of the arrangement
a spectrum in which the definition of the lines is perfect, and
they are present by hundreds. Though the lenses are 10 centims.
in diameter, only the central portion of each is used, a diaphragm
with a circular aperture of 5 centims. or less being placed in
front of B.
   To form the absorbent spectra of any organic substance, a
suitable solution of the same is poured into a cell with parallel
sides.  This is placed at any convenient point between A and B,
care being taken that the faces of the cell are at right angles to
the course of the ray A, B.    The slit may in this case be opened
wider, when each spectrum will show the characteristic absorbent
bands of the substance employed, the position being indicated
(and, if required, recorded) by their relation to the lines of the
solar spectrum in which they are produced.
   When the calcium or electric light is to be used for lecture
room demonstration of diffraction-spectra,  the lens (B) should
have as short a focus and as large a diameter as possible.        The

                         Mr. R. Mallet         on Volcanic Energy.                                   145
remarks here that, upon the basis of the heat annually dissipated
from our globe being equal to that evolved by the melting of 777
cubic miles of ice at zero to water at the same temperature, and
of the experimental data contained in his paper, he had demon
strated, in terms of mean crushed rock, the annual supply of heat
derivable from the transformation of the mechanical work of con
traction available for volcanic energy, and had also estimated the
proportion of that amount of heat necessary to support the annual
vulcanicity now active on our globe; but, from the want of
necessary data, he had refrained from making any calculation as
to what amount in volume of the solid shell of our earth must be
crushed annually, in order to admit of the shell following down
after the more rapidly contracting nucleus. This calculation he
now makes upon the basis of certain allowable suppositions, where
the want of data requires such to be made, and for assumed thick
nesses of solid shell of 100, 200, 400, and 800 miles respectively.
    From the curve of total contraction (plate x. Phil. Trans. part i.
 1873) obtained by his experiments on the contraction of slags,
he has now deduced partial mean coefficients of contraction for a
 reduction in temperature of 1° Fahr., for intervals generally of
about 500° for the entire scale, between a temperature somewhat
 exceeding that of the blast-furnace and that of the atmosphere,
 or 53°Fahr.      And applying the higher of these coefficients to the
 data of his former paper, and to the suppositions of the present,
 he has obtained the absolute contraction in volume of the nuclei
 appertaining to the respective thicknesses of solid shell above
 stated. In order that the shell may follow down and remain in
 contact with the contracted nucleus, either its thickness must be
 increased,       its
                 volume remaining constant,                              or

   “On Combination of Colour by means of Polarized Light.”                                  By
 W. Spottiswoode, M.A., Treas. and V.P.R.S.
  The results of combining two or more colours of the spectrum
have been studied by Helmholtz, Clerk Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh,
 and others; and the combinations have been effected sometimes
 by causing two spectra at right angles to one another to overlap,
 and sometimes by bringing images of various parts of a spectrum
 simultaneously upon the retina.         Latterly also W. v. Bezold has
 successfully applied the method of binocular combination to the
 same problem (Poggendorff, Jubelband, p. 585).           Some effects, ap
 proximating more or less to these, may be produced by chromatic
 polarization.
    Complementary Colours.-First, as regards complementary colours.
If   we use a Nicol's prism, N, as polarizer, a plate of quartz, Q,
 cut perpendicularly to the axis, and a double-image prism, P, as
 analyzer, we shall, as is well known, obtain two images whose colours
 are complementary.        If we analyze these images with a prism, we
 shall find, when the quartz is of suitable thickness, that each spec
 trum contains a dark band, indicating the extinction of a certain
 narrow portion of        length; these bands will simultaneously shift
                             its
 their  position when the Nicol         Nturned round.
                                             is             Now, since the
          remaining            spectrum       complementary
                                                                                            is in

                    Red,                Green-blue ;
                    Orange,             Cyanic blue;

                    Yellow-green,       Violet.
   When in one spectrum the band enters the green, in the other a
band will be seen on the outer margin of the red and a second at
the opposite end of the violet—showing that to the green there
does not correspond one complementary colour, but a mixture of
violet and red, i.e. a reddish purple.
   Combination of two Colours.-Next as to the combination of two
parts of the spectrum, or of the tints which represent those parts.
If, in addition to the apparatus described above, we use a second
quartz plate, Q, and a second double-image prism, P., we shall form
four images, say O O, OE, EO, EE ; and if A, A' be the com
plementary tints extinguished by the first combination QP alone,
and B, B' those extinguished by the second Q, P, alone, then it will
be found that the following pairs of tints are extinguished in the
various images:—
                    Image.             Tints  extinguished.
                     OO                       B, A,
                     OE                        B', A',
                     EO                       B', A,
                     EE                        B, A'.
   It is to be noticed that in the image OE the combination Q, P,
has extinguished the tint B' instead of B, because the vibrations'
in the image E were perpendicular to those in the image O formed
by the combination QP. A similar remark applies to the image E.E.
   The total number of tints which can be produced by this double
combination QP, Q, P, is as follows:–
                               4 single images,
                               6 overlaps of two,
                               4 overlaps of three,
                               1 overlap of four.
                     Total.. 15
   Collateral Combinations.—The tints extinguished in the overlap
O O-H-EO will be B, A, B, A.; but since B and B' are complemen
tary, their suppression will not affect the resulting tint except as
to intensity, and the overlap will be effectively deprived of A alone;
in other words, it will be of the same tint as the image O would
be if the combination Q, P, were removed. Similarly the overlap
O E--EE will be deprived effectually of A'alone; in other words,
it will be of the same tint as E, if Q, P, were removed. If therefore

      I48                    Royal   Society:-Mr. W.              Spottiswoode          on
      the Nicol N be turned round, these two overlaps will behave in
      respect of colour exactly as did the images O and E when QP was
      alone used. We may, in fact, form a Table thus:–
                         Image.                              Colours extinguished.
                   O O-H-EO                        B +A +B'+A =B+B'+A = A
                   O E-HEE                         B'+A'+B+A'-B+B'+A'-A'.
       And since the tints B, B' have disappeared from each of these for
       mulae, it follows that the second analyzer P may be turned round
       in any direction without altering the tints of the overlaps in question.
          In like manner we may form the Table
                  O O-H-BE                     B + A +B+A'-B + A+A’= B
                  O    E-HEO                   B'+A'+B'+A =B'+A+A'-B'.
       Hence if the Nicol N be turned round, these overlaps will retain
       their tints; while if the analyzer P, be turned, their tints will vary,
       although always remaining complementary to one another.
          There remains the other pair of overlaps, viz.:-
                                O O-HO E                     B + A+B'+A'
                                EO  + EE                     B'+A+B+A'.
          Each of these is deprived of the pair of complementaries A, A',
       B, B'; and therefore  each, as it would seem, ought to appear white
       of low illumination, i. e. grey. This effect, however, is partially
       masked by the fact that the dark bands are not sharply defined like
       the Fraunhofer lines, but have a core of minimum or zero illumina
       tion, and are shaded off gradually on either side until at a short
...    distance from the core the colours appear       their full intensity.
                                                                          in
       Suppose, for instance, that      and     were bright tints, the tint

       resulting from their suppression would        bright;             be

which imply that the images OO and OE may have the same tint,
but that EO and EE need not on that account be complementary.
They will differ in tint in this, that EE, having lost the same
tints as EO, will have lost also the tint A, and will have received
besides the addition of two measures of the tint A'.
   Effect of Combinations of two Colours.-A similar train of rea

interest of these parts of the figure consists in this, that each of
the triple overlaps is complementary to the fourth single image,

             Prof. Tyndall on the Transmission of Sound.            151
by Helmholtz, viz. that the low-tint colours (couleurs dégradées),
such as russet, brown, olive-green, peacock-blue, &c., are the result
of relatively low illumination.       He mentioned that he obtained
these effects by diminishing the intensity of the light in the colours
to be examined, and by, at the same time, maintaining a brilliantly
illuminated patch in an adjoining part of the field of view.          If
therefore we use the combination N, Q, P, P, (i.e. if we remove
the second quartz plate), we can, by turning the prism P round,
diminish to any required extent the intensity of the light in one
pair of the complementary images, and at the same time increase
that in the other pair.      This is equivalent to the conditions of
Helmholtz's    experiments;    and the tints in question will be found
to be  produced.
    “Further Experiments on the Transmission          of Sound.”     By
John Tyndall, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., &c.
    The author describes a number of experiments made with hete
rogeneous atmospheres obtained by saturating alternate layers of air
with the vapours of various volatile liquids. Starting from his ob
servation on the transmission of sound through a snow-storm on
the Mer de Glace, in the winter of 1859, he shows the extraordi
nary power of sound to pass through the interstices of solid bodies
as long as the continuity of the air is preserved. Sound, for example,
penetrates through twelve layers of a silk handkerchief, while a
single layer of the same handkerchief dipped into water, so as to
fill the interstices, cuts off the sound.
    He also describes numerous experiments with artificial fogs
of a density so great that a depth of three feet sufficed to inter
cept the concentrated beam of the electric light; the effect of
such fogs on sound was sensibly nil. Experiments were also exe
cuted on the illumination of such fogs by sudden flashes, obtained
by the combustion of gunpowder or gun-cotton, or by the alternate
extinction and revival of the electric and other lights.   Such flashes
promise to be extremely useful as fog-signals.
    The author corrects the mistake of supposing that, in the expe
riments at the South Foreland, the lower trumpets were not com
pared with the higher ones. This, in fact, was the first step of
the inquiry.
    He also communicated an extraordinary instance of the intercep
tion of sound during one of the battles of the late American war.
    In these experiments the author has been ably aided by his assist
ant, Mr. John Cottrell.       An account of the experiments will be
found in a paper now printing for the Philosophical Transactions.

    The following communication was read:—
    “Note on the occurrence of Sapphires and Rubies in situ with
Corundum, at the Culsagee Corundum Mines, Macon Co., North
Carolina.”       By Col. C. W. Jenks.
    The mine described in this paper is in a hill situated about
nine miles east of Franklin, the chief town of Macon County, rising
about 400 feet above the valley. The hill is a boss of serpentine
protruded through the surrounding granite.          The corundum occurs
in five nearly parallel veins, cropping out for about a mile along the
steep side of the hill in a direction N.E. and S.W. The veins all
dip to the S.E. about 45°. They are thin at the surface, but widen
out as they descend, the thickness of the vein in the deepest working
(75 feet) being about 10 feet. They consist of a mass of chlorite,
Jefferisite, and corundum, the latter forming from one third to one
half of the mass, and occurring in crystals imbedded in the other
minerals.       The author gives a list of several minerals which also
 occur in the veins, including two new silicates, which Prof. Genth
has called Kerrite and Maconite.        Analyses of some of these minerals
and of the       serpentine  rock are  appended   to the paper. Some of
the     crystals  of corundum    weigh   as much as 300 pounds.       The
 corundum is crushed and used for grinding and polishing stones,
 glass, and metal; about 200 tons have been extracted from the
mine. The colour of the crystals is very variable; and some of them
show different colours in different parts. Many rubies and sapphires
 have been already procured and cut for setting.
        March 11th, 1874.—John Evans, Esq., F.R.S., President,
                                 in the Chair.
     The following communications were read:—
     1.  “On the relationship existing between the Echinothuridae,
 Wyville      Thomson, and the Perischoechinidae, McCoy.”           By R.
 Etheridge, Esq., jun., F.G.S.
   . In this paper the author referred in the first place to the peculiar
 characters of the genera Calveria and Phormosoma, Wyville Thom
 son, and especially to those in which they approach the Cretaceous
 genus Echinothuria, S. P. Woodward, and which led Prof. Wyville
 Thomson to include these three forms in his group Echinothuridae.
 He remarked that an overlapping of the interambulacral plates,
 more or less like that occurring in these three genera, is met with
 also in Archaeocidaris, McCoy, and Lepidechinus, Hall, belonging to
 the group of palaeozoic Echini which McCoy proposed to call
 Perischoechinidae, and which is characterized by the presence of
 more than three rows of plates in the interambulacral areas.          As

      Mr. W. Shone     on some Boulder-clay   Foraminifera, &c.   153
there is no overlapping of these plates in the other genera referred
to this group, it includes two types of structure.    The author then
discussed the characters presented by the test in the genera of the
Perischoechinidae (namely Archarocidaris, Palaechinus, Perischodomus,
Lepidechinus, Eocidaris, Melonites, and Oligoporus), and pointed
out that although we have no conclusive evidence of the presence of
membranous interspaces along with the overlapping plates in
Archaeocidaris, the fragmentary condition in which the remains of
that form are usually found would lead us to infer their existence.
No known palaeozoic genus exhibits the want of distinction between
the ambulacra and interambulacra on the ventral half of the test
seen in the recent genus Phormosoma.       In Melonites and Oligoporus
the author described an increase in the number of rows of plates in
the ambulacra, and he indicated that all the Perischoechinidae differ
from the later Echini by the increased number of perforations in
the ocular and genital plates.
    2. “On the discovery of Foraminifera &c. in the Boulder-clays of
Cheshire.”     By William Shone, Esq., jun.
    In this paper the author described the occurrence of Foraminifera,
Entomostraca, and some other small organic bodies in the Boulder
 clay at Newton by Chester and at Dawpool.           They were found
 partly in the interior of specimens of Turritella terebra, a.d partly
 free in the Boulder-clay; but those obtained from the Turritellae
 were in better condition than the others. The Foraminifera gene
 rally agree precisely with those found in the tidal parts of the river
 Dee.     The author stated further that the Turritellae containing
 Foraminifera are filled with a fine greyish-white sand, in which
 the minute fossils abound; and he discussed the probable conditions
 under which the deposit containing them had been formed.
     3. “On the occurrence of a Tremadoc area near the Wrekin in
 South Shropshire, with description of a new Fauna.”        By Charles
  Callaway, Esq., M.A., B.Sc., &c.
     The author stated that in an exposure of light-green micaceous
  shales dipping south-east at 50° at Shineton near Cressage, which
  are represented as of Caradoc age in the Geological-Survey Map, he
  found a series of Trilobites and other fossils which induced him to
  regard these Shineton shales as belonging to the Lower Tremadoc
  series.   He described as new species Asaphus Eos, Conocoryphe
  Salteri, C. angulifrons, Platypeltis Croftii, Conophrys salopiensis,
  Lichapyge cuspidata, Lingulella Nicholsoni, Metoptoma Sabrinae,
  and Theca lineata. The author regarded these shales as the equi
 valents of beds containing Dictyonema found near Malvern and at

  ON THE EXPRESSION OF THE WORK RELATIVE TO AN ELEMEN
             TARY TRANsformation.            By J. MoUTIER.
 M     •
         CLAUSIUS      has recently given a demonstration of Carnot's
          theorem, founded on the expression of the work relative to
an elementary transformation on the hypothesis now generally ad
 mitted, in which heat is considered to be a mode of motion.         M.
 Ledieu arrived at the same result by a different path. These solu
tions leave the nature of the motion undetermined, and by that very
 fact present the greatest generality.      My intention is to treat the
same question by admitting that heat consists of a vibratory motion.
The analogy existing between heat and light permits us to suppose
that it is so; and as the vibration theory suffices for the explana
tion of all optical phenomena, there is reason to investigate whether
it can likewise account for the phenomena of heat. This particular
 hypothesis is not new in science. It is true that it restricts the
 generality of the solution; but, on the other hand, it permits us to
 state precisely the nature of certain phenomena.
    The vibratory motion with which each point is animated can be
 decomposed according to three rectangular directions; each com
ponent motion is an oscillatory rectilinear motion of the same
period, produced by a force proportional to the distance from the
 material point to a fixed centre.
    If we represent by m the mass of the material point, by 4 the
 acceleration at the unit of distance, by a the amplitude of the oscil
lation, the mean value of the force is falmpa.
    The duration i of an oscillation is   i- #.
                                                 •         2ra
                                                       U-H.
                           -               -         -
    The maximum velocity of the material point is
    The maximum semi-vis viva is 4mu”-fa.
    The mean semi-vis viva Amu” is the half of the maximum semi
vis viva; *mu’-3 fa. This mean is considered to be proportional
to the absolute temperature T.
   The elementary work which corresponds to a rise of temperature
dT is composed of two parts: one is equal to half the increment of
the mean vis viva ; the other arises from modifications brought into
the vibratory motion by supposing that the mean vis viva preserves
the same value, or else that the temperature remains constant.
    The temperature remaining constant, the amplitude of the oscil
lation may change, provided that the duration of an oscillation varies
in the same ratio. If the amplitude of the oscillation is increased
by the quantity da, there results a work which is expressed by the
product of the mean value of the force into the increment of the
amplitude, or fila.

    2. Let us seek as well the condition for there being no heat con
sumed in internal work when the body is heated under constant
volume, which is sensibly the case for permanent gases.
    The quantity of heat necessary for raising the temperature by dT
is then Kd'I'; in this case dL=0,
                                            = 0.

    This relation is equivalent to the following—
                                Ti"= constant.
    By substituting for i and T the values deduced from the prece
ding relations we find for the condition
                                a = constant.
    Therefore, that there may be no heat consumed in internal work
when a body is heated under constant volume, the amplitude of the
 oscillations must remain the same ; on the contrary, there is expen
 diture of heat in internal work when the amplitude of the oscilla
 tions increases.
    3. When the body undergoes transformation with the tempera
 ture constant, as in changes of state, the quantity of heat necessary
 for effecting the transformation is
                   Q=2MKT<U+017F>

     This relation shows the connexion existing between the heat ne
 cessary for determining a change of state, such as fusion or vapori
 zation, and the variation of the molecular actions in consequence
 of the change of state. When the molecular actions diminish (which
 is the ordinary case), the transformation demands an expenditure
 of heat (heat of fusion or vaporization); while the body evolves
 heat when the change of state is accompanied by augmentation of
 the molecular forces.—Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences,

     When the gas is one which is very soluble in the liquid, we can,
 by operating in tubes prepared as                        I

 tions to a pressure sufficiently feeble, or to a temperature high
 enough, for the quantity of gas held by the liquid to be very con
 siderably more than the normal quantity.                 If a gaseous atmosphere
 be then introduced to the interior of the             liquid,  a sort of ebullition
 will be determined. The experiment can very readily be realized
 with ammonia solution.             The ordinary solution is put into a pre
 pared tube, surrounded with a freezing-mixture,                      and is satu
 rated by passing for a long time a current of gaseous ammonia.
 The tube containing the solution is then taken out and allowed to
 return to the surrounding temperature, say, of 20°C.; no gas is
 liberated within the liquid ; but if the end of a glass tube, formed
 at the lamp into a small bell, containing air be put into                  ammonia             it,
 gas escapes         that atmosphere, and seems

in   bubbles the more frequent the more pronounced the supersatu
ration.         In
                 this case the experiment resembles the ebullition excited
in   a liquid        by
                   the same process. Besides, when after some time                                                 it

dant liberation of binoxide of nitrogen, which suddenly ceases if
the wire be immediately withdrawn, without leaving a gas-bubble,
and which recommences as soon as the wire is again immersed.
At the same time the water is charged with a fresh quantity of
nitric acid. This decomposition can be determined with more acti.
vity by the introduction of a little bell containing air, its outer sur
face having been freshly disaerated in the flame of a gas-burner.
The bubbles of binoxide then seem to issue from the bell, as in the
solution of ammonia. This effect, of a gaseous atmosphere decom
posing nitrous acid, can be observed even at the temperature of zero
(Centigrade); in this case the liberation of the binoxide of nitrogen

more   marked,   was observed on the same limb             1866.                        in

The ring was distinctly seen when the aperture was reduced to one
and a half inch.         The 9-inch equatorial could not be used, as there
were no means of excluding the direct sunlight.
   The morning after the transit the sky was slightly hazy, and the
planet could not be found, though probably it might have been if
the small telescope had been mounted equatorially.
    On the day following (the 10th), the crescent, extending to more
than three fourths of a circle, was seen with beautiful distinctness
in the equatorial; and on this and two subsequent days, measure
ments were taken with the filar micrometer for the purpose of de
termining the extent of the cusps, and consequently the horizontal
refraction of the atmosphere of the planet, on the assumption that
the extension of the crescent and formation of the ring are due to
this refraction.
    The results of these observations are given below, each result
 being the mean of the number of separate measurements indicated
in the last column. On the 10th, the chord of the arc between the
cusps was measured; on the other days the distance between lines

    These observations give a mean of 44'-5 as the horizontal              refrac
 tion of Venus's atmosphere, or about one quarter greater than that
 of the earth's. The writer's observations in 1866 gave 45'-3.
 Mädler, from observations of the cusps in 1849, when the nearest
 approach of the planet to the sun was 3° 26', made the refraction
 43'-7.
    The formula for the refraction is this:

    DUlºº          and Petit in 1819 measured the specific heats of
           thirteen solid elements.  In each case there appeared a
    very simple    relation    between the specific heat and the atomic
    weight: the product of the specific heat into the atomic weight
    was a constant quantity. The atoms of                  all
                                                    the elements examined
    have therefore the same     capacity  for heat.       the specific heat

      that they employed a method differing from that employed by
      the latter physicist, and also that the substances examined could
      not be considered perfectly identical. Had De la Rive and Mar
      cet examined more thoroughly into these differences, they must
      easily have perceived the incorrectness of their mode of account
      ing for them (the method of cooling must give larger, not smaller
      numbers than Regnault's method of mixtures; small impurities,
2     trivial differences in the physical state of an element, may well
      alter the specific heat of that element 1 per cent. or so, but surely
      not 30 to 60 per cent.), and that remarkable property of carbon
      the announcement and examination of which forms a part of the
      following communication would thirty years ago have most pro
      bably been discovered.
         In his comprehensive research on the specific heat of solid
      bodies*, Kopp estimated anew the specific heats of carbon, boron,
      and silicon, using a modification                 of the method of mixtures; his
      results were as follows:—
    Gas-coke     ....   0-185          Amorphous boron           0.254   ||   Amorphous silicon         0.214
    Furnace-coke...     0-166     ||   Crystallizedboron         0.230        Fused silicon     ....    0-138
    Native graphite     0-174                                                 Crystallized silicon      0.165
          These numbers are smaller than those of Regnault.             Kopp
       explained the different numbers obtained by using different mo
       difications of carbon by supposing that carbon has in reality but
       one specific heat (that of diamond, 0.1469), and that the other
       varieties give higher numbers inasmuch              being porous sub   as,
       stances, they absorb gases, and                  on
                                              coming into contact with the
       water  of  the calorimeter evolve    small quantity
                                                      a          heat.  Kopp            of
       believed that        all
                           the allotropic modifications     each element pos   of
       sess the same specific heat, and that variations           the number            in
       actually obtained are due               to
                                        the errors      experiment,     ofthe                    or    to
       use  of  impure materials.
           Several years later (1868) Wüllner and Bettendorf attempted
       to  show that Kopp's hypothesis was untenable, that Regnault’s
       numbers were perfectly reliable, and that the smaller numbers
       obtained       by
                      Kopp did not justify the conclusion which                                       he   had
                    The following are the numbers obtained                                       by

164               Dr. H. F. Weber            on the Specific Heat              of
and Bettendorf concluded                that the different                modifications         of
carbon have really different specific heats.    In obtaining these
numbers a small error was introduced     by the following circum
stance. . . The substance to be examined (1 to 5 grims.) was
warmed in a glass with water to about 70°, and then allowed to
cool to about 20° in the calorimeter.    In calculating the specific
heat of the substance, it was assumed that the specific heat of the
water remained equal to unity throughout the experiment.      Now
the average specific heat of water between 20° and 70°, according
to Bosscha”, is 1.0099. Taking this number into account, Wüll
ner and Bettendorf’s numbers become:—
     Gas-coke      .    .    .     0-1961               Graphite           .        0-1883
     Furnace-graphite.             0-1861               Diamond            .        0-1429
     If we use the number for the specific heat of water between
20° and 70°, obtained by Jamin and Amauryt, these numbers
become still smaller.     We may say, then, that the numbers ob
tained by Wüllner and Bettendorf stand midway between those
of Kopp and those of Regnault.
   From a consideration of the results of                     all
                                                   the researches upon
the  specific heats         of
                       carbon,   boron,  and  silicon,     may safely     it                    be
averred that the different    allotropic  modifications       these ele          of
                                                                            in of no

elements      any
             in        of    its
                         modifications obeys the law        Dulong and
Petit.    These three solid elementary bodies differ        this respect,
therefore, from        all
                      the other elements.            also, however,

                                          the different experimenters
diverge considerably from one another.          The four series       de                  of

166              Dr. H. F. Weber on the Specific Heat of
    Perfectly analogous   results were obtained for graphite in two
series   of researches.  From experiments made in the autumn of
1872,  I concluded that the specific heat of crystalline boron                                   in
creases with the temperature exactly as that of diamond and
graphite increases, and that, at any rate for low temperatures,
the specific heat of silicon varies with the temperature.   Follow
ing up these preliminary researches,                         I
                                            have now for two years
busied myself with an inquiry into the relation subsisting between
the specific heats of the various modifications of carbon, silicon,
and boron, and the temperature at which these are determined.
                                                I
As the investigation advanced found that comprehensive de
terminations of the specific heat of these elements, as a function
of the temperature, might lead to a removal of the idea that these
bodies form an exception to the law of Dulong and Petit, and also
to a new point of view from which to regard this law itself—that
these numbers might also be useful in further determinations of
the specific heat of the various modifications of any element, or
of the specific heats of the elements when in chemical combina
tion.     I
          therefore spared no trouble in obtaining exact and trust
worthy determinations of the specific heats of these elements at
as many and as various temperatures as possible. Over a hundred
careful measurements have been made.        As regards-carbon in
the free state, all the problems which presented themselves have
been solved; the specific heat of the different carbon-modifica
tions has been determined for                 all
                                  temperatures between —80° and
+1000°.      Only connexion with the elements boron and silicon
                           in
a few questions yet remain unanswered.           prefer, however, I                               to
publish the results which      have obtained;
                                      I         and     the next Part        in
I hope      correct any errors and
           to                          extend the investigation.

 were determined were briefly as follows:–
    The amounts by weight, G, of the substance to be examined
 were determined, by means of an OErtling's balance, to within
0-1 to 0.03 per cent. of the total weight; a greater exactness was
 unnecessary, since the values of T and W could not be deter
 mined to within less than 0.1 per cent. of their absolute amount.
 The values To, T1, T2,  ...T.   and W1, W2,      ... We were not de
 termined by the same means throughout. Within the limits
 –80° to +300° the temperature was determined directly by
 means of thermometers, and the corresponding quantities of heat
 measured by the ice-calorimeter; for high temperatures, 500° to
 1000°, both of these values were calculated from the calorimeter
 readings.   The detailed description of both methods is as fol
 lows.   As means for obtaining a range of temperature from low
 to high points under a red heat, solid carbon dioxide, freezing
 mixtures of snow and salt, and an oil-bath were used. By regu
 lating the gas-flame and by constantly stirring the liquid, the
 temperature of the oil-bath could be kept so nearly constant, that
 in an interval of 15 to 20 minutes it did not alter more than one
 degree.   Two test-tubes 10 centims. long, placed one within the
 other, the space between them being filled with cotton-wool,
 formed the vessel in which the substance was heated.              After
 the substance had been   placed  in this vessel,  a plug of cotton-wool
 was inserted as a stopper, and the vessel was immersed in the
 cooling (or heating) liquid for a full hour. The temperature of
 the solid carbon dioxide and of the freezing-mixture remained
 during that time perfectly constant.         Small variations in the
 temperature of the oil-bath were, as far as possible, prevented
 by regulating the gas-flame. . At the expiry of one hour the
 final temperature was determined, the heating-vessel seized in
 the hand, removed from the bath (or cold mixture), brought into
 a horizontal position, and moved as quickly as possible towards
 the opening of the calorimeter standing close by. At the mo
 ment when the opening of the heating-vessel came very near
 the opening of the calorimeter the plug of cotton-wool was with
 drawn, and by a quick jerk the heated substance was thrown
 into the calorimeter, so that without touching the walls of the
 instrument it should fall into the receiving vessel. After a little
 practice the heated substance could be deposited in the calori
 meter not more than two seconds after the vessel containing it
 was removed from the bath.         During this interval of time the

that it is surrounded with such bad heat-conductors (glass, air,

               and Petit in 1819 measured the specific heats of
       thirteen solid elements. In each case there appeared a
very simple relation    between the specific heat and the atomic
weight: the product of the specific heat into the atomic weight
was a constant quantity. The atoms of               all
                                                 the elements examined

      that they employed a method differing from that employed by
      the latter physicist, and also that the substances examined could
      not be considered perfectly identical.     Had De la Rive and Mar
      cet examined more     thoroughly   into these differences, they must
      easily have perceived the incorrectness of their mode of account
      ing for them (the method of cooling must give larger, not smaller
      numbers than Regnault's method of mixtures; small impurities,
†     trivial differences in the physical state of an element, may well
      alter the specific heat of that element 1 per cent. or so, but surely
      not 30 to 60 per cent.), and that remarkable property of carbon
      the announcement and examination of which forms a part of the
      following communication would thirty years ago have most pro
      bably been discovered.
        In his comprehensive     research on the specific heat of solid
      bodies*, Kopp estimated anew the specific heats of carbon, boron,
      and silicon, using a modification of the method of mixtures; his
      results were as        follows:—
    Gas-coke     ....   0-185 Amorphous boron                0.254    ||   Amorphous silicon       0.214
    Furnace-coke...     0-166 | Crystallizedboron            0-230         Fused silicon    ....   0-138
    Native graphite     0-174                                              Crystallized silicon    0.165
          These numbers are smaller than those of Regnault.        Kopp
       explained the different numbers obtained by using different mo
       difications of carbon by supposing that carbon has in reality but
       one specific heat (that of diamond, 0.1469), and that the other
       varieties give higher numbers inasmuch as, being porous sub
       stances, they absorb gases, and on coming into contact with the
       water of the calorimeter evolve a small quantity of heat.     Kopp
       believed that        all
                         the allotropic modifications    each element pos   of
       sess the same specific heat, and that variations        the number         in
       actually obtained are due           to
                                      the errors      experiment,    ofthe
                                                                                             or
                                                                                             to
       use  of impure materials.
          Several years later (1868) Wüllner and Bettendorf attempted
       to  show that Kopp’s hypothesis was untenable, that Regnault’s
       numbers were perfectly reliable, and that the smaller numbers
       obtained       by
                       Kopp did not justify the conclusion which                             by      had

164               Dr. H. F. Weber on              the Specific Heat            of
and Bettendorf concluded                that the different                modifications         of
carbon have really different specific heats.    In obtaining these
numbers a small error was introduced     by the following circum
stance. . . The substance to be examined (1 to 5 grms.) was
warmed in a glass with water to about 70°, and then allowed to
cool to about 20° in the calorimeter.    In calculating the specific
heat of the substance, it was assumed that the specific heat of the
water remained equal to unity throughout the experiment.      Now
the average specific heat of water between 20° and 70°, according
to Bosscha”, is 1.0099. Taking this number into account, Wüll
ner and Bettendorf’s numbers become:—
     Gas-coke      .    .    .     0-1961               Graphite           .        0-1883
     Furnace-graphite.             0-1861               Diamond            .        0-1429
     If we use the number for the specific heat of water between
20° and 70°, obtained by Jainin and Amauryt, these numbers
become still smaller.      We may say, then, that the numbers ob
tained by Wüllner and Bettendorf stand midway between those
of Kopp and those of Regnault.
   From a consideration of the results of                     all

166               Dr. H. F. Weber on                       the Specific Heat         of
    Perfectly analogous    results were obtained for graphite in two
series of researches.    From experiments made in the autumn of
1872,   I concluded that the specific heat of crystalline boron                                         in
creases with the temperature exactly as that of diamond and
graphite increases, and that, at any rate for low temperatures,
the specific heat of silicon varies with the temperature.    Follow
ing up these preliminary researches, I have now for two years
busied myself with an inquiry into the relation subsisting between
the specific heats of the various modifications of carbon, silicon,
and boron, and the temperature at which these are determined.
                                                      I
As the investigation advanced found that comprehensive de
terminations of the specific heat of these elements, as a function
of the temperature, might lead to a removal of the idea that these
bodies form an exception to the law of Dulong and Petit, and also
 to a new point of view from which to regard this law itself—that
these numbers might also be useful in further determinations of
the specific heat of the various modifications of any element, or
of the specific heats of the elements when in chemical combina
tion.    Itherefore spared no trouble in obtaining exact and trust
worthy determinations of the specific heats of these elements at
as many and as various temperatures as possible. Over a hundred
careful measurements have been made. As regards-carbon in
the free state,         all
                   the problems which presented themselves have
been solved; the specific heat                         of
                                    the different carbon-modifica

                                  temperatures between —80° and
+1000°.      Only     connexion with the elements boron and silicon
                             in
a few  questions  yet  remain unanswered.       prefer, however,          I                              to
publish the results which      have obtained;

 were determined were briefly as follows:—
    The amounts by weight, G, of the substance to be examined
 were determined, by means of an OErtling's balance, to within
 0-1 to 0.03 per cent. of the total weight; a greater exactness was
 unnecessary, since the values of T and W could not be deter
 mined to within less than 0.1 per cent. of their absolute amount.
 The values To, T1, T2,    ...T.   and W1, W2,     ... We were not de
 termined by the same means throughout.                Within the limits
  —80° to +300° the temperature was determined directly by
 means of thermometers, and the corresponding quantities of heat
 measured by the ice-calorimeter; for high temperatures, 500° to
  1000°, both of these values were calculated from the calorimeter
 readings.    The detailed description of both methods is as fol
 lows.    As means for obtaining a range of temperature from low
 to  high  points under a red heat, solid carbon dioxide, freezing
 mixtures of snow and salt, and an oil-bath were used.           By regu
 lating the gas-flame and by constantly stirring the liquid, the
 temperature of the oil-bath could be kept so nearly constant, that
  in an interval of 15 to 20 minutes it did not alter more than one
 degree.    Two test-tubes 10 centims. long, placed one within the
  other, the space between them being filled with cotton-wool,
 formed the vessel in which the substance was heated.               After
 the substance had been     placed  in this vessel, a plug of cotton-wool
 was inserted as a stopper, and the vessel was immersed in the
  cooling (or heating) liquid for a full hour. The temperature of
 the solid carbon dioxide and of the freezing-mixture remained
 during that time perfectly constant.          Small variations in the
 temperature    of the oil-bath were, as far as possible, prevented
 by regulating the gas-flame.         At the expiry of one hour the
 final temperature was determined, the heating-vessel seized in
 the hand, removed from the bath (or cold mixture), brought into
 a horizontal position, and moved as quickly as possible towards
 the opening of the calorimeter standing close by. At the mo
 ment when the opening of the heating-vessel came very near
 the opening of the calorimeter the plug of cotton-wool was with
 drawn, and by a quick jerk the heated substance was thrown
 into the calorimeter, so that without touching the walls of the
 instrument it should fall into the receiving vessel. After a little
 practice the heated substance could be deposited in the calori
 meter not more than two seconds after the vessel containing it
 was removed from the bath.           During this interval of time the

that it is surrounded with such bad heat-conductors (glass, air,

raise the unit weight of water from 0° to T is unknown. Bosscha's
calculation from Regnault's results (carried out between 100°
and 200°) gives W = T + 0.00011T"; while Jamin and
Amaury”, for temperatures between 0° and 75°, give
                     W;=T+0.00055T-4-0-0000004Tº.
Until these anomalous results are cleared up by a new research,
water must not be used for the empirical graduating of the ice
calorimeter.           I
                  have used calcspar as a standard.      From the
results of careful experiments made with pure substance by
means of Neumann's method, the specific heat of calcspar be
tween 6° and 100° was found to be 0-2065, the specific heat of
water for the temperature 2° to 6° being taken as the unit. From
another series of experiments upon the changeability of the specific
heat of calcspar, 0.2061 was deduced as the average specific heat
of this substance between the points 0° and 100°. If one unit
weight (one gramme) of calcspar be cooled from 100° to 0° in
the ice-calorimeter, 20-61 heat-units are given up to the calori
meter; and the heat-unit is taken as equal to the amount of
heat necessary to raise through one degree one gramme of water
at a temperature between 2° and 6°.     Having obtained this con
stant, a piece of pure calcspar weighing 1521 grim., heated to a
boiling heat      T, was brought into
                                the calorimeter, and the ensuing
displacement of the mercury thread measured.     The movement
of the mereury thread corresponding to one heat-unit was then

were as accurately (and much more easily) made as would have
been the case had a telescope been employed.     Throughout the
entire research a small oscillation in the  mercury thread of the
calorimeter was noticed (owing to the difference of melting-point
of the outer and inner ice of the instrument), varying between
0.0 millim. to 0.20 millim. per minute in winter while the ca
lorimeter was surrounded with snow, and 0.0 millim. to 0.45
 millim. per minute in summer when the calorimeter was sur
 rounded with pure lake-ice.      The correction necessary on account
 of this oscillation in an experiment lasting twenty or thirty mi
 nutes would be considerable;            I
                                       therefore endeavoured to bring
 it about that the time which elapsed until the heat had been
 entirely spent in melting ice should be as short as possible.
 This time was reduced to about ten or fifteen minutes by allow
 ing not more than 4 or 5 grms. of ice to be melted at once, and
 by causing the formation of a new quantity of ice by means of
 the introduction of a fragment of ice or snow, and the addition
 of a drop or two of alcohol.
    In order to obviate a small loss of heat by the temperature in
 the receiving-vessel of the calorimeter rising above 4°, instru
 ments of three sizes were used.           For measuring quantities of
 heat varying from 0 to 50, from 50 to 100, and from 100 to 200
 heat-units, the receiving-vessel of the instrument employed was
 capable of containing 8, 16, and 30 grims. of water respectively.
 When the quantities of heat taken up by substances cooled to
 —To in rising to 0° had to be determined by means of the for
 mation of a corresponding amount of ice, alcohol was used instead
 of water in the receiving-vessel, care being taken that the proxi
 mity of these cold bodies did not bring the temperature of the
 snow or ice-film in the calorimeter beneath                   its
                                                         melting-point.

    Two platinum tubes, closed at their lower ends, 6 centims. in
length, 12 centim. wide, the walls of the tubes being 1-2 millim.
thick, were placed side by side at a distance of 1:2 centim., and
held in this position by means of a crosspiece of platinum, from
which projected perpendicularly a platinum rod by means of which
the two tubes could be moved about at will.
    Two pieces of platinum, of the total weight of 32:39 grims.,were
brought into one of the tubes; and in the other such a quantity
of the substance under examination was placed as would have a
heat-value nearly equal to that of the 32°39 grims. of platinum.
The tubes were closed by asbestos stoppers, and placed in a small
muffle made of sheet copper about 2 millims. thick, which was
entirely closed and then placed at the back of the muffle of a
newly constructed gas muffle-furnace, in which any temperature
between 500° and 1000° could easily be obtained.             From the
arrangement and position of the tubes it might with safety be
assumed that after the expiry of a sufficient time the contents of
both would be at the same temperature.         When the tubes had
remained in the furnace for an      hour, the perpendicular   platinum
 rod was seized by a pair of very hot tongs and the tubes very
 quickly transported to a double water-calorimeter standing as
 close by as possible. At the proper moment, while the tubes were
 held in the operator's right hand, the asbestos stoppers were
 withdrawn simultaneously by the left hand, and the contents of
 the two tubes thrown, by a jerk of the right hand, the platinum
 into one, the carbon into the other calorimeter.        After a little
 practice the time which elapsed from the withdrawal of the hot
 tubes from the furnace until the moment when the contents of
 the tubes found themselves in the calorimeter was reduced to 3
 or at the most 4 seconds. The loss of heat during this brief
 time affected both tubes in an exactly similar manner, inasmuch
 as the tubes,  in respect of size, shape, material, and temperature,
 were exact  counterparts   of one another.    Considering the brief
 ness of the time and also the thickness of the walls of the plati
 num tubes, the reduction in the temperature of the enclosed
 substances must have been extremely small.          Inasmuch as the
 weights of the two substances were equalized so that the product
 of the weight into the specific heat was the same for each, the
 small reduction of temperature might be taken as the same in
 each case. Against the assumption that the temperature of the
 platinum was the same as that of the substance under examina
 tion at the moment when they both fell into the calorimeter, no
 argument of importance can be urged.
     The double calorimeter employed consisted of two identical
 vessels of the thinnest sheet copper placed parallel to one another
 at a distance of 2 millims. The cover of each instrument had

The total weight was therefore 3.562 grims.
  The thermic relations of these six specimens were not altoge
ther identical. From a number of determinations, the average
specific heats for the temperatures 0° to 100° were deduced as
follows:—
                           ##":
                      -
                           D+E                =0° 1451
                           F                  =0-1485
   The evidently not perfectly homogeneous masses D, E, and F
would therefore have been rejected had it not been for the con
sideration that the determination of the specific heat for the
temperature-interval—80° to +30° could not be trusted beyond,
at the furthest, the third place of decimals when working with
the quantities of diamond A, B, and C only.
   This degree of certainty               I
                                 did not, however, deem sufficient
for determining the existence of an inflection-point in the curve
of the specific heat indicated by preliminary experiments. As the
determination of this point appeared to me of the utmost impor
tance, I  sacrificed the advantage of working with absolutely pure
material for the gain of being able to determine with the greatest
possible accuracy the specific heat of the diamond at and near to
the temperature 0°. In              all
                               the series    experiments the total

   In the following Tables the meanings of the letters are as
follows:—
  G   =   weight of substance employed.
  Q = water-value of the calorimeter (inclusive of stirrer and
             thermometer).
 At =     increase of temperature (corrected) which the calorimeter
             showed after the addition of the glowing substance.
  W=      the product of Q into At.
 AT =     the difference between the initial temperature T of the
             substance brought into the calorimeter and the final
             temperature To of the same substance (calculated from
             W and the known specific heat of platinum).
CT,   T-    the average specific heat for the temperature-interval
              T 10.

In this formula, A is             a constant          depending          only on the nature
of the steel, and 8 a quantity of the form 3. B being                                      a second
constant.     The diameter of the needles is represented by a.
    The formula is conformable to the results of Coulomb's expe
riments+.      I propose to verify it for the particular case of needles
of very slight diameter and little length.
    1. Needles of the same diameter.—The temper of the needles
compared should be identical; the breaking of a saturated,
quite regular cylindrical needle furnishes saturated needles in
that condition. They are saturated; for the primitive needle
possesses in every point of it a higher degree of magnetism than
corresponds to the saturation of the fragment which belongs to it
after the breaking. The breaking itself has, according to the
preceding, no other effect than that which would result from the
separation of the parts which were in precise juxtaposition.
Finally, the temper is as identical as possible; we shall even see
that employing the results eliminates the minute differences of
local temper which cannot be entirely avoided.
    The mother needle is magnetized to saturation, by at least
four Bunsen elements, in a coil of 25 centims. length, very
regular, and formed of three superposed layers of wire.         In order
to make an experiment, the length and magnetic moment of the
entire needle are measured; the two ends are then removed by
 breaking them off at 3} or 4 centims. distance from the extre
 mities, preserving the end fragments; the length of the middle
 fragment and         its
                     magnetic moment are measured, and                suc                        by

   Equation (1) represents a curve tangent to the axis of w at the

The curves representing the experiments present the same general
characters.   To make the comparison, the asymptote of the ex
perimental curve is determined with the utmost care.        In fact,
starting from a length of from 10 to 40 centims. according to
the diameter, the points characteristic of the needles fall rigo
rously in a right line, or only deviate within the limits of errors
of experiment; the asymptote is therefore perfectly determined.

   Beyond 10 millims. for the thickest needle, and 6 millims. for
the thinnest, the characteristic points are, theoretically and prac
tically, confused with the asymptote.
   The agreement of calculation and experiment is very remark
able for the needles which are not too short in proportion to
their diameter.     It was for this case only that Green established
the formula which we are engaged in verifying. For extremely
short needles, in                  all

portionality of their distance from the ends of the needle to the
first power of the diameter.
    Comparison of the results furnished by observation on needles
of different diameters is attended with great practical difficulties.
The multiplicity of comparisons of apparatus required by these
experiments, the considerable influence of the slightest errors in
the estimation of the minute diameters upon the ratios to be de
termined, and, above all, the difficulty of giving an identical
temper to needles of different diameters are grave obstacles
which it is not easy entirely to surmount. It is right, however,
to remark that the difficulty in regard to the tempering is less
for needles that are tempered very hard, such as we have always
employed, because in this case the coercive power varies little for
rather large variations in the temperature at which the steeping
was effected.
    The following Table relates to the law of the polar distances.
The first column gives the diameters of the needles, the second
the abscissa D, the third the value of the ratio
                                                    º   (which should

point, but in points nearer to the origin in proportion as the
degree of magnetization of the mother needle is less.       Besides,
the curves themselves are not proportional reductions of the same
curve; and if we take the ratio of the magnetic moment of a
rupture-needle to the corresponding saturated needle, this ratio
approaches towards unity in proportion as the length of the
needle diminishes.    Therefore, if needles be taken from the middle
of a non-saturated needle, but which is regular and from 1 to 2
millims. in diameter, the shorter they are the nearer are they to
saturation.
   The difference which we have noticed in this respect between
very thin and thicker needles is important for the theory of mag
netism.
   Itremains to examine the condition of the end fragments of
non-saturated needles.              I
                          have limited myself to comparing the
magnetic moment of these fragments with that of equal frag
ments from the middle of the needle.       ascertained that the          I
moment of the end fragments                  is below that of the middle ones,
and as much more so
   (1) As the primitive needle is shorter,
   (2) As the magnetization is less intense,
   (3) As the absolute length of the fragments is less.

   B. Needles presenting consequent points.-We have just seen
that, in a regular needle, the fragments from the extremities
possess a lower magnetic moment than those which come from
the centre.
   The consequent points behave like poles of less force than
the extreme poles; the fragments which include them possess,
with equal length, a higher magnetic moment than that of the
end fragments, but lower than that of the fragments derived from
the interval between two consequent points.
   We conclude this section by indicating a means of verifying
the perfect regularity of a magnetized needle:—After separating
a sufficient length of the extremities, we break the middle piece
into fragments of arbitrary, unequal lengths.         the mother                         If
needle was regular, the characteristic points obtained by taking
for abscissa the length of the fragments, and for ordinate their
magnetic moment, will be situated on a regular curve.        The
slightest irregularities will then be                          seen   by simple inspection of
the figure obtained.

      The physical theory    magnetism exists almost entirely under
                                          of
 the form       comparisons.

 series      phenomena absolutely parallel, unfortunately those
               of
 comparisons only awaken        the mind ideas which are imperfect
 and never entirely satisfy                       it. in
                                  Even Ampère's beautiful theory
 of   molecular solenoids    perhaps,     is,
                                        not wholly unaffected      this                                      by
 remark, which applies especially        the coercive-force theory,
                                                                  to                                                as
  well     as    other attempts which have been made for the pur
                 to   all
 pose      elucidating the theory
           of                         steel magnets.        of
      It was Coulomb who first established with some precision the
  difference between iron and steel         regard      magnetization,   in               to
  and introduced the notion       coercive force.     of

effect of this force to a sort of friction which opposes the separa
tion of the combined magnetic fluids, or their reunion when they
are separated. This comparison between two orders of pheno
mena so complex and so little understood as magnetization and
friction is necessarily very artificial, and excludes a great num
ber of phenomena furnished by experiment.           In fact, the as
sumption of a coercive force analogous to friction would seem
to imply the following propositions:—
   1. The coercive force is opposed to any induction-effect on
the part of magnetic forces below a certain limit C.
   2. It reduces the effect of any force              F-C
                                               to that which would
be produced by a force equal to F-C, if the coercive force did
not exist; and
   3. After the cessation of Fit preserves the acquired magnetism
up to a limit equal to the magnetism which would be produced
by a force C continuing to act in the direction of the force F, if
the coercive force had no existence.
     The only mathematician    who, to my knowledge, has treated
a problem in the hypothesis of the coercive force, Green, does
not appear to have formed a different idea of                        it.

   The original hypothesis of the coercive force explains, there
fore, pretty accurately the only phenomena well known at the
time when it was invented; it cannot enable us to foresee new
phenomena; and the progress of the science of magnetism has
left little of it in existence but the name.
   The phenomena of temporary magnetism and of the maximum
of magnetization, as well as those of permanent magnetism, have
been explained collectively by Wiedemann, but again by means
of a comparison.   He compares magnetic phenomena to those
which depend on the elasticity of solid bodies, specially those
accompanying torsion or flexion.    This has the advantage of ex
pressing an incontestable physical relation, since torsion modi
fies the magnetic condition of a bar, and such modifications may
in their turn cause a variation in the torsion to which the bar
has been submitted beforehand.
    Wiedemann assumes that in the unit of volume of iron or steel
a finite number of magnetic elements (molecular currents) exist,
but that in the natural state their axes are distributed equally
in   all
      directions.  External magnetic forces tend     rotate these                       to
elements about their centre     gravity; but these oppose
                                                of            re                                     a
sistance     displacement, analogous
              to                           elastic reaction,   tosuch                         in           a
manner that, according        the intensityto   the acting forces, the
                                                                     of

of  their temporary    displacement.    On submitting these hypo
theses      calculation we obtain, for the representation
           to                                                       the                            of

satisfying the same essential conditions, present only vague and

his theory the original work must              consulted”. We will  be

merely say that the analogy on which it rests may be carried
very far, and that we could find arguments in favour of it even
in our present researches: thus we have seen that repetition of
the action of a current upon a needle augments the permanent
magnetic moment communicated to the latter *; in like manner,
when an imperfectly elastic thread is twisted by means of a con
stant force, the permanent torsion it acquires is increased by a
second or a third application of the same force, and tends towards
 a new limit.
   We do not charge Wiedemann's hypothesis with being abso
lutely false; we only say that it is incomplete; and this is why
a certain number of phenomena can only with extreme difficulty
be accommodated to it. Of this number are some relative to the
superposition of a certain permanent magnetism and a tempo
rary magnetism opposite in direction, particularly those pro
duced in the separation of magnetized bundlest.
   Instead of attributing, as Wiedemann does, temporary and
permanent magnetism to the same molecules, other physicists                                         f
prefer to assume that the condition (whatever it may be) which
corresponds to the conservation of a certain degree of permanent
magnetism is communicated, in the steeling or the tempering,
only to a certain number of molecules, the rest retaining the
magnetic properties of soft iron.    It is further conceivable that
the different molecules may  acquire  the coercive power in differ
ent  degrees.
   Be this as it may,            I
                        think that important light would be shed
on many facts in connexion with the magnetization of steel by
supposing that it is magnetically heterogeneous.         Now this is
not a   gratuitous hypothesis.  Chemists will     readily  admit that
the true nature of the chemical species which constitute steel
is still very imperfectly known, and that a bar of steel may con
tain normally a mixture of several of those species. When a
steel bar is attacked by chlorhydric acid, it is ascertained, accord
ing to A. Holtz S, that the corroded surface is rugous, the aspe
rities being formed of a highly carbonaceous steely substance

    is variable in different
    work with closed meshes, filled up with the more attackable
    ferruginous mass; sometimes the two substances are more inti
    mately   mixed, and the carbonaceous steel is in fine isolated
    grains.    Physical heterogeneity involves magnetic heteroge
    neity; Holtz, in fact, having measured the magnetic moment
    of magnetized bars before and after the more or less prolonged
    action of chlorhydric acid, believes it to be deducible from the
    whole of his experiments that the carbonaceous steel is the real
    seat of the coercive force, and that the rest of the mass is almost
    destitute of it.
        Itis not for us to pass judgment on the degree of confi
    dence deserved by A. Holtz's conclusions from the chemical
    point of view; but the hypothesis of the magnetic heterogeneity
    of steel does appear to merit serious examination.        In the first
    place, it has the advantage of affording a very simple explana
    tion of the phenomena connected with the superposition of tem
    porary and permanent magnetism, for which it was imagined.

    § 44. Effect of   the Temperature    of  the Ingredients on that  of
the Freezing-mixture.—An ounce of finely powdered chloride of
sodium was cooled in a flask surrounded by a freezing-mixture
till its temperature was — 15°C. It was then stirred with four
ounces of ice, which had been cooled and had the temperature
 —10°.      As soon as liquefaction began, the temperature —22°
was reached; and this degree of cold was never surpassed.
     § 45. The same degree of cold (–22°) resulted from the
mixture of 1 oz. of NaCl at –15° with 4 oz. of ice at 0°, also
when 1 oz. of salt at +12°C. was mixed with 4 oz. of ice at
 –   12° C.
    § 46. Indeed the margin of temperature may be greatly ex
 tended.     Thus, 1 oz. of NaCl in powder was heated to incipient
redness and thrown upon 5 or 6 oz. of ice at 0°; after a few
minutes constant stirring, the temperature had reached –22°.
     § 47. 1 oz. of dry anhydrous Na, SO, was heated nearly to
redness, and thrown upon 4 oz. of ice at 0°.          In a few minutes
the temperature had sunk to —0°7. Again, an ounce of anhy
 drous CuSO, was heated to about 600°C., and thrown upon
 4 oz. of ice; the temperature at once sank to —0°5 (compare             \
 § 55).                                                                   |
     § 48. From the above experiments, and from the theoretical
 considerations touched upon in § 42, I conclude that, within very
                                                                          !
wide limits as to quantity, the temperature of a freezing-mixture
 may be very independent of the temperature both of the salt
 and of the ice.
     § 49. Effect of Crystalline Water in the salt on the Tempera
 ture of the Freezing-mixture—From $26 it appears that crystal
 lized sulphate of soda (Na2SO4+7H2O) gives with ice a tempe
rature of –0°7.         Deprived of water, the anhydrous salt N, SO,
gave with ice the temperature also of –0°7.            Sulphate of cop
per in the anhydrous state produced, when mixed with ice, a
temperature of –1°7, while with the ordinary crystallized
 hydrate the temperature was —2°.
     § 50. Having examined six or seven other salts as to the tem
 perature of their freezing-mixtures when employed both with and
 without their crystalline water,    I  do not scruple to assert that
 water of  crystallization, properly so called, takes no effect upon the
 temperature of the freezing-mixture; and I believe the same is
 true of that water which has been called constitutional.           But
 where a profound rearrangement of the elements of water ensues,
 the effect may be different, as appears in the next paragraph.

   All these numbers are sufficiently near to —26°, the number
got when both ingredients are at 0°, to justify the conclusion that
the temperature of the ice has something, but little, to do with
the temperature of the freezing-mixture.      And it appears that
the temperature of the HCl solution is also without effect, pro
vided that the saturation has been effected at the same tempera
ture and pressure.       The water acts, indeed, here much as the
water of crystallization acts in the case of solid salts.
   § 55. Table of Freezing-mixtures.—In the following Table
the lowest attainable temperature is given. This, as we have
seen, is independent of the temperature of the salt and       degree                              its

                                   and Attached Water.                                                   211
resulting from the union of the halogens with the alkali metals
has brought to light many points of interest. The two members
of this family which                I
                           had previously examined were NaCl,
solidifying at –23° with 10-5 molecules of water, and NH, Cl,
solidifying at — 16° with 12 molecules of water.      I have reexa
mined the cryohydrate of chloride of ammonium; and the mean
of several analyses gives 19:27 per cent of chloride, which brings
the ratio to NH, Cl-H 12:4 H2O.
   There is nothing particular to remark in the analysis of this
group.    All, excepting the ammonium salts, bear heating to 300°
or 400° C. without decomposition or volatilization.      The liquid
cryohydrates were weighed in covered basins of Bohemian glass,
evaporated to dryness, strongly heated, covered, and quickly
cooled. The ammonium salts were heated on the water-bath
till they ceased to lose weight.

temperature is so abundantly soluble in water, yields a large
proportion of anhydrous salt when cooled.   An ice-salt cryogen

   § 59. Chloride of Potassium.—Since KI is thus seen to com
bine with 8:5 of water and KBr with 14 of water, the one a
fraction and the other a whole number, I spared no care in the
preparation and analysis of the chloride of potassium, to see
whether the fractional relationship did not arise from experimental
error.   Perfectly pure K. COs was dissolved in a slight excess of
HCl, evaporated to dryness, and ignited in a platinum basin.
The KCl was recrystallized four times.          Six ounces of the
saturated solution were cooled; solid matter separated down to
–  10°. At this temperature the separated salt appeared as a
cloudiness in the liquid, a little heavier than the latter, and of a
granular but translucent appearance.       The liquid may now be
cooled to — 15°; but it is now a supersaturated solution of the
true cryohydrate—a solution, it is to be observed, of which the
solid crystals present are unable to determine the solidification.
At a little below –15°, long ice-like crystals shoot out and the
temperature rises to -11°4, which is the crystallizing-point of
the cryohydrate.     From this behaviour I am disposed to admit
that there  may  be an intermediate hydrate similar to the bihy
drate of NaCl.
   Of the last portion which solidified, 6.588 grims. gave 1.320
of anhydrous salt.      Of the previous crop of crystals 7-869
grms. gave 1:579 of salt. These show the respective per
centages 2003 and 2007, both of which point to the relationship

     § 60. Thehalogen salts of potassium arrange themselves ac
cording to the cold required for the solidification of their cryo
hydrates, and according to the molecular ratio of water, as
follows:–

   We find here the general rule confirmed, that among like
salts the lower the temperature of solidification of the cryohy
drate, the smaller is the number of molecules of water which it
contains.

   It appears that, for the same halogen, a sodium salt attaches
less water than an ammonium salt, and the ammonium salt less
than the potassium salt. Also, for the same metal, an iodine salt
attaches less water than the bromine salt, and the latter less
than the chlorine salt.
   Or if we denote by "XM the number of molecules                          of water
attached to one molecule of XM, then

   This remarkable rule has no exception amongst the above nine
salts; and the only exception to the general rule, that the lower
the solidifying-point the fewer the molecules of associated water,
is offered by the iodide of sodium.       Concerning this see § 68.
   § 67. It may be perhaps more than accidental that the num
bers of molecular water-worths show a distinct tendency to be
multiples of 0.5. For my own part, recognizing the possible
range of analytical error,                I
                                 for the present distinctly forbear
to  express   any   opinion  as to whether we are here dealing
with the same physical force which constitutes chemical attrac
tion, and which regulates the integral ratios of molecular com
bination as most chemists appear to understand the term—or
whether it is a distinct or distinctly conditioned force binding
the salt and water together in quite a new ratio, or a ratio which
can only be brought to the chemical one by multiplication by
constants, at present arbitrary.
   It is useful, however, to reflect that almost innumerable                    in

stops shortly below 0°C.; and the solution may be cooled to
–22° while the liquid remains quite clear. This possible de
pression of the temperature in presence of one hydrate is clearly
a happy incident in the genesis of the cryohydrate as far as the
assurance of the freedom of the latter from the former is con
cerned.    On cooling by means of carbonic acid and ether, soli
dification ensues shortly below —22°, and the temperature rises
to -17°, at which it remains constant.    Of the portion last to

   § 75. Nitrate of Sodium.—The        temperature at which this
cryohydrate is formed was found by experiment to be — 17°5;
but, for reasons partly considered in § 69,      believe this tem     I
perature to be too low, and that, when supersaturation does not
intervene, the temperature is    16°-5.        –
                                          Here, however, I assign
to it the temperature    got  by direct observation.    Of the last
portion to solidify, 5:4210 grims. gave 2.2140 of NaNOs, or
40.8 per cent., which indicates the composition

NaNOa.
   § 76. Nitrate of Potassium.—This was examined in § 24.
The cryohydrate solidifies at –2°6, and contains 11.2 per cent.
of nitre. The water-worth is expressed by the relation
                                   KNOs–H 44-6H. O.

   I  believe that here again the water-worth really falls with
the temperature of solidification.   But the order of the salts
in regard to their water-worths is again different from the order
observed with the sulphate, as well as from that of the chlorides
of the same metals.

XXV.       General Theorems relating to Equilibrium and Initial and
       Steady Motions.   By Lord RAYLEIGH, M.A., F.R.S.*
IP impulses,
   a material system start from rest under the action of given
             the energy of the actual motion exceeds that of
any other which the system might have been guided to take by
the operation of mere constraints; and the difference is equal to
the energy of the motion which must be compounded with either
to produce the other (Bertrand). A proof of this interesting
theorem is given in Thomson and Tait's ‘Natural Philosophy,’
§ 311—by a slight modification of which a more general result
may be arrived         at,
                   giving rise   important corollaries.

      By means  the general theorem (6)        may prove that the         we

220           Lord Rayleigh on General Theorems relating to
corresponding thereto (viz. T) is greater than if the velocities
had remained unchanged; and this, again, is evidently greater
than the actual E (viz. T) of the original motion. The total
increase of energy is equal to the decrease which the alteration
of mass entails in the energy of the former motion, together with
the energy (under the new conditions of the system) of the dif
ference of the old and new motions.       If the change be small,
the latter part is of the second order.
   On the other hand, of course, any addition to the mass les
sens the effect of the given impulses.

which stands in remarkable contrast with that above demon
strated.   The theorem         that         is,

would produce this other supposed motion.”               From this   fol                                  it
lows readily that, with given velocity-conditions, the energy                                                          of

222        Lord Rayleigh           on General Theorems relating to
And since the potential energy in either case is proportional
to the descent of the point Q, we see that the effect of the
constraint is to diminish this descent.
   The theorem under consideration may be placed in a clearer
light by the following interpretation of the function E.
   In forming the conditions of equilibrium, we are only con
cerned with the forces which act upon the system when in
that position; but we may, if we choose, attribute any con
sistent values to the forces for other positions.   Suppose, then,
that the forces are  constant, as if produced by weights. Then, in
any position, E denotes the work, positive or negative, which
must be done upon the system in order to bring it into the
configuration   defined by W =0. Thus, to return to the rod
with the weight suspended from Q, E represents the work
which must be done in order to bring the rod from the con
figuration to which E refers into the horizontal position.  And
this work is the difference between the work necessary to raise
the weight and that gained during the unbending of the rod.
Further, if the configuration in question is one of equilibrium
with or without the assistance of a constraint (such as the sup
port at P), the work gained during the unbending is exactly
the half of that required to raise the weight; so that E is the
same as the potential energy of the bending, or half the work
required to raise the weight.
    When the rod, unsupported at P, is bent by the weight at
Q, the point P drops. The energy of the bending is the same
as the total work required to restore the rod to a horizontal po
sition.   Now this restoration may be effected in two steps. We
may first, by a force applied at P, raise that point into    proper          its
position,  a process requiring the expenditure          work. The      of
system will now          be
                         the same condition
                              in                   that       as
                                                           which            in             it

                                   if    had been originally sup

also less in the former case.

inflection cannot be a   property   enjoyed by the points of a curve

                                  does not insert   examples   for practice,
 as     English writer would probably have done. The above-men

bing briefly our author's treatment of the question of multiplication,
to which his third chapter is devoted. In the first place he explains,
by means of two examples, Oughtred's method of contracted mul
tiplication; but              of leaving the last figure uncertain as is
usually done, he notices that the process gives an approximation
in defect, and points out that if the sum of the digits in the mul
tiplier, which give partial products, be increased by the first un
used digit of the multiplier, and by unity if there be a second
unused digit in the multiplier, and then this sum be added to the
product, we now have an approximation in eccess; and by compa
ring the two we obtain a result in which a certain number of digits
are known to be exact.           Moreover the rule, as usually stated,
directs that          if,
                   for instance, the result were required          true for                 to   be
two places        decimals, the unit digit
                  of                             the multiplier should

THE“On Coniferine,      and its Conversion into the Aromatic Prin
ciple of Vanilla.”   By Ferd. Tiemann and Wilh. Haarmann.
   The sap of the cambium of coniferous trees contains a beautiful
crystalline glucoside, coniferine, which was discovered by Hartig
and examined some years ago by Kubel, who arrived at the formula

                                  Ol. + 3aq.
A minute study of this compound leads us to represent the mole
cule of coniferine by the expression
                          C. H., O, + 2aq,
the percentages of which nearly coincide with the theoretical values
of Kubel's formula.
   Submitted to fermentation with emulsine, coniferine splits into
sugar and a splendid compound, crystallizing in prisms which
fuse at 73°. This body is easily soluble in ether, less so in alcohol,
almost insoluble in water;      compositionits  represented        the

  To remove         all

with the natural compound, we have transformed the former into

  In  order further to elucidate the nature of vanilline, we have sub
mitted this body to fusion with alkali. The product of this action
is a well-known acid discovered by Strecker, and described by
him as protocatechuic acid,

            C, H, O, + 4 O = C, H, O, + H, O + CO,.
   We have identified this substance by analysis, by the study
of    its
       reactions, and also   transforming  by

    “On the alleged Expansion in Volume of various Substances in
passing by Refrigeration    from the state of Liquid Fusion to that of
Solidification.”    By Robert Mallet, C.E., F.R.S.
     Since the time of Réaumur it has been stated, with very
various degrees of evidence, that certain metals expand in volume
at or near their points of consolidation from fusion. Bismuth, cast
iron, antimony, silver, copper, and gold are amongst the number,
and to these have recently been added certain iron furnace-slags.
Considerable physical interest attaches to this subject from the ana
logy of the alleged facts to the well-known one that water expands
between 39°F. and 32°, at which it becomes ice; and a more ex
tended interest has been given to it quite recently by Messrs.
Nasmyth and Carpenter having made the supposed facts, more
especially those relative to cast iron and to slags, the foundation
of their peculiar theory of lunar volcanic action as developed in
their work, ‘The Moon as a Planet, as a World, and a Satellite'
(4to, London, 1874). There is considerable ground for believing
that bismuth does expand in volume at or near consolidation; but
with respect to all the other substances supposed to do likewise,
it is the object of this paper to show that the evidence is insuffi
cient, and that with respect to cast iron and to the basie silicates
constituting iron slags, the allegation of their expansion in volume,
and therefore that their density when molten is greater than when
solid, is wholly erroneous. The determination of the specific gra

 direct method, however, and operating upon a sufficiently large
 scale, the author has been enabled to make the determination with
 considerable accuracy. A conical vessel of wrought iron of about
 2 feet in depth and 1.5 foot diameter of base, and with an open
 neck of 6 inches in diameter, being formed, was accurately weighed
 empty, and also when filled with water level to the brim; the
 weight of      its

 vessel and water were at 60° F.

    It is a fact, notwithstanding what precedes, and is well known
to ironfounders, that certain pieces of cold cast iron do float on
molten cast iron of the same quality, though they cannot do so
through their buoyancy.            As various sorts of cast iron vary in
specific gravity at 60°F., from nearly 7-700 down to 6:300, and
vary also in dilatability, some cast irons may thus float or sink in
molten cast iron of different qualities from themselves through
buoyancy or negative buoyancy alone; but where the cold cast iron
floats upon molten cast iron of less specific gravity than itself, the
author shows that some other force, the nature of which yet re
mains to be investigated, keeps it floating; this the author has pro
visionally called the repellent force, and has shown that                amount                    its

of a metal and of the “subatom” of a metalloid (by which term I
define that mass of matter which gives us a spectrum of channelled
spaces, and builds up the continuous spectrum in its own way).
Thus, in iodine, the short lines, brought about by increase of density
in an atomic spectrum, are represented by the addition of a system
of well-defined “beats” and broad bands of continuous absorption
to the simplest spectrum, which is one exquisitely rhythmical, the
intervals increasing from the blue to the red, and in which the
beats are scarcely noticeable.
   On increasing the density of a very small thickness by a
gentle heating, the beats and bands are introduced, and, as the den
sity is still further increased, the absorption becomes continuous
throughout the whole of the visible spectrum.
   The absorption of a thickness of 5 feet 6 inches of iodine-vapour
at a temperature of 59°F. has given me no indication of bands,
while the beats were so faint that they were scarcely visible.

 spectra at those temperatures, although we undoubtedly get line
 spectra when electricity is employed, as stated in 4) give us a con
 tinuous spectrum at the more refrangible end, the less refrangible
end being unaffected.
    (y) At ordinary temperatures, in some cases, as in selenium, the
 more refrangible end is absorbed; in others the continuous spec
 trum in the blue is accompanied by a continuous spectrum in
the red. On the application of heat, the spectrum in the red dis
appears, that in the blue remains; and further, as Faraday has
shown in his researches on gold-leaf, the masses which absorb in
the blue may be isolated from those which absorb in the red. It
is well known that many substances known to be compounds in so
lution give us absorption in the blue or blue and red; and, also,
that the addition of a substance known to be compound (such as
water) to substances known to be compound which absorb the
blue, superadds an absorption in the red.
    7. In those cases which do not conform to what has been stated
the limited range of the visible spectrum must be borne in mind.
Thus Ihave little doubt that the simple gases, at the ordinary con
ditions of temperature and pressure, have an absorption in the
ultra-violet, and that highly compound vapours are often colourless
because their absorption is beyond the red, with or without an ab
sorption in the ultra-violet.             Glass is a good case in point; others
will certainly suggest themselves as opposed to the opacity of the
metals.
    8.  If  we assume, in accordance with what has been stated, that
the various spectra to which              I  have referred are really due to dif
ferent molecular aggregations, we shall have the following series,
going from the more simple to the more complex:-

scribed in another note, is at first continuous.                As the action of
the heat is continued, this continuous spectrum breaks in the
middle; one part of it retreats to the blue, the other to the red.

end; on heating, this breaks up into a channelled space-spectrum.

in the third note) make their appearance after the continuous ab

produced, while the cooler exterior vapour gives a channelled ab

(with thick lines which thin subsequently) as the heat is continued.

with grey, red, and brown sandstones, the red beds becoming more
prevalent in the upper part of the section. In Prince-Edward
Island beds apparently corresponding to these are found, and also
gradually become more red in ascending.        These are overlain, ap
parently conformably, by the Trias.
   The author gave a tabular list of 47 species of plants found in the
Upper Coal-formation of Nova Scotia and Prince-Edward Island,
and stated that all but about ten of these occur also in the Middle
Coal-formation.     The number of species decreases rapidly towards
the  upper  part of the formation; and this is especially the case in
Prince-Edward Island, some of the beds in which are considered by
the author to be newer than any of those in Nova Scotia. The
plants contained in the upper deposits were compared with those of
the European Permian, and a correlation was shown to exist be
tween them; so that it becomes a question whether this series was
not synchronous with the lower part of the Permian of Europe,
although in this district there is no stratigraphical break to esta
blish a boundary between Carboniferous and Permian.         The author
therefore proposes to name these beds Permo-Carboniferous, and
regards them as to some extent bridging over the gap which in
Eastern America separates the Carboniferous from the Trias.
   2. “ Note on the Carboniferous Conglomerates of the eastern
part of the Basin of the Eden.”        By J. G. Goodchild, Esq. Com
municated, by permission of the Director-General of the Geological
Survey of the United Kingdom, by H. W. Bristow, Esq., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
   The author commenced by describing in detail the series of beds
between the true Basement series of the Carboniferous and the
Mountain Limestone as shown in sections at Ash Fell. The general
sequence   in descending  order is as follows:—
   a. Carboniferous   Limestone,  with a few thin beds of stained sand
      stone and shale; thickness not less than 1000 feet;
   b. Obliquely laminated soft red sandstones,      with coal-measure
      plants, frequently conglomeratic, alternating with fossiliferous
      shales and beds of limestone; thickness about 500 feet;
   c. Limestone, 500 or 600 feet thick, passing down into
   d. Shales with thin impure limestones, passing down through
      calcareous   conglomeratic beds into a series of apple-geeen
      quartz conglomerates and chocolate and grey shales, succeeded
      without any clear line of separation by the drift-like red con
      glomerates, sandstones, and shales forming the lower part of the
      Carboniferous Basement beds, which has been regarded as the
      equivalent of the Upper Old Red elsewhere,
   The author described the mode of occurrence of these deposits in
various parts of the district under consideration, and the disturb
ances which have affected their surface distribution.        Along the
Cross-Fell escarpment a group of sandstones and conglomerates
occupies an exceedingly prominent position, especially at and near

Roman Fell, whence the author proposes to call these deposits the
Roman-Fell beds. These beds represent the series b, and also the
lower part of a, at Ash Fell. Following their outcrop towards Cumber
land, the conglomeratic beds from the middle downwards increase
much in thickness and become much coarser. The author regards the
Roman-Fell beds as approximately on the horizon of the Calciferous
Sandstone series of the south of Scotland; and he remarks that they
are locally undistinguishable from much of the Basement series, and
have been described by authors as undoubted Old Red Sandstone.

            Account of a Well-section in the Chalk at the North end
of Driffield, East Yorkshire.”    By R. Mortimer, Esq. Communi
cated by W. Whitaker, Esq., F.G.S.
   In this paper, which was in continuation of a former communica
tion to the Society (Q. J. G. S. vol. xxix. p. 417), the author stated
that the well-section referred to passed through 7 feet of clay and
47 feet of chalk, the upper 3 or 4 feet of the latter very rubbly and
broken. The chalk was bedded in laminae of from <U+017F>º                                                in.    to   16   in.

Prof. Agassiz, to the effect that he supposed the northern hemisphere
to have been covered in glacial times from the pole to the equator
by a solid cap of ice. He described his observations made during
33 years, and especially those of last summer, when he travelled
from England past the North Cape to Archangel, and thence by
land to the Caucasus, Crimea, Greece, and the South of Europe.
His principal results were as follows:–In advancing southwards
through Russia a range of low drift hills occurs about 60° N. lat.,
which may perhaps form part of a circular terminal moraine left
by a retreating polar ice-cap; large grooved and polished stones of
northern origin reach 55° N. lat. at Nijni Novgorod, but further
east and south no such stones could be seen.        The highest drift
beds along the whole course of the Wolga seem to have been
arranged by water moving southwards.            In America northern
boulders are lost about 39°, in Germany about 55°, and in Eastern
Russia about 56° N. lat., where the trains end and fine gravel and
 sand cover the solid rocks. Ice-action, in the form either of gla
ciers or of icebergs, is necessary to account for the transport of
large stones over the plains, and the action of moving water to
account for drift carried further south. There are no indications
of a continuous solid ice-cap flowing southward over plains in
Europe and America to, or nearly to, the Equator; but a great deal
was to be found on shore to prove ancient ocean circulation of
equatorial and polar currents, like those which now move in the
Atlantic, and much to prove the former existence of very large
local ice-systems in places where no glaciers now exist.

    In this paper the author described the jade-mines on the right
bank of the Karakash river formerly worked by the Chinese. There
 are about 120 holes in the side of the hill; and these at a little
distance look like pigeon-holes.       The rocks are a thin-bedded
rather sandy syenitic gneiss, mica- and hornblende-schists, traversed
by veins of a white mineral, apparently zeolitic, which in turn are
 traversed by veins of jade.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Gault of Folkestone.” By F. G. H. Price, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author divided the Gault into two great sections, Upper and
Lower Gault, which he again subdivided into eleven well-defined
zones, mostly named after characteristic Ammonites.      Each of these
zones or beds is numbered, commencing with No. XI., the zone of
Ammonites interruptus, which bed forms the base of the Gault,
reposing upon the Folkestone beds of the Upper Neocomian.
    He found the thickness of the deposit at Copt Point to be 99 feet
4 inches.

Nucula De Rancei–which he described.                  -
   The   paper was  accompanied    by a table of  species, setting forth the
various beds in which the    particular  fossils have been met with.
    2. “On the Cretaceous Rocks of Beer Head and the adjacent
Cliff-sections; and on the relative Horizons therein of the War
minster and Blackdown Fossiliferous deposits.”            By C. J. A. Meyer,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The author remarked that in advancing westward from the Isle
of Wight the Cretaceous rocks diminish steadily, although unequally,
in thickness, and change slightly both in mineral character and fossil
contents, while the base of the series rises gradually in the cliff-sec
tions. The chalk-cliffs of Beer Head, the most westerly chalk pro
montory in England, owe their preservation, in his opinion, partly
to a local synclinal arrangement of the strata. The Cretaceous rocks
of the district include the following, in descending order:—
                         Upper Chalk (in part)?
                         Middle Chalk.
                         Lower Chalk.
                         Chalk Marl.
                         Chloritic Marl.
                         Upper Greensand.
                         Gault.
                         (?)
    The author described in detail the minor subdivisions of these
 series, and gave lists of the fossils found in them in situ. The base
 of the section is occupied by beds which he identified with those of
 Blackdown, certainly underlying the Upper Greensand, and appa
 rently occupying the position of the Gault or of the Gault and
 Upper Neocomian in part. The Warminster beds, on the con
 trary, were said to cap the Upper Greensand, and to be in reality
 Chloritic Marl. The author suggested that the term Upper Green
 sand should be applied exclusively to beds between the Gault and
 Chloritic Marl, and that the latter should be considered a distinct
 division.

     1. “Note on some of the Generic Modifications of the Plesiosau
 rian Pectoral Girdle.”     By Harry G. Seeley, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
     The author stated that Plesiosauria differ from all living reptilia,
  except Chelonians, in wanting a sternum, and pointed out the re
  semblance between the plesiosaurian coracoid and the coracoid and
  precoracoid of Chelonians, inferring that the plesiosaurian scapula,
  had been carried forward by the potential ossification which elon

gated the plesiosaurian neck.     He compared the chelonian plastron
with the  plesiosaurian  girdle-bones, to show the dependence of form
in the chelonian    type  upon  the potential energy due to the condi
tions of locomotive   activity, and used this consideration in elucida
tion of chelonian and plesiosaurian resemblances and differences.
The plesiosaurian interclavicle he regarded as homologous with the
chelonian and lacertian interclavicle; but the chelonian clavicles he
believed to be epiphysial, potential representatives of the precora
coids, and therefore bones of which no analogues should be sought
in Plesiosaurs on the theory of their chelonian affinities. He be
lieved that the clavicles were ocasionally distinct from the inter
clavicle, though usually blended with           just           it,

girdle given by Conybeare, Hawkins, Owen, Huxley, Cope, and
Phillips were discussed, and reasons given for dissenting from their
views. The old genus Plesiosaurus was divided into two families—the
Plesiosauridae, containing the genus Plesiosaurus, and the Elasmo
sauridae, with Eretmosaurus, Colymbosaurus, and Muraenosaurus.
  A   new type was taken for the genus Plesiosaurus, which showed
distinct clavicles.     Eretnosaurus has neither clavicle nor inter
clavicle; and the scapulac, concave      front, are blended

 Museum since 1842, the date of Prof. Owen's memoir on this sub
ject, and then reviewed the determinations of Prof. Owen.       He
considered that Labyrinthodon ventricosus, Owen, is not a distinct
 species, and that L. scutulatus, Owen, has not been proved to be a

IF Ruhmkorff
   we place between the poles of the large electromagnet of
             the two extremities of the thick wire into which
the current passes from the pile—in other terms, if the circuit be
closed between the two poles, we get neither spark nor report; but
when we open it a violent detonation is produced, “almost as
powerful as the report of a pistol,” says M.A. de la Rive, who first
made the discovery. The learned Genevan physicist adds, “it
seems that the intensity of the extra current is greatly augmented
in this case by the influence of the poles of the magnet.” This is
the phenomenon which         I
                           have essayed to fathom.
   Is it necessary to interrupt the current between the two poles in
order to obtain this effect?               we increase the distance

between the two poles of the electromagnets    in order to study only
their isolated action, we shall quickly verify:—
   (1) That the phenomenon announced by De la Rive is equally
produced within the sphere of attraction of either of those poles;
   (2) That the phenomenon is not inherent in the inducing current
alone, but that the current from any independent pile, interrupted
within that sphere of attraction, gives rise to the same effects.
   (3) That the extra current receives a very real and considerable
augmentation of tension.
   Oxygen being magnetic (as M. Edm. Becquerel has proved),
there was room to ask if some action of condensation or separation
of the constituent elements of air did not take place in the mag
netic field of the pole.       I
                             therefore collected, by means of ordinary
aspirators, air from several points in that field; and analysis of it
revealed none of these peculiar actions.
    To give still more precision to this research, M. Duboscq and
I  investigated the interference-phenomena, by submitting one of
the two luminous rays, or both at once, to the action of a powerful

flector of M. Jamin. We caused the two rays, or one of them, to
pass successively    into air, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbonic

magnetic atmosphere of magnets.”             From some experiments,
which are to be realized with greater precision by means of appa

   The new electromagnet,     whichof  have the honour

              to                                                             of
obtaining very considerable dynamic effects with relatively feeble
currents.
   Each      of
           the cores consists           of

each of the tubes an insulated wire of copper is wound, always in
the same direction, the thickness of the layer of wire being greater
on the outermost tube. The extremities of the wire belonging to
each tube traverse the breech and are united so as to form only
one single conductor arranged in the following manner: the wire,
after being wound round one of the two outside tubes, passes on to
the inner tube next to this, then upon the tube concentric to the
preceding, and so on to the central tube of this core; then, having
run along the breech, it is wound round the central tube of the
second core, within which core it follows a course the reverse of
that indicated for the first core; that is to say, after winding round
each of the concentric tubes successively and in the same direction,
passing from the smallest to the largest, it issues finally after en
veloping the outside tube of the second core”.
   The following is the result of some experiments made with this
electromagnet :—
    Employing the current of ten Bunsen, elements of the usual
size with bichromate of potass, the attractive force of the electro
magnet at a distance of 124 millims. is 713 kilogrammes, and the
time required for the development of the magnetism to raise this
weight is 1:33 second.

connect the four free ends crosswise (that            connect the lower end is,

it a process of multiplication similar to Weber's, but with three
commutators.
   A commutator (I.) alternates in very rapid succession the direc
tion of the current in A and B. A second commutator (II.), moved
by the same mechanism, turns the conduction of the spirals a and
b to the galvanometer in such wise that all the induction-actions of
the diamagnet which arise in a on the alternation of the principal
current, arrive in the same direction at the galvanometer.                These
induction-shocks (10–12 per second) give, according to known laws,
a constant displacement from the position of rest.               This enduring
deflection can be    directly   observed. In        harmony    with      the                       all            in

arrangement is recommended in those cases where the measurement
of the angle cannot be carried to a greater nicety by increasing the
magnifying-power of the telescope or by large scale-distances.
    In the above-described process for observing diamagnetism,
beside the slight action to be measured, an incomparably greater
one, the direct induction of the spirals, must be compensated.          It
is therefore a principal thing with the apparatus to be able to ensure
the compensation and preserve it unaltered. This is only possible
when the system of commutators (L. and II.) satisfies certain con–
ditions in its construction, to be more particularly described in
another place, and when the spirals are well insulated, so that in
their windings no secondary closings variable with the temperature
shall exist. Now these conditions, as we learn from observation,
can be fulfilled with very remarkable completeness; and hence, in
my institute, diamagnetic measurements will be carried out accord
ing to this method with more powerful spirals.
   I                                                I
      have also executed another (and, so far as know, undescribed)
form of differential inductor, with which the induction produced
by the arising and vanishing magnetism upon the principal current
is observed.    Let four branches A, B, C, D be, after the manner
of Wheatstone's combination, united so that the principal current
divides into two branches A+B and C+D, and let the bridge
together with the galvanometer be inserted between the angle-points
A B and CD. Let the branches A and C contain each a single
spiral of great magnetizing force. Now let the action of the sta
tionary current upon the galvanometer be compensated by resist
ances in B and D.       The action, in general still present, of the extra
currents at the closing and opening of the circuit is compensated
separately, by micrometrically displacing fine iron rodlets in the less
powerful spiral until the galvanometer shows neither stationary nor
momentary deflections.      Induction, however, is immediately again
produced by the opening and closing when a feebly magnetic body
is placed in the other spiral; this can, as before, be multiplied and
measured.
   It is true that this last method is far more difficult in practice;
but it might be suitable for the investigation of certain reactions
on current-electricity.    Thus, for example, by it one might study
the question whether the rotation of the polarization of light in
magnetic or diamagnetic bodies under the influence of the current
reacts on the current, which, with present views on electricity and
the luminiferous aether, is not improbable. It was intended obser
vations of this kind that induced me to make the above-described
preliminary experiments on electrical induction-currents through
diamagnetic bodies.—Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften in

XXIX.       On the Comparison     of some Tube and other Spectra with
  the Spectrum of the Aurora.      By J. RAND CAPRON, Esq., F.G.S.*
                           [With Four Plates.]
                          by                         Ångström    to  the
 IN     a  contribution
 L solution of the
                              the late Professor
                        problem    of the aurora-spectrum   (an abstract
of which appears in “Nature’ of the 16th July, 1874), the Pro
fessor is stated, amongst other things, to have laid down certain
propositions in substance as follows:—
    1st. That the aurora has two different spectra—the one com
prising the one bright line in the yellow-green only, and the
other the remaining fainter lines.
    2ndly. That the bright line falls within a group of hydro
carbon lines, but does not actually coincide with any prominent
line of such group, and that Herr Vogel's finding this line to
coincide with a not well-marked band in the air-spectrum must
be regarded as a case of accidental coincidence.”
   3rdly. That moisture in the region of the aurora must be
regarded as nil, and that oxygen and hydrogene must alone there
act as conductors of electricity.         Professor Angström then de
tails the examination of an exhausted dry air-flask filled with
a discharge analogous to the glow of the negative pole of a
vacuum air-tube, and, comparing this with the aurora-spectrum,
gives the following results:—
          Aurora-lines, wave-lengths 4286 4703 5226
          Violet light,        22          4272 4707 5227

250            Mr.       J.    R. Capron           on the Comparison                  of some Tube
are also compared with other lines in the violet light 4654 and
4601; and the Professor then concludes that it may be in general
assumed that the feeble bands of the aurora-spectrum belong to the
spectrum of the negative pole, possibly changed more or less by
additions from the banded or the line air-spectrum.
   4thly. That the only probable explanation of the bright line is
that it owes its origin to fluorescence or phosphorescence, the Pro
fessor remarking on this point that “an electric discharge may
easily be imagined which, though in itself of feeble light, may be
rich in ultra-violet light, and therefore in a condition to cause a
sufficiently strong fluorescence,” remarking also that oxygen
and some        of       its
                   compounds are fluorescent.
   5thly. That there          need, is    no
                                       order    account for the spec
                                                         in                 to

                          have recourse    the “very great variability
                                                                  to

                                          to

 does not admit such variability, and does not admit that the way
a  gas may       brought
                    be         glow                     or

     Inorder      test the Professor's conclusions
                     to                                         experimental          in   an
way,  I  have  recently    examined some tube and other spectra not
only for line-positions, but also for general resemblance                                                    to   an
aurora-spectrum.         These experiments, few         first, led     others;   at                     to

 other recognized    micrometer-measured     spectra when they are
 compared.      In most cases the central  part of the spectrum only
 (corresponding to the central lines of the aurora) is mapped, the
 red line in the aurora not being found to correspond with any
 prominent line in the gas-spectra examined, and the auroral line
 near solar G being at present so indefinitely fixed as to render
 comparison almost valueless.      I have selected Dr. Vogel's spec
 trum as given in his Memoir (“English Mechanic,’ vol. xviii.
 No. 461, p. 446) for comparison, it being, so far as I am aware,
 the most accurately mapped with regard to wave-length at one
 observation of any auroral spectrum, and it seeming an unsafe
 plan to attempt to obtain an average aurora by comparison of
 differing observations made at various times by different observers

     This tube was one of Geissler's and of rather small calibre.                                         On
illumination the wide ends were easily lighted with silver-grey                       a

At 6 inches distance from it the line a (see drawing) in the blue
green (F solar) was very bright.        The lines marked 8, Y, 8, s,
and & also survived, but were faint. At 12 inches from the slit
a and y were alone seen; and at 24 inches a stood by itself upon
a dark ground.                    I
                       also noticed that the red and yellow parts
of the  spectrum   first lost their light on the tube being withdrawn
from the   slit; and this appeared to account for 8 disappearing

254        Mr.      J.    R. Capron            on the Comparison             of some Tube
    Tested for distance.—In the case of the C.A. tube at 18
inches from the slit the continuous spectrum and fainter lines
disappeared, while the four principal lines still shone out, that
in the green being the strongest.         At 24 inches the same
lines were still visible, though somewhat faintly.
   In the case of coal-gas, at 24 inches the whole spectrum was
quite brilliant, the four principal lines being very bright, and
even preserving their distinctive colours.     The H line, near the
line or band in the    blue, was also  plainly seen.  The O tubes,
when treated by the same current as the carbon-tubes, were
found to be         all
                  three identical   general features. The discharge
                                                       in

the  capillary  part,  were the distinguishing light colours, while
nothing could             be
                  more marked than the difference    brilliancy                        in
between these and the preceding carbon-tubes.
   The OH, tube presented very much the same character; but
the discharge occasionally varied from pinkish white     yellow    a                    to   a
colour, somewhat like what artists call brown pink, reminding
one   ofthe “golden rays”        certain aurorae. in  These       spectra                O
presented,     common with the carbon-tubes, three principal
                    in
bright lines                 the yellow, green, and blue, with
                      in or

                                shading off towards the violet. The
bands, however, showed but very little trace        local colour; and        of
the whole spectrum had          faint and washed-out look, very

    3rd, a piece of very fine brass foil cut as a pointer and
 fixed in the focus of a positive eyepiece.
    The lines or bands in both tubes were found to be slightly
 nebulous towards the less-refrangible end (where they were mea
 sured), and the O tube was not bright under a moderately high
 power (positive eyepiece); but, subject to these remarks, the three
principal lines in both tubes were found to correspond in position
within the limits of my instrument.      The spectra did not, how
ever, I am bound to say, look alike.
    I was naturally puzzled by these observations; and it then
occurred to me to reduce Dr. Vogel's spectrum of O, given in
 his memoir, to the same scale with my own. This           did inde                          I
 pendently; and I then compared the result with my own spectrum
as mapped out; and from it I judge that if my O tubes, one and
all, showed a carbon-spectrum, the learned Doctor's tube must
have been subject to a similar infirmity, as the tubes         agree                              all
in main features.

   The 5622 for the yellow line of the tube must be an error.

  The Geissler tube was probably filled designedly with coal
gas.  In the case of the barometer-tube, the spectrum may be
assumed to be the result of some carbon impurity.
     No lines of mercury could                be detected             in either     case.

     As the air-spark   spectrum may be said in some form to repre
sent   lightning,  so it would seem not unreasonable to expect a
rarefied-air  spectrum    to represent the aurora; and indeed it has
long been the practice in lecture-rooms to exhibit with con
 siderable success exhausted air-tubes excited by electricity as
 “aurora” tubes. The first tube                          I
                                              examined was an ordinary
 Geissler tube    charged   with rarefied air. The bulbs, on passing
 the discharge, were filled with the well-known rose-tinged light,
 like to the aurora-streams, which in the capillary part was con
 densed into a brighter and whiter thread, while the platinum
 wire of the negative pole was surrounded by               usual mauve        its                           or

    The spectrum, even with            weak current, was quite bright,

is the brightest of the violet-pole group, and which represents
a medium-intensity     band in the capillary spectrum.      After this
is a faint band near a, representing two rather bright ones in the
capillary spectrum, this last being succeeded by other bands in
the violet. a, 8, and y in the violet-pole were examined carefully
for relative brightness, and are, I believe, correctly marked.
   The red- or positive pole was next examined, but presented no
peculiar features.    It appeared as a fainter representation of the
capillary air-spectrum with some few lines or bands absent;
and, as will be seen after, it is also a fair representation of a dif
fused air-spectrum (see Plate V. spectrum 3).
   Examined for comparative intensity, at 24 inches from the slit,
the whole capillary air-spectrum showed faintly—the marked lines
in the centre of the spectrum generally retaining their promi
nence; but after a I judged e next in brightness. On examining
the violet pole at 12 inches from the slit, the whole spectrum was
faint, and the bands a and 8 were alone distinctly seen.
   Next to the Geissler air-tube I examined an “aurora”-tube,
about 15 inches long and 13 inch across, with platinum terminals
and of the same diameter throughout.          The discharge was of a
rosy red colour; and the long flickering stream from pole to pole
certainly much reminded me optically of an auroral streamer.
Spectroscopically    examined, the discharge presented a faint
banded air-spectrum similar to that of the positive pole (see
Plate V. spectrum 4); but the relative intensity of the lines
was somewhat altered, while a very bright line in the green (seen
also in the tube next described) was characteristic of the spec
trum, and in this respect distinguished it from the ordinary air
spectrum.
    Following this last tube I examined one purchased as “phos
phorescent.”     It was rather short (6% inches), of equal calibre,
and about the size of the bulb of a Geissler tube.        It was filled
with a white powder (probably one of the Becquerel compounds).
On passing the current between the electrodes a bright rose
coloured stream appeared; and wherever this was in contact with
the powder, the tube glowed with a brilliant green light.           On
stopping the current the tube still continued to shine, but with a
fainter green glow, which gave only a continuous spectrum.
When examined in full glow, the tube-spectrum was also in the

bands in the blue and violet portions of the spectrum (which I
have not yet worked out), while in the red, yellow, and green a
faint but distinct air-spectrum was seen ; and with this was also
found the same bright line in the green which distinguished the
“aurora”-tube.                                       -

trum were the line a (by far the brightest) corresponding to y
in the violet pole ; next was 8, a line in the yellow not appear
ing in the tube-spectrum, and then other lines of less intensity.
In the “aurora”- and “phosphorescent” tubes was found, as
 before mentioned, a line prominent for          brightness, and,    its                                  in
 deed,  inthe “aurora”-tube the only one which survived when
it  was moved away from the slit.       This line also appears        the                            in
spark-spectrum, but there only           average brightness.

     Acomparison of this spectrum suggested itself to me (as it
has  previously done to others), partly from the suspected re
lations between the aurora and the corona, and partly from a
consideration of the views lately expressed by M. Gronemann
and others in favour of the aurora having    origin  the fall   its               in             of
 an incandescent meteoric powder.
   The spectrum was obtained from spark taken over solution

rity as the late Professor Ångström can be aught than highly in
teresting and instructive; and I quite appreciate that the Pro
fessor has opened up new and apt discussion (especially upon the
subject of the presumed phosphorescent or fluorescent character
of the bright aurora-line); but, on the other hand,   find reason                        I
to differ from him in his absolute conclusions as to the violet
pole spectrum ; and on some other points in his memoir,                                                     I
further feel strongly that whatever advance the learned Pro
fessor's memoir may have made in that direction, there is still
plenty of auroral ground left for spectroscopists to work upon,
and that the legacy Professor Herschel speaks      though unde                  of,
niably rich, may, like some other legacies, give rise      good                                to   a
deal    of
         discussion              among          the legatees before                its    benefits        are
reached.
    Professor Angström's                        principal     propositions               seem        to    be
these    :—
   1st. Two auroral spectra.       agree     this, but question
                                                    I                in
whether the fainter lines  may   not  comprise   more than one
spectrum.
   2nd.  Icagree also that the bright yellow-green line falls,                                             as
Professor Angström describes, just behind the second line     the                                    in
hydrocarbon yellow group. And find,       common with the Pro

           well-marked     prominent line  or  the air-spectrum          in
with which    accords.

    3rd. This may      conveniently divided into two parts, viz.:-
                              be
    A.  The proposition that “moisture           the region    inthe aurora              of

          regarded      nil.”    as
    Here    see reason       differ, since (to quote

that the white arc, streamers, and floating patches                    light                    of

           feel much more in accord with Professor   Angström’s
memoir upon the subject of the phosphorescence or fluorescence
of the bright yellow-green aurora line.
      I
      do not notice that the Professor touches upon the external
features of the aurora in respect of these phenomena; perhaps
the following extracts from my own note-book on this point may
not be uninteresting.                    I
                           quote from them as made at the time.
    October  20th, 1870.-I noted the grand auroral display of
that evening including “streamers of opaque white phosphorescent
cloud very different from the more common transparent auroral
diverging streams of light.” (On this occasion, too, may mention           I
I   saw sharp and clear both the red and the green lines with
Browning's miniature spectroscope.                          I
                                            also noted a peculiar

flickering of the green line.)
   February 4th, 1872–A fine display. The first signs were (in
dull daylight) “a lurid tinge upon the clouds, which suggested
the reflection of a distant fire, while, scattered among these, torn
and broken masses of white vapour having a phosphorescent ap
pearance” . . . . . . reminded me of a similar appearance in Oc
tober 1870.    Then follows a description of the formation of the
corona.    Day aurorae too, not unfrequently recorded, we should
suppose could hardly be seen without the presence of some phos
phorescent glow.
   Having regard to the near proximity of the phosphoretted
hydrogen band to the bright aurora-line, to the circumstance of
this band brightening by reduction of temperature (a phenomenon
probably connected with ozone), to the peculiar brightening of
one line in the “aurora” and “phosphorescent” tubes, and to
the observed circumstance that the electric discharge has a phos
phorescent or fluorescent afterglow (I believe this was isolated
by Faraday),              I
                feel there is strong evidence in favour of such an
origin to the principal aurora-line,                   if

   5th. Professor Ångström opens a wide door to discussion in
his proposition of the invariability of gas-spectra; and I cannot
now attempt to follow this interesting part of the present sub
ject. Suffice it to say that, if the Professor makes this assertion
in    its
       strictest sense    can hardly suppose
                                    (I               means it), there
                                                                he   so
is,    far
      so             as
                  am aware,
                     I                       no
                                 one spectrum that can claim place
with the aurora-spectrum.       Giving greater latitude     the Pro            to
fessor's words,   we may    think assume
                                    I      upon  competent authority
that lines vary      number and brilliancy with temperature, and
                               in                                                     in
breadth with pressure; and again, Kirchhoff, inspeaking       vapour            of
films      increasing the intensity
            as                         lines, states “it may happen
                                                     of

           and other Spectra with the Spectrum                               of the Aurora.                 265
that the spectrum appears to be totally changed when the mass of
vapour is altered.”                  I
                        suppose, too, we may now add magnetism
as capable of effecting a change in certain spectra—though this
subject is at present new and only partially explored.
   Thus far          I
               have given the results of some observations made
with a view to test experimentally                                    Professor        Ångström's COIl
clusions on the aurora-spectrum.    It will no doubt be remarked
by some who look at my drawings, that            have obtained a                  I
number of   negatives, but that there is no   positive   result any
where.          I
            quite admit  this, and am  disappointed    in so doing;
but then it must be remembered that one way of   finding   out what
                 is,
a thing         isfind out what
                          to            not.     venture    think,
                                                            it   is          I                    to

and that, although                   no

the auroral  conditions,  we may still usefully examine the set

    $84. Ammonium Alum.—This body was examined on account
of the large percentage of water which is held by the ordinary
hydrated salt.    The cryohydrate solidifies at —0°2. The part
last to solidify was examined; of this, 4:38 15 grims. contained
0-2060 grim. of anhydrous alum. This shows 4.7 per cent. Of
the immediately preceding crop of crystals, 5-2400 grims. gave
0-2220 of anhydrous alum, or 4.2 per cent. The first of these
determinations indicates the relationship

    § 85. Perchloride of Mercury.—A saturated solution of cor
rosive sublimate solidifies at -0°2.        The ultimate and penulti
mate portions were examined.         Of the former, 6.0640 grims.
gave 0-197, or 324 per cent.; of the latter, 4.977 grims, gave
0-164, or 3:29 per cent. The first indicates the formula

    § 86. Oralate of Ammonium.—This solidifies as a cryohydrate
at —0°2. Of the last portion to solidify, 4:340 grims. contained
0.125, or 2.8 per cent. of the anhydrous salt. This agrees with
the relation
                       NH, CO, +239-1H,0.
    § 87. Carbonate of Sodium.—After igniting the carbonate so
 as to decompose any bicarbonate, the saturated salt solidifies as
 a cryohydrate at -2°.      Of the final portion, 6.4090 grms. con
tained 0.383 of Na,COs.        This shows 5:97 per cent., or the
relation

    § 88. The following Table shows at a glance the relation be
 tween the lowest attainable temperature when the salt is mixed
 with ice, the temperature of the solidification of the cryohydrate,
 the water-worth or aquavalent.       Column 1 shows the salt em
 ployed, and the degree of hydration when associated with water
 of crystallization. Column 2 shows the temperature obtained
 when the salt is mixed with ice.       Column 3 shows the tempe
 perature at which the cryohydrate separates.          In column 4 are
 shown the number of molecules of water associated with one
 molecule of the salt in the cryohydrate.            It is here called
 “water-worth.”      In column 5 are the percentages of the anhy
 drous salt which the final portions of the cryohydrates contained,

   § 89. Remarks on Table—The above Table contains the whole
                     I
of the salts which have as yet examined fully. The interesting
group of the chlorides of the alkaline earths, including magne
sium and the no less interesting group of the perchlorides of
aluminium and iron, have presented difficulties with which am                             I
still contending.   The same is the case with the nitrate of cal
cium and the chloride of copper, CuCl2.
                                               I
   From the evidence before us think, however, that may                               I
venture to enunciate the general law, that if we define as similar
salts either (1) those which consist of the same acid united with
bases belonging to the same chemical group (ex. Na2SO4, K2SO4),
or (2) those which consist of the same base united with acids
belonging to the same group (ex. KNO3, KClOs), or (3) those
whose bases belong to the same group, and whose acids be
long to the same group—then, of similar salts, the one which
produces the greatest cold when used in a freezing-mixture  unites
as a cryohydrate with the fewest molecules of water. And to the
following law there seems to be only one pronounced exception:
The temperature at which the cryohydrate is formed is the same
as the temperature of the corresponding freezing-micture.    This
latter law, however, has to be taken with reserve as far as those
salts are concerned which, like AlCls and MgCl2, decompose
water, and also in regard to those bodies which, like CaCl2,
unite with water under the liberation of much heat. These                                      I
shall consider in my next communication                  to the Society.

   § 90. Of very great interest is the behaviour which is shown
by mixtures of ethylic alcohol and water when deprived of

consequence of the use of alcoholic liquids in regions of ex

deration.  The two liquids are miscible in     proportions.  all

in the Annales   de Chimie et de Physique, entitled “Sur la refroi
dissement et la congélation des liquides alcoholiques et des vins.”
According to M. Boussingault, frozen wines after thawing fur
nish an alcoholic liquid and are not therefore pure ice. Accord
ing to M. Melsens, alcoholic liquids containing about 50 per
cent. of alcohol by weight or by volume become at—30°C. viscid,
syrupy, and sometimes opalescent.     These represent commercial
spirits such as rum, cognac, &c., and may be represented by the
formula C, HsO4-3H, O, corresponding to the maximum con
densation.    According, again, to M. Melsens, when wine which
has become semisolid through being exposed to cold of a free
zing-mixture is drained through wire gauze or introduced into a
turbine, nearly colourless ice free from alcohol is left.     From
frozen wine containing from 10 to 12 per cent. of alcohol, from
16 to 25 per cent. of pure      was got      ice

   Messrs. Dupré and Page epitomize one branch of their research
as follows:—“The whole of the physical characters of mixtures
of alcohol and water come to a maximum deviation from their
theoretical values somewhere between 30 and 45 per cent. of
alcohol by weight.   The 30 per cent. nearly corresponds to the
formula C2H6O +6H2O (29.87 per cent.); the 45 per cent.
has approximately the formula C. He O+3H, 0 (46 percent.).”
The mean of these values is
                                     C. He O+4.5H2O.
    § 94. According to Rudberg (Pogg, Ann, vol. xiii. p. 496),
the contraction is greatest when 55 volumes of alcohol are mixed
with 45 volumes of water, or 43-6 weights of alcohol with 45
weights of water. This corresponds to the formula
                                     C, HsO4-2-6B, O.
  § 95. According to Bussy, alcohol not stronger than 33
Beaumé may be frozen by the evaporation of SOs. This strength
is that of 78.29 per cent. of alcohol by weight, or
                             C. He O+ 1.406H2O.
   According to           Marchand (Journ, für Chemie,
                                             vol. xxv. p. 253),
when 1 part by weight of spirit is mixed with 1 part of snow,
the depression of temperature depends upon the strength of the
spirit, according to the following Table:—

and water are brought into contact, the initial temperature                                                            of

grims. was placed in the inner of two long test-tubes, which were
then sunk to the neck in the ice of an ice-calorimeter: a stopper
of cotton-wool prevented the outer air from coming into contact
with the graphite. As the graphite was gradually cooled down
the motion of the mercury thread was carefully noted, with the
result that the forward movement was equal to 0-11 division per
minute. When the temperature of the graphite was 0° it was
quickly removed and placed in the receiving-vessel of the calori
meter, and the movement of the mercury thread again carefully
noted.    The forward movement was exactly the same as that
noticed before the introduction of the graphite; hence it follows
that there is not the smallest evolution of heat from the contact
of graphite with water.        Another experiment proved that the
amount of gas absorbed by 3 grims. of lamellar graphite did not
alter the weight of the mass so much as one milligramme.
   The following experiments were carried out with a piece of
very pure lamellar graphite from Ceylon.                      The percentage of
ash in this  sample   of  graphite     was   0.38;       the numbers deduced
for the specific heat will therefore hold good for absolutely pure
graphite within 1 or 2 units in the fourth decimal place.                     I  did
not determine the     hydrogen    which was        possibly       present, as Kopp
has found that the amount of this element in Ceylon graphite is
exceedingly small, varying from 06 to '17 per cent.

that the specific heat of graphite, as that of diamond, is expressed

appears that, in the curves expressing the specific heats of dia

cific heat of graphite, within the temperature-intervals    550° to
750°, 750° to 900°, and 900° to 1050°, changes linearly with

mental methods were not delicate enough to determine this
question with precision, it is safer to deduce from the foregoing
results the following generalization only—that, from a red heat
 upwards, the specific heat of carbon does not vary more than the
specific heats of those elements which fulfil the law of Dulong and
Petit. Thus Bedé* shows that the specific heats of the follow
ing elements for the temperatures T are
               Copper =0.0910+0-0000467,
               Zinc . =0.0865+0.000088T,

                         =0.0286-0-000038T.
   (2) The  specific heats of graphite and diamond are identical
from the  temperature   600° and upwards (there are slight diver
gencies, but they do not exceed # to 2 per cent. of the value of
y). By reducing, by the help of the mean differential quotient
#=0000556,             the above values for the specific heat                  of gra
phite to the temperatures 606°7, 806°5, and 985°0, and com
paring these with the specific heat of diamond at the same tem
peratures, we obtain the numbers

   Although  the small difference increases with an increasing
temperature,  nevertheless it is not greater than the difference
between the specific heats of different modifications of other ele
ments. Thus, according to Regnault, the mean specific heats
between 10° and 100° for steel and copper are                    ...
          Soft steel =0,1165                 Soft copper           =00948
          Hard steel =0,1175                 Hard      copper =0.0934
    These differences may         be
                                  accounted for          by

   As the differences for graphite are 0-78            greater than those
for diamond, these new 'experiments show that the specific heat
of graphite is a very little greater than that of diamond, viz.
                  0.0020 between 550 and 756,
                  0.0031        ,       750   ,   1000.

 show that, from    the point (about 600°) at which the specific heat
 of carbon ceases   to vary with increase of temperature and becomes
 comparable with     that of other elements, any real difference in the
 specific heats of the two modifications disappears, and carbon obeys
 the law  of Dulong     and Petit.
    By multiplying the values obtained for the specific heat of
 carbon between 600° and 1000° by the generally received atomic
 weight 12 (deduced from the vapour-density of carbon com
 pounds), we obtain a product varying from 5:4 to 5-6, which
 agrees with the atomic heat of those other elements which have
 small atomic weights (aluminium 5-7, phosphorus 5:5, sulphur
 5'5, &c.).
    All the anomalies in the specific heat of carbon disappear when
 the temperature reaches a red heat.

    The results which have obtained are not in keeping with
 those of Dewar”, who obtained for gas-carbon the number 0314
 as represeuting the mean specific heat from 20° to 1040°, for
 graphite 0-310, and for diamond 0.366. For the mean specific
 heat of “carbon’ between 20° and the temperature of the oxy
 hydrogen blowpipe (estimated at 2100°) Dewar obtained the num
 ber 0-374.
     From these numbers Dewar concludes that “the true specific

now quickly sealed and the weight determined.      The weight of
the  glass tube was 1-105  grm., and that of the enclosed porous
carbon l'410 grim.    A platinum spiral weighing 0-655 grim.
served as a weight to sink the tube under the water in an ice
calorimeter.   The specific heat of the platinum spiral between
0° and T was Co-T-003194-0-000004T.            The mean specific
heat of the glass employed was from 0° to 24°=0-1880, 0° to
99°=0-2017, 0° to 2039–0-2103,0° to 256°-0-2136.            From
the following tabulated results the amounts of heat given up by
the porous carbon, the glass, and the platinum spiral, in cooling
from 23°, 99°, and 224° to 0°, are obtained; and from these and
the data already given the specific heat of porous carbon for the
above-mentioned              temperature-intervals              are deduced.

After each experiment the crystals were removed from the tin
foil vessel, dried, and placed in a new vessel. In the last expe
riment, where the boron was heated to a temperature above the
melting-point of the tinfoil, a vessel of glass, the mean specific
heat of which from 0° to 263° was 0.2141, was employed,

    These results show that the specific heat of crystalline boron
varies, within the temperature-interval                   —80° to +260°, in a
 manner     exactly  analogous       with that of the variation of the specific
heats of both modifications of carbon.                  As with these, so in the
case   of boron     there appears to be an inflection-point in the
 neighbourhood       of 0°. The wonderful agreement between the
 variation in the specific heats of boron and carbon from —80°
 to +260° makes it almost certain that at higher temperatures

of silicon increases from 200° to 300° in the same proportion as
it does from 184° to 232°, it will attain the value 02055 at
300°.       Multiplying this number by 28 (the atomic weight of
silicon deduced in accordance with Avogadro's law), we obtain
the number 575.            This number is in keeping with those ex
pressing the atomic heats of the metals. Then, taking Regnault’s
determination, we have the following atomic heats:–

     Silicon does not form an eatraordinary exception to the law of
Dulong and Petit; so soon as the temperature passes 200” it
comes within the sphere of this law.               From these experiments
it also follows, that the smallest relative weight of silicon (28)
hitherto found in the molecule of any of the gaseous compounds of
 this element is in reality the atomic weight of silicon.

     (1) The values of the specific heats of the elements carbon,
 boron, and silicon change with the temperature; these values
 gradually increase with an increase of temperature until a point
 is reached at which they are constant.             This point is situated at
about 600° for carbon and            boron,    at about 200° for silicon.
 The specific heat of carbon at 600° is about seven times, that of
 boron about two and a half times as great as at —50°. The
nature of the function expressing the relation between the spe
cific heat yr and the temperature appears to be the same for the
 three elements, and to have the form
                              _A   n  1 +AT

 where A, B, q, and h represent positive quantities, and T the
 temperature calculated for absolute zero.
     The specific heats of the elements are not, generally speaking,
 expressed by constant numbers, the physical condition of the
 elements influencing their specific heats as much as their che
 mical nature.       The idea that the temperature exercises but an
 insignificant influence upon the magnitude of the specific heats
 of the elements, and that this influence may be overlooked with

                   the Elements Carbon, Boron, and                          Silicon.               299
out introducing any serious error into the determination of the
specific heat, may now no longer be entertained.
   (2) The constant final values for the specific heats of carbon,
boron, and silicon are, in round numbers, 0:46, 0:50, and 0-205
respectively.    The products of these numbers, multiplied into
the atomic    weights 12, 11, and 28, are
                       5.5, 5'5, and 5-8,
values which are in keeping with the atomic heats of the metals
and of the other non-metals.    Carbon, boron, and silicon, which
hitherto formed the most marked exceptions to the law of Du
long and Petit, are now shown to obey this law when a certain
temperature is reached.   This law may therefore be accepted as
binding in the case of                  all
                            the elements;    must, however,            it                               be

                   in   a

with the temperature; for every element, however, there                                            is   a

      (1) Reasoning from analogy, it may be supposed that the      dif
 ferent modifications of boron and silicon will show, as regards
  specific heat, a behaviour similar to that of the modifications of
  carbon.     This point I hope to settle by experiments carried out
  during the present winter.
       (2) It may be supposed that the specific heats of those com
  pounds into the composition of which carbon, silicon, or boron
  enters, will exhibit a variation with the temperature analogous
  to that exhibited by the elements themselves.      My experiments,
  so far as  they have gone,  fully  bear out the truth of this sup
  position.
      The physical cause of the variation in the specific heat of car
  bon is to be sought for in the constitution of the atoms, not in
  that of the molecules.
      On the supposition that the specific heats of the elements
  hydrogen and oxygen are as constant in their compounds as in
 the free state (and there seems no reason to doubt the truth of
  this supposition), it is possible, from a series of observations at
  different temperatures of the specific heat of a compound (C, H.),
   (C, O), or (C, O, H), to deduce the specific heat of the carbon
  in the compound as a function of the temperature.
      So far as my researches have gone,  I find that, in gaseous and
 liquid carbon compounds, the specific heat of the carbon is a
  function of the temperature, but that the nature of this function
  varies from compound to compound.        The specific heat of carbon
  when in combination is a function of the temperature and of all
  those circumstances which influence the quality of the non-carbo
 nated part of the compound molecule.      Thus the specific heat of
 carbon in carbon monoxide, CO, for every degree of temperature
 from —30° to 250°, is totally different from the specific heat of
 carbon in the dioxide, CO2; the function of the temperature
 representing the specific heat of carbon in the compound CH, is
 of an entirely different nature from that representing the specific
 heat of the same element in the compound Clo Hig.
      Hence it follows that the constitution of the carbon atom
 differs according to the nature of the molecule of which it forms
 a part; for example, the carbon in CO2 is of a different nature
 from the carbon in CO.           Hence it is self-evident   that the
 “chemical value” of carbon is not constant; that “ varying
equivalency” or “polyequivalency” of carbon is possible, as is
indeed exhibited in the compounds CO and CO2.
     In the specific heat of carbon, considered as a function of the
temperature, we have therefore a means of settling one of the
most important questions in the theory of the carbon compounds
—the question as to the constancy or variability of the nature of
the carbon atom in the compounds formed by that element.            A

bon, which have hitherto appeared anomalous seem to find their
explanation in this variability of the carbon atom.    Thus the
heats of combination in certain reactions are as follows:–
        C, O                                                C, H2= —4584

   On the assumption that the nature of the carbon atom does not
vary, these facts are difficult of explanation.    Regnault's results
regarding the specific heats of liquid and gaseous carbon com
pounds” are explained by adopting the hypothesis that the nature of
the carbon atom varies in                            its
                               different compounds. The great va

This hypothesis, put forward by Kopp, Berthelot, and others to
account for the seeming exception of carbon &c. to Dulong and
Petit’s law, yet remains as the most probable means of account
ing for the changes in the specific heats of those bodies, although
it is now shown that they obey the above-named law. Before
these questions regarding the constitution of the atoms of these
elements can be answered, careful researches upon the specific
heats of their compounds must be undertaken.      I propose to dis
cuss the theoretical bearings of these questions in another instal
ment of this paper.

          and true Inference were friends and fellow-travellers,
      F Fact
        or if
          the latter followed the former at an easy distance, we
should always find them on smooth roads and under a cloudless
sky. Whoever discovered the one, would be quite sure that the
other was close at hand, neither impeded by the quicksands of
doubt, nor hidden from view by the fog of hypothesis.     Medio
crity would then be   as efficient as genius, and we should be
constrained to acknowledge    the truth of Lord Bacon's assertion,
that “our method of   discovering   the sciences is such as to leave
little to the acuteness and strength of wit, and indeed rather
to level wit and intellect” f.
   The difference between a non-scientific and a scientific                             intel
lect is supposed, at least in modern times, to consist in this,
that while the one mixes up facts with their inferential ocular
spectra in such a way as almost to justify the sarcasm that
“there are more false facts than false theories current,” the
other carefully isolates facts from their theoretical or hypo
thetical shackles, and proclaims from the housetops “we know
that these are facts, we infer that this is their explanation.”
   And with good reason; for a fact stands out in objective pro
minence, and, as such, must present the same aspect to every
same observer—whereas      the inference is eminently subjective,
             it its

   When a scientific man says, “In the year 18–      established                          I
this fact,” he is within philosophical bounds, supposing the
fact to be such as can be repeated and verified by persons
capable of performing an experiment with accuracy.    But when
he says,        “In
                the year 18—I established this explanation,” he
becomes non-scientific, because he confuses that which admits of
proof with that which can only be a matter of inference.

between the sides and the gaseous solution is perfect; and
therefore the sides may be regarded, pro ratá, as merely a con
tinuation of the liquid itself, and no bubbles will form there
any more than in the central parts of the liquid.     (2) But sup
pose the sides to be chemically unclean, adhesion is diminished
or destroyed, and therefore the surface of the liquid next to
such sides is virtually as free as                         its
                                      upper surface; consequently

the side below the surface, introduces air and not oil—or that a
clean glass rod on which no bubbles appear, taken out and
drawn with friction through the hand, acquires an air coating,
which causes it to be covered with bubbles when returned to
 the soda-water.    A man must be strangely fascinated with his
 own    hypothesis to maintain such a proposition; and yet M.
 Gernez, after a lapse of eight years, attempts to explain my
 results (which have been confirmed by Professor Schrötter *)
 by seriously maintaining that the effect of washing with caustic
potash solution, boiling distilled water, or alcohol is not to
 make the solid surfaces chemically clean, but to deprive them
of the film of air which clings to them.         quote his language:I
—“Si l’on a soin de dissoudre, par des lavages successifs à la
potasse, à l’eau distillée bouillante et à l'alcool, la couche super
ficielle des vases de verre en certains points de laquelle se trou
verait retenue une petite quantité d'air, on constate qu'il ne se
forme plus une seule bulle gazeuse sur la paroi baignée par le
liquide, pas plus qu’à l’intérieur de la solution sursaturée entre
des limites de température et de pression très-étendues” (p. 44).
    As to the action of porous bodies in liberating gas from solu
tion, I have long since endeavoured to show that they act by
reason of that strong adhesive force of which the absorptive
power of charcoal for various gases affords striking examples.

    An application of the same principle affords another trans
formation of some interest for P(1, 3, 5 ...)a. It was proved by
Euler that P(1, 3, 5 ...)a is equal to the number of partitions of
a' into the parts 1, 2,                3...
                               in which each part only appears once

we see that    partition

The value of P(1, 3, 5...)a given by (4) is in fact that found by
Euler (Opera minora collecta, vol. i. p. 93). The class of parti
tions without omissions is one which has not, believe, been par                                    I
ticularly noticed before; and it is curious that it should be iden
tical with the partitionment into uneven numbers.
   There is also another mode of transforming this latter class of
partitions, which can be best made clear by an example. Thus,
consider the partition 1 +3+3+7, and arrange the parts     -  as in
the following scheme:–

   In like manner the work that can be gained during the mix
ing of any number of pure and different gases, which press                                                     in
dependently, is the sum of those due to the expansions of the
several gases from their original to their final volumes, where the
volume of a gas is understood to mean the space in which the gas
is confined.
   The next problem which presents itself is that of finding the
work that may be done during the mixture of two quantities
of mixed gases—for example, oxygen and hydrogen.         Suppose
the two mixtures to be contained in a cylinder, and separated
from one another by a piston which moves freely. The rule is that
the work required to be estimated is that which would be gained
during the equalization of the oxygen-pressures if the hydrogen
were annihilated, together with that which would be gained du
ring the equalization of the hydrogen-pressures if the oxygen
were annihilated.
   If the proportions of the gases are the same in the two                                 is,
mixtures, and also the total pressures, there                course, no                    of
possibility     doing work.

hydrogen, the more general rule reduces             that already given
for pure gases.

be done during the mixing of a volume vo of two gases under
the partial pressures QI and Q, with a large quantity of the

when there is free diffusion than when the gases are uniformly
mixed; for if the gases be allowed to rise from the reservoir
tolerably quickly (or if a series of movable pistons be interpo

consideration shows that extreme purity in any gas will always
be attained and maintained with difficulty.            Even when the ne
cessary work is small, as in the separation of oxygen from the
atmosphere, it is well to bear in mind that some work is abso
lutely essential. The reversible absorption of the oxygen of air
may be effected by a substance like baryta; but we must not
expect to recover the pure oxygen at the same temperature and
under a pressure equal to the total pressure at which it was
absorbed.      Either the temperature must be raised, or the gas
must be exhausted at a pressure less than that under which it
existed in the mixture during the absorption.             It is just possible
that this point might be found to be of practical importance in
the solution of the problem of extracting oxygen from the air.

An Elementary Treatise       on the Integral Calculus, containing Applica
   tions to Plane Curves and Surfaces, with numerous Eramples.             By
   BENJAMIN WILLIAMSON, A.M., Fellow and Tutor, Trinity College,
   Dublin. London: Longmans, Green, and Co. 1875 (crown 8vo,
   pp. 267).
 WEonhave      already noticed Mr. Williamson's ‘Elementary Treatise
           the Differential Calculus’ (vol. xliii. p. 307), and have now
to perform the same office for his companion volume on the Integral
Calculus,     a work characterized by the same excellences as those
which marked the previous volume. It is written with clearness
and accuracy, and is illustrated with an abundance of examples. Its
contents may be briefly described as consisting of three parts.            In
the first are given the ordinary methods of integration, viz. by re
duction to known forms, of rational fractions, by successive reduc
tion, and by rationalization.           In this part of the work, which
occupies the first five chapters, integration is treated simply as the
inverse of the process of differentiation.          In the next part, the
sixth  chapter,  a sufficient account is  given  of Definite Integrals; and
here the student is introduced to the notion of integration as a
process of summation.         In the latter part of this chapter some ac
count is  given   of the Eulerian Integrals, particularly of the second ;
and at the end there is a table of values of the gamma function
(log T (p)+10) from p-1-000 to p-1999 to six places of deci
mals; but the method of constructing this table is omitted as “too
complicated for insertion in an elementary treatise.”              The third
part of the book, comprised in chapters seventh, eighth, and ninth,
explains the application of the Integral Calculus to finding areas and
lengths of curves and volumes of solids. In this part will be found
many useful and interesting properties of curves; e.g. in addition
to those which we might expect to find almost as a matter of
course,   we may      mention     Lambert's   theorem on the area of an

320                               Royal Society      :-
elliptic sector, areas of roulettes, the theory of Amsler's plani
meter, Landen's theorem on the length of a hyperbolic arc, Stei
ner's theorem on the rectification of roulettes, and some others.
    It will be seen, from this brief account of the contents, that the
work is of a strictly elementary character. Such subjects as the
expansion of functions in trigonometrical series, elliptic functions,
and the Calculus of Variations are simply omitted; while the trans
formation of the independent variable and double integration are
but briefly noticed. Within the limits which the author has assigned
to himself, however, the treatment is very full and satisfactory; and
the work is well adapted to the wants of those for whom it is writ
ten, viz. students in the Universities, very few of whom (as we
suppose) will find it necessary to enter into the subject beyond the
contents of the present volume.

screwed on at each end of the main tube; these caps are closed
by a glass plate at one end, and have each a small side tube
for the purpose of passing hydrogen or other gases through the
hot tube.       The furnace is supplied with coke or charcoal; an
electric lamp, connected with thirty Grove's cells, is placed at one
end of the tube and a one-prism spectroscope at the other. The
temperatures reached by this furnace may be conveniently divided
into four stages:—
   I. When the continuous spectrum of the tube extends to the
sodium-line D, this line not being visible.
   II. When the continuous spectrum extends a little beyond D,
this line being visible as a bright line.
   III. When the spectrum extends into the green, D being very
   §
bright.   .
         When the spectrum extends beyond the green and D be
comes invisible as a line, and the sides      of the furnace are at a red
heat.
   I may add (1) that
         employ
                            I  have only within the last few days been
able to            the third and fourth stages of heat, as the furnace
was    previously    without a chimney, and the necessary draught
could not be obtained; and (2) that          I was informed, a little time
ago, by Prof. Roscoe that, with a white-hot tube, he had observed
new spectra in the case of Na and K. These spectra, which           I  now
constantly see when these temperatures are reached,           I  shall call
the “new spectra.”
   9. The results of the experiments, so far as the visible spectrum
is concerned, between the stages indicated may be stated as
follows:—
      H. No absorption.
      N. No absorption.
      K.    I have  observed,    either separately or together:-

                     time, the light being transmitted in the centre of

               (3) Continuous absorption clinging on one side or
                     other of the line. (This phenomenon, which, so
                     far as  I  know, is quite new, will be described in
                     another note.)

                     trum.
               (y) Continuous absorption clinging on one side or the

    11. It will be seen from the foregoing statement that if similar
spectra be taken as indicating similar molecular conditions, then
the vapours, the densities of which have been determined, have
not been in the same molecular condition among themselves. Thus
the vapours of K, S, and Cd, at the fourth stage of heat, gave us
line, channelled-space, and continuous absorption in the blue re
spectively.          This is also evidence that each vapour is non-homo
geneous for a considerable interval of time, the interval being
increased as the temperature is reduced.

      3. The time of the late glaciers, the special subject of the
         paper.
   After expressing himself in opposition to the hypothesis of a great
polar ice-cap, the author described this last period as one not of
mere local glaciers, but as characterized by a return of a great ice
sheet over nearly the whole of Scotland and Ireland; but he stated
that this ice-sheet was probably neither so thick, so extensive, nor
so enduring as that of the first period of glaciation, which cleared
away every thing in the shape of superficial deposits down to the
hard rock.      He believed, however, that in the last period the
mountains of Scotland and Wales, as well as the Pennine range and
the rest of the north of England as far as Derby, were covered with
thick ice, which in most parts reached down to the sea, and that
extensive snow-beds prevailed over the rest of England.          In the
summer months the melting of these would give rise to streams of
muddy water, and produce the superficial deposits of Brick-earth,
Warp, and Loess; whilst, when the currents were stronger, perhaps
from the thaw being unusually rapid, deposits of gravel would be
formed. This second ice-sheet would gradually become less and
break up into valley-glaciers, which in their retreat would leave
kaims and eskers at low levels, and moraines in the mountain
 glens.   During this time no new great submergence of the country
 took place;   and the last great modifications of the surface were sub
 aérial, and not submarine, the work having been done by frost, rain,
 and glaciers.
   2. “Notes on the Upper Engadine and the Italian Walleys of
Monte Rosa, and their relation to the Glacier-erosion Theory of
Lake-basins.”       By the Rev. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.G.S.
   The author stated that he had examined:—(1) the small lakes on
the summit of the Bernina Pass. These were situated in a position
very favourable to glacier-erosion, and, he thought, might be attributed
to that cause.     (2) The lakes on the upper part of the Maloya Pass.
These   lay  in three rock-basins, and at first sight seemed favourable
to the glacier-erosion     theory; but further examination showed that
they were in no way connected with the glacial system of the neigh
bourhood, and were probably preglacial.           (3) The Val Bregaglia to
the Lake of Como. The          presence  of barriers in the valley, its fre
quent W-like form, and the signs         of   glacial action   to  near the

 since no approach to this form, no U-like trough, was found in the
 valleys down which the glaciers had flowed on their way to the
 lakes.    As, then, the principal features of the district appeared to be
preglacial, he contended that disturbances of the beds of the valleys
along lines transverse to their direction were more likely to have
produced the lakes.

    The following communications were read:—
    1.  “On   the occurrence of Thanet beds and of Crag at Sudbury,
Suffolk.”     By William Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S. .
    After referring to some passages in papers by Mr. Prestwich, in
which the probable existence of Thanet beds in North Essex is
mentioned, the author described certain sections near Balingdon, on
the right bank of the Stour, which exhibit sands belonging to this
series. The principal section at the Great Chalk-pit, Balingdon,
shows, in descending order, beds belonging to the London Clay,
Reading beds 9 feet, and Thanet sands about 14 feet, resting on
Chalk. No fossils occur in the Thanet beds; and their identification
is founded on the uniformity in the character of the sands, their
resemblance      in fineness, compactness, and colour to the Thanet
sands of West Kent, the presence at the base of the series of a green
sand resembling the “base-bed ” of the Thanet sand, and the oc
currence immediately beneath it of a layer of tabular flint, as is
usual where the Thanet sand caps the chalk.
    The Crag-beds described by the author are found on the left bank
of the Stour, in Suffolk, and consist of ferruginous dark reddish
brown sand, with layers of ironstone, slightly false-bedded, with
here and there light-coloured grit with broken shells. In the lower
part there are layers of flint pebbles, phosphatic nodules, and phos
phatized bones, which also form a bed about 1 foot thick at the
bottom. These beds rest on deposits belonging to the lower portion
of the Thanet sands, and these again on the Chalk. In one pit a
considerable number of fossils occur, but not in a condition to
enable them to be satisfactorily determined. From their position and
general characters these beds were referred by the author to the
Red Crag.
    2. “Note on a modified form of Dinosaurian ilium, hitherto
reputed Scapula, indicative of a new genus, or possibly of a new
order of Reptiles.”      By J. W. Hulke, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The author reexamines Mantel's “Scapula of an unknown Rep
tile”=Owen’s “Scapula of Megalosaurus?”, and adduces reasons
for considering it to be a modified Dinosaurian ilium.       He describes
two new examples of the bone in Dr. Wilkins's collection, contrasts
them with undoubted scapula of sundry Dinosaurs and existing
reptiles, and proves their essential correspondence with the ilia of
known Dinosaurs.

   3. “Note on a Reptilian Tibia and Humerus (probably of Hylaeo
saurus), from the Wealden Formation in the Isle of Wight.”       By
J. W. Hulke, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In this communication the author describes two saurian limb
bones, remarkable for the great expansion of their articular ends,
and the shortness and smallness of their shaft. The features of the
tibia are more like those of the tibia of Hylaeosaurus than of any
other Dinosaur. This resemblance, and the suitability of the humerus
to the very massive articular end of the Hylaeosaurian scapula, dis
pose the author to refer the bones to this Saurian.

      ON THE MAGNETIZING-FUNCTION                          OF TEMPERED               STEEL.
                                     BY E. BOUTY.
     HE  magnetic moment of a magnetized needle may always be
      regarded as the product of two factors, of which the one
expresses the quantity of magnetism contained in the needle (or,
if preferred, the power of each pole), while the other factor is
equal to the distance of the poles. By the advice of M. Jamin                                           l
applied myself to determine these two distinct elements separately,
and to study apart the variation of each of them when the condi
tions of magnetization are changed. The following is the principle
of the method employed.
   It is easy to verify that the magnetic moments y of a series of
needles of different lengths w, magnetized under the same condi
tions, can be represented by a formula such as
                                       y=m(w—d),

     MAYER, CAPTAIN OF ARTILLERY.
   Of the two hypotheses from which the dynamical theory of gases
starts, the older gives the coefficient of friction of gases propor
tional to the square root, the newer (Maxwell's) gives it proportional
to the first power of the absolute temperature.      From the retarda
tions of vibrating disks by the friction of the air, Maxwell found
experimentally the power 1, O. E. Mayer the power #; by experi
ments on currents through capillary tubes O. E. Mayer found the
power #,      Puluj the power #, of the absolute temperature. ,
              J.
   For the more certain determination of the ratio, experiments on
currents through four capillaries of glass and one of brass were
undertaken; and together with the temperature of the room those
of boiling water, congealing paraffin, and a mixture of salt and snow
were employed. A first series of experiments, less accurate, were
carried out with the difference of pressure variable; a second, con
siderably more exact, with the difference constant.
   The results of the two series agree very well, and confirm those
of Mayer's experiments in a perfectly satisfactory manner. For
the coefficient of friction p at the temperature t there were found:—
     According to the first series, u =0.0001706 (1+0.002735t);

 XXXVIII.        On Spectra   of Gases.    By M. EUGEN GoldstEIN%.
   W ÜLLNER            has recently
            which he concludes
                                     published some experiments from
                                    that the appearance of different
  spectra of one and the same gas does not depend on the tem
 perature.
     It is known that the complete spectra of the gases have hitherto
 only been produced by means of electrical discharges; and we
 are accustomed to distinguish two different kinds of discharges,
 the continuous discharge and the disruptive discharge.
     Discharges which we call continuous show in a mirror rota
 ting about thirty times a second the image of a continuous field
 of light.     I will not decide whether this discharge is really con
 tinuous, or whether it consists of sparks following each other so
 rapidly that the rotating mirror cannot resolve them into sepa
 rate images, at least not with the velocities which we can conve
 niently give to the mirror. This latter opinion, which Professor
 Helmholtz considers to be the more probable one, is suggested
 by the fact that just those means by which we can shorten the
 time elapsing between the different discharges, lead at the end
 to the so-called continuous discharge.           The temperature is
 doubtless the greater the more electricity passes in a single dis
 charge.      It is therefore higher in discharges following each other
 slowly than in the continuous discharge.           The measurements
 made by Riess with the electrical thermometer agree with this.
    According to Wüllner, the two forms of spectra which are
 called by Plücker and Hittorf spectra of the first and second

order, or band- and line-spectra, are closely related to the modes
of discharge.   He believes he has established by a series of ex
periments “that the line-spectrum of a gas only appears in the
disruptive discharge, the band-spectrum only in the continuous
discharge through the gas.”     After these facts have been estab
lished, Wüllner tries to explain the spectra of different orders by
means of the different thicknesses of the luminous layer in the
two modes of discharge.     In the disruptive discharge (accord
ing to Wüllner) only a few molecules of the gas emit light; in
the continuous discharge, on the other hand, nearly the whole
 mass of the gas contained in the spectral tube is luminous.      If
 we accept the principles deduced by Zöllner, the gas-spectrum
can only consist of a few luminous lines in the first case, while
the thick layer of the continuous discharge will show light of
in all
    wave-lengths which the gas can emit            the temperature
   question.     shall now give the results

gate the question whether the discharges go through adjacent

the isochronism of the discharge in different parts of the same

336              M. E.  Goldstein on Spectra  of Gases.
    The discharge of    a Leyden  jar does not generally show any
stratifications,   even if the positive light without the jar shows
them.      If we introduce into a circuit containing a tube showing
stratified light a spark in atmospheric air, and look at the image
of the discharge in a rotating mirror, we shall see that the
image begins with a band which we cannot widen by increas
ing the number of rotations of the mirror; and this band is
not stratified.     If we do away with the spark, the image of
this band will again be stratified.
    If a Leyden jar is introduced into the circuit, the resist
ance of which is somewhat large, the dark space which is ge
nerally seen between the positive and negative light disap
pears, and the whole tube is filled with light of the colour of
the positive light.     Introducing a spark instead of the jar, we
observe light in the dark space, the intensity of which varies
with the strength of the spark.
    The images given by the rotating mirror are characteristic
in this case.      The blue light in the negative cylinder of a
spectral tube of the common form is widened into a field of
light, the intensity of which becomes so small, if the velocity of
rotation is sufficiently great, that the eye cannot distinguish it;
the dark space extends from the negative light to the capillary
part of the tube.      On the other hand, feeble light fills the posi
tive tube, which can be made to sink below the limit of visi
bility in the rotating mirror. We thus get a good image of
the discharge from the capillary part only, showing a long band,
the width of which is equal to its length.      The image just de
scribed corresponds to the continuous discharge.             When a
spark is introduced into the circuit, both cylinders are illumi
nated, and we see the complete image of the whole tube flashing
in.     The difference between a continuous and discontinuous
discharge is here seen in a striking way.         Spark and jar pro
duce here again the same effect.
   The discharge of a Leyden jar in thick sparks is affected in a
curious way by the magnet. The discharge shows every where
the colour of the positive light, and is torn into two parts which
run along opposite sides of the tube.        Each part, however, has
a different character   according  as it emanates from the positive
or negative end of the tube. An explanation of this fact by
means of oscillating discharges does not seem possible.
    The positive light of a continuous discharge, on the other
hand, is deflected as a continuous thread towards one side.        If
we introduce a spark in air sufficiently long, the discharge is
torn again into two parts, and the whole phenomenon is the
same as    if a Leyden jar were introduced.
    I think I   may consider it to have been proved by these and

               M. E. Goldstein   on Spectra  of Gases.             837
 similar observations    that the discharge is at the same time
 every where the same throughout the whole circuit, and that
 therefore it cannot be continuous in one part and discontinuous
 in another.
    I now turn to the spectra   we observe in these different kinds
 of discharges.
    I must first mention an     observation   regarding  a change    in
 the discharge without the aid of any of the means mentioned
above.
    The tube filled with carbonic oxide, which has already been
mentioned, showed in the beginning stratifications with a dark
 space and feeble light.       The discharge was widened into a
continuous band in the rotating mirror.
    The spectrum of carbonic oxide consists of a well-known
 group of bands. After a short time the phenomena character
istic of the continuous discharge disappeared, and the rotating
mirror showed distinct images of the tube indicating a disrup
tive discharge.     Nevertheless the spectrum consisted of the pre
viously mentioned bands without the addition of lines.
   Tubes filled with nitrogen show generally the band-spectrum.
When the discharge was made disruptive by means of the car
 bonic-oxide tube, the spectrum of nitrogen remained the same,
only showing a variation of intensity.
    A tube filled with nitrogen and another filled with hydrogen
 were introduced into the same circuit.       The spectrum of nitro
gen consisted of bands; the spectrum of hydrogen showed Ha,
HS, Hy.       If Wüllner's hypothesis were correct, such a result
would    be impossible; both tubes, according to Wüllner, should
give spectra of the same order.       The images of both tubes in
the  rotating  mirror consisted of a continuous field of light.
   If one of the electrodes of a vacuum-tube has only a small
surface, or if it is contained in a narrow tube, the spectrum may
be different, according to the direction of the current.        If the
large electrode is positive, the discharge consists of a greater or
smaller number of single sparks; if the current goes in the other
direction, the discharge is continuous.
   If we introduce such a tube into the circuit together with an
other tube, the discharge, as has been said, is continuous or dis
ruptive according to the direction of the current, yet the spec
trum of the other tube is unaltered.       It often happens that in
one and the same tube both      spectra  are seen at the same time,
the narrow    part of the tube showing  the line-spectrum, while the
wider parts of the tube show the band-spectrum; yet the dis
charge has every where the same character.
   If  the gas in a tube is exhausted to very small fractions of a
millimetre pressure, the discharge consists of a number of sparks

338                     M. E.           Goldstein      on Spectra      of Gases.
which the mirror cannot widen.      The spectrum, however, re
mains the same.     If under higher pressure it was a band-spec
trum, it will remain so.
   If the intensity of the current decreases, the continuous dis
charge often alternates with sparks—as, for instance, if the clo
sing of the inducing current happens to be bad or too short.
Artificial strengthening of the current does away with these
sparks; the introduction of moist resistances increases their
number. The spectra do not change if this takes place. Very
often these sparks pass at the beginning of the discharge, or
after having changed the direction of the current.     The band
spectrum of air, of carbonic oxide, &c. in         these cases                  all                        is

white and surrounded by an aureola, does not appear suddenly if
the pressure of the gas under low pressure is increased slowly. We
observe first a yellow spark, which is of the same thickness and
which can be seen isolated in narrow tubes. The rotating mir
ror shows that the discharge is discontinuous. The spectrum
consists of bands.    Its thickness is much less than that of strong
discharges of the Leyden jar which give line-spectra.
   In wide tubes we see discharges going out from the positive
electrode which are of a red colour.     They look like branches
of a tree, and appear to be about as thick as a thread. The spec
trum consists of bands.
     All thisshows that the supposition cannot be true which as
sumes that the band-spectrum is only given out by thick layers,
and that it is produced by a superposition of light of feeble                                 in
tensity and absorption in the gas itself.
   Wüllner's hypothesis on the production of band- and line
spectra cannot, therefore, be maintained.
   A few objections, and the proof that for some gases Wüllner's
propositions can à priori be shown to be untenable, must be de
ferred to another occasion.
   Wüllner assumes in nearly                 by

the band-spectrum        was seen.    As the distance increased, the
band-spectrum    became more feeble, and       last the line-spec

   As already mentioned, the spark discharge with line-spectrum
has sometimes      little reddish point, the spectrum

 344                 M. E. Goldstein           on Spectra        of Gases.
extends much further at temperatures not particularly high than
Wüllner indicates for the state of perfect formation of the con
tinuous spectrum.
   The first spectrum of hydrogen, according to Wüllner, ends
between H 8 and Hºy.              I
                           have seen it much further.    The strong
fluorescence of the  glass tubes which the    light causes ought to
have shown   long ago that the spectrum is much longer than has
been indicated hitherto. The dispersion of brightness in the
continuous ground of many line-spectra seems to me to corre
spond so much with the relative intensity of certain places in the
spectrum of the first order, that                  I
                                      tried to get at a continuous
spectrum directly from a band-spectrum by raising the tempera
                     I
ture. In this have succeeded very well with nitrogen; unfor
tunately at present there is no time for a closer investigation of
hydrogen in this regard.                I
                               do not attach particular importance
to a single experiment   which confirms my view.
   The  spectrum  of the second order is obtained with the lowest
 densities in which jar-discharges still go through a narrow tube
 filled with air; these densities are represented by fractions of a
 millimetre.
                  If, then, while constantly using jar-discharges one
 lets the   density  increase, the lines disappear and the band-spec
trum      appears.   If  the density still increases, then the brightness
of   the dimmer band-parts grows perceptibly faster than that                                  of
the stronger maxima; the proportion             brightness reaches unity

            former paperst it has been shown that if a, b, c, ... s, t, u
IN be the digits of a given number, and 8 be any integer less
than 10,  n being the number of digits in the same number, the
expression
  (10–8)"T'a-t- (10–8)"                                 “b-H        (10–8)"Tºc--... + (10–8)*s

has the same remainder to 8 as the given number has.
   By simple substitution of 8 in this expression, the remainder
to 8 may be found, two kinds of operation being necessary for
that purpose.  The first is the determination of the coefficients

upon themselves any symbol to show the number of times that
the operation is repeated to produce the result. This indication
might be useful in certain instances; and the results of it have
yet to be worked out.
   Comparing the two methods at present known by which the
remainders to a given divisor can be obtained, namely the opera
tion of division and that of unitation, it will easily be perceived
that obtaining remainders by division is an inverse process,
whereas unitation is a direct process.   Division has to be worked
out  by commencing   with the   highest  or left-hand figure, and
proceeding towards the smallest or right-hand figure. Unita
tion is begun at the right-hand figure and proceeds towards the
left-hand figure. In unitating to the base 10, for instance, the
unit figure is identical with the unitate; for        the powers                                    all                               of

350     Mr. W. H. Walenn      on the Unitates   of Powers and Roots.
    The double vertical lines in the above diagrams show the
 period of recurrence in the unitates of the positive powers of a
given number; this, in the function Uza", is 6 terms, in Ulya",
4 terms, and in Una", 10 terms. The Table in
 the margin gives the periods of recurrence for the
 values of 8 up to 10, P being the corresponding pe
 riod. In the above “unitation squares,” the series
 of unitates is continued towards the left hand to
 show the law of formation of Us a ", which in some
 cases is different from that of Usa”.         By means
of these unitation squares, the unitate of any power
of any number to the given base may be calcu                   1
lated by inspection, knowing the recurring figures
and the period of recurrence; for instance,
                         ––
         U,43*=U,74=7;            U,256*7=U,4}=2;
                    U             =U13–3–1.
                       1152176345
    Practically, there is not much difficulty in finding U, V/q
when it is finite or integral; for it may be ascertained from the
root itself (by extraction), or from looking out U, q in the table
of unitates belonging to the series Us a” and ascertaining the
corresponding     value of Usa.      It will, however, sometimes be
found that there are several values of Us a that will fulfil the
conditions; for instance, Us W729– USS/9; and, looking for
9 in the series 1, 8, 9, 1, 8, 9, 1, 8, 9, ...,  it is seen to belong to
3, 6, or 9*; a method of ascertaining the true unitate by means
of a unitation square will be given further on. It will be dis
covered upon examination that in unitates, as in some other nu
merical results, there may be m mth roots, n nth roots, and so on.
    Considering unitates as remainders, and inspecting the series
of unitates in unitation squares, it will be evident that the unitates
of some surd roots have finite and integral values. These values
may be determined in the same manner as the unitates of rational
roots; for instance, from the series Uga” (= 1,4,9,7,7,9,4, 1,9,...),
Uov/7=4 or 5. Further, it will be found, from these reasons,
that Us W/q (m and q being whole numbers, and V/q being irra
tional) is finite and integral when 8 is of the form n”—q; in
this case n is any whole number excepting unity, taking care to
choose n so large that the expression n”—q may not be negative.
    Unitation squares, formed in geometrical progression with
respect to exponents (in the horizontal series), may be used to
obtain the unitates of certain roots, the base of the system being
                      * Un  V729– Un V3=9.

The mean diameter of the open sectors of the disk equalled the
diameter of the mouth of the resonator, while the spaces of call
board between the open sectors was twice the width of these
openings.       Thus the resonator's mouth was exposed to the
vibrations during an interval which equalled that during which it
was screened from them.           A rubber tube led from the nipple of
the resonator to one       ear, while the other ear was tightly closed

tions of the residual sonorous sensations, making use, under my
directions, of the same apparatus which                I employed in my ori
ginal experiments.        Madame Seiler in former years worked much
with   Helmholtz,     assisting   him with her fine ear in experiments
 contained in his renowned work Die Lehre von den Tonempfin
 dungen. This lady unites to educated musical perceptions a
knowledge and appreciation of recent advances in physiological
acoustics; and hence        I  have great confidence in the determina
tions made    by   her. These results I give in the following Table,
which I desire to take the place of that published in my paper
of October 1874.
    Column S of this Table contains the simple sounds experi
mented on; they are designated in the notation stamped by
König on his forks. Column N gives the number of vibrations*
per second corresponding to the sounds of column S. In column
D are the corresponding durations of the residual sensations,
expressed in vulgar and in decimal fractions.                The reciprocal of
the number of beats       per   second   required   to   produce  a continuous
sensation by a given sound is taken as the duration of the resi
dual sensation of this soundt.           In column L are given the num
ber of wave-lengths contained in the separate impulses into
which the sound had been divided in order to produce the con
tinuous sensation.

    Although at first sight the apparatus which                I  have used in
this research     may  appear    coarse,   yet   experience   showed that the
accuracy of a determination depended more on the ear than on
   * I here, as always, refer to complete vibrations, i. e. to a motion to and
fro, or to what the late Professor De Morgan proposed to call a swing
swang.
   t That is to say, we take as the duration of the residual sensation
the interval during which the impress of a beat has not diminished suffici
ently in intensity to cause discontinuity in the sensation. To obtain the
duration of the entire sensation, we should have to know the intensity of
 the sensation at the end of the above interval, and the law giving the rate
of diminution of the sensation.

356               Prof. A. M. Mayer's        Researches   in Acoustics.
the mechanical appliances of our experiments; for the average
difference in the measures of the duration of any one residual
sensation did not exceed the rºbo of a second.    The perforated
disk made 33 revolutions to one of the driving-crank; and if the
disk has twelve perforations, then the above difference of a obo
of a second is given by the difference between two observations,
in one of which the driving-crank made 30 revolutions in ten
seconds, and in the other made 29 revolutions in the same time.
It is evident that the apparatus readily detects this difference,
                       I
especially as often ran it during thirty seconds to obtain the
number of beats striking the ear during one second.
    Before accepting as final the above determinations,       ascer            I
tained that great differences in the intensities of the pulses had
little effect on the number of beats required to produce a conti
nuous sensation. When a great increase in intensity was given
to the pulses, their number had to be slightly increased to pro
duce the same continuous sensation as that experienced with
feebler pulses; but the difference was barely measurable.       It is
also important to remark that, after the blending of the pulses
has been once attained, a further increase in the velocity of the
disk does not change the character of the sensation.        Extreme
velocities, of course, produce such violent agitations at the mouth
of the resonator as to render experimenting impossible.
     Ihave projected the above determinations into the accompa
nying curve (fig. 2), placing on the axis of abscissae the numbers
of vibrations of the various sounds, as designated at the base of
the figure, and on the ordinates the corresponding durations of
their residual sensations. Thus has been obtained the full-lined
curve of the figure.  The dotted curve is an equilateral hyperbola,
and  expresses  an assumed law—that the durations of the resi
dual sensations are inversely as the numbers of vibrations pro
ducing them.      In drawing the latter curve,                   I
                                                     took the point
corresponding to the ordinate of Uts as the basis of the assump
tion.
  From the discussion of the curve of the experiments, we find
that the law connecting the pitch of a sound with the duration
of       its   residual sensation may    be   expressed thus,

 experience a simple sonorous sensation when a tuning-fork is
 brought near the mouth of the resonator.        On revolving the
 perforated disk, two additional or secondary sounds appear—one
 slightly above, the other slightly below the pitch of the fork.
An increasing velocity of rotation causes the two secondary
 sounds to diverge yet further from the note of the beating fork,
until, on reaching a certain velocity, the two secondary sounds
 become separated from each other            §

 same moment a resultant sound      appears, formed by the union
of the sound of the fork with the upper and lower of the secon
 dary sounds.     This resultant is the lower second octave of the
 note  given  by the fork. On further increasing the velocity of
 rotation of the disk, the two secondary sounds and the resultant
 disappear, and the ear experiences only the sensation of the
simple sound produced by the fork, whose beats at this stage of
the experiment have blended into a smooth continuous sensa
tion. These successive and gradual changes, as they happen
with an Ut, fork, we have indicated in steps of semitones in the
jº-H
appended musical notation. The sound of the fork is given in
the semibreve, while the crotchets represent the secondary
sounds and the resultant sound.       In the fourth bar the upper
note  pH   proceeds to :D in the fifth bar. This is so because in
the natural scale :D is higher than be.

cing the maximum dissonances a constant fraction of the num
bers of beats which give continuous sensations.      Thus I find
that <U+017F>o of the latter numbers give me the most  disagreeable sen
sations; another observer has placed the fraction as high as tºo.
I imagine that we do not greatly depart from an average judg
ment in stating that about 1% of the number of beats, through
out the musical scale, which produce continuous sensations, cor
respond to the numbers of beats giving the greatest dissonant
effects. Thus we can go from the law connecting the pitch of a
sound with the duration of its residual sonorous sensation to the
law giving the numbers of beats throughout the musical scale
which produce the most dissonant sensations.

 or quickly enough, to prevent two sounds from succeeding each
 other so rapidly without blending.
    “This fact proves, besides, that there should be in the ear dif
ferent parts which are set in vibration by sounds of different height,
 and which give the sensations of these sounds.  Some may imagine
 that the mass of the vibratile elements of the ear, comprising the
 tympanic membrane, the ossicles, and the liquid of the internal
ear, can vibrate, and that it is on this property of this mass that
depends the impossibility of sonorous vibrations ceasing with
the same rapidity in the ear. But this hypothesis does not suf
fice to explain the known facts.
    “When, in fact, an elastic body enters into vibration under
the influence of an exterior sound, it takes the number of vibra
tions of the latter; but as soon as the exciting sound ceases, it
vibrates with the number of vibrations which belongs to it when
vibrating freely.    This fact, which is a consequence of theory,
can be   very neatly proved for tuning-forks by means of the vibra
tion-microscope.
   “Therefore, if the ear vibrate as an entire system,"and is
capable  of prolonging notably                                   of its
                                       vibrations, this prolongation

40,000 vibrations per second we have a residual sensation en
during only ++s of a second. If we apply the law to vibra
tions below forty per second, when they do not produce a con
tinuous sound, but explosive sensations in the ear, we reach a
remarkable result.    Thus the residual sensation corresponding
to thirty vibrations per second should remain in the ear is of
a second after the vibrations outside the ear have ceased;                                                     then

nerve-terminations? The more we study the minute structure
of the retinal rods and cones, the further appears to remove an
understanding of the mode of operation of the sensory apparatus
of the eye. May not research in this direction be guided by the
hypothesis that the molecular constitution of the retinal rods
and cones is such that their molecules are severally tuned to the
vibrations corresponding to the colours red, green, and violet f
This would lead us to look for effects of actinism on the retina
as showing the link existing between the transmitting and sen
sory functions of the eye.   Do not the facts of the known per
sistence of chemical action, after it has been once initiated, and
the time which would be required for the retinal molecules to
recombine, or rearrange themselves, after the aetherial vibrations
had ceased, comport with the known durations of the residual
visual sensations, and with the main facts of physiological
optics, better than the hypothesis that masses of the retinal
elements are set in vibration rather than their molecules?
5. Quantitative Applications of the Laws to the fundamental facts
                         of Musical Harmony.
   To show the full value of these laws in introducing quanti
tative precision in the explanations        of consonance and dis
sonance would     require an extended   space;  we here present only
such  application   as will serve to show their importance  in giving
clear and  simple   guides in reasonings in the  physiological theory
of musical   harmony.
   We have seen that 26 beats of the simple sound C, of 64
vibrations per second, give a continuous sensation; therefore, to
determine the nearest consonant interval of this note, we have to
obtain a sound which will make with C, the vibration-ratio of
64: 64+26. This would show that the nearest consonant                                 in
terval of C1, on the natural scale, is      fourth plus  its    semi       3   ofa
tone.        The duration       of

XLI.        On Extraordinary Reflection.   By ARTHUR HILL CURTIs,

IN Ino elementary treatise on Experimental Physics with which
         acquainted is any reference made to extraordinary Re

flection; and            I
                      have known several instances where, from this
omission, students have been led, though somewhat illogically,
to the inference that in crystals producing double Refraction
the ordinary law of Reflection is satisfied.         On the other hand,
in memoirs on molecular mechanics attention has frequently
been drawn to the fact that the construction of Huyghens is as
applicable to reflection as to refraction.          Professor Haughton
draws attention to this fact in his memoir on the equilibrium
and motion of solid and fluid bodies (Trans. of the Royal Irish
Academy, vol. xxi. part 2). Mr. Stoney has applied Huyghens's
construction to the doubly reflected rays producing rings in
 striated calc-spar (Trans. R. I. A. vol. xxiv.); and Professor
 MacCullagh has, in the case of light, by the aid of his theorem
of the polar plane, determined, on his theory, the intensities of
the two reflected rays (Trans. R. I. A. vol. xviii. part            Still,                       1).            in

refracted wave-plane within the crystal, viz. when the plane of
incidence contains the optic axis or axes, and the wave-normal
corresponding to the two coincident refractedwave-planescoincides
with an optic axis. If the cap of the tube A be replaced by a Nicol's
prism with a small orifice, the images may be four, three, two, or
one as the stage B is rotated (the last corresponding to the same
arrangement as that which gives two images in the previous
case) when in addition the Nicol's prism is so adjusted as to
polarize the incident light in such an azimuth as to cause the
intensity of one of the reflected vibrations to vanish.  The planes
of  polarization of the several refracted   rays may  be determined
by examining them by means of a Nicol's prism introduced into
the tube E. If the tubes A and E be made of the same dia
meter, one Nicol's prism will be sufficient for                            all   purposes.

added to the circuit in order to get a second reading of the
galvanometer; then the pulley P' is adjusted so that the cord
passing over it may indicate upon the quadrant B the galvano
meter-deflection obtained after introducing the resistance cor
responding to A A'; and lastly the vertical scale is moved so
that a vertical line drawn through the centre of the division
marks and continued downwards to meet the horizontal scale at
O may be exactly behind the point Q, where the cords       A P and
A'P'  cross each other.   We have then only to read off the hori
zontal and vertical distances, AO and O Q, to get the perma
ment resistance and electromotive force of the circuit*.  To adapt
the apparatus  to use with a sine-galvanometer,   it would be only
necessary to replace the vertical scale O Q by a quadrant
marked with concentric circular arcs, each differing from the next
by  1 millim. in radius.

 Flow of Electricity in a uniform plane conducting Surface.                                                   385
   Integrating (a) with respect to t, we get, as before, the equation
of vis viva; this mode of deriving which enables us to see the
error committed in supposing that, when the equation is formed
for a continuous mass, the equal and opposite forces acting at
the common boundary of two elements will be multiplied by the
same velocity, viz. that of the bounding surface.
   It is clear that we must treat the motion of each element ex

experimentally  the theoretical conclusions, together with some
results obtained by these methods.
   The general subject treated of in this paper has attracted the
attention of a considerable number of mathematicians and phy
sicists.  The earliest published investigation relating to it was
contained in a remarkable memoir by Kirchhoff, which appeared
in Poggendorff’s Annalen in 1845 (vol. lxiv. p. 497).      In this
paper Kirchhoff established the general mathematical theory of
the flow of electricity in an unlimited uniformly conducting
sheet, and in a limited sheet with a circular boundary, with so
much completeness as to leave little for others to do beyond
working out the application to special cases of the general prin
ciples he laid down, or finding other methods of establishing the
conclusions he deduced from them.
    We cannot better indicate the general plan of Kirchhoff's                                          in
vestigation than by quoting the following account of it from a
paper by Professor W. Robertson Smith", to which we shall
have to make further reference immediately:-" By an applica
tion of Ohm’s law, he [Kirchhoff] expressed analytically the
condition to be satisfied by v [the potential].    When the elec
tricity enters and issues by a number of individual points, he
found (apparently by trial) that an integral of the form X (a log                                          r),

For this purpose the most convenient rule to adopt in relation
to the lines of flow, is to place them so that the total flow of
electricity between each pair of consecutive lines is the same—
and with regard to the equipotential lines, to place them so that
the change of potential in passing from any one to the next con
secutive line is the same.   In the sequel, whenever a system of
lines of flow, or of equipotential lines, is referred                                          to,

 wards from A and inwards towards B.       These two systems of
 lines subdivide the whole surface of the conducting sheet into
 quadrilaterals, such as PQ and Q R. The actual direction of
 the flow at any point P, due to the combined action of the source
 and sink, will evidently be intermediate between the directions
 of the primary streams A P and P B through the same point;
similarly the direction of the resultant current at Q will be                                                                 in
termediate between the direction of the primary streams A Q
and Q B; in other words, the line of resultant flow through P
 will enter the quadrilateral PQ at P, and the line of resultant
flow through Q will pass at Q from the quadrilateral PQ into
the quadrilateral Q R. And it can be shown that the points P,
Q, and R are points on the same line of flow—that          that                                        is,                     a

Q, R, or R. R, and since these quantities are equal to each
other, it follows that the lines PQ R, PQR, and P, Q, R, are
 consecutive flow-lines of a system which divides the conducting
 sheet into portions each of which conveys an equal current.
     It is important to observe that the reasoning employed here
 is general, and not limited to the special case to which it has been
applied.      The general conclusion to which it leads may be thus
 stated:—If similar * systems of lines of flow be drawn, corre
 sponding to each of two separate systems of sources and sinks,
 the lines of flow which would result from the combined action
 of the sources and sinks of both systems will be obtained by
 drawing curves through the alternate angles of the quadrilaterals
 produced by the intersections of the two primary systems of
flow-lines, in directions concurrent with both the primary flow
 lines that intersect each other at each angle.
     11. The method which, as we have seen, allows the flow-lines
 for two equal opposite poles to be drawn, also enables us to
 deduce very easily their general form.         Let a be the constant
angle between consecutive flow-lines of the pencil diverging
 from A and of that converging to B.           Then, evidently, -          º
           ZA PB =ZA        Q B-4A      R B = . . . =na,
 where n is a constant integer.       Also
                      ZAP'B=4A         Q. B= . .     . = (n+1)2,
 and
                      ZAP, B=4A       Q,  B=    . . .  = (n-1)a.
     Hence the lines of flow due to one source and one sink of equal
 strength are arcs of circles passing through the poles, each one dif
 fering from the next by a constant change (=a) in the angle which
the radii vectores from the poles make with each other; or, what
comes to the same thing, they are arcs of circles cutting each
other at the poles with a constant difference of angle equal to
the constant difference of angle (=a) between the rectilinear
flow-lines which either the source or the sink would          produce by
                                                           -
itself.
     12. The whole number of flow-lines is therefore           º, or     the
same as the number of lines leaving the source or entering the
sink when either of them is by itself in the sheet. This is evi
dent also if we consider that infinitely near to either pole the
effect of the other vanishes in comparison, and therefore the
    * By similar systems is here to be understood systems such that the
total flow between any pair of consecutive lines of the one set is the same
as that between any two consecutive lines of the other set.

source and one equal sink having been determined, the form of
the equipotential lines is at once given by the consideration that
the two sets of lines cut each other orthogonally (§ 2); and it is
a well-known geometrical result that the system of lines ortho
gonal to the system of circles which, as has been seen, represents
the flow-lines for this case, is another system of circles having
their centres on the line through the poles, each circle cutting
this line once internally and once externally in points situated
harmonically with respect to          extremities.          its

have recourse to a process of superposition of the same kind as
that employed (§ 10) for placing the lines of flow.
   We have seen (§ 5) that the equipotential lines for a single
pole are concentric circles, and that the radii of consecutive
circles form a geometrical progression.     To find the system of
equipotential lines for two equal opposite poles, it is only needful
to draw for each pole separately a system of equipotential lines
with the same difference of potential between any one line and
the next as it is intended that there should be between the lines
of the combined system, and then to draw lines through the
intersections of the two overlapping systems of circles thus ob
tained, taking care, in going from one intersection to the next,
that the changes of potential are in opposite directions for the
two primary systems taken separately.          Thus,      the lines                         let                      to 1,

ble under certain conditions.      Thus only can we learn how hope
less it would be to   attempt   to treat nature in detail, and exhaust
the whole number of events that might arise” (vol. i. p. 216). Yet
this is not an adequate statement of the aim of Book II. ; and the
same would be found true of similar statements made in regard to
the other books.     Of course, in the case of any elaborate treatise
the same may to some extent be true; but in the work before us
the difficulty assumes unusually large dimensions, and renders the
task of the reviewer peculiarly hard.

   ductive reasoning can we add a tittle to our implicit knowledge,
   which is like that contained in an unread book or a sealed letter.
   Sir W. Hamilton has well said, ‘Reasoning is the showing out
  explicitly that a proposition not granted or supposed is implicitly
  contained in something different which is granted or supposed.’”
  So far as the words “nor inductive" are concerned our author
  would, we suppose, stand nearly alone in his opinion. It is gene
  rally held that induction, or inductive inference, is a process that
  puts us in possession of something new ; but when himited to
  deductive reasoning, the opinion expressed in the above sentence is
  very commonly held, though there are some who regard it as fun
  damentally erroneous.       Suppose we took a full-grown man with
  perfect powers of reasoning, but wholly ignorant of geometry,
  there would be no difficulty in giving him a perfect knowledge of
  the definitions and axioms of the science.        But when he came to
  prove the propositions of the first book (say the 47th) that would
  be quite another question, his success or failure would depend on
  his powers of invention.       No working of the keys of any logical
  machine would put him up to the essential steps “through A
  draw   AL   parallel to BD or CE, and join A D, CF.” It cer
 tainly seems to us that considerations of this kind land us on this
  conclusion:—Either the first book of Euclid is not a specimen of
  deductive reasoning, or else the account commonly given of deduc
 tive reasoning is somehow or other erroneous.         If we may venture
 on a surmise, we should say that the passage above quoted is
 couched in metaphorical language, and that the words “explicit”
 and “implicit" are used equivocally.          To explicate is to unfold.
 We unfold a table-cloth when we put it on the table, we explicate
 the definition of a circle when we draw a learner's attention to all
 the points involved—that it must be a plane figure, bounded by one
line, &c. But, except by an improper use of language, we do not
 speak of an oak tree as being unfolded from an acorn; the oak tree
is indeed derived from the acorn, but only by the continual assimi
 lation of new matter.      It is only in this latter sense, at least as it
seems to us, that the first book of Euclid can be said to be un
folded from the definitions and axioms,
    We have gone rather beyond our intention in the last paragraph,
and will not venture further into the region of doubt and debate.
We will therefore only add that, whether the student ends by
adopting Mr. Jevons's logical views or not, he will not fail to learn
a great deal from an attentive perusal of this very able and com
prehensive work.

Introduction to Experimental Physics, Theoretical and Practical,
   including directions for constructing Physical Apparatus and for
   making experiments.      By ADoLPH. F. WEINHoLD, Professor in
   the  Royal Technical School at Chemnitz. Translated and edited,

  This is an elementary treatise on Experimental                  Physics which
differs   materially      from those       ordinarily   used in our Schools
and Universities.          The object of the writer has been to pre
sent the general facts of elementary physics as plainly as pos
sible, always in a concrete form, to keep abstractions as much as
possible in the background, and to give instructions with such
detail and minuteness as will enable the reader who is provided
with simple tools and materials and endowed with a proper amount
of patience, to make                all

periments are described which prove that the velocity attained
when a particular force is acting is directly proportional to the
time from the beginning of motion, that for a given mass moved
the accelerations are as the forces which produce them, that for
a given acceleration the spaces described are as the squares of
the times, &c. The student finds that in 2, 3, 4 seconds the
spaces are 4, 9, 16 times respectively the space described in the
first second. But he is not invited to go beyond these particular
cases, nor to find a general expression which shall apply to all his
experiments.     The formulae s–3 gt”, v=gt, &c., find no place in
this book.    Now,   much as these and similar formulae are abused
by candidates for examinations, who learn them by heart and

without having any notion of their                 meaning, we do not
think   they should have been excluded from a work on elementary
 mechanics.
    The principles of fluid-pressure are discussed and exemplified at
great length; atmospheric pressure also and the barometer receive
a good deal of attention: perhaps, however, a fuller description of
the Aneroid Barometer might have been given with advantage.           It
is an instrument of such common use, that a brief account of the
mechanism by which the motion of the lid of the box is transmitted
to the index, and the mode of graduating- the dial-face, would have
been desirable.
    The few pages devoted to the phenomena of air-suction, lateral
pressure, Clement's disk and the spray-disperser are very lucid,
leaving nothing to be desired in the way of explanation.            The
author's explanation of the phenomenon of the Clement's disk we
will give nearly in his own words:–                -
    “The effect of suction produced by a current of air is rendered
especially obvious if the current is allowed to expand between two
flat disks. A circular disk of cardboard 10 centims. in diameter
has a hole in the middle.     A glass tube about 8 millims. wide, bent
at  right angles, is passed through a cork which is glued upon the
disk so that the bore of the tube is exactly over the hole in the
disk.    A second disk of stout paper or thin cardboard is suspended
to the other by three threads; the distance between the disks
should be 10 millims.      If air is strongly blown through the tube
it will expand   between the plates in a radiating manner, and the
particles of air will tend to move with the same velocity.        But if
the particles of air are to maintain the same velocity, then the
same quantity of air which at any instant fills the space within
the circle of 1 centim. radius will in the next instant have to
fill the space within the ring of 2 centims. radius, in the next
that within the ring of 3 centims. radius, and so on. If the par
ticles of air are to maintain their original velocity, it is necessary
that the quantity of air which at a certain time fills the inner circle
of 1 x 3: 14 square centims. area, should fill at the following instant,
the ring of(2°–1) x 3:14–3 x3-14, at the next instant the ring
of (3°–2*) ×3:14–5x3-14 centims. area, and so on;–that     the    is,

   The pages which treat of the magnetization of a rod of soft iron
by a galvanic current and the attendant phenomena are well
worth studying.       The author explains clearly by a number of
capital illustrations the Ampèrian theory of magnetism and the
properties of solenoids.       The applications of electromagnetism
in telegraphy (Morse's Telegraph) and in the electric bell are well
described. Considering, however, how much is omitted, nine pages
are rather too many to devote to the electric bell alone.
   In concluding this notice we may state our opinion that Wein
hold's Introduction to Elementary Physics will prove of very
great service to those who have to teach the elementary principles
of Mechanics and Physics in schools, or otherwise, and are com—
pelled by reasons of economy to construct their own apparatus;
to these it will have the additional recommendation that the dia
grams and pictures of apparatus are           drawn             all

Mr. J. Prestwich on the                   Phenomena of the Quaternary Period.                 409
   The author next proceeded to notice the raised beach at the Bill
of Portland, in which      he had, with the assistance of Mr. Jeffreys,
determined 26 species of shells, two of them not now living in the
British Channel, and one new. This beach contains pebbles of the
Devonshire and Cornwall rocks.
    The raised beach Mr. Prestwich found to abut against an old cliff
that had been swamped at a later geological period by a land-wash,
which had levelled it and the old sea-land with the adjacent land
surface. The mass which had thus swamped the cliff and buried
the beach consisted of loam and angular débris, the latter being in
larger proportion at top. In the loam he found several species of
land and freshwater shells and fragments of bones.                The angular
débris consisted of    pieces  of the local   rocks, together  with a number
of specimens which by their organic remains were shown to belong
to the Middle Purbecks, a part of the series not now existing in
Portland.      A similar bed, but much thicker, was then described at
Chesilton, in the north of the island.         It is there 60 feet thick, and
contains large blocks of Portland stone and Portland chert, the
greater number of which are in the upper part of the deposit, which
is here on the sea-level, and 400 feet lower than the Portland
 escarpment which rises above            This loam and angular débris the

colour in the upper, and of an olive-green to bluish-grey colour in
the lower parts of the excavations.        Interspersed in the mass are
fragments of more or less altered shale, and a micaceous-looking
mineral of the vermiculite group, which sometimes becomes an                     im
portant constituent of the rock, which also contains bright green
crystals of a ferruginous enstatite (bronzite), and sometimes a horn
blendic mineral closely resembling smaragdite. A pale buff bron
zite occurs in larger fragments than the green form of the mineral;
 and in the rock of Du Toit's pan an altered diallage is present.
 Opaline silica, in the form of hyalite or of hornstone, is disseminated
 through the greater part of the rock-masses; and they are every
 where penetrated by calcite.
    The analyses of the component minerals (given in detail in the
 paper) show that this once igneous rock is a bronzite rock converted
 into a hydrated magnesium silicate, having the chemical characters
 of a hydrated bronzite, except where the remains of crystals have
 resisted metamorphism.      Except in the absence of olivine and the
 small amount of    augitic mineral,   it might be compared with the
 well-known Lherzolite rock.
    The diamonds are said to occur most plentifully, or almost exclu
 sively, in the neighbourhood of dykes of diorite which intersect the
 hydrated rock, or occur between it and the horizontal strata through
 which the igneous rocks have been projected. The authors compare
 the characters of the diamonds found in different positions, and
 come to the conclusion that their source is not very remote from
 that in which they are now found.
    The mineral above-mentioned as resembling vermiculite is de
 scribed by the authors as a new species under the name of Waalite.

      GENTLEMEN,
I* WISH to point out a slight error in a communication from Mr.
      J.R. Capron on the Spectrum of the Aurora, which appears in
the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine. Mr. Capron writes
as follows:—
     “From Dr. Watts's ‘Index of Spectra'                 I
                                               have extracted the
three principal carbon-tube bands or lines; and they compare with
Dr. Vogel's oxygen-tube as under:--
                                                        Yellow.      Green.     Blue.

     “The 5622 for the yellow line of the tube must                    be an error.
5608 seems to me, from my own observations, nearer                    its   place; and
I calculate 5193 and 4825 for the other lines.”

  The number 5622 Mr. Capron has taken by mistake from the
wrong series of numbers—from spectrum No. L. instead of from
spectrum No. II. The other two numbers, 51.89 and 4829,          am                                          I

actually given for the three lines of the tube-spectrum are as fol

 EXPERIMENTS                 WITH THE HOLTZ MACHINE.                                 BY     F.   Ross ETTI       k.

    The ratio between the work expended and the intensity of the
 current diminishes when the humidity augments—in such a manner
 that, to obtain a current of given intensity, a greater velocity of
 rotation is requisite in wet than in dry weather, but a less expen
 diture of work. The Holtz machine is therefore more economical in
 wet weather than in dry.
    The distance between the two disks of the machine has also some
 influence on the intensity of the current: the less the distance the
 stronger the current, and the greater the amount of the work.
    The Holtz machine, like the voltaic couples, possesses electro
 motive force and internal resistance.     The electromotive force is
 independent of the velocity of rotation; but it diminishes as the
 degree of humidity increases.     The effective motor weight (differ
 ence between the weights necessary to turn the machine charged
 and not charged) is proportional to the electromotive force produced.
 This is very great in comparison with the electromotive forces of
 the most energetic voltaic couples; in fact it has been found to
 amount to 433000 Siemens units with a relative humidity equal to
 0.69, to 599000 with the humidity 0.35—the Daniell couple giving
 E = 11:57, and that of Grove E = 1998. The electromotive force
of the Holtz machine is therefore about 50000 times as great as that
of the Daniell couple, and 30000 times as great as that of the
 Grove couple.
    The internal resistance of the Holtz machine is independent of the
hygrometric state, but varies with the rotation-velocity, diminishing
more rapidly than the velocity increases.        It is very great: the
lowest resistance (which corresponds to the greatest velocity attain
able, or 8 turns per second) is equal to 570 million Siemens units;
for a velocity of 2 turns per second it is 2810 millions of the same
units.
    Under these conditions a resistance inserted in the outer circuit
must be very considerable in order to exert any sensible influence
on the intensity of the current.     It was because the resistance em
ployed by Poggendorff was too feeble that he could not verify an
effect of this kind.     M. Rossetti, on the contrary, by interposing
in the circuit a column of distilled water of greater or less length,
has ascertained that the current of the Holtz machine is susceptible
of being very notably weakened by augmentation of the external
resistance, following Ohm's law in this equally well with the ordi
nary galvanic currents.
    The author has deduced from his experiments a measure of the
mechanical equivalent of heat, by comparing the serviceable work
expended for the production of the electricity with the total heat
which could be developed by the current obtained.        He found for
that equivalent the number 428.-Bibliothèque Universelle, Archives

on THE    solution of               HYDROGEN IN METALs, AND THE DECOM
    POSITION       OF WATER           BY IRON.  BY M.M. L. TROOST AND P.
    HAUTEFEUILLE.
    In  previous researches on the alloys formed by hydrogen”, we
have   pointed   out the characters by which these definite combina
tions   may   be distinguished from the solutions of hydrogen in the
metals. We have seen that besides potassium, sodium, and palla
dium, which can combine with hydrogen, there are other metals
which simply dissolve this gas. The number of those which pos
sess this last property appears to be considerable.
   We shall see that iron, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are
united by the analogy of their chemical properties into a natural
group, present great similarities in their behaviour in the presence
of hydrogen at various temperatures. As the facility with which
they absorb or give out hydrogen depends largely on their physical
state, it is necessary, in order to account for the differences observed,
to investigate these metals successively in ingots, in thin plates, and
in the pulverulent condition.
   I. Nickel.—An ingot of pure nickel, cast in lime, was submitted
for twenty-four hours, at a red heat, to the action of a current of
hydrogen gas, and then cooled slowly in the gas. The volume of
hydrogen extracted from it at a red heat in vacuo was one fifth of
the volume of the metal.
   Some laminae of nickel, obtained by decomposing with the pile
the double sulphate of nickel and ammonia, were heated in a va
cuum to 200° C.; they gave out forty times their volume of hydro
gent. On afterwards being heated to near 200° in a current of
hydrogen and slowly cooled in this gas, they absorbed sixteen times
their volume of         it,
                        which they gave up                   200°. The same

 of a current of hydrogen, it reabsorbs a volume sensibly equal to

 the hydrogen is expelled.
     II. Cobalt.—An ingot, cast in lime, of pure cobalt was submitted
 to a red heat for twenty-four hours in a current of hydrogen, and
 then cooled slowly in that gas. The volume of hydrogen extracted

     Laminae of cobalt, obtained by galvanic decomposition of the
  double sulphate of cobalt and ammonia, were heated in vacuo to 200°.
 They gave up thirty-five times their volume of hydrogen".               Heated
 subsequently in a current of hydrogen to about 200°, and again
 cooled slowly in the same gas, they absorbed twenty-four times their

XLVIII.      On the Electric Conducting-power of the Chlorides of
   the Alkalies, Alkaline Earths, and Nitric Acid in Aqueous
   Solutions.     By F. Koh LBAUsch and O. GROTRIAN +.
Thisexperimental
            memoir is to form the commencement of a systematic
                       investigation of the work of the current in
the interior of electrolytes.    In order to arrive at laws in this
obscure department, the first requisite is a detailed inquiry into
the facts.    For the materials we possess are very imperfect, and
for the most part inexact; and the measurements, with few ex
ceptions, have not been referred to a sufficiently defined unit; so
that up to the present only a slender basis is afforded for more
general points of view.      Thus much, however, is already known,
that the relations are by no means simple; and accordingly, in
order to analyze them, it will be advisable to commence with
simple chemical combinations and examine these in groups.
    On this account we have operated first upon the chlorides of
the alkalies and alkaline earths.     The observations refer to thirty
five different solutions of them, and show the dependence of the
conducting-power on the amount of salt contained, and on the
temperature from 0° to 40°C.          Chloride of lithium is the only
one that was examined merely in very dilute solutions.
    Of the acids, we have previously experimented on sulphuric
and hydrochlorict.       We now add nitric acid, about the electri

   The dependence of the conducting-power of the chlorides on the
temperature shows, according to the above, great simplicity in
many respects.     The universally small amount of the coefficient
A  proves  that, with          all

   nearly equal proportion with the temperature; the positive sign

424 Electric Conducting-power of the Chlorides of the Alkalies, &c.
now defined.         At  the same time   it is immaterial for a whether
the solution be reckoned in parts by weight (as is done here), or
  (as is more rational according to the definition of the conduct
 ing-power) by volume, since for dilute solutions the volume is
 equivalent to the weight.         Also the quantity b, which denotes
 the initial deviation from proportionality, has a definite        signifi
 cation for each salt.
      Only the results for 18° shall here be given, as their form      for
 the other temperatures is very similar. They are:—

       According to this, the total character of each curve already
   shows itself while the content is yet very small: those substances
   which have a maximum of k at a definite degree of concentration,
   are distinguished by a relatively high value of b. (It may there
   fore be conjectured that LiCl also will show a maximum.)
       If now we seek to connect the specific conducting-power a
   with other physical properties of the substances dissolved, we
   readily perceive that for the chlorides the quantities a stand
   nearly in the inverse order in a series to that of the equivalent
   weights A of the anhydrous salts—indeed so that, with equal
   amounts of chlorine in solution, the conducting-power of dilute
   solutions is not very different.      Still the deviations of the pro
   ducts A. e from their mean amount to as much as 22 per cent.
    (Wide infra.)
       On the other hand, another accordance of an arrangement is
    self-evident—namely, according to the specific gravities s of the
    anhydrous salts.        The products s. a are, for the chlorides of the
    alkalies and alkaline earths, constant quantities, the greatest devia
    tion from the mean being 12 per cent. Although this deviation
    is not inconsiderable, yet so simple a relation is deserving of
    notice.    If it were rigorously exact, it would signify that equal
    volumes   of anhydrous salts in solutions imply equal conducting
   powers.
        In the following Table the salts are placed in the order of
    their conducting-powers a, and together with their equivalent
    weights A and specific gravities s.       For the latter I am indebted

426            Dr.    J.   H. Gladstone and Mr. A. Tribe on                      the
ments, employing chloride of copper, and observed some facts
which seemed to have an interest from their bearing on the
causation of galvanic action.
  It is known that if metallic copper be placed in a solution of
cupric chloride, it will slowly become covered with a crystalline
deposit of the insoluble cuprous chloride:–
                                 Cu + CuCl2=2CuCl.
   We found that when metallic copper and platinum are con
nected by a wire and immersed in cupric chloride, the insoluble
salt forms not only upon the copper, but also on the platinum
plate, as a white crystalline body.  This deposit may generally
be observed in about two minutes when the plates are three
quarters of an inch apart.    The formation of cuprous chloride
upon the platinum plate takes place about equally rapidly in
solutions containing 2-5 or 10 per cent. of salt. With a 20 per
cent. solution the deposit was smaller, and with 40 per cent.
practically nil, although there was abundant formation of cu
prous chloride upon the copper plate.
    We satisfied ourselves that the action took place equally well
in solutions from which oxygen had been rigidly excluded, and
also that a current passed from the copper to the platinum
through the liquid—that                   is,
                                  from the metal        higher        of
                                                                     that              to   of

through the cork to a plate of platinum which hung in the solu

mercuric chloride   upon the mercury, the metallic surface was at
once dimmed by a film of mercurous chloride, which increased in
quantity; and in the course of an hour or two the insoluble chlo
ride appeared also on the platinum plate, and in twenty-four

Experiments               on the Reflection     of Sound from Flames and Heated
                                               Gases.
Th;Tyndallreading of the recent interesting research of Professor
                 on “Experimental Demonstrations of the Stopp
age of Sound by partial Reflections in a non-homogeneous
Atmosphere” (Proc. Roy. Soc. Jan. 1874; “Nature,’ Jan. 29,
Feb. 5), and of the subsequent paper by Mr. Cottrell “On the
Division of a Sound-Wave by a Layer of Flame or heated Gas
into a reflected and a transmitted Wave” (Proc. Roy. Soe. Feb.
12, 1874), caused me to turn my attention to the experimental
illustration of the reflection of sonorous vibrations from flames,
heated gases, and from sheets of cold gases and vapours.
   The following experiments are of easy execution, and show
in a marked manner the reflecting-powers of sheets of flame
                                                         -
and heated gas, and even
serve to give approximate
measures of these reflecting
powers.
  Take two similar resona
tors and place the planes of
their mouths at a right
angle; then in this angle
firmly           fix
            the fork corre
sponding      the resonators,
                     to

           that the broad face   one
           itsprongs faces the mouth
            one resonator, while the
space between the prongs
faces the mouth of the other
resonator.  (See the figure.)
By trial the two planes                   of
the fork are placed              at
                        such distances                     from the resonators   that

complete interference of the vibrations issuing from their mouths
is obtained, and the only sound that reaches the ear is the
faint sound given by the fork’s action on the air outside the
angle included by the mouths of the resonators.           in these         If
circumstances we close the mouth of either resonator with a
piece of cardboard, the open resonator will strongly reinforce the
sound of the fork.   If we now also cover the mouth of the latter
resonator with a piece of cardboard we shall again have silence.
Also, if we substitute, for one of the pieces of cardboard, a slip
of stout glazed note-paper, the same result is obtained.       But
if we replace the piece of note-paper by a similar piece of French
tracing-paper, a faint sound issues from the resonator so covered,
because the tracing-paper is sufficiently permeable to sonorous
vibrations to permit the resonator to slightly reinforce the sound
of the fork. This reinforcement becomes greater if we sub
stitute for the tracing-paper a piece of tissue paper, such as is
used in printed books to cover steel engravings; and a yet
greater reinforcement is produced when we put in the place of
the tissue paper a piece of the soft, loosely woven paper which
is used by French instrument-makers for the inner wrapping of
their packed wares.          I
                          thus obtained a graded series of sub
stances, more and more permeable to sonorous vibrations.
  I   again obtained neutralization    by interference, with the
mouths of the resonators   open, and then screened the mouth of
one of them with a bat's-wing coal-gas flame.       The vibrations
issuing from the resonators were now no longer neutralized, but
the vibrations from the uncovered resonator had a great ascen
dancy over the other, so that a strong sound issued from                               it.   I
now tried     destroy this superiority
              to                             screening   by mouth               its
successively with the graded series    paper screens.
                                                of      The loose,
soft paper was not equal    it; nor was the tissue paper; but the
                                 to
tracing-paper just equalled the effect    the gas-flame
                                                     of    guard                in

                    the resonator from the                     entrance    of
                                                                            sonorous
vibrations. On   lowering  the gas-flame,                 so   that itstop luminous
border was  just  below the mouth        the        of         resonator, and there
fore only a  sheet      of
                       heated air ascended                     across the latter, the
balance  of the tissue paper against the hot gases and vapour                                re
mained unimpaired.         Thus appears that the reflecting-power

above described circumstances, the reflecting power         tracing            of

balance  of the interference, and caused     faint sound  a     issue                 to

gas; while cold dry hydrogen closed the mouth of the resonator
more effectively than either of the above gases, but was far                                                             in
ferior in this shielding action to the sheet of heated gases above
the bat's-wing gas-flame.         We should not place too much confi
dence in measures of the        reflecting-power   of surfaces made by
the method      just   described,  and which       have used merely to       I
give approximations of the reflecting-powers of the above named
gaseous sheets; for the substance which closes the mouth of the
 resonator may allow a considerable portion of the sonorous
vibrations to enter the latter, and yet the resonator may not be
able to reinforce the sound by reason of              being thus thrown           its
out    of tune with the fork                       by

powers        reflect sonorous vibrations.

flame equals the intensity of the vibrations which impinged on
the flame minus the intensity of those which were reflected from
the flame, then there is no absorption of these vibrations by
the flame; but if this equality does not exist, then there is
absorption in the flame; and this means that the flame is heated
by the sonorous vibrations—which enter the flame as sonorous
vibrations, but issue from the flame as heat vibrations.   It thus,
at first, appears that the absorption  of the sonorous vibrations
might be detected by their production of an increase in the
temperature of the flame, just as sonorous vibrations are absorbed
by eacutchouc and reappear as heat in this substance.

434                      Mr. C. Tomlinson                  on some Phenomena
who in 1837 attributed the action of bits of wood, wire, &c. in
liberating vapour from boiling liquids to the air contained in
their pores or adhering to their surfaces, their action ceasing
when the air is driven off.         M. Gernez quotes this con
clusion with    applause;   but he does not quote Schönbein’s
doubts,  forgetting  perhaps that the doubts of a man of genius
are often of more value than the conclusions of an ordinary man.
I  pointed to the fact some years ago* that Schönbein was by no
means satisfied with the theory which attributed the action of
solids in liberating gases or vapours from liquids to their carry
ing down air, a film of which was supposed to adhere to                                                           all

                                expressed his opinion that any one

    In 1842 Marcet attributed       differences of adhesion of the
liquid                              of                   of to

1844 Magnus recurs           the same idea, and also

of M.    Donny.      According       him,  boiling   to not       inherent              is          an
property       liquids; they only boil when they contain air—that
                   of
is, when they are not pure.         Heat liberates bubbles       air near                           of

sufficient      counterbalance the pressure

are submitted, nothing further opposes the development                 this                                 of

             paper
 lven
gy,
      It is said that rough bodies are most favourable to the
liberation of vapour.      The hot carbonic disulphide was touched
with a rat's-tail   file, and it produced furious boiling. The file
was then held in the flame of a spirit-lamp, and while hot placed
in the upper part of the tube, so that it might cool down to
about the temperature of the liquid and yet be sheltered from
the air. On touching the surface of the disulphide with the end
 of the file, there was no liberation of vapour; and the file was
 slowly passed to the bottom of the liquid, but still there was no
 action.    The file was now taken out and waved in the air; on
 reinserting it into the liquid, there was a burst of vapour, arising
 from some mote or speck of dust caught by the file from the air.
 The file was quickly cleaned by the liquid, and it became inac
 tive as before.    It was again taken out and waved in the air;
 and on once more putting it into the liquid, boiling set in again.”
    But, according to M. Gernez, the file instead of catching mu
 clear particles caught air, which it reintroduced into the hot
 liquid.    He does not attempt to explain the following experi
 ment, although he refers to the paper containing it”.
    Wood-spirit, boiling at 140°F, contained in a test-tube, was
 plunged into a flask of hot water. A clean glass rod that had
 been exposed during an hour to the air of my garden was inac
 tive.   It was drawn through the hand that had been made
 slightly greasy with lard, and when reinserted it produced such
 a burst of vapour as to turn out half the contents of the tube.
    A similar result was produced with ether and bisulphide of
carbon.
   Surely     I
             am not exceeding the bounds of philosophical dis
cretion in insisting that a theory of boiling that does not                                in

 the exhaustion was made as perfect as possible.                     Not a single
 bubble was visible either         by   daylight    or   by  candlelight.     Had
 there been a bubble in any part of the tube it must have been
 detected, since the bubbles have the lustre of mercury.                        On
 again holding the tube over the flame, the charcoal gave a few
 crackling sounds and then emitted vapour in abundance, and the
 boiling was as easy as at first. Next morning abundance of                                                     air
 bubbles were given off during the boiling, showing that air had
 been absorbed during the night.

The boiling was singularly vigorous, every part of the smear
originating rapidly ascending bubbles of vapour, which boiled
Over.
    Such experiments   as these may be multiplied to any extent.
Their results seem to me to be eloquent in favour of the action
of nuclei in liberating vapour. Such action may be explained
by M. Verdet’s theory, or by that of M. Gernez, or by my own.
I say they are active because the vapour adheres to them and
the water does not ; but         I
                              think it can hardly be maintained
that their action is due to air, seeing that in the course of these
repeated   boilings air is expelled while the nuclei continue as
active as ever, and it is only after twelve hours or so of repose
that air is reabsorbed in any appreciable quantity.
   The following cases of nuclear action are taken from a paper
read by me before the Society of Arts.on the 7th of April, 1869,
entitled “On the Theory of Boiling in connexion                          with some
Processes in the Useful Arts.”
    1. In some of the old colliery engines of Seotland, when the
steam becomes slack and there is no time for cleaning out the
boiler, the engine-men are accustomed to throw into it about a
bushel of the radicles of barley, produced during the malting
and separated in cleaning the malt.      The effect of these radicles
(or   comings  as the men call them) becomes immediately appa
rent on    again   raising the steam; for not only is there an
abundant supply for producing the full working-speed of the
engine, but an excess going to waste at the safety-valve.         This
singular effect will continue during several days+.
   2. In the distillation of ardent spirits on a large scale it is cus
tomary, when converting the wash into whatarecalled “low wines,”
to throw a lump of soap into the still every time it is charged.
This has the effect not only of causing the steam to rise more
quietly, but the vapour is more free from the residual matter of
the process.
   3. The sugar-boilers are accustomed to throw a lump of
butter into the vacuum-pan for the purpose of preventing that
irregular boiling which displays itself in furious bursts, separated
by apparently almost passive intervals.        Solid paraffin is now
preferred to butter in producing regular boiling.
   4. Professor Oerstedt noticed that if a metallic wire be sus
pended in a boiling liquid, it instantly becomes covered with
bubbles of vapour.       To show the application of this fact, 10 lbs.
of brass  wire,    of a line in diameter, were put into a still con
taining ten pints of brandy; seven pints came over at a heat
which, in the absence of the wire, would have sent over only four.

alcohol, and similar liquids in glass vessels, the vapour is given
off with difficulty. At one moment the liquid does not boil at
all, at another it bursts into a mass of vapour and liquid which
fills the vessel and occasions such a bumping of the retort as to

upwards.     A globular flask containing above ten ounces of                                               di
stilled water was employed. When the mouth of the small tube
was downwards the phenomena were much the same as before,
only the tube did not rest on the bottom unless held there.    On
removing the lamp, the tube rapidly filled and sank with its
mouth upon the heated bottom, which expanding the enclosed
vapour caused it to disgorge the water and so to rise again.                                                It
did this two or three times; it then settled and filled; but there
remained a small bead of air about the size of the head
of a small pin. On again applying the lamp, the water boiled
readily; but 75       seconds elapsed before the tube became active ;
and it was not until bubbles of vapour passed up into it and
displaced the water that the tube was in a condition to pour out
its intermittent bubbles; and it seems to me of importance to
insist on this point, namely that on this as on many other
occasions the flask boiled, so to speak, from               own independent      its

LII.    Remarks on M. Goldstein’s Observations on Spectra                                    of
          Gases. By Professor WüLLNER, of Aachen *.
IN schaften
   the Monatsbericht of the Königl. Akademie der Wissen
            for August last are described by M. Goldstein
observations on gas-spectra t, which are said to prove that my
explanation of the band- and line-spectra observed in one and
the same gas (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxlvii. p. 321) is untenable.   My
explanation was to this effect—that from an illuminating gas a
band-spectrum is always obtained when a thick layer of gas is
made use of as the source of light, but the line-spectrum when
only a few molecules of the gas are ignited.    deduce this from          I
experiments which showed that in tubes filled with rarefied gases
the line-spectrum always and only appeared when the induction
current traversed the tube in the form of a proper spark, but
the band-spectrum when the discharge was without a spark.
In my experiments at that time the sparkless discharge was
that which     Iafterwards (Pogg. Ann. Jubelband) named the
luminous tuft: it gives light which more or less fills the entire
tube; the proper spark ignites a minimum quantity of mole

450        Prof. Wüllner on  M. Goldstein's   Observations
mann, which, as it seems to me, pretty well elucidate the phe
nomena in question.
   The tube used for these experiments had a uniform diameter
of 2 centims., the points of the electrodes being 8 centims.
distant from each other.        Besides the tube, a Riess spark
micrometer was placed in the circuit, by which such spark-dis
tances as I pleased could be inserted.   The method of conducting
the observations was that which     I had previously employed, and
is described in Pogg. Ann. vol. cxlvii.
   If  the exhaustion of the tube was a minimum, with a long
spark-distance the discharge passed only in the same rhythm as
in the spark, but it filled the entire tube; the spectrum is not
the line-spectrum, but the band-spectrum not sharply shaded.
If  the spark-distance be diminished, there follows upon the first
momentary discharge a positive luminous tuft showing stratifi
cation (that described in the Jubelband of Poggendorff’s Anna
len).    The number of strata increases as the spark-distance
decreases; when the distance is short, but still just sufficient to
exclude the closing-current, four strata are visible.
   At about 1 millim. pressure, if a spark-distance of 30 millims.
be inserted, the discharge commences with a momentary partial
discharge which fills the tube, followed immediately by a positive
luminous tuft with stratification.      The spectrum is the band
spectrum.      With decreasing spark-distance the stratification
becomes sharper, and in the spectrum the shadings appear more
distinct.
   With an air-pressure     of 4 millims. and without a spark
distance the positive tuft, completely filling half of the tube,
appears as a perfectly continuous field of light; but when a
spark-distance is inserted, first the momentarily passing bluish
discharge shows itself, and the positive tuft takes the form of a
cloud (described by P.A. in the Jubelband).        Band-spectrum.
    Pressure 25 millims.     A small spark-distance gives at the
commencement a partial discharge, visible in the rotating mirror
as an unspread image of the tube; then follows a luminous tuft
at the positive electrode in the form of two clouds.   If the spark
distance is taken very great, only the momentary partial dis
charges appear, which fill the tube each time with whitish blue
light.    In the spectrum the shadings are no longer distinctly
recognizable; but not a line of the line-spectrum is to be seen.
   Pressure 45 millims.       Without a spark-distance the light
divides in the rotating mirror into four clouds.     With a spark
distance of 30 millims. the clouds have nearly vanished, and the
current passes only in 3–4 discharges, which in the rotating
mirror give unspread images of the tube; but the spectrum is
still the band-spectrum, only not so sharply shaded.            On

shortening the spark-distance the clouds gradually develop; and
when it is reduced to 20 millims. they are already completely
formed, but are of shorter duration than when there is no spark
distance.     With 65 millims. pressure the number of clouds rises
to five or  six;  in other respects the appearance is substantially
as before.
   Pressure 100 millims.      Without a spark-distance, essentially
a positive luminous tuft, in the shape of a great number of clouds,
which give the band-spectrum.          When a spark-distance of 10
millims. is   interpolated, there appears   a small and feeble spark,
in the rotating mirror as a fine line of white light opening the
discharge; but it reaches only about 1 centim. below the positive
electrode, and is there lost in the diffused discharge, as before de
scribed in the case of hydrogen.       On increasing the spark-dis
tance   inserted, the spark  extends further;   with one of 30 millims.
it sometimes goes quite over from one electrode to the other.
 When the spark enters, the green lines of the line-spectrum im
mediately appear in the band-spectrum otherwise furnished by the
tube, and exactly as far as the spark extends; so that in the spec
trum the length of the spark can be accurately ascertained, even
without the aid of the rotating mirror.
    Pressure 145 millims.     Without    the interpolation of a spark
distance the current passes at first    in the form of a partial dis
charge; then follows a positive tuft    which appears in the rotating
mirror as flickering clouds.      The   insertion of a spark-distance
of 12 millims. sometimes produces         in the tube a very peculiar
spark-discharge : from the positive      electrode springs a spark to
about the distance of 1 centim. in the tube, and is there lost,
but reappears 1 centim. lower down, looking again like a spark
line 1 centim. in length. Sometimes the spark is present as a
line along this whole distance; but it never goes further than
about half the distance between the two electrodes.          Only with
the external interpolation of a greater spark-distance does the
spark in the tube become longer; and when the former amounts
to 30 millims. the latter sometimes extends the whole distance
from one electrode to the other.         The spectrum of the spark
shows, besides the green, even the yellow and red lines of the
nitrogen line-spectrum. The lines, however, are to be seen in
the spectrum only just as far as the spark eatends (here, as before,
I  copy, word for word, the note made at the time); hence we
can recognize in the spectrum precisely to what distance the spark
reaches.
    The above-related series of experiments consequently shows
unequivocally that a spark-distance interpolated in the circuit of
the induction-current by no means always calls forth sparks in
spaces filled with rarefied gases, even with uniform rhythm of the

on the pressure of the enclosed gas and on the length of the                                           in
terpolated spark-distance.        As long                       as,

good for any given number of poles, it will still be true for one

this would enable us to advance, by successive additions of one
pole at a time, to any number.

                     found that the conventional distinction between positive
and negative angles leads       the following rule
                                            to                          as   to

and for the point   R we have
                      X6+Rrx=(n+1)2+(m—1)2.
Consequently    for each of these points, which we already know.
are situated on the same flow-line of the resultant system, we
have
                   6, +6,  +...+6, +6, = (n+m)2.
In  the same way, we should get for the points     P and Q' situated
on the line of flow of the resultant system which lies next to the
line through P, Q, and R on the left, the respective values which
follow  :
                   X6+P'pX=no. +(m+1)2,
                   264-Q'qX=(n+1)2+ma,
and therefore for each    of them
                   6, +...+6, +6, = (n+m + 1)a.
The same reasoning gives for the points Q, and R1 on the line
of flow next on the right to that through P, Q, and R,
                   6, +...+6,    +6= (n+m-1)2.
   30. Next suppose the additional pole at      L to be a sink; then,
since the resultant flow must be everywhere concurrent with both
the components, the new flow-lines will pass through the other
 pair of angles of each quadrilateral; for instance, three conse
cutive lines will pass through the points P and Q1, through P'',
 Q, and R2, and through Q' and R1; and by applying the same
considerations as above, it will be seen that these lines are cha
racterized by the following values of the expression
                           6, +. - ..+6, +6,
namely:—for      the line through    P' and Qi,
                             (n—m-H 1)a;
for that through    P', Q,  and R2,
                             (n-m)&;
and for that through Q' and R1,
                             (n—m—1)a.
Hence it follows that sources and sinks affect the value of the
sum of angles denoted by X6 in opposite ways, and therefore that,
as assumed provisionally above (§ 28), sources and sinks must be
distinguished by a difference in the intrinsic sign of the angles
which the radii vectores drawn from them make with the fixed
line.    When this is done, the equation
                               26=no.

often      as   it contains the greatest common measure of the strengths
of the whole set. Moreover, if on any flow-line there is a point
of no flow, the line will intersect itself at this point one or more
times.   Separate flow-lines cannot intersect each other anywhere
except at a pole.
   Equipotential lines form closed curves which always surround
one or more poles.    At points where the strength of the current
is nothing, the same equipotential line cuts itself once or oftener;
in such cases there is at least one pole within each loop formed
by the line. Separate equipotential lines never intersect each
other.
   The method of superposition, by which any system of flow
lines or equipotential lines can be drawn, is easily carried out
by drawing, in rather strong lines on white paper, one of any two
systems that are to be compounded to a resultant system, and
drawing the other component system on tracing-paper.      Placing
the two drawings one over the other in any required manner, and
laying a second piece of tracing-paper on the top, the curves
which pass through the intersections of the two component
systems can be drawn at once. The resultant system may then,
if required, be recompounded with one of the components by
the same process.

lines for a few of the simpler cases is shown in Plate X.

often as it contains the greatest common measure of the strengths
of the whole set. Moreover, if on any flow-line there is a point
of no flow, the line will intersect itself at this point one or more
times.   Separate flow-lines cannot intersect each other anywhere
except at a pole.
   Equipotential lines form closed curves which always surround
one or more poles.     At points where the strength of the current
is nothing,  the same equipotential  line cuts itself once or oftener;
in such cases there is at least one pole within each loop formed
by the line. Separate equipotential lines never intersect each
other.
   The method of superposition, by which any system of flow
lines or equipotential lines can be drawn, is easily carried out
by drawing, in rather strong lines on white paper, one of any two
systems that are to be compounded                 to a resultant system, and
drawing the other component system on tracing-paper.    Placing
the two drawings one over the other in any required manner, and
laying a second piece of tracing-paper on the top, the curves
which pass through the intersections of the two component
systems can be drawn at once. The resultant system may then,
if required, be recompounded with one of the components by
the same process.

lines for a few of the simpler cases is shown in Plate X.

     HIS   instrument consists of a Nicol's prism or other ordi
        nary polarizer, and a double-image prism as analyzer. The
latter is so cut as to show one image in the centre of the field of
view, the other excentric; and the peculiarity of the arrangement
consists in giving to the analyzer a rapid motion of rotation.  the                                         If
speed attains eight or ten revolutions per second, the image will
remain persistently upon the retina during an entire revolution,

 with a quartz plate. The order of the tints will be that due to
 a right-handed quartz for one position of the quarter-undulation
 plate, and will be that due to a left-handed quartz for a position
 at right angles to the first.
    In order that this effect may be successfully produced, the
 thicknesses of the selenite and quarter-undulation plate must be
 adapted to one another.          The latter is usually constructed for
 the  yellow  rays;   and with such plates we should consequently
 use a selenite  giving   yellow and blue images.
    If the   quarter-undulation     plate be used with a quartz per
 pendicular to the axis, the tints may be reduced to a pair of com
plementaries, as given by a selenite.
    To these many other and varied experiments may be added,
 º
them.
       on the present occasion I will confine my remarks to two of
     In the cases hitherto described the central image appears
 colourless and uniformly illuminated, while the excentric image
 or ring has been the chief subject of observation.        But if instead
 of a   plane plate we use     quartz   wedges  giving   Savart's bands,
 or a concave    quartz   cut  parallel to the axis,  the central image
 will be the most    interesting.     We shall then see light and dark
  (or coloured and colourless) bands taking alternate places at
 each half revolution of the analyzer.         The ring shows no very
 striking feature.      If a  quarter-undulation     plate be used, the
 bands will be seen to travel across the        plate,  in one direction
 when it is placed so as to produce right-handed, or in the other
 when placed so as to produce left-handed circular polarization.
     Analogous effects are seen with a concave quartz plate cut
 parallel to the axis. The central figure then shows rings, which
 with a quarter-undulation plate expand or contract according to
 the position of that plate.      When, however, the analyzer revolves
 rapidly, it will be noticed that the rings assume the form of spi
 rals. This is due to the fact that the central image, when pro
  duced by a circularly concave plate, is not accurately circular,
 but elliptical, owing to the unequal refraction of the double
 image prism in two rectangular directions.           To the same cause
 is attributable the apparent wabbling of the central image, even
when the instrument is in perfect adjustment.
     The principle of the revolving analyzer is applicable alike to
 a table polariscope for eye-observations and to one constructed
 for projection.    In the table polariscope it is used above the
  analyzer, a diaphragm being placed immediately over the object
  on the stage of the instrument; in that for projection it may
 be placed in the focus of the focusing-lens of the system.

THE
.*. “On the Sun-spot Period and the Rainfall.”                               By   J.   A. Broun,
F.R.S.
   Having read with much interest Mr. Meldrum's communication
to the Royal Society on the apparent simultaneity of excess of
rainfall and sun-spot area”, I have waited some confirmation of
his conclusions from a more extensive induction.    Mr. Hennes
sey’s “Note” in the Proceedings of the Society for April 1874t
induces me to offer the following views and results to the Royal,
Society.
   It is well known that the amount of rainfall is a very variable
quantity in some countries and in certain positions, and that
when there is a year of drought in one part of the world, there is
frequently an excess of rain in another. Any investigation, then,
which should be occupied with the average fall of rain over the
earth's surface must be long and laborious, unless the variation
to be dealt with is large and marked compared with others which
must be considered purely accidental relatively to the sun's spots.
                           I
In proof of this may cite the rainfall at Mussoorie given by Mr.
Hennesseyt, where, as far as the sun-spot area is known, any
result favourable to the connexion of the two phenomena
depends wholly on the rainfall for 1861, which is upwards of 50
inches in excess of the mean. If this excess be not due to the
great spot-area, then a long series of years' observations might be
requisite to make the positive and negative errors destroy each
other.
   It has been with the intention of determining what may be the
effect of a given change of sun-spot area, within a limited district,
during a period favourable to the connexion of the two phe
momena, that the following discussions have been made.          We can
then say approximately within what limits the excess and defi
eiency of rainfall             lie
                        for the years    greatest and least spot-area,
                                                      of

dental variations, and whether the result may encourage more
extensive research.

of time, and is a constant to be deduced from the observations.
   Having obtained the mean spot—area for each year from 1832 to
1867, from Table VII. of the paper on this subject by Messrs.
De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy”, the mean for three periods of
11 years (1832 to 1864) was found equal to 643 millionths of the
sun's visible surface; with this quantity the values of +4A (in
millionths of the sun's surface) for each year were obtained.
                                                                         §.
   Mr. Meldrum's conclusion depends chiefly on observations
during these periods in Great Britain; and as he has deduced the
rainfall for the first period of minimum spots from observations at
three stations, Greenwich, Carbeth (near              and Aberdeen,
I first examined the observations at these     places together with
simultaneous observations at Makerstoun for the two periods
1832 to 1853t. Applying the above equation to these observa
tions, the following results were obtained:—
                    Greenwich               AR= –0.00092 AA;
                                           . . . .   .   .
                    Makerstoun . . . . AR= –0.00020 AA ;
                    Carbeth . . . . . . . . AR= +0.00158 AA ;
                    Aberdeen . . . . . . AR= +0.00128 AA.
Greenwich and Makerstoun are thus opposed to the conclusion,
and Carbeth and Aberdeen are more strongly in its favour.       It
should be remarked, however, that the result for Aberdeen depends
wholly on the rainfall given for that place in 1834 (12.3 in.)
being exact. As it is 12 inches less than the mean, while at the
other three stations the deficiency is only from 0-6 in. at Green
wich and Makerstoun to 1-2 in. at Carbeth, this may be due to a
leaky rain-gauge or to a clerical error of 10 inches. In any case
no great weight can be given to the conclusion from these four
stations t.

   If we    seek the value of        f   for the mean of the three periods of
eleven    years   commencing          1832 and 1835, we find the following
equations:—
                1832 to 1864       . . . . . . . . AR= +0-0019 AA ;
                1835 to 1867       . . . . . . . . AR= +0.0011 AA.
    These results, then, are, as we expected, in conformity with
Mr. Meldrum's conclusion; so that if we compare the year of
largest with that of smallest spot-area, the difference of rainfall
should amount to 2.61 in. by the first and to 1:51 in. by the
second value of f.           If we take the mean spot-area for the years
 1834, 1844, 1856, and 1866, and for 1836, 1848, and 1861, we
find that the mean difference of rainfall for these years should
be 2:06 in. by the first and 1:20 in. by the second value of f,                         in
stead of 8:45 in. as found by Mr. Meldrum.
    It will be seen also that the greatest mean difference of rainfall
is that for the years 1841, 1852, and 1863, and this was an excess
of rain for years of spot-area deficiency; were another such
opposite difference to present itself, it would neutralize the con
clusion derived from these means.                        It should also be observed
that while the first and third            periods      of eleven years are in favour
of the   connexion,      the second (1843 to 1853) is opposed to it (this
is also the case for the eleven years 1857 to 1867).
    It will be seen, then, that from this discussion a probable

Mr.    J.  A. Broun on      the Sun-spot     Period and    the  Rainfall.      477
difference of about 2 inches of rain may be expected betwixt
years of greatest and least spot-area.
    This result is derived from observations at ten stations, dis
tributed over a very small patch of the earth's surface; and it is
evident that for any serious investigation a much larger series of
observations representing the rainfall over a great extent of country
would be essential.
    I  now examined observations made at different stations in
India; but this examination showed the extreme difficulty of
obtaining a satisfactory result, either way, from a few stations in
that country, when, in certain years, the accidental excess of
rainfall at some of the stations may be 40 inches, even though
deficiencies at some stations may diminish the amount of the
error.
    From my own experience of rainfall on the Indian ghats,                       I
should doubt that a mountain-station, such as Mussoorie, is well
fitted to be employed in this discussion.             If a single station could
be taken to     represent    any  tract of   country,  it ought to be one least
liable to local causes of variation.          Among    the mountains a slight
change in the average direction of the wind will cause great
 differences in the rainfall at stations but little distant from each
 other, and to eliminate accidental variations of 40 or 80 inches
 would require observations during a very long series of years.

 may have to be dealt with at an Indian hill-station f:—

that of greatest spot-area.     The examination of many series of
observations has shown how difficult it will be to arrive at a con
clusion for a quantity so small as 2 inches of rain.
   It is evident that a larger tract of country than Great Britain
should be chosen, and the approximate rainfall be deduced from
the greatest possible number of stations.       Germany and France
may give sufficient data for such a trial. Were the result well
marked, there would be reason to seek for its confirmation in
other countries; but to undertake this labour, better grounds,       I
think, must be found than            I
                                  have hitherto been able to obtain.
The admirable series of observations which Mr. Symons is ob
taining will suffice for the future, as for the past, ten years to give
a very near approximation to the excess or deficiency of rainfall
in Great Britain.

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “New Carboniferous Polyzoa.”    By Prof. John Young, M.D.,
F.G.S., and John Young, Esq., F.G.S., Hunterian Museum, Glasgow
University.
   The authors described two new forms of Polyzoa from the Carbo
niferous Limestone shales near Glasgow.    For one of these they
proposed to form a new genus, Actinostoma, allied to Fenestella,
                                   on one face only, and with the
with the frond erect, and poriferous
fenestrules oblong. The species they named A. fenestratum. The
second species was described under the name of Glauconome stel
lipora.
  2.   “On     Palaeocoryne and other Polyzoal Appendages.”   By Prof.
John Young, M.D., F.G.S., and John Young, Esq., F.G.S.,         Hun
terian Museum, Glasgow University.
    The authors maintained that the structures described by MM.
Duncan and Jenkins under the name of Palaiocoryne, are not inde
pendent organisms, but mere processes of the Polyzoa on which
they occur, the cells at the base being only the cells of the Polyzoa.
They stated that the tissues of the two structures are perfectly con
 tinuous, that the “dactylose basal lobes” are the branches of the
Polyzoon of which the processes are continuations, that the stem,
capitulum, and branches of the processes are solid, that there is no
normal aperture in the capitulum, that the stems do not always
bear capitula, even when they give off branches, and that in many
cases they are mere processes without either capitulum or branches.
According to their observations, the stellate processes called Palaeo
coryne are given      off
                       chiefly from the poriferous face, and the other
processes from the poriferous and non-poriferous faces, and from the

                        Mr. T. Belt    on the Steppes              of Siberia.                          479
edge and base of the frond.   The authors did not express any positive
opinion as to the function of these processes; but they suggested that
those given off from the non-poriferous face and from the base of
calycine fronds, may serve as adventitious roots, and those given off
from the margins and from the poriferous face near the margins
may be irregularities of growth, unless they are the commencement
of new fronds.
   3. “The Steppes of Siberia.” By Thomas Belt, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author described the portion of the Siberian steppes traversed
by him as consisting of sand and loam. The best section seen by
him was at Pavlodar, where he found 1 foot of surface soil, 20 feet
of stratified reddish-brown sand, with lines of small gravel, 8 feet of
light-coloured sandy silt, 15 feet of coarse sand, with lines of small
pebbles and 1 line of large ones, and 6 feet of clayey unlaminated
silt, with fragments of the bed rock in                      its
                                             lower half, the bed rock
being Magnesian Limestone much crushed                  the top. South   at                                  of

   The object       this paper
                             of        supply further and conclusive
                                            is   to

ferous age whose original mineral constitution      precisely the same
                                                                         of is
as  those     the later Tertiary periods, those
                   of                               both ages present
ing the same varieties      structure, and that the great alterations
                                  of
which most       the older rocks have undergone constitute the only
                        of
difference between the two groups. The author describes           some                             at
length the various constituents under the following heads, viz.
felspar, augite, olivine, magnetite, mica, apatite, glassy matrix, &c.

He next describes the occurrence of dolerites in the Midland Coal
fields, Ireland, Edinburgh, Arran, &c.
   In conclusion he draws attention to the many variations in com
position and texture in the same rock-mass, and accounts for them
thus:—If the lava were simply in a viscid state, with the ingre
dients imperfectly mixed, portions of it must, on consolidation,
contain them in various proportions, just as is known to be the case
in imperfectly fused slags.
   He maintains that there is an absolute identity of composition,
structure, and mode of occurrence in these eruptive rocks of very
widely separated geological periods, and that therefore they should
be placed in one group.

ence to a group of very large and far-travelled erratics in Llanarmon
parish, Denbighshire.”     By D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author, after referring to a number of northern-drift boulders
in addition to those he had noticed in a former paper, describes
several large felspathic boulders found up to a height of about
1750 feet above the sea, on Cefn-y-fedw, N. of Llangollen.             He
then gives a somewhat detailed account of the drifts in the neigh
bourhood of Corwen, and of some large felspathic boulders, probably
from the Arenig mountains, which are generally found on the sur
face, or interposed between the lower boulder-clay and an upland
extension of the middle sand of the plains. The main part of the
paper is devoted to an account of the discovery of a numerous group
of very large and far-travelled felspathic boulders in the parish of
Llanarmon, Denbighshire. The author refers particularly to a remark
able slickensided boulder, and to the great “Immovable Stone” at
Maendigychwyn (now called Eryrys), about 1150 feet above the sea,
which is the largest far-transported boulder he has heard of in the
British Isles.    He stated a number of facts and considerations
which led him to believe that the Llanarmon boulders, along with
those further N. and W., must have come                   or all
                                                    the way from Snow
don, and that they were floated over passes        cols   the intervening

                                 coast-ice about the close      the Lower     of
Boulder-clay period. He concluded                by
                                            noticing the necessity for
personal examination             of
                           boulders instead       relying of   answers    on           to a
queries, and stated that about Llanarmon the felspathic boulders
are called “granite tumblers,” while       Cheshire all kinds
                                                in                boulders     of
are called “marble stones.”

   In this paper the author criticised a figure of the lower molars of
Diprotodon, published by Professor Owen, on the ground that the
teeth are represented in it in an unabraded state, and stated that
when the last tooth breaks through the gum the first of the series
is always worn flat. He also remarked on the peculiar modification
of the premolar in the genus Diprotodon.

these last figures appear in spectrum No. I. against the same scale

 ON    THE DETERMINATION      OF THE QUANTITY OF MAGNETISM OF
                    A MAGNET,       BY R. BLONDLOT.
   The notion of instituting a method of magnetic exploration based
on the production of induced currents has long been entertained.
In 1849 Wan Rees published” the result of researches on the dis
tribution of magnetism, the principle of his process being as fol
lows:—The wire of a much-flattened induction-coil is connected
with a galvanometer; the bar to be examined is introduced into
the coil up to a fixed point of the latter, and is then briskly with
drawn to a great distance: this gives rise to an induction-current,
which deflects the needle of the galvanometer a certain angle.
   Van Rees lays down a simple proportionality between the inten
sity of the current and the inducing magnetism, from which it fol
lows that the current observed is a measure for the sum of the free
magnetism over which the coil glides; and he concludes, from a
known relation, that that sum is equal to the actual magnetism at
the place from which the withdrawal of the coil started.
   Subsequently, in 1861, in a memoir an abstract of which appeared
in Poggendorff's Annalent, M. Rothlauf treats the same subject,
commencing with a critical examination of Van Rees's memoir.
The theory of the latter is faulty in two points; the principal
charge against it is that it supposes the experiments to be made
with a coil formed of one circumvolution only, and that the points
situated beneath it are the only ones which act by induction. We
refer for the details of the criticism to M. Rothlauf's memoirit.
    Finally, M. Gaugain has recently taken up Wan Rees's method,
and made it the foundation of researches, which he is pursuing
with success, on magnetism.
   It appeared to us important to examine Van Rees's method from
the theoretical point of view, to seek the exact signification of the
numbers given by        and   it,treat     particular
                                            to         case  in which,    a            in
though generally inaccurate,                       its
                                     application does not involve any
appreciable error.

This relation, in general very complicated, is simplified in a special
case, as we will show.
   Let us consider the potential W of a pole P. It is known that
this potential has for its value in absolute measure the opening of
the cone under which the pole P regards the current.      If, then, the
circuit B starts from negative infinity to reach the pole and then
remove thence to positive infinity, the potential varies by the quan
tity 4".
    #:   this it follows that, in the above-indicated conditions of
displacement, W1-Wo is a constant quantity, and equal to 4T for
all the poles; consequently     can   put      factor, which gives
