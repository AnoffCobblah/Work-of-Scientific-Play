has demonstrated that if the heat evolved by compressing an
elastic fluid be equivalent to the force absorbed in the compres
sion, the proportion of heat converted into mechanical effect by
any perfect thermo-dynamic engine will be equal to the range of
temperature divided by the highest temperature from the abso
lute zero of temperature. Therefore, if in a perfect steam-engine

be the absolute temperature of the condenser, the fraction of the

which is analogous to the fraction representing the proportion of
chemical force converted into mechanical effect in the electro
magnetic engine”.     The extreme simplicity of this very import
ant deduction which Professor Thomson has drawn from the
dynamical theory of heat, is of itself a strong argument in favour
of that theory, even if it were not already established by decisive
experiments.

   In order to compare the foregoing result with the duty of
a  steam-engine  approaching perfection as nearly as possible,                                                  I
will admit that steam may be safely worked at a pressure of
14 atmospheres. The temperature of the boiler corresponding
to that pressure will, according to the experiments of the French
Academicians, be 387°Fahr.      The temperature of the condenser
might be kept at 80°. Reducing the above to temperatures
reckoned from the absolute zero, we obtain for the work evolved
by the combustion of each grain of coal,
                W = 1261.45 (846–539) =457-76                                 foot-pounds.

        On the Mechanical Effect                     of Heat and of Chemical Forces.                               7

        The Rev. T. P. Kirkman's Note on Combinations.            Il
ciple, that “the decomposition of a compound body occasions
as much cold as the combination of the elements originally pro
duced heat.”
  Mr. Joule, in     the introduction to his paper “On the Heat dis
engaged in Chemical Combinations,” published in this Magazine
last July, after noticing that      I
                                   had proved the definite production
of cold by decomposition, adds, that previous to the year 1843
he had demonstrated “that the heat rendered latent in the elec
trolysis of water is at the expense of the heat which would other
wise have been evolved in a free state by the circuit.”       But his
conclusions in no   way   interfere with  mine,  for he ascribes the
absence of heat to a cause quite different from absorption by
decomposition. He reasons thus, if I understand him rightly:—A
 current of a certain intensity passing through a conductor with
resistance produces a certain amount of heat.        The same inten
sity of current ought equally to affect water and a solid con
ductor; but he proves less heat is produced by it in water ; and
ascribes as the reason, that a certain amount of the intensity is
used up in overcoming the obstruction offered by the decom
position, and the residue of the current is alone concerned in
producing the heat.        Now this explanation differs altogether
 from that which ascribes to the decomposition itself the absorp
 tion of the heat.   The latter is the principle        I
                                                      endeavoured to
 establish in the   paper   published  in this Magazine    in October
 1851, and by a similar process to mine, which Mr. Joule him
 self proves in the Number for July 1852.
   If it be true that decomposition occasions as much cold as
combination of the same elements produces heat, is not Mr.
Joule’s theory of the heat of combination being due to resistance
to electric conduction disproved ?

appears, that            all

       Conductibility     of Minerals for Voltaic Electricity.              13
times, and with several specimens, the surfaces having been pre
viously purified with care.
    Three hundred and nineteen species have been submitted to
direct examination by the author.       The comparison of his results
with those of previous experimenters shows in general a satis
factory coincidence. Where divergences exhibited themselves,
they are to be referred to the variety of structure resulting from
difference of locality, and without doubt also to the fact of his
having made use of voltaic instead of machine electricity.
    The influences resulting from differences of structure are
exhibited by the experiments of M. Riess on the conductibility of
the sulphuret of antimony, native and artificial.          These obser
vations have been confirmed by those of Professor Faraday, and
more recently by MM. Karsten and Munck of Rosenschöld, who
have found among other peculiarities, that native crystals of
realgar procured from Nagy-Ag are good conductors, while
 M. Hausmann ranks the substance among the semi-conductors,
 and M. Pelletier among the insulators.          Sulphuret of zinc, in
pieces or in powder, is a conductor or an insulator according as
 it is prepared in the dry or the humid way. Does not this
 explain the divergence of the results of M. Hausmann from those
 of Mr. Fox with reference to blende : Black sulphuret of mer
 cury very pure conducts well, while cinnabar is a perfect insu
 lator. The other sulphurets exhibit the same peculiarities.
     The diversity of electric propagation, according as it comes
 from the pile or the machine, is rendered manifest by a crowd
 of experiments. MM. Hausmann and Henrici distinguish as
 semi-conductors a great number of substances, such as carbonate
 and sulphate of lime, which with current electricity are perfect
 insulators.    The author has repeated the greater number of their
 experiments and found them correct. This remark will be suf
 ficient to explain certain divergences which exhibit themselves
 between their results and those of Mr. Fox, as also the complete
 coincidence  (if  we except the sulphurets          of

 succeeded in   polarizing   the forceps,  or in developing electro
chemical phaenomena which masked the result sought after.
   These obstacles became still more numerous in examining the
variations of conductibility in the same mineral.     The conducting
substances which   belong   to other  systems   than the regular are
not numerous.     The   crystals  to be obtained are nearly always
very small, and their texture rarely homogeneous. The natural
faces are in some cases covered by an insulating crust, although
of a fine polish.  M. Wartmann has found some crystals perfect
conductors, and others of the same appearance which arrested
the most energetic currents, until by the continued friction of a
very hard body the surface was abraded. Some very beautiful
crystals of oxide of tin have proved themselves conductors along
their edges, and here and there on their faces, but everywhere
else they were insulators.     Finally, the variable adherence of the
 surfaces of cleavage sometimes modifies the conductibility in
 the most capricious manner.        These difficulties have obliged
 MM. Wiedemann and Senarmont to have recourse to the super
 ficial distribution of machine electricity, and to determine in a
 manner less direct the sense of greater or less conduction.
     The experiments which M. Wartmann made in connexion with
this point were executed by passing a current simultaneously
round two galvanometers of Ruhmkorff.         The crystal was clasped
in one direction between the    jaws  of a  forceps,  which latter was
 connected with one of the galvanometers; in the perpendicular
direction it was clasped between a second pair of forceps which
were connected with the other galvanometer.          Multiplied experi
ments have shown that manganite (acerdèse) conducts much better
parallel to the axis than in the perpendicular direction.      Plates of
sulphuret of molybdenum from Wallais exhibited the opposite de
portment, which appears to the author to be sufficiently pro
nounced in certain crystals of arseniate of iron also.
    The results of M. Wartmann's investigation, similar in many
respects to those of MM. Hausmann and Henrici, are as follows:—
      i.The conducting minerals belong to five primitive crystalline
                            among the twelve species of the system
types.     None are found
represented by the oblique unsymmetrical prism.
    2. Minerals present       all
                             intermediate degrees between perfect
conductibility and perfect insulating power.
      3.Native metals and their alloys are conductors.

                       the Disintegrated Surfaces                 of Crystals.                                    19
lous figure with a crescent at each end, and an elliptical space in
the centre, from which the image of the candle or luminous
point has wholly disappeared.            Hence it appears that the whole
of the original surface of the flat summit of the crystal has been
removed by the action of the solvent, an effect which may be
imitated, as we shall presently see, in artificial crystals. The
nebulous expansion of which we have been treating has some
times rectilineal branches at its extremities, and is sometimes
filled up in the middle, where the image of the candle is distinctly
seen.     In other specimens, this nebulous portion is the only part
that is visible.      The angular magnitude of the figure varies
greatly in different specimens, and also                               its

    In a specimen of Avinite, observed the remarkable geome
trical figure shown in fig. 6.      It consisted of two images a, b,
joined by a line of light, and each of them sending out, in oppo
site but parallel directions, luminous rectilineal branches ac, bil.
 The line ab is perpendicular to the edges of the prism, and ac,
bd parallel to the sides of the reflecting face.     On the opposite
side of the  prism  the  figure is reversed.
   On the faces of the primitive cube of Boracite, the optical
figure seen by reflexion is a rectangular luminous cross, with a
central image, the radiations being perpendicular to the edges of
the square faces.     Muriate of soda that had begun to deliquesce
in a humid atmosphere exhibits the same figure.
   The faces of the octohedron of ovidulated iron gives six lumi
nous radii, inclined 60° to each other; but each alternate image
is stronger than the one adjacent to                              it.

images     of the candle will             be developed              at 1, 2, 3; and by a little
further action of the solvent, these images connect themselves
with the central image S, by the radial lines 1S,2S,3S, inclined
110° to each other, and 30° to the principal radiations from S.
By continuing the action, other three images start up at 4, 5, 6,
but apparently without any radial connexion with S.           The
principal radiations aS, bS, cS begin at this period to grow faint
between 4 and 1, 5 and 2, and 6 and 3.      Another immersion of
the  crystal developes the images 7, 8, 9; and by continuing the
action, the images 1, 2, 3 become the brightest, and the branches
A, B, C become more like images at m, n, 0. The central image

   I now proceeded          to apply the solvents to the summit planes
of the   prism.       My   first experiment was made on an artificial
face perpendicular to the axis.             By the action of vinegar it gave
the figure shown in fig. 24, which consists of three radiations,
inclined 120° to each other, having                               its

there are three non-concentric circular arches, similar                         those              to

    The very same figure, with the exception                   the circle and theof

  strange branching figure shown in fig. 27, where abc forms the
  brightest portion.          I obtained the same figure with another
  crystal, but the parts a y were wanting, and b and c were con

  crystal which belongs to the rhombohedral system.                         By the
  slightest action of water upon the flat summit of a hexagonal
  prism it produced                 six

                           have delineated many of the figures
which they produce, and though some of them have considerable
interest, I am not able to present the details in the form which
I could  wish.        I
                    expected to have been able to obtain interesting
and definite results by subjecting the faces of a large class of
minerals to the action of fluoric acid; but, in so far as my expe
riments went,     Iwas disappointed.       Dr. Fyfe, many years ago,
exposed several crystals of quartz and amethyst, which                    I
                                                                       sent
him for this purpose, to the action of fluoric acid, but the disin
tegration of the surfaces was such that they would not reflect
any light at all.         I
                        have no doubt, however, that by weakening
the action and   carrying   it on very slowly the desired effect will
be  produced.
   During the preceding experiments I was led to observe, that
different solvents had a tendency to produce different figures,
and   I confirmed the truth of the observation by many experi
ments. When muriatic acid, for example, acts upon alum, it
produces a figure with six radiations, not unlike those of sulphate
of potash, and by continuing the action, the central image
vanishes.    If in this state we immerse it in water, three of the
radiations  vanish,   and it assumes the usual form. When again
immersed in muriatic acid, the six images reappear.               Diluted
nitric acid has the same effect as muriatic acid; but diluted sul
phuric acid gives such a form to the radiations, that their extre
mities are included within an equilateral triangle, the larger
radiations pointing to the three angles, and the shorter ones to
the three sides.
    Diluted alcohol, though it acts feebly upon alum, produces a
figure different from water and the acids. It gives a figure with
three short radiations; and, by further dilution, the figure
undergoes changes which give it a greater resemblance to the
 aqueous figure.
    In order to retard or diminish the action of solvents upon
 highly soluble crystals,          I
                               conceived the idea of immersing them
 in solutions of the crystal of different degrees of strength.           In
 making this experiment on alum,                 I
                                             took a  crystal  which    gave
 the figure shown in fig. 8, and having immersed it in a saturated
 solution of alum for a single instant,              I
                                                found that it had, as it
 were, seized the particles of alum in the solution, and replaced
 them in their proper position on the disintegrated face.                B
 subsequent immersion the face repassed through                 the all
                                                                     stages
 at which it  produced the phaenomena shown             fig.in  and finally
                                                                    7,

                                                       the candle.      The
 singular fact    in
                   this eageriment         is,
                                         the inconceivable   rapidity  with
  which the particles     the solution fly into their proper places upon

the disintegrated surface, and become                     a permanent           portion      of the
solid crystal.
    In repeating and varying these experiments,           observed a            I
number of curious facts, which it would be out of place here to
describe.          I
               immersed crystals of alum in saturated solutions of
nitre and other salts, and observed many remarkable changes
upon the figures which they produced.       The changes take place
principally upon the central parts of the figure, as shown in
fig. 33, which represents one of the forms which a solution of
nitre gave to the figure produced by alum; but in other cases
the whole figure suffers a change. A crystal of sulphate of
potash, which gave the hexangular radiations already described,
produced the same figure, with twice the angular magnitude,
when dipped for a few seconds in a saturated solution of nitre.
    In consequence of having observed that the natural cleavage
planes of crystals gave indications of regular optical figures,
similar to those produced by solution,                       I
                                            was led to make some
experiments on the effects of mechanical abrasion, as produced
by coarse sandstone”, or by the action of a rasp or large-toothed
file.   Surfaces thus torn up produced, in a rude manner, the
optical figure given by solution; but what was very remarkable,
 the figure had a different position, or had the position which solu
tion would have developed on the opposite face. This is also true
of the figures produced by natural    cleavage planes, in which the
separating surfaces have been slightly torn up.
   It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the power of producing
the optical figures described in this paper may be communicated
to wax or isinglass, &c. The impressions on isinglass enable us
to see the figure by transmitted light, and to observe         form                        its
and dimensions with greater accuracy.

     My     reasons for concluding that clouds consist     of minute drops,
are as follows.      Prof.  Henry’s   experiments    demonstrate that the
film of a soap-bubble contracts on the included air with great
force considering the thinness of the film”.            Now the amount
of condensation to which the enclosed air is subjected by the
film is inversely as the diameter of the sphere, that                      the                                   is, if

which would cause the rays of the sun at those places to traverse
a greater or less length of the firmament.       hold, that if these            I
motions are sufficiently extensive, they must produce sensible
alterations in the intensity of the morning and evening red.
   With regard to the action of clouds and mists in the lower
regions of the atmosphere in producing the morning and evening
red,        I
        follow Professor Forbes and M. Clausius.         look upon                            I
the clouds as white, or nearly white reflectors, which only ap
pear coloured in consequence of red light falling on them, or
from being seen through a coloured mist.          cannot, however,                   I
come to a conclusion as to whether the usual sombre colours of
the clouds are generally produced in the clouds themselves or

in the clearer air; neither can see any reason why, in account
ing for the colours of the clouds, we must restrict ourselves to
the consideration of those particles only which produce the first
blue and red.

varies considerably in quantity and also in composition, depend
ing upon the length of calcination, the quantity of iron and sul
phur remaining, the heat of the furnace, &c. It is also liable
to be affected by the flux when any is used.      If that be fluor
spar or lime, the coarse metal will be enriched; but if oxide of
iron, which nevertheless is a preferable flux, the coarse metal
will not be so rich in copper, a portion of the oxide of iron being
reduced to the state of sulphuret.    The qualities of oxide of iron
used are the rich slags from iron cupola furnaces, and the scale and

we think very probable; although from the above table, and
from many other analyses of coarse metal, almost every charge
would require a different formula.
   The slags skimmed from the charge are removed to an open
lº,    and when cool are broken up into small pieces and examined
  y the eye for small shots of metal which may have been drawn
out by the rake, and which are laid aside to be returned to the
fusing-furnace.   The average quantity so returned from one
charge is about 2 cwt., even with the most careful workman and
best fused charges.    The examination of the slags is generally
the work of old    men,  which from long practice they do with
astonishing accuracy; nevertheless there are often slags with a
small quantity of copper chemically diffused through the mass
which cannot be detected by the eye, but which may be easily
and quickly tested by the methods described under assaying,
namely, taking a few test-bottles of equal size, containing each
#, 4, ,   , and 1 grain of copper dissolved and converted into
ammoniuret.     A sample of the slag is ground fine, and 100
grains digested at a boiling heat in nitromuriatic acid for about
 15 minutes; a little water is added, and then ammonia in excess,
after which the solution is filtered into a bottle of similar dimen
sions with the others and the colours compared. Should it be
the same as the one containing # grain of copper, then the slag
has } per cent., and so with the others. The careful testing of
the slags in this way, apart from the picking out of the shots,
becomes an important guide to the whole management of the
works.    Imperfect fusion, whether caused by bad coal, bad fur
nace, or bad workmen, never gives a perfect slag ; and that small
causes often produce great and important results, we may illus
trate by the following circumstance. In a work, where the
maximum quantity of copper in the slag allowed to be cast away
was # of a per cent., two furnaces working alongside each other
at the same rate produced what was practically termed clean
slag; but the one contained seldom less than + per cent, the
other seldom above , per cent. They fused 40 tons per week,
producing each about 25 tons slag, being a weekly loss in copper
in the one furnace over the other of nearly £3, equal to the
wages of two first class men. The cause of the difference in this
instance was in the furnace, an imperfection in the draught,
which would not have been observed but for testing the slags.
   Clean slag is and ought to be a primary object to the smelter;
but it often happens that a desire to increase the make of copper
induces a heavy charge being put into the furnace, or the build
ing of larger furnaces, which in    all
                                      the instances    we  have seen
where the slags were tried strictly       by

water to pass through it for a time, it is then removed into a

the caustic state, some of it probably to the metallic condition.

   When a piece of this coarse metal, after being fused with soda
and cooled, is immersed in water, there is a rapid absorption of
water with evolution of heat, and diffusion of a smell of sulphide
of hydrogen, while the mass falls into powder. Immediately
after this absorption, and before disintegrating, the piece of
coarse metal when broken has a brown colour, which, when seen
through a lens, is found to be caused by a reduction of the copper
either to the state of metal or suboxide, probably from the presence
of sodium, which decomposes the water, becoming converted into
soda, while the hydrogen reduces the subsulphuret of copper.
The powder soon turns black by exposure, and now contains
oxide of copper and oxide of iron along with the sulphurets.
The soda in the alkaline water in the tanks is in the caustic state,
with a little undecomposed sulphate, and contains antimony

the best sort; that obtained in the manufacture of nitric acid
from nitrate of soda is better than that procured from common
salt in making soda ash.    The former contains on an average
about 99 per cent. of sulphate, while the latter does not contain
more than 70 per cent., the remainder being common salt, the
presence  of which is deleterious.
   The slag obtained from the fusion of the ores is an important
consideration in a smelting establishment: by referring to the
average composition of the ore, in connexion with the fact that
all the iron and silica goes         form slag,    will

   The slag obtained while making this iron was not exhausted of
oxide of iron, although three equivalents of lime for the silica
present were added as flux.    Such iron is well-suited for the
precipitation of copper from solutions, as described in a former
article, and might be worth the attention of those who adopt
such processes.
   On the surface of slag we have occasionally met with a sili

tary perpetuity       is   1-A1A2Ag:
  The above formulae thus solve every possible contingency that

                 by means          of Tables of Single             and   Joint Lives.                43
can be constructed out of a single set of existing lives, treating
them always as a set, and abstaining, as we have done, from
dividing the set into individuals; and the results are obtained by
merely handling the formulae without the necessity of entering
into any consideration of the various contingencies that may
arise.  Among the more obvious results are the following, which
I presume are well known.     The value of a perpetuity expectant
upon the death of the survivor of a set of lives is
                        l—X(A) +X(AA) –2(AAA) +                                . .   ;
and the value of an annuity for their lives and the life of the
survivor is
               X(A)—X(AA) +X(AAA) — . . ;
the former being, (perpetuity) + (annuities for joint lives in even
combinations)–(annuities for single lives and joint lives in odd
combinations); and the latter being, (annuities for single lives
and joint lives in odd combinations) — (annuities for joint lives
in    even combinations).
      Let us now introduce another set of lives B1, B,       Bm, and                     ...
construct    status out
                 a          them which   of                         to

                                                              is
constructed out       the former set. We have merely
                              of                              find the                   to
probability      the new status being                 given time, and
                      byof

multiply        itthe probability      the old status; and when the

multiplications are performed, change the small letters into large
ones      as
         before.    The same process may        extended    any num  be                  to
ber of coexistent status.
   Thus, suppose we require the value             annuity for the lives
                                                                   of    an

 changing the letters,
                      A1+A2-A1A2-A,B1–A,B1--A1A2B1.
    The complexity       the status only increases the labour
                              of                                  working                 of

    The preceding formulae may be adapted to the case of contin

 it being assumed that the term, as well as the lives, begins to run

 X. On         the Temperaturesof Conductors of Electrical Currents.
                    By Rich ARD ADIE, Esq., Liverpool*.
          experiments which have led to the discussion in the
THEpages      of this Journal between Dr. Tyndall and myself on
the subject of the reduction of temperatures by electricity, took
their origin some nine years ago in an examination       made of                         I
the thermo-electric cross.      remember       I
                                           found it a most diffi       I
cult experiment to explain; and as Dr. Tyndall in his last com
munication in your December Number speaks of the mysterious
action of the outlying arms of this cross, I will briefly detail the
examination I then made; and by doing so       think I shall show           I
that  I have not omitted to vary the currents employed, but, on
the contrary, have gone through the widest possible range of
currents in order to establish the general law of the unequal
heating effect of an electrical current.           In the thermo-electric
cross, this property of electricity heating bars unequally gives
rise to an apparent refrigeration at                             its

required a period of two hours for the temperature of the ther
mometer to coincide with that of the atmosphere. The time
necessary for this purpose having elapsed, a current from a
single pair was passed in the direction DBA.; the thermometer
then rose one degree, and remained stationary there. To break the

rose two degrees above where it had stood while the current was
circulating, at which point it remained until it began to cool

     I regret that  Dr. Tyndall should have spoken of my views of
these   experimental     inquiries as partial; one of the results
obtained should be an answer to that charge, where           have had        I
occasion to establish a     general law, that electricity, of whatever
tension, heats a conductor unequally.        For the rest am willing     I
to abide his decision, or the decision of those who may come
after him, in the matter of the supposed production of cold by
                    I
electricity, for feel confident that the onward progress of science
never will establish such a law; while to M. Peltier, the origi
nator of these inquiries, due honour will be done; and it will
be remembered that when he was experimenting, he had not the
benefit of any previous researches to guide him.
   Although experiment is the only Caesar to whom appeal can
be made in a case of this kind, still there are advantages to be
derived from looking at what may be expected from other known
laws of heat and electricity.         The admirable researches of
Mr. Joule, which have appeared in the pages of this Magazine,
show that the resistance to conduction and the heat developed by
 an electrical current are always in direct proportion; from which
it may be inferred, that where there was no resistance there would
be no heat; and again, if there was absorption of heat, the converse
of resistance should be looked for; what kind of force in a
thermo-electrical joint this can be was the difficulty        have felt       I
in reflecting on the supposed fact of the absorption of heat by
electricity circulating in conductors which resist          passage    its                    in
a  greater     or
               less  degree.

cards crossing, the needles deviated in contrary directions so as to
remain in one straight line, as if they had been rigidly connected.
  To obviate this, for the magnet having        unmarked end pointing             its
south was substituted one   having   its marked end      that direction,                          in

       less power  than that    which the marked end    pointed

would also attract the other, and thus the half cards which they
carried would be caused            cross each other;     tothat the whole                     so

 loses its fitness to be impregnated very soon after it is passed into

fact of penetration to a very positive test beneath the microscope,
and found that the spermatozoon always penetrates at the parts to
which it is applied, and at no other part of the egg, and that a short
time afterwards it may be detected striking into the vitelline mem
brane, by its thicker or body portion, in a line with the point at
which it has entered, and the centre of the yelk, and that he has
usually found eggs so penetrated to have been fertilized and produce
embryos.      Further, that eggs in which no spermatozoa have been
seen in contact with the yelk membrane, have usually been un
fruitful, although numerous spermatozoa have been observed on
their surface.     During his experiments the author had an oppor
tunity of examining some eggs which had been impregnated by the
natural concurrence of the sexes, and then found that these most
fully confirmed the results obtained by artificial impregnation.
 Spermatozoa were observed sticking into the vitelline membrane for
 many hours after the time at which the egg must have been fecun
 dated; which the author believes must be within the first half-hour,
 and perhaps within the first few minutes; as he has sometimes found
 spermatozoa close to the vitelline membrane within one minute after
 they had been supplied to the egg. The spermatozoon invariably
 enters the egg with its thicker or body portion foremost, and passes
 onwards with a direct but slightly serpentine motion, in a centripetal
 direction to the vitelline membrane.       A large proportion of the
 spermatozoa never enter the envelopes of the egg, if they happen to
 come into contact with them laterally, as is frequently the case; they
 then merely adhere to the surface, but do not fecundate.            The
 greatest number penetrate when supplied to the egg within a few
 seconds after removal from the male body, and of the eggs from the
 body of the female.     Some experiments are then detailed which the
 author states arose out of a communication made to him by Mr.
 Busk, F.R.S.     The spermatozoa were narcotized by exposure for
 eight or ten minutes to the vapour of chloroform, and it was then
 found that when in this state, while perfectly motionless, as when
 dead, they did not impregnate.      These experiments, in connection
 with others, seemed to show that the entrance of the spermatozoon
 into the egg is not the result of an endosmic action of the envelopes,
 but is that of the operation of a distinct power in the spermatozoon.
    The nature of the influence of the spermatozoon is then examined.
 The author has endeavoured to put this to the test of experiment,
first, by immersion of eggs, both before, and at the period of fecun
 dation, and during the segmentation of the yelk, in solutions of
 potass; and newt, by reducing the bodies of recently-obtained and
 perfectly active spermatozoa, to a fluid state, by trituration in a
 glass mortar, prepared for the purpose, and then applying the ma
 terials so obtained to the egg immediately it is expelled from the
 female, and before it has been in contact with water; and conse
 quently at the time it is most susceptible of the fecundatory influence.
 The experiments by immersion in potass solution showed that the
  endosmic action of the egg envelopes is exceedingly rapid, as decom
 position of the yelk was commenced in some within three minutes of
 the application of the solution. In very weak solution the result was

different, and appeared to be favourable to the action of the sperma
tozoon. The fluid obtained by trituration of the spermatozoa was
applied to several sets of eggs, but no fecundation of the egg was
effected by it; the yelks, however, became affected, being in some
cases shrivelled and contracted, as when potass solution or decom
posing seminal fluid is applied, thus showing that the substance of
the broken down spermatozoa had passed to the yelk by endosmosis.
These experiments were made at the same time with others made
with portions of the same fluid which had not been triturated, and
in which the spermatozoa were still active. In these instances fe
cundation was constantly effected, so that the conclusion deduced
from these comparative trials was, that fecundation is not the result
simply of the addition of the substance of the body of the sperma
tozoon to the egg, but primarily seems to be due to a force or
dynamic power in the spermatozoon, which is lost when this body
                                                                                            its

    The anatomy and attachments of the stapes are next minutely
described.     The base of this bone, generally stated by writers on
the physiology of the ear as being attached to the margin of the
fenestra ovalis by a simple membrane, ligamentum annulare baseos
stapidis, is shown to possess some points of considerable interest.
 Instead of a simple margin to which the ligament above noticed is
 fixed, the base of the stapes is stated to present a circumferential
 surface for articulation with the fenestra ovalis.  This circumferen
 tial surface, larger at the anterior and posterior extremities than in
 the middle, is covered by articular cartilage.     The surface of the
fenestra ovalis, to which the circumference of the base of the stapes
is applied, is somewhat larger than that of the stapes. It is smooth,
 has a very compact structure, and is not covered by cartilage.
    The base of the stapes is attached to the fenestra ovalis by two
 ligaments.     The inner or vestibular ligament passes from the inner
 margin of the fenestra ovalis to the inner margin of the circumferen
 tial surface of the base of the stapes. The outer one passes from
 the outer margin of the fenestra ovalis to the corresponding margin
 of the stapes. These two circular ligaments leave between them a
 space which may be considered as an articular cavity; this cavity
 always containing a sufficient quantity of fluid to lubricate the arti
 cular surfaces of the bones.
   The movements of the stapes are of two kinds, one being produced
by the action of the tensor tympani, the other by the stapedius
muscle. If the tensor tympani muscle be drawn in the direction of
 itscourse, while the cavity        the vestibule has been exposed
                                                        of                                                                 to

of swallowing; but during the first act, while they were open, air
was forced into the cavity of the tympanum by the contraction of
the muscles of the fauces and pharynx, and the orifices were again
closed, and remained so until the second act of swallowing, which
opened the tube and allowed the air to escape. That the act of de
glutition opens the Eustachian tubes, was inferred also from the cus
tom usually adopted of swallowing while the descent in a diving-bell
is performed; by this act the condensed air is allowed to enter the
tympanum and the sensation of pain and pressure in the ears is
avoided.     The author then proceeds to show that the tensor and
levator palati are the muscles which are attached to and open the
Eustachian tubes in man, and the mode in which they act is pointed
Out.
   The third part of the paper is devoted to the examination of the
Eustachian tube in animals; and the author arrives at the conclusion,
that in Mammalia, Birds, and those reptiles having a tympanic cavity,
the Eustachian tubes, as in man, are closed excepting during muscular
effort.   In some mammalia the muscles opening the tubes are, as in
man, those belonging to the palate; in others the function is per
formed by the superior constrictor of the pharynx. In birds it is
shown that there is a single membranous tube into which the two
osseous tubes open; this membranous tube is situated between, and
intimately adherent to, the inner surface of each pterygoid muscle,
and by which muscles the tube is opened.
   The conclusion respecting the influence of the closed Eustachian tubes
to which the author arrives, is that the function of hearing is best
carried on while the tympanum is a closed cavity; that the analogy
usually cited as existing between the ordinary musical instrument, the
drum and the tympanum, to the effect that in each it is requisite
for the air within to communicate freely with the outer air, is not
correct. The view that the sonorous vibrations of the air in a closed
tympanic cavity are more effective in impressing the membrane of
the fenestra rotunda than when it is open to the outer air, is strength
ened by the performance of the following experiment with the tuning
fork.    If this instrument be made to vibrate by striking it against
a firm  solid, and if the handle be then placed in contact with the
head, the sound at first loud, gradually becomes fainter, and soon
ceases to be heard ; if at the moment that it has ceased to be heard,
a finger be placed over the tragus of one ear, and firmly pressed so
as to close the external meatus from the outer air, the sound of the
tuning-fork is again heard, and continues to be heard for some
seconds; thus showing that the sonorous undulations existing in
the external meatus are not sufficiently powerful to affect sensibly
the membrana tympani until they are wholly confined by the walls
of the tube when closed.
   The leading results arrived at in the paper are as follows:—
   1. That a principal function of the membrana tympani muscles
and ossicles of the tympanum, is to act as the analogue of the iris in
the eye.
   2. That the tensor tympani muscle, by drawing tense the mem
brana tympani, and by compressing at the same time the fluid in the

labyrinth, protects the ear from the injurious influence of very
powerful vibrations.
     3. The stapedius muscle, by slightly relaxing the membrana
tympani and the fluid of the labyrinth, places the ear in a position
to be influenced by vibrations of a most delicate character.
     4. Another function of the membrana tympani is to form part of
 the resonant walls of the closed tympanic cavity.
      5. The guttural orifices of the Eustachian tubes are closed, and the
 tympanic cavities do not communicate with the cavity of the fauces
 excepting during certain muscular actions.
      6. In  man and some mammalia the Eustachian        tubes are opened
 by the muscles of the palate, in other animals by the superior con
 strictor of the pharynx.
      7. In birds there is a membranous tube common to the two
  osseous Eustachian tubes, and this common tube is opened by the
  action of the internal pterygoid muscles.
      8. For the function of hearing to be perfect, it is requisite that
  the tympanic cavity should be closed from the outer air.
      “An Experimental Inquiry undertaken with the view of ascer
  taining whether any, and what signs of current Force are mani
  fested during the organic process of Secretion in living animals"
  (continued). By H. F. Baxter, - Esq. Communicated by R. B. Todd,
  M.D., F.R.S. &c.
      The present communication is a continuation of a series of expe
  riments, the first part of which was published in the Phil. Trans.
  for the year 1848. The object is to show that the changes which
  occur during the organic process of secretion in living animals are
  accompanied with the manifestation of current force; and the prin
  cipal facts upon which this conclusion is founded are the following:—
       1st. It was found that when the electrodes of a galvanometer are
   brought into contact with the secreted product and the venous blood
   flowing from the same organ, an effect upon the needle is produced,
   indicating the venous blood to be positive.    This fact was established
   in the liver, kidneys and mammary gland.
       2ndly. The effect could not be referred to the heterogeneity of the
   fluids without assuming that the blood was acid and combined with
   the secreted product; nor could it be referred entirely to thermo
   electric effects, inasmuch as the current varied in each organ, and
    was capable of traversing a liquid conductor.     The effects, however,
    may be partly due to catalytic actions on the combining power of pla
    tinum; and this last supposition tended to confirm the opinion ori
    ginally entertained by Wollaston, that the changes which occur
    during secretion are analogous to those which take place in the de
    composing cell of a voltaic circle.
       Without giving any definite opinion as to the lungs performing
    the office of a secreting organ, it was found, that when one electrode
    was in contact with the mucous surface, and the other in contact
    with the blood in the pulmonary-veins, an effect occurred upon the
    needle indicating the blood (arterial) to be positive.    This fact ap
    pears to afford some explanation of the failures of Muller, Pouillet
    and of the author in his early attempts to obtain evidence of current

     “On   a new Series of Organic Bodies containing Metals.”      By
Dr. E.    Frankland,  Professor of Chemistry,   Owen's  College,  Man
chester.    Communicated by B. C. Brodie, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author communicates in this memoir the continuation of his
researches, a preliminary announcement of which appeared several
years ago, upon a new series of organic compounds closely allied to
cacodyle in their composition and properties, and which, like that
body, are formed by the union of the alcohol radicals with various
metals, and are distinguished for their powerful electro-positive cha
racter.    These remarkable compounds are procured by the action of
heat or  light upon their proximate constituents, and are thus distin
guished from most other organic compounds of this nature by the
manner of their formation.      The author describes seven of these
compounds.
   Stanethylium.—When iodide of ethyle and metallic tin are exposed
to the influence of heat or light, which is most conveniently done in
sealed glass tubes, the tin gradually dissolves in the ethereal liquid,
which finally solidifies to a mass of colourless crystals.  A quantity
of  gas, comparatively   very small,  is generated  at the same time.
This gaseous product of the reaction proved, on analysis, to be a
mixture of hydride of ethyle and olefiant gas, produced from the de
composition of iodide of ethyle by tin into iodide of tin and ethyle,
which last is transformed at the moment of its liberation into the
two gases just mentioned.      The principal and most important re
action, however, consists in the direct union of tin with iodide of
ethyle, giving rise to a crystalline body which is the iodide of a new
organic radical, stanethylium.
   By double decomposition the other compounds of stanethylium
can be readily formed; the author has prepared and described the
oxide, chloride, bromide and sulphide of stanethylium; these bodies
exhibit a striking resemblance to the corresponding bi-compounds of
tin, but are distinguished from them by a peculiar pungent and irri
tating odour resembling that of the volatile       mustard.        oil

formula of stanethylium is C, H, Sn; that of the oxide C, H, SnO,
and that of the bromide C, H, Sn Br.           Stanethylium therefore per
fectly resembles cacodyle in its reactions, combining directly with
the electro-negative elements, and regenerating the compounds from
which it has been derived.
    Stanmethylium and stanamylium are formed when the iodides of
methyle and amyle respectively are exposed to the action of light in
contact with tin; their salts are isomorphous with those of stanethy
lium, but they have not yet been completely investigated.
    Zincmethylium.—This radical is formed in an uncombined state
when iodide of methyle and zinc are exposed to a temperature of
about 150° C. in a sealed tube; the zinc gradually dissolves with
an evolution of gas, whilst a mass of white crystals and a colourless
mobile liquid refracting light strongly, occupy, after a few hours,
the place of the original materials.          In this reaction two distinct
decompositions take place, viz. the decomposition of iodide of methyle
 by zinc with the production of iodide of zinc and liquid zincmethy
 lium, and the decomposition of iodide of methyle by zinc with the
 formation of iodide of zinc and the gaseous radical methyle.            The
 zincmethylium was obtained pure by distillation in an atmosphere
 of dry hydrogen. Its formula is C, H, Zn, and it possesses the fol
 lowing properties.     It is a colourless, transparent and very mobile
liquid, possessing a peculiar penetrating and insupportable odour,
and boiling at a low temperature. Zincmethylium combines directly
with oxygen, chlorine, iodine, &c., forming somewhat unstable com
pounds.     Its affinity for oxygen is even more intense than that of
potassium ; in contact with atmospheric air it instantaneously ig
nites, burning with a beautiful greenish blue flame, and forming
white clouds of oxide of zinc ; in contact with pure oxygen it burns
with explosion, and the presence of a small quantity of                 its

of this radical, which is formed by the action of sunlight upon iodide
of methyle and metallic mercury.       After an exposure of several days
to sunlight, white crystals begin to form in the liquid, which finally
solidifies to a white crystalline mass; ether dissolves out the new
compound and deposits it perfectly pure by spontaneous evaporation.
    Iodide of hydrargyromethylium       (C, H, HgI) is a white solid,
crystallizing in minute nacreous scales, which are insoluble in water,
moderately soluble in alcohol, and very soluble in ether and iodide
of methyle; it is slightly volatile at ordinary temperatures, and ex
hales a weak but peculiarly unpleasant odour, which leaves a nau
seous taste upon the palate for several days.       At 100° C. the vola
tility is much greater, and the crystals are rapidly dissipated at this
temperature when exposed to a current of air. At 143°C. it fuses
and sublimes without decomposition, condensing in brilliant and ex
tremely thin crystalline plates.     In contact with the fixed alkalies
and ammonia it is converted into oxide of hydrargyromethylium,
which is dissolved by an excess of all these reagents.
    A corresponding compound containing amyle is formed, though
with difficulty, under similar circumstances, but the attempts to form
one containing ethyle have not yet been successful.           Preliminary
experiments have also been made with other metals, amongst which
arsenic, antimony, chromium, iron, manganese and cadmium promise
interesting   results.
    From a review of the composition and habits of all the organo
metallic bodies and their compounds at present known, the author
is of opinion that the view most generally held respecting the con
stitution of cacodyle, according to which that radical is a conjugate
compound consisting of arsenic conjugated with two atoms of methyle,
 and which view must, if true, be applied to all the organo-metallic
bodies, is no longer tenable; and he contends that the behaviour of
 these bodies clearly indicates that they are compounds formed upon
 the type of the oxides of the respective metals, a portion of the oxygeu
 being replaced by the several radicals, methyle, ethyle and amylc;
 the establishment of this new view of their constitution will remove
these bodies from the class of organic radicals, and place them in the
 most intimate relation with ammonia and the bases of Wurtz, Hof
 mann and Paul Thenard; indeed the close analogy between stibethine
 and ammonia first suggested by Gerhardt, has been most satisfac
 torily demonstrated by the behaviour of stibethine with the haloid
 compounds of methyle and ethyle.        Stibethine furnishes us therefore
 with a remarkable example of the law of symmetrical combination,
 and shows that the formation of a five-atom group from one con
 taining three atoms can be effected by the assimilation of two atoms,
 either of the same or of opposite electro-chemical        character: this
 remarkable circumstance suggests the following question.           Is this
 behaviour common also to the corresponding compounds of arsenic,
 phosphorus and nitrogen, and can the position of each of the five
  atoms with which these elements respectively combine be occupied
  indifferently by an electro-negative or an electro-positive element?
  This question, so important for the advance of our knowledge of the
  organic bases and their congeners, cannot now long remainunanswered.

  “On    the Dentate Body of the Cerebellum.” By William Brinton,
M.D. Communicated by R. B. Todd, M.D., F.R.S. &c.
   The corpus dentatum has generally been described and recognised
as a wavy line or lamina of grey matter, which is seen in certain
sections of the crus of the cerebellum, and contains fibres apparently
derived from the restiform body, and the processus e cerebello ad
testes.   Reil's account, with some vague and conflicting details, gives
it a more definitely tubular form, although he is apparently not cer
tain of the continuity of                       its
                                 upper and lower layers posteriorly.
   The author    explains  these somewhat varying descriptions          the                                           by

this reason no correction was made on temperatures below 100° in
Chart No. 2, where indeed it could hardly be perceptible.                                    Al
though of little practical importance, this difference, if it exists,
cannot safely be neglected in theoretical researches, inasmuch as
the value of a degree of the mercurial thermometer must in such
case be a variable quantity, differing in the ratio of 23 to 24 from
100° C. to 0°.
    Having at last obtained satisfactory proof of the existence and
amount of the correction between 0° and 100°, he has thought it of
sufficient importance to give a detailed account of the method em
ployed to extract the required evidence from M. Regnault's obser
vations on the tension of low pressure steam.
    As the law of density, illustrated in Chart No. 2, has clearly re<U+017F>er
 ence to the air-thermometer, if a series of observations were perfectly
correct, they must perfectly exhibit this difference—if it really exists
—when projected on the chart; because the divergence from the
line that joins the points at 0° and 100° must exactly correspond
with the correction required at the intermediate temperatures.                In
 short, the line of density would appear as a curve slightly concave
towards the axis, and if the proper correction were made on the
temperatures, that curve would be converted into a straight line.
This view is illustrated by a sketch, in which the curvature is pur
posely much exaggerated.           In this a straight line is drawn, as the
 gradient of density, and in which the points range if the tempe
 ratures are by the air-thermometer.            This line is inclined to the
 axis a of  temperature,    at an  angle   of which h is the cotangent (see

   It is remarked that the differences in the first table show a distinct
   curvature with reference to the chord; while in the second table the
   accordance with the straight line is as perfect as could be expected.
      With the view of bringing these facts out into higher relief and
   presenting the deflection to the eye on a scale that should at once
   be relatively correct and very highly magnified, the author computed
   six values of h from the observations at 90° and 100°, at 80° and
   100°, &c., without correcting the temperatures, by the formula

   The difference between h at 50° in the two tables being 1733, a
straight line is drawn from the point corresponding to 100°, making
an angle of 17°33, with the chord for 50° in the uncorrected tem
peratures; and lines are drawn from the same point making angles
1°38, 1° 15, 0°-68, &c. with this line, the intersections of which
with the distances or chords corresponding to the temperatures,
give the points which represent on the same magnified scale, the
observations with the temperatures corrected.       The author remarks
that the line joining these points represents the empirical law of
density, and that its relation to the standard right line for the tem
perature 50° is precisely what might be expected to subsist between
the empirical and true curve of tension.    It intersects that line—and
intersection, not contact, is the character of empirical formulae—at
50°, 75°, and 100°, and at intermediate temperatures diverges from
it to the extent of about ºth of a degree at the maximum.
   Thus, he states, M. Regnault's observations between 50° and 100°
afford a distinct answer to the inquiry in the affirmative, and it seems
no longer possible to doubt that there is a difference between the
mercurial and air-thermometers below 100°; and that its amount
does not sensibly differ from the formulae that embrace MM. Dulong
and Petit's standard observations.     He annexes these formulae in a
combined form    adapted  to the Centigrade  scale.

but this can only be done approximatively, as in the following:
     If      accuracy is required, the rule is to find t, from tº by
          greater
(2), then substitute it in (l), and compute tº ; this compared with
the true value shows the alteration to be made in tº to obtain its
true value.
     In conclusion the author observes, it might be expected, without
reference to theory, that the curve deduced from the uncorrected
temperatures should not show, in its continuation above 100, any
abrupt divergence from      its
                             regular course; nevertheless from 100°                               to

ammonio-sulphate of copper for blue, sulphuric tincture of roses for
red, and water with a little nitric acid for white. The vessels con
 taining these solutions stood on a shelf about 12 feet from the
 ground, and had free sunshine through the day.            In the first place,
five test-tubes containing a strong solution of permanganate of pot
 ash were placed respectively in the five rays. The order of decom
position was blue, red, white, green, yellow. The two first were
 nearly colourless on the third day, and on the seventh, when opened
 and tested, contained no manganese in solution. The white and
 green were not entirely decomposed till the twenty-second day, and
 the yellow after eight weeks still contained much permanganic acid.
 In order to determine what was the effect of free contact with the
 atmosphere upon actinic decompositions, two tubes containing solu
 tion of permanganate, the one sealed, the other open, were fixed in
 phials of the ammonio-sulphate of copper, and cemented to the necks
 so as to prevent the escape of ammoniacal fumes.             In about eight
 hours the solution in the sealed tube had become colourless, whilst
 the other retained a deep red tinge.         Peroxide of mercury exposed
 to blue    light  in a sealed tube was much blackened in four days,
 whilst a similar portion in an open tube was not affected. Periodide
 of mercury (prepared by trituration) in sealed tubes and dry gave
 the following order of action,-blue, red, white, green, yellow ;
 the action of the two latter rays being hardly perceptible, and pos
 sibly due to small portions of blue and red light which had not been
 absorbed by the solutions. In unsealed vessels the action was rather
 less rapid. Covered with water, the iodide was not affected by any
 of the rays. This salt is far more stable than is generally asserted.
 The sample used in these experiments had been kept for ten years
 in diffused light without any alteration, and even in the blue ray an
 exposure of several weeks was required to produce any great effect.
 Periodide obtained by precipitation seemed rather less stable.
     Iodide of starch, perfectly dry, gave the following order:-
 blue, red, white, yellow, green.        The decomposition under the two
 latter   rays  was  very slow and   imperfect.    When moist, the iodide
 was bleached far more       rapidly  than when   dry;  more rapidly also in
  open than in closed tubes. Perchloride of mercury was acted on as
  follows:—blue, red, white, green. The yellow ray caused no per
  ceptible formation of protochloride. This substance, under the blue
  ray, gives false results if not perfectly screened from ammoniacal
  vapours. Peroxide of mercury gave blue, red (considerable), white,
 green, yellow (very slight). Alcoholic tincture of the green colouring
  matter of leaves was decomposed very rapidly, and almost simulta
  neously in     allthe rays; apparent order, white, red, yellow, green,
  blue.    Alcoholic sulphocyanide          iron gave—white, blue, yellow,

audible when the hand was removed.

        will first find the intensities of these emergent rays, and
compare them.
   A cylindrical pencil of parallel rays falling on the drop of
rain will emerge through an element of the surface of the drop,
of dimensions different to those of the element through which it
passed on entering; and the pencil will emerge, in the general
case, not parallel, but diverging, both in the plane of the paper
and at right angles to that plane.      It will be necessary to cal
culate this in order to find the   intensity of the emerging light.

pend upon the size of the drops of rain, although the width of
the primary bow is independent of this. The larger the drops
of rain, the closer are the bows; and therefore under some cir
cumstances the bows may be so close together, that at points
within the primary bow, the mixture of colours may be such as
to make the bows invisible.    This may account for the fact, that
the supernumerary bows are not always seen accompanying the
primary bows.

the transverse motion which                           we   have      just considered.                Also the

against it; one drawn from analytical, and the other from phy

making pro hac vice the hypothesis that the increment of elasti
city varies at each instant from point to point, and is exactly
proportional to the increment of density. A theory of this kind,
resting on hypotheses, ought to have no weight against a course
of reasoning which deduces the velocity of sound exclusively
from hydrodynamical principles.
   From what has now been proved, it appears that the velocity
(W), so far as it is independent of any arbitrary disturbance, may
for small motions be expressed by the function

it   follows that the condensation (a)                            is   at   the same time expressed

an   initial disturbance of finite extent be composed of normal
vibrations.
    In the other class of disturbances the velocity is given at given
positions in successive instants, and the condensation is to be
inferred from the given circumstances of the disturbance.        The
fluid may be conceived to be set in motion by the surface of a
solid, and to be either unlimited in extent, or to be confined
within solid boundaries. The motion in such cases is constrained,
and may be conceived to be composed of parts of the normal
motions for which m, X, and c are constant only for an indefi
nitely small time and through an indefinitely small space.
   In the application of these principles to the undulatory theory
of light, the initial disturbances appear to be of the first class,
and not to be immediately or necessarily due to the motion of a
solid; the motion contiguous to an axis of propagation, which
is analytically distinguished by satisfying exactly the integra
bility of uda.--vdy--wdz, is the exponent of a ray of light; and
the direct vibrations, and the parts of the transverse vibrations
remote from the axis, must be supposed to be incapable of pro
ducing the sensation of light.
   Before proceeding to apply the above results to an instance of
arbitrary disturbance of the fluid, the circumstances of uniform
rectilinear propagation in cases of constrained motion are first to
be investigated.

It is again to be remarked, that as these equations contain arbi
trary functions, they can apply only to the arbitrary disturbance,
the denominators having no reference to the law of variation of
the velocity and condensation with the distance, but to the pro
portion of the two parts of which the velocity, each moment that
it is impressed, consists. When W is given as a function of t,
the two parts of the velocity are found by the solution of a
common differential equation, of which the variables are the
function          f

                   to remark, that the previous general solution
accords with this solution on giving a particular form to the
arbitrary functions, and that the change of the relation between
the velocity and condensation in passing from free to constrained
motion is confirmed.
     Ifthe fluid were put in motion by a smooth solid sphere
moving in it in a given manner, the velocity impressed at each
point of the surface at any instant would be known. The direc
tions of the impressed velocities determine the directions of the
initial propagations, and as we found in the general considera
tion of the mutual action of the parts of the fluid no other than
rectilinear propagation, it follows that the initial direction of
propagation continues to                                all
                                  distances from the centre.       The
motion will therefore       the same for   indefinitely

form, if the thermal capacity of each part of the body be inde
pendent of the temperature, in the following manner.     Let the
temperature of the body be measured according to an absolute
scale, founded on the values of Carnot's function, and expressed
by the following equation,

108         Mr. W.   J. M. Rankine    on the General      Law of
in the formula (1), which is transformed from the actual to the
potential form in consequence of the change of state dW.
    The sum of those three quantities is as follows:
                                              d2U
                  d.Q=(1+D20+Q.              iv.      . d.V. .  .   . (2)
    If from this expression be subtracted the potential energy
developed, that is to say, given out in overcoming resistance,
                                d'U
                                     dV,
                                7W
the result will be the algebraical sum of the energies, actual and
potential, acquired on the whole by the substance in passing
from the total actual energy Q and state W to the total actual
energy Q+ d0 and state V+ dV; viz.
                d'U                             d         dU

    Now this quantity must be the same, whether the change d0
or the change d'V be made first, or both simultaneously; other
wise by varying the order of making those changes, the sum of
energy in the universe, actual and potential, might be changed,
which is impossible.      Therefore the above expression must be
the   complete  differential of a funetion of the energy Q and state
V;    that is to say,

f'(Q)    being a function of Q only, to be determined by experi
ment, of which f(Q) is the primitive.
    Thus we obtain, for the total energy, actual and potential,
 acquired by the substance, in consequence of the changes of
total actual energy from Q to Q+ d0, and of state, from V to
W+ dV, the formula

            Mr. W.          J.   M. Rankine      on the General          Law of
 are, the nature and value of the function                      f(Q) for      each      kind of
 actual                of
                            # for each        kind of potential energy, and of
 #
    2     energy
          and                          combination by pairs of an actual with a
               #. for each
potential energy.
    (5.) Abstract and metaphysical as the principles and reasoning
of this paper may appear, they are of immediate practical utility.
   When applied to the mutual transformation of visible motion
with the power arising from attractive and repulsive forces, the
equation 3 becomes identical.
   It is in the theory of those forms of energy which manifest
themselves to us only by their effects, such as heat and elec
tricity, that this law becomes useful. It enables us, when power
is produced by the consumption of one or more of those energies,
to analyse the effect produced, to refer each portion to the kind of
energy by which it is caused, and thus to determine how much
of any given kind of energy must disappear in order to produce
a given change in the condition of a substance.
   An important consequence of the formula (1) is as follows:—
If the    tendency,
                            #. of the     state W to increase             is proportional
simply to the actual energy present, Q, then
                                    d’U__l             d'U.
                                   dOdV     T Q dV’
and consequently
                                        d2U
                                   Q
                                       d(\dW
                                                  dV= dU;            .   .    .    .    .    (5)
that is to say, when the tendency to the production of potential
energy is simply proportional to the actual energy present, then is
the actual energy converted into potential energy the ea act equiva
lent of the whole potential energy produced.
   (6.) Another important consequence of the formulae (1) and
(3) is as follows:—If a substance be made to undergo a change
of condition, and be brought back to                     its
                                             primitive condition                              by
a   process not the exact reverse      the former process, then will

between the actual and     potential  forms.   That the   permanent
conversion from the actual          the potential form may

have found that they indicate that perfect gases possess an elas
ticity, independent of heat, corresponding to that due to about
2°1 of the Centigrade thermometer; that is to say, that the

above the absolute zero of a perfect gas-thermometer, or 27.2%%
Centigrade below the freezing-point.

during the period of receiving heat from without ;
  Q, the total heat during the period of emitting heat;
   H, the whole heat received;
   H2 the whole heat emitted; so that
   Hi–H2 is the useful effect of the engine, or the heat perma
mently converted into expansive power; then the proportion of

down as   experimental data be rigorously correct, electrical actual

                                         of

   By developing this argument,       we generally   as   practice,                 do      in
the latent reductio ad absurdum becomes manifest.
   Since the extremities       the bases BC and EF coincide, the
                                         of

                                                     if                                                     :
according     the tenth axiom, two right lines cannot enclose
                to
space, but here two right lines                         do      enclose      a    space, which              is a
absurd.   In the same manner                        it   can be shown that                       EF    could
not fall below BC; and             cannot fall either above
                                         as   it                                                 or   below,

 130            Mr.     J.   P. Hennessy on             some      Facts connected
  parallel lines maybe deduced, is certainlyas obvious as that towhich
  he improperly gave the title of axiom. The numerous attempts
  which have been made to supersede his theory have generally
  been met by two objections,—(1), that the subsequent demon
  strations are much more complex, (2) and full of embarrassing
  reductio ad absurdum.        These are put forward by Dr. Lardner
  very clearly; he says, “When you have once admitted Euclid's
  axiom,  all his theorems flow from that and his definition,              the                          as
 most simple and obvious inferences.                   other theories, after
                                                                    In
 conceding         an
                    axiom much further removed from self-evidence
 than Euclid's,       labyrinth

 stration remains            to threaded,

    It  will presently          be
                             seen that the demonstrations         propose                 I                  to
 give are not open             to

Archimedes and Plato.             Now M.      Legendre    has adopted the
 definition   of   straight line given
                   a                                        by

 shortest distance between        any two  points;    but     has not taken         he
Archimedes' definition                plane surface, which
                                            of   a                    exactly                 is
 similar:     inthis case            he
                              has substituted for Euclid's the    following,
attributed      toHero:-‘A plane surface such that the right line
joining every two points which can                   assumed uponbe is   lies                          it
entirely  in   the surface.” This definition has received the unani
mous approbation               of
                           modern geometers, even those most conser
vative   of  Euclid's arrangement.               not this, however, which

but the more important fact, that every other definition                have                       I
seen was either            utility

that such definition         better than Euclid's Xth axiom, which                                           is

given    by  Mr. Mill”,       tracing deductive truths        their original        to
inductive foundation.         He proves the fifth proposition from first
principles      bysix formulae, the third        which      “straight lines

   The following are the direct demonstrations of the twenty
seventh and twenty-ninth propositions, which flow from the
definition of parallel lines have given.    I
                     If
   XXVII. a line intersect two right lines
and make the alternate angles equal to each
other, these right lines are parallel.      DCB
and ECB are equal to two right angles, but
the former is equal to ABC, therefore ABC
and ECB are equal to two right angles;
therefore (def.) AB and CD are parallel.
   XXIX. If a right line intersect two parallel right lines it makes
the alternate angles equal. (In the same figure) ABC and ECB
are equal to DCB and ECB; therefore ABC and DCB are equal.
   IV. Having assumed the definition which suggest, a direct                   I
demonstration immediately occurs: this is so obvious that a
proof is unnecessary.
   The fact that this proposition is proved indirectly, and that
such a form of proof only can be given to        unless    alteration    it,       an
similar      to

   It is well known how much labour has been bestowed by geometers
on the solution of Kepler's Problem, and what complicated results
have been obtained for the coefficients in the expression for the
Equation of the Center.     I have lately found a new solution of this
problem, which differs strikingly from former solutions in this respect,
that it leads to an unexpectedly simple law of coefficients.     It is as
follows:—
   Let g be the mean anomaly;
          º be the angle of excentricity;
          i   be any positive integer number.

Esq.
     § I. On the existence  of Current Force in the Muscular Tissues.
    After  relating   the conclusions arrived at by Matteucci in refer
ence to the       origin  of the muscular current, the author endea
voured to obtain more direct evidence by forming a circuit between
the muscular tissue and the venous blood; the effects however were
but slight, they nevertheless indicated the tissue and the venous blood
to be in opposite electric states. The results of the experiments
tend to confirm the inferences of Matteucci.
     § II. On the existence of Current Force in the Nervous Tissues.
    After referring to the results obtained by Pacinotti, Puccinotti
 Matteucci, and Du Bois Reymond, experiments are related in which
it is  shown that if one electrode be inserted into the substance of the
brain, and the other be brought into contact with the blood flowing
from the internal jugular vein, an effect upon the needle occurs in
 dicating the blood to be positive; an effect also was easily obtained
 if the latter electrode was placed in contact with any other part of
 the animal, such as the muscles.          Reasoning from the results
 obtained, combined with physiological evidence, it was considered
 that they tend to establish the conclusion that the effects are due to
 the changes which occur during the organic process of assimilation
 or nutrition.
    4.  “On    the Theory of Waves.”       By Andrew John Robertson,
Esq.
    #he author remarks that in the seventh volume of the Cambridge
 Philosophical Transactions, Mr. Earnshaw has a paper on the Ma
thematical Theory of the Waves of Translation, and that the objection
to the theory therein given has been pointed out by Professor Stokes
in a Report to the British Association, namely, that it requires a
 mathematically     sudden generation  and destruction  of motion.  Pre
viously to his having an opportunity of reading Mr. Earnshaw's
paper he had considered the subject in a manner entirely different
(Phil. Mag. Dec. 1850, March 1851). The analysis he then em
ployed was not however such as to lead to results sufficiently general,
and he has in consequence now employed a higher analysis, in the
 application of which he acknowledges himself indebted to Mr. Earn
 shaw's paper for considerable assistance.
    Taking the results deduced by Mr. Scott Russell from his expe
rimental inquiry as the basis of his investigation, the author assumes,
—1st, that the horizontal motion, produced by the passage of a
wave, in every particle of any vertical column is the same; and
 2nd, that the velocity of transmission is uniform. On these prin
 ciples he deduces the value of c, the velocity of transmission,
                           •=G+ºv/º:
 in which   h  is the depth of undisturbed waters; 2k is the height of
 a positive and the depth of a negative wave; and g the accelerating

force of gravity.   Hence it appears that the velocity is greater for a
positive than for a negative wave in the same channel.
   Comparing this result with Mr. Scott Russell's experiments, it
appears that on fourteen experiments of positive waves, the total
error is 3% per cent. on the sum of         the velocities; and that   all                                                    on
sixteen experiments     negative  waves,of
                                         the error   scarcely per cent.                 is                2
    on
    the sum               of      all
                     the velocities.  The author infers that       may                                          it
therefore     safely be
                      considered that the    experiments   bear out the
theory, which shows that the positive and negative waves are phe
nomena      the same class, and not distinct,
                of                                  maintained by Mr.                as

But if the vertical motion were at its greatest when the horizontal
motion was destroyed, the particles would oscillate in both directions,
and a disturbance once given would continue until friction or
external force destroyed                             it.

the above-named organs with the vital or organic changes which
take place in them.
   In consequence of the secondary actions which occur at the elec
trodes some difficulty is experienced in ascertaining the true or
normal result in the roots.   Combining however the facts obtained
by means of the galvanometer with analogical evidence, the author
considers that they tend to establish the conclusion, that, during the
changes which occur in the leaves and in the roots of plants, current
electricity is manifested.
  2.   “On      the   relation of Cardioids to Ellipses.”    By Joseph
Jopling, Esq.
   The object of this communication is to point out the relation of
Cardioids to Ellipses, and that the former as well as the latter are
related to and deducible from the cone.
   The author remarks that the motions of the common trammel show
most beautifully the mechanical relation of ellipses and cardioids, and
that they are thus reciprocals of each other; that an ellipse, as is
well known, is a plane section, or a projection of a plane section of a
cone upon any other plane, the limits being the circle and the right
line; and a cardioid is also a projection from a cone; the difference
being that the cardioid is obtained from a curved section, formed by
the intersection of a sphere or other curved solid with a cone.
   After referring to properties of the sections of cones by spheres
depending on the magnitude of the vertical angles of the cone, the
author states that these and many other new curves, their relations,
and new properties of the cone and the sphere are made most clearly
manifest, and numerous practical results are very readily obtained by
the application of a double scale of sines to the rays of the cone—
distributed equally on the plan—correspondingly on the elevation, and
on the developed surface, or on any other projection of the cone.
   He considers that it is of great importance that some method
should be devised to give appropriate names to these new curves,
especially those so evidently and intimately related to old ones.
Thus the curved intersection of a cone and a sphere, from which the
cardioid is projected on the base, and which has then the cusp turned
symmetrically inwards, by another projection on a vertical plane
gives a symmetrical line with the cusp turned outwards, having
other distinct points of change in the curvature.
   As ellipses are related to cardioids, so it is stated are hyperbolas
in a similar way related to conchoids; conchoids to their mechani
cal reciprocals; and parabolas to cissoids; amongst the vast number
of curves, any of which can conveniently be derived by scales prac
tically from the cone.
   By this method it is considered that not only projections of curved
sections of cones, spheres, &c. are obtained with ease, but also by
means of scales, ruled papers, hollow cones and diagrams, the plane
sections of cones, and      projections from them are greatly facilitated.

      paper was read, entitled “On the Solution of Urinary Calculi
        A
in dilute Saline Fluids, at the temperature of the body, by the aid of
Electricity.” By H. Bence Jones, M.D., F.R.S., Physician to St.
George's Hospital.
   In 1848 the author first attempted to dissolve calculi in a solution
of nitrate of potash, by placing them at the same time between the
electrodes of a galvanic battery; an effect was produced on the uric
acid at the negative pole, but no very decided result was obtained.
The experiments were resumed during the last summer.
   The results with uric acid calculi may be thus arranged. The
action was chiefly at the negative electrode.

 means in the same time.     Still, if the stone consists of oxalate with
 urate, from one to two grains may be dissolved in an hour; and if it
 consists of oxalate with phosphate, from four and a half to five and a
 half grains can be taken away in that time.
    These results may be obtained with calculi which have been long
 removed from the bladder, and have been dried at 212°.
    MM. Prevost and Dumas in 1823 proposed to treat calculi by the
 galvanic pile. By means of the mechanical action of the mixed gases
 evolved by decomposing water, they found that phosphatic calculi
 might be disintegrated.     The chemical action of the substances
 evolved by galvanic action on the surface of calculi was not deter
 mined by them.
  Jan. 6, 1853.-A paper was read, entitled “On Molecular Influ
ences. Sect. I. Transmission of Heat through Organic Structures.”
By John Tyndall, F.R.S.
  In this paper the author has examined the influence exerted by
 the molecular structure of wood upon the passage of heat through
 the substance.     Finding the usual modes of determining the con
 ductivity of bodies inadequate to his purpose, he has been led to
 the construction of a new instrument which is capable of indicating
 very slight differences of transmissive power.
   A cubical space is cut out of the centre of a rectangular slab of
mahogany.      The same slab holds a thermo-electric pair of bismuth
and  antimony,    which are fixed in trenches cut out to receive them.
The junction of the pair (which is of a V-shape) abuts from one of
the faces of the cubical space just mentioned; the end of a wooden
slider forms the opposite boundary of the cubical space, and against
this end a platinum wire, bent several times up and down so as to
form a kind of micrometer-grating,        is laid and imbedded in the
wood. A small      projection of ivory abuts at each side of the bismuth
and antimony junction, and from one projection to the other a thin
membrane is drawn, thus enclosing a space in front of the junction,
which is filled with mercury.       Two similar projections jut at the
sides of the micrometer-grating, and across from one projection to
the other, a second membrane is stretched, thus enclosing another
chamber in front of the wire. This chamber is also filled with mer
cury, and against the wire a thin plate of mica is cemented, thus
preventing       all
                contact between the two metals. From the free ends
of the bismuth and antimony bars wires proceed            delicate galva

being brought closely            up
                             against the cube, the latter         claspedis

where the object is to detect minute differences of molecular action.
The protruding ends of the micrometer-wire are united to the poles
of a small galvanic battery, and the wire is heated by the passage of
the current; the heat is transmitted through the film of mica to the
mass of mercury in front, which thus becomes the source of heat
immediately applied to the face of the cube.        The current is per
mitted to circulate through the bent wire for 60 seconds. During
this time the heat passes from the face of the cube in contact with
the source to the opposite face; the quantity transmitted to the
opposite face at the end of a minute, will of course depend on the
conductivity of the body in the given direction.       This quantity is
measured by          its
                   effect upon the galvanometer.

tions of Planets.   By M. Encke. Translated into English and illus
trated with Notes   by  G. B. Airy, Esq., Astronomer Royal.
   The main object of the author is to supply an easy and accurate
method of computing the perturbations of the various small planets
revolving between Mars and Jupiter, the number of which is con
stantly increasing from fresh discoveries.   The method, however, is
applicable to any of the other bodies of the planetary system.
   Let t denote the time from which it is proposed to compute the
action of the disturbing body.     By a slight transformation the dif
ferential equations of the motion of the disturbed planet are reduced
to the following form : —

     1.   It   proceeds from the fundamental                                             equations            of    motion              bya

series of arithmetical operations of extreme simplicity, only a few
analytical expressions of by no means a complicated character being
employed in the computation.
   2. It affords the means of immediately correcting the quantities
employed in computing the disturbing forces for each successive                                              in
terval, and thereby leads rapidly to results of great accuracy.
   3. Since the perturbations of r, y, z are of the same order as
those of the polar coordinates, they serve to afford unequivocal
indication of the extent to which the intervals of quadrature ought
to be diminished.    It is well known that the method of the varia
tion of constants may assign enormous perturbations to the elements,
while at the same time the actual perturbations may be very in
significant.
   The original researches of M. Encke on this subject are contained
in Nos. 791, 792, and 814 of the Astronomische Nachrichten.        It
may be mentioned that a similar method had been already proposed
by Mr. G. P. Bond, of Cambridge, U.S. M. Encke, however, did
not become acquainted with this circumstance until he had completed
his investigation.

The construction of the equatoreal enabled me to keep the same
points of the disc steadily fixed on the pile, as far as it was neces
sary to obtain an invariable deflection of the needle of the galvano
meter, and the position of the points of the sun, under examination,
was readily deduced from the reading of the declination circle.
There is no need to observe that all extraneous radiation was pre
vented by large screens, supported by the telescope itself, and the
turning dome was only opened as far as it was necessary to intro
duce solar rays on the object-glass.  The telescope has 1*25 focal
length, and 77* aperture.
   “Now these are the results obtained in sundry experiments:—
1. The heat of the solar image is at the centre almost twice as
great as at the borders.   This is found to be true, examining the
diameters both in right ascension and declination.          2. The maxi
mum of temperature did not appear to be at the centre, but above
it,   in   point distant from
           a                        about        geocentric declination.

of lunar mountains are seen visibly parallel to the alignement of the
craters: this fact also is like that which we observe on the earth;
indeed, the large Italian volcanic chain follows the line of the Apen
nines along this country.
   “The second class of lunar volcanoes are those which have their
outside edges elevated above the surrounding plane; their form is
generally regular, and not broken, as those of the preceding class,
and the ground around them is elevated in a radiating disposition,
as is visible around Tycho, Copernicus, Aristotle, &c.         The regu
larity of their forms suggests that the ejected matter was not dis
turbed by the motion of waves, and, consequently, that they were
atmospherical volcanoes, like those of the Monti Laziali, Albani, and
Tusculani, at the south-east of Rome; the want of breach in the
craters seems to indicate that no lava, but only scoriae and loose mat
ters, have been ejected.      The disposition of the soil around them
suggests the opinion that they are of a comparatively later epoch,
and formed after the crust of the satellite was pretty resistent, and
was capable of being elevated        round   all great effort.by  a  sin                    It is
gular, indeed, that this radiation                 of

"having modern volcanoes following the direction of the higher edges
 of their chains. Professor Ponzi seems to think it unquestionable
 that water existed at the surface of the moon; the fierce glare of the
 sunshine is not able to melt the ice there, which is probably at the
 temperature of the planetary spaces; just as the sun at the surface
 of the earth is not able to melt our glaciers, which yet possess a cer
 tainly higher temperature.    Cold, and other unknown causes, may
 have absorbed and fixed all the atmosphere which anciently existed,
 as we see that the immense atmosphere which anciently surrounded
 the earth has been fixed by several chemical processes and reduced to
 its actual composition; and it might be possible that this actually
 existing atmosphere of ours should be all solidified, either by cold or
 chemical processes, if the earth arrives at the same degree of cold
 which seems to have place on the moon.
    “These are some of the conclusions to which we have arrived in
our inquiry into the solar and lunar constitution; they do not cer
tainly belong to astronomy strictly taken, but a recreation from
more serious occupations may be excused to astronomers dwelling
in the pure climate of Italy. I trust you will receive them as a
token of my gratitude, and of interest for the work which you have
published.”
   In a later letter Professor Secchi tells Captain Manners “that
the observatory of the Collegio Romano is about to be furnished
with a large refractor equatoreally mounted.      The refractor will
have 9 inches aperture, and a focal length of 14 French feet.”
There is only a little hesitation at present as to the best mode of
mounting this telescope.
    Since the date of the preceding communication, Sig. Secchi has
made the following interesting experiments on the heat emitted by
different parts of the solar disc. It appeared from the former experi
ments that the heat increased from the margin of the solar disc to
the centre; but there was this peculiarity, that when it was mea
sured in the direction of the axis of the sun’s rotation, it attained
its maximum intensity at a point situate about 3' above the centre.
At the time when the former experiments were made, the projection
of the sun's equator upon his disc passed above his centre, at a di
stance agreeing almost exactly with the position of maximum tem
perature; whence the conclusion naturally suggested itself to Sig.
Secchi, that the equatoreal regions of the sun are intrinsically hotter
than the other parts of his surface.    He justly remarked, that if this
were   true, it ought to follow that in the month of June, when the
nodes   of the solar equator pass through the earth, the upper and
lower hemispheres should appear equally heated; and on the other
hand, in the month of September, when the projection of the solar
equator attained     itsgreatest depression, the point    of
                                                           maximum
temperature should fall below the centre

                                              the disc. Experiments
similar  to  those previously undertaken     him have served    tocon
firm, this view of  the subject.  “In the month   ofAugust the upper
hemisphere appeared little hotter than the lower, but the differences,

always very small, were not unfrequently negative,        In September
the lower hemisphere    appeared decidedly the hotter of the two. The
maximum difference rather exceeded 2° (by the galvanometer), being
almost identical with the result obtained in the month of March in
the opposite direction.    Moreover, this maximum occurred from the
14th to the 16th September, which also corresponds with the epoch
of the greatest depression of the solar equator.”
   Sig. Secchi remarks, that the influence of the solar spots upon
the temperature is very striking.     Sometimes a spot which did not
occupy more than Tºwth of the aperture of the pile, caused the tem
perature to fall 3°, or about                  ºth
                                    of the whole intensity. He found,
however, by isolating the spot with a diaphragm, that it exercises a
sensible influence even in the obscure part.

I FEEL      some difficulty in writing this note, and yet I think it
     requisite to say a closing word upon a subject which has
already occupied too much of your space. It is nearly ten years
since Mr. Adie made his experiments: would not a careful repeti

reliance upon results which have such a mass of scientific evidence
against them      With regard to his theory of the metallic cross”, I

     The immortal Berthollet, to whom we are indebted for the doc
  trine of chemical statics, was the first who considered the cause of
  chemical action under this point of view.        He was led theoretically
  to  express  the influence of masses in the form of a law which still
 retains the name he gave to             and       endeavoured       it,

                   RESEARCHES ON THE DENSITY OF SULPHUR.
                            BY CHARLES BRAME.
   The author gives the final results of his recent labours in the
following terms:—
    1. The specific gravities of the different varieties of sulphur, or of
its different molecular conditions hitherto adopted, do not agree
together, not merely for the different forms, but likewise for each
one in particular, and the limits of these discrepancies extend beyond
those of any possible errors of observation.         The differences are
caused as much by foreign bodies present in the sulphur employed,
as by the various circumstances under which any particular mole
cular form of sulphur had been obtained, or by the influence of phy
sical agents upon         The limits  it.  variation appear      of   com                           to       be
prised between 1:87         19319, the lowest density
                                            or                 the viscous                     of
sulphur, and 2:0757, the highest density which has been observed                                                          in
native crystallized sulphur. However,         appears that the maximumit
density     sulphur may rise        high                2:09, and perhaps
           2° of
                                              2:08     as             as            or
even to            1.

       ON THE OCCURRENCE         OF GOLD IN PENNSYLVANIA.
                 BY CHARLEs M. WETHERILL, PH.D.
  In the spring of 1851, an earth was given to me for examination,
of which the locality was not exactly stated but which was said to
have been taken not far from the city, in which gold was detected.
The earth was said to have been obtained in digging a well. Several
months later, while in Reading, I met with a notice in a German
newspaper of that place, which stated that some time previously an
earth had been found in digging a well, upon the land of Mr. Yoder,
Franconia Township, Montgomery county, which proved, upon
examination,  to contain gold.    I have no doubt but that this is
the locality of the earth which I examined.           Several rocks from
the neighbourhood were analyzed, consisting of clay slate rock,
ferruginous quartz, decayed in places, containing pyrites and mag
netic oxide of iron-sand. In most of these gold was detected in
traces.    Some specimens contained no gold whatever.          The earth
from the well, which was more particularly examined, consisted of
sand and gravel, coating in some places fragments of shale or other
rock. A careful examination of these with the lens detected a rather
thick spangle of gold adhering to the gravel, and a small rounded
mass of a white malleable metal, which proved by a micro-chemical
investigation upon half of it to be native tin, which occurs only,
according to Dana, in small grayish-white metallic grains along with
Siberian gold. It melted before the blowpipe, was oxidized by nitric
acid, the resulting oxide being insoluble in tartaric acid, and dissolved
slowly in HCl, with which solution HS gave the yellowish-brown pre
cipitate SnS+SnS*.         This occurrence of native tin is strongly
opposed to the supposition of fraud in the earth examined.        Separa
ting the rock and washing, gave a further quantity of very fine
gold spangles, mingled with pyrites and magnetic oxide of iron,
together with more spangles of native tin.        One pound and a half
of the  original  substance,  from which these   spangles  were removed,
after  separation   of the rocks and concentration      by  washing, was
melted with twice      its   weight   oflitharge   (previously tested for
gold), and   a   small quantity  of  charcoal powder.      The resulting
button  of   lead was cupelled (adding     to the lead the gold already
found) and the silver treated with nitric acid, which left   a   coherent
mass  of  gold weighing 0:006 grm.         One hundred pounds      of  the

I      OUGHT  perhaps to apologise for returning to a subject
    which has been already submitted to so fundamental an
examination, that it may seem superfluous to enter upon                                                   its
further consideration.        From observations made             me, and                   by

proposed by Professor Forbes, I have been able in this new
locality to make observations quite as regularly as before. The
artifice consists in covering the case surrounding the torsion
balance within and without with a metallic coating, in my case
with tin-foil. The advantage of such a metallic covering in
observations with very mobile apparatus has been proved in other
cases also (by MM. Regnault and Kohlrausch); it may perhaps
be due to the lessening of the sensitiveness of the apparatus with
regard to differences of temperature; or, which seems to me most
probable, to the removal of every trace of electrical development
from the apparatus.

as that followed            by

 770.3 to 813-2 seconds, and hence the force of torsion in the
 ratio of 1 : 1-114.
    This variability in the force of torsion of a bifilar or unifilar
wire, which exhibits itself when the weight which imparts tension
to the wire remains the same, diminishes in time, is indepen
dent of temperature, and which, it may be remarked, exhibited
itself in Baily’s experiments in a still greater degree, is well
deserving of attention; for future observations it would be of
interest to ascertain        its

existence of certain organic compounds highly analogous to
cacodyle, and, like that body, consisting of a metal, or in some
cases phosphorus, associated with the groups Cº Hº, C*H*,
C*H', &c., and possessing in most instances, highly remarkable

Zincmethyle (C*H*Zn) and Zincaethyle (C*H*Zn) were pro
visionally assigned, besides giving methods for procuring similar
compounds containing tin, arsenic and phosphorus, by acting
upon the iodides of the alcohol radicals with these elements, and
expressing a belief, founded upon the similarity of functions
existing between hydrogen and the groups of the form C* Hººt"),

   More recently Löwig and Schweitzerº have commenced
labouring in the same field, and have filled up one of the gaps
in the foregoing table by the formation of stibaethyle, (Sb(C*H*),)
in acting upon iodide of aethyle with an alloy of antimony and
potassium ; the same chemists state also the probable formation
of similar compounds containing methyle and amyle in place of
aethyle, and bismuth and phosphorus instead of antimony.
     Ihave continued my researches upon the organo-metallic
bodies formed as above described, and having succeeded in
increasing the list by the addition of several new members,                                                 I
propose, in a series of papers, of which this is the first, to lay
before the Royal Society the results of my experiments on the
formation of bodies of this class.
     The agents which     I have hitherto employed in the formation
of these   organo-metallic     compounds are two, viz. heat and light;
in many cases either of these can be used, in others only one
can be made to effect the desired combination, whilst more rarely
the assistance of both appears to be essential.            In those experi
ments in which heat was         employed   the materials were subjected

should be placed near the focus of a large parabolic reflector,
the temperature being prevented, if necessary, from rising too
high by immersing them in water or in a solution of sulphate of
copper.    The unconcentrated rays of the sun, or even diffused
daylight, are quite sufficient to determine the formation of the
crystalline body; but an exposure of several weeks, or even
months, would be necessary for the completion of the change,
which is effected by the use of the reflector in a few days of
bright sunshine. The liquid gradually assumes a straw-yellow
colour, but            its

inhaled; yet this compound can scarcely be said to be volatile at
common temperatures, since a few grains may be exposed to the
air for several weeks without any appreciable loss of weight.
     Owide of Standethylium.—In contact with solutions of the
alkalies, iodide of stanaethylium is immediately decomposed,
oxide of stanaethylium and an alkaline iodide being formed; with
solutions of potash and soda the oxide of stanaethylium dissolves
in an excess of the precipitant, but is reprecipitated, unchanged,
by cautious neutralization of the alkaline solution; with solution
of ammonia the precipitated oxide remains undissolved on the
 addition of an excess of the alkali; a quantity of the oxide of
 stanaethylium, prepared in this latter manner, was heated for a
 few minutes with an excess of ammonia, thrown on a filter and
washed with distilled water until all iodide of ammonium was
 removed. Submitted to analysis it yielded the following results:—
     I. 3497 grm., burnt with oxide of copper, gave 3218 grim.
 carbonic acid and 1630 grm. water.
     II.   7296 grm, decomposed by nitric acid and ignited, gave
 ‘5778    grm.  peroxide of tin.
     III.,  '9218 grm, gave, when similarly treated, 7239 grim.
 peroxide of tin.
     These numbers agree closely with the formula C*H*SnO, as
 is seen by the following comparison:—

     The numbers obtained by experiment correspond sufficiently

164                 Dr. E. Frankland                   on a      New Series         of
well with the theoretical one, when it is considered that oxide of
stanaethylium is not absolutely insoluble in excess of ammonia.
   Oxide of stanaethylium presents the appearance of a somewhat
cream-white amorphous powder, closely resembling peroxide of
tin, but less heavy than that oxide; it has a peculiar though
slight aethereal odour and a bitter taste; it is insoluble in water,
alcohol and aether, but readily dissolves in solutions of acids and
of the fixed alkalies; with acids it forms salts, which are, how
ever, for the most part difficultly crystallizable; those with strong
acids exhibit an acid reaction. The nitrate deflagrates when
heated to about 120°C., and on the application of a higher heat
becomes pure peroxide of tin.      The salts of oxide of stanaethy
lium behave with    reagents  so nearly like the salts of peroxide of
tin, that the two are very difficult to distinguish from each other.
   Sulphuret of Standethylium.—When sulphurctted hydrogen is
passed through an acid solution of a salt of stanaethylium, a
cream-coloured precipitate falls, which is insoluble in dilute acids
and ammonia, but soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid,
solutions of the fixed alkalies, and alkaline sulphurets; from its
solutions in the fixed alkalies and alkaline sulphurets, it is repre
cipitated, unchanged, on the addition of an acid.          have made                     I
no analyses of this body, but there is no doubt that          formula                        its

cannot be distilled without decomposition,      could not avail                  I
myself of these means of purification.     The above formula

of stanaethylium is deposited in long white needles, which closely
resemble, both in appearance and properties, the chloride of stan

analytical results:—
   '97.30 grim., burnt with oxide of copper, yielded 5108 grim.
carbonic acid and 2582 grm. water.
   These numbers agree very closely with the formula C*H*Sn Br,
as is seen from the following comparison:—

  These results show that stanaethylium      perfectly resembles
cacodyle in       its
                 reactions, combining directly with the electro
negative elements and regenerating the compounds from which
ithas been derived.

  Both these causes probably contribute to produce the excess
of hydride of aethyle; but the very small amount of gaseous
products, compared with the solid ones, convinced me that the
production of the former is only an accidental circumstance,

                Calcination of the granulated coarse Metal.
             next operation is the calcination of the granulated
 THE      coarse metal; this is done in the same manner as the cal
  cination of the ore, but the furnaces used are always single-bedded,
  and measure inside about 21 feet in length and 14 feet in width.
 The charge of metal covers the bottom of the hearth to the depth
  of about 4 inches, making about 4 tons, and is put in through
 the hoppers fitted upon the top of the furnace as described for
 the ore.
     The coarse metal being easily fused, great care is required not
 to raise the heat of the furnace too high, otherwise the metal
 will cake, and by adhering to the bricks will prove prejudicial to
 both the calcination and the furnace. When the charge is let
 into the furnace, it is slowly brought to a visible red, the fire is
 gradually and cautiously increased until the metal acquires a
 bright red heat, which should take about fourteen hours. This
 temperature is continued until the charge has been altogether
 twenty-four hours in the furnace, when it is               down through     let
 the bottom into the cubs or vaults beneath.

    more extensive surface      being   exposed.    As the heat requisite
to a drive off the sulphur does not penetrate deep into the solid
 granules, rendering the calcination                          of
                                               coarse metal tedious, the

columns, the change taking place is very apparent and interest
ing. The rapidity of the formation of sulphuric acid at the
commencement may be assisted by the powder being damp;
nevertheless there seems to be an intermitting action between the
sulphur as sulphurets and sulphuric acid, the oxide of iron pro
bably playing a part in these reactions. It is also seen that it is
much more difficult to decompose sulphate of copper by heat than
sulphate of iron.    It is remarkable how little sulphur is driven
off while in the top bed, and how rapidly it is evolved when the
powder enters the lower and hotter bed, so as in a few hours to
decompose the whole of the sulphurets.

 a three-bed calciner, the heat passing from one bed over the other,

   We observe in the above table the same kind of reaction as
was noticed in the calcination of the ore—a sudden evolution of
sulphur, and then a gradual absorption continuing for several
hours. The change of sulphates into sulphurets, and again into
sulphates, &c., is also worthy of remark; and this action takes
place to a certain extent even in the lowest bed. The peroxide of
iron at one time gives off a portion of       oxygen and       con                     its                                is

when the   testing  showed the  decomposition    the sulphates into                             of

   In  this series of analyses the same reactions are exhibited, but
the same objection applies to this kind of furnace when used for
powder as for ore—the impracticability of regulating the heatin
each bed as required.          If it be increased in any one of the beds,
the heat of the others is reduced so as to affect the process.
   If we look at the results as the powder enters each bed, there
is an appearance of regularity.             In going into the second, it has
lost 6  per  cent. of   sulphur    in the   first,   or about one-fifth; and on
entering the lowest bed it has parted with two-thirds in all, or
14 per cent. in the second bed; but looking at the actions and
reactions hourly, and the sudden starts the evolution of sulphur
occasionally takes, the progress of the calcination is much slower
than it ought to be, and would be were there sufficient control
over the heat.
   The following table shows the results of experiments made in
an ordinary one-bed calciner as described for ore, and as univer
sally used for granulated coarse metal.

   Sulphurous acid in a dry atmosphere is not converted into
sulphuric acid by taking more oxygen from the air; but when
moisture is present, small quantities are formed; and in the pre
sence of peroxide of iron the formation of sulphuric acid is rapid;
hence at the early part of the calcination sulphates are abundant.
The peroxide of iron is converted into the magnetic oxide, the acid
combining with a portion of the protoxide of iron, and the quan
tity of sulphate of iron is always large before the heat of the
furnace becomes high, and often before any sulphate of copper
exists. When sulphate of iron is decomposed by the intensity
 of the heat, there is always a simultaneous formation of sulphate
 of copper, probably from a mere transfer of the acid, the iron
 being converted into the state of peroxide. When the heat of
 the furnace is too high for the existence of sulphate of iron, and
 no moisture present, we nevertheless think that the oxygen of
 the peroxide of iron converts the sulphurous acid into sul
 phuric acid, which simultaneously combines with the oxide of
copper.
    These experiments point to the conclusion, that to obtain rapid
and complete calcination, the stuff must be in powder, and sub
jected to a free current of                    air
                                  with regular and increasing heat,

    The difference between this and that deposited in the flue of
the same furnace is worthy of remark.              In the former there is
much    sulphate of  copper    and   iron,    and but little of the more
volatile matters; while in this last, taken at a greater distance
from the furnace, where the heat is less, the more volatile mat
ters are in greater quantity.

pages   of our mathematical periodicals, and are well known to
mathematicians as being the best dissertations on their respective
subjects at that time extant.  Among his separate publications,
the Restoration of the Treatise of Apollonius on Inclinations is
acknowledged to be a most clegant and able work, and furnishes
a remarkable contrast to the attempt of Dr. Horsley on the same
subject; whilst his Theory of Projectiles in the same tract is no
less distinguished for clegance and originality.     It does not
appear, however, that his superiority in geometry in any way
enabled him to subdue his natural irritability, for at various
periods of his career he had differences with almost every person
of eminence with whom he came in contact.           He was one of
those “whose  special education was in advance of his general; ” and
hence, as Mr. Swale remarks, although “his heart was good, his
habits had been formed by casualty and the necessity of the
moment rather than by design and the prudent hand of a master.”

 Captain Heath, for some time editor of the Ladies’ Diary for the
 Stationers’ Company, and subsequently of the Palladium on his
 own responsibility.      His opposition to Simpson, Rollinson and
 Turner (afterwards editors of the Diary, the Mathematician, and
the Mathematical Exercises, and who at times corrected his
 errors), was inveterate; nor was his violent language towards
 them at      all
               justifiable under any circumstances.         Its grossness
ultimately led        his dismissal from the editorship
                         to                                    the Diary,     of

William Crakelt, now in my possession, I gather that he was
the editor of the mathematical department of the London Maga
zine, a periodical of considerable repute towards the close of the
last century.   His papers in the Mathematical Miscellany, the
Geometrical   Delights, &c., prove him to have been a mathema
tician and astronomer of no mean abilities. Mr. Hugh Brown was
the translator of Euler’s edition of Robins's Gunnery, which,
with the assistance of Mr. Burrow, as is now evident, he improved
considerably.    The publication of the first number of Carnan’s
Lady’s and Gentleman’s Diary was now determined upon; but
of the articles named in the memorandum, only the second,
third, and fifth were inserted. The places of the others were
supplied by some valuable geometrical discussions, which are the
more remarkable on account of their systematic character.              Mr.
Burrow in this respect set the example of attempting the classi
fication of geometrical inquiries, which it would have been well
to have followed out more fully than has been done in most of
our mathematical periodicals.

 Mathematical     Repository    himself,   the first volume        which was                   of
to   contain Algebraical questions, and the second Geometrical.
 He proposed this          Dodson, who readily accepted the offer
                               to                                                                                  of

                                                  (Jones) might probably
 afterwards   publish   himself.    Mr. Robertson           this set the affair      on

when a medical man of Hooke's acquaintance accidentally called
upon him, he found him absolutely dying of want; and on his
leaving the house he gave an old woman who waited upon Hooke
some money to buy him a fowl and some wine.               Hooke happened
to see him do      it;  and when the       gentleman   was gone, he took
the money from the woman and would not buy anything
 with it.”

 School in Christ's Hospital, and published his Antilogarithmic
 Canon, “a work unique of              kind,”      1742;-the Mathema

is   almost wholly composed          algebraical questions, most

to get three uniform experiments where the temperature of the

 was made to pass in the direction ABD, where it had to enter

that the galvanic current has at each of those joints a fixed tem

time below the temperature of the atmosphere, and that if                                                   I

   In  the second experiment, where the joint was cooled 19-2
below the temperature of the atmosphere by the electricity          fur
nished by the action of a cold acid solution, on the interruption
of the current the temperature of the joint rose to 46°, or one
degree above that of the atmosphere.          The second and third
experiments I repeated many times in order to satisfy myself of
their accuracy.     In these experiments there is no effect on the
temperature of the joint which may not be accounted for by the
requirements of the battery for caloric, and the power which an
electrical current possesses of arranging temperatures in a con
ductor composed of various materials. In the second experiment
it may be held that the cold water at 38° would, without the aid
of any galvanic current, reduce the temperature of the apparatus
below that of the atmosphere: this is an effect distinct from the
one noted; for in the experiment in question there are portions
of the metallic circuit intervening between the joint B and the
cold solution which are above the temperature of the atmosphere;
for example, where the electricity enters the bismuth, the tem
perature for a current of this kind is 4° higher than where it
quits it at B, or 2°8 above the temperature of the atmosphere.
   The normal temperature of the galvanic electricity derived
from the action of a battery is a point which the heat of the solu
tion and atmosphere cannot altogether govern; for there are
the chemical actions absorbing and evolving caloric, which must
also have their influence. In the Smee's battery I think it
extremely probable that the electricity comes from it at a tem
perature lower than that of the apparatus or atmosphere when
these are uniform, as in the first experiment.
   The following repetitions of the second experiment show that
a cold water cell did not reduce the temperature like a cold acid
solution.

    The small reduction in the temperature of the joint in the
 pure water experiment is most probably due to the current given
 by the water.    I  would have preferred the experiment without
 this current, but to do so I must have destroyed a part of the
 metallic contact of the plates in the cold water with the joint.
 The difference, however, between the two experiments of 1°8 is
 an ample proof of the galvanic current from a cold solution
 reducing the temperature of the joint, independently of the effect
 of conduction from the joint to the water.

  I     propose examining the case where the oscillation                   circular.                       is
  Fresnel has shown that           circular vibration

  but whose      phases   are 90° different.      Starting     from this,         has                                he

      The same conclusion being applied                  the lineal and very  to

  same direction as the      rotation of the plane in which the lineal
 vibrations are executed,     that is from east to west, as when these
  directions are opposed      to each other. In the former case the
 duration is shortened,      in the latter case augmented. To the
 circular oscillation of a pendulum it is therefore necessary to
 apply a correction, the sign of which depends upon the sense in
 which the vibration is executed.
     We arrive at the same result when we discuss & priori the
 effect of the rotatory motion of the earth upon the duration of
 the circular oscillation of a pendulum.
     If t denote the duration of a complete lineal vibration of a
 pendulum (two seconds in the case of a seconds' pendulum), and
 T the duration of a sidereal day, then the angle of rotation of

                                               -
 latitude X it is 2T sin A.
     If the same   pendulum describes a circle, the apparent rotation
 during the time t, when the direction of rotation is from east to
 west, is
                             27--2T #  t     A,
                                       T sin
and when the direction is from west to east,
                             27—27t
                                       i sin X.
     The change of the angle by the rotation of the earth during
the time T amounts therefore to +27 sin X. The difference of
phase between the two motions left and right, after twenty-four
hours sidereal time, is therefore equal to the product of two
complete oscillations into the sine of the latitude.       From this it
follows, that the conical seconds' pendulum, when it rotates from
east to west at Paris, moves about three seconds quicker than
when the rotation is from west to east, a quantity which far ex
ceeds that which astronomers would think of neglecting.
    This difference would be still greater in the case of long pen
dulums.      With the pendulum of 11 metres suspended by M.
Foucault in the Paris observatory, it would amount to at least
ten seconds daily.
    It is conceivable that this inequality might be proved in a
direct manner, if two isochronous pendulums were set swinging
simultaneously in opposite directions, so that their coincidences
on one and the same diameter might be observed; for the rota
tion of this diameter must be the same as that of the plane of
oscillation of a pendulum vibrating in a plane.
    The oscillations being always assumed as very small, what

200                              Mr.     J. J.       Sylvester on an Impromptu
subject took place, and the author has not cared to put it on
record, I feel myself under an obligation so to do, the more so
as it entirely supersedes the comparatively inelegant demonstra
tion of my own which I had previously intended to publish.
   The method rests essentially on the following well-known
theorem given by Euler relative to the partition of numbers; to
wit, that the number of ways of breaking up a number n into
parts is the same, whether we impose the condition that the
number of parts in any partitionment shall not exceed (m), or
that the magnitude of any one of the parts shall not exceed (m).
Of this rule more hereafter—for the present to      application                                        its                              to

It will of course be seen that, for the purposes of the demonstra

able to        assume that the number of partitions, when the greatest
part is       not allowed to exceed (m), is not greater than the number
of   partitions when the number of parts in any one partitionment
does not exceed (m). The equality of these two numbers would
then evince itself in the course of the demonstration as a conse

     In A the number of parts is 4.    In B the greatest part is                          4;
the others   might be  (although they  happen not in this particular
instance to be) 4, but cannot be greater than 4. And so every
A in which the number of parts is 4 will give rise to a B in
which 4 is one of the parts, and every other part is 4 or less,
and evidently (although, as above remarked, this is immaterial to
the demonstration) every such B gives reciprocally the same A
from which it is itself derived; hence the number of A's and B’s
is equal. This is the theorem which, for the sake of distinction,
I have called the Corollary to Euler's.    Euler's own is proved by
the same    diagram;  for if we define A as a grouping where the
number of parts does not eaceed 4, we get a definition of B as a
grouping where the greatest part does not exceed 4, and so in
general. We see that this theorem may be varied also by affirm
ing that the number of ways in which n may be broken up, so
that there shall never be less than (m) parts, is the same as the
number of ways in which it may be broken up into parts, the
greatest of which in any one way is not less than (m).    So, again,
a similar  diagram  makes it  apparent, that if we break up each of
i numbers into parts so that the sum of the greatest parts shall
not exceed (or be less than) m, the number of ways in which this
can be done will be the same as the number of ways in which
these i numbers can be simultaneously partitioned so that the
total number of parts in any simultaneous partitionment shall
never exceed (or never be less than) m; and doubtless an exten
sive range of analogous general theorems relative to the parti
tioning of numbers may be struck out by aid of the same dia
gram, by no means easily demonstrable unless this simple mode
of conversion happen to be thought      but        of of,

XXXIII.        On some anomalous         cases   of Electrical Decomposition.
                    By W. R. GRove, F.R.S. &c.”
            OLLASTON     showed,     in a well-known experiment+, that
          when Franklinic electricity from the prime conductor
of an   ordinary electrical machine was made to pass from fine
points of gold wire sealed into glass tubes and immersed in
water, both positive and negative pole gave mixed oxyhydrogen
gas, the exact proportions of which are not given.     This expe
riment has been subsequently discussed by    Ritchief,  Faraday S,
and others, but differing as the decomposition in this case does
from electrolysis by the voltaic battery, I am not aware that it
has been repeated on a large scale, or that anything more than
a mere verification of the fact has been attempted.
   The apparatus constructed by M. Ruhmkorff, which           have     I
described in a paper in the Philosophical Magazine for December
last, p. 500, having given me the means of procuring electricity
of tension in quantity far exceeding that of the best electrical
machine, and having my attention directed to Wollaston’s expe
riment by the wires sealed in glass tubes which                I
                                                      used for my
recent experiments,       I
                          determined to make some experiments
similar to Wollaston's, but with the spark from the secondary
coil instead of that from the electrical machine. I select the
following from amongst many experiments made with this ap
paratus.
   The terminals of the secondary coil consisted of two wires of
platinum fºoth of an inch in diameter sealed into glass tubes.
One of these coated wires was prepared on purpose for these ex
periments; and having been carefully sealed into a glass tube,
the extremity was ground on a hone until the section of wire
formed one surface with the glass.
   The other coated wire had been similarly prepared, but had
been used for some time for the experiments in attenuated gases,
given in the paper to which          I
                               have alluded; and the extremity
of the wire was worn beneath the surface of the glass, a circum
stance which proved of some little importance||.
   The tubes containing the platinum wires were curved in form

   | This result is  important in another  point of view than that relating to
the experiments in this paper, viz. it shows the transmission of matter in
electrical discharges, and that even in the aurora borealis experiment, or
passage of the spark in highly rarefied gas, solid matter, even such as the
dense substance platinum, is given off; thus favouring the theory that the
spark is ignited matter, and rendering the hypothesis of a fluid unnecessary
for   its
       explanation.

  With the     coated point positive, the platinum plate negative,
0.3 c. i. of gas was collected from the point; a minute bubble
only appeared in the tube containing the strip or plate; the gas
contracted in the eudiometer to 0-7 of its volume; the residue,
mixed with half       its
                       volume     oxygen, detonated, leaving

   4th. The converse experiment, i.e. coated wire negative, plate
positive, 0.3           gas was collected from the negative coated
                    in c.

wire, and,      as the former case, only
                       of                   minute bubble appeared

the gas from the negative point contracted        half                                      its                 in

   5th.    In the above experiments     had used from         oz.                           2     to   3        of
distilled  water,  with    few
                            a  drops    sulphuric   of I

prove   its conducting power, without paying any particular atten
tion  to  the exact quantity             of
                                 acid which was mixed.
I     now determined         try different degrees
                               to                          dilution       the    of                      of
acid, and      note more accurately
               to                              proportionits  the water.              to                        I
first took the extreme case             dilution, using
                                              it of         oz.     distilled     3              of
water, and merely touching                    narrow glass rod which had
                                               by        a

   The coated wire was the positive pole, the plate                platinum                   of
foil the negative; 0.3            was collected from the coated wire,

second contraction appeared               nitrogen, and
                                              to    be       greater quan             its
tity  in this than       the previous experiment was doubtless due
                          in
to  the greater time which, from the inferior conducting power                                                  of
the solution, was necessary for the decomposition, more               having                       air
thus entered into solution.              this  experiment
                                               In           the  liquid   was
exposed for twenty-four hours, during ten             which the discharges
                                                                     of
were kept up, while        the previous experiment less than
                            in                                          hour                           an
was sufficient, and the water had not cooled from               preliminary             its
boiling before the experiment was completed.
    6th.
       I    next tried      strong solution
                               a                     sulphuric acid, spec.
                                                                   of
grav. 1:23; the gas from the coated point, which was positive,
contracted      to
                0-2       of   its
                             volume; the residue was hydrogen.
    7th.
       I    used     still stronger solution, spec. grav. 1:45, both
                      a
points being coated; the volume from the negative pole was                                                      to
that from the positive         4.5 as  3:25; the gas from the negative
                                               to
pole contracted       inthe eudiometer           only 0.95   to     volume;             of       its
the residue was     pure   owygen       the   gas
                                              ;    from the    positive  pole
contracted        0:5;
                 to      the residue was hydrogen.            Here,        my                              to
surprise, there was, after the first contraction,              residuum                                         of
oxygen     in               of                                            to          of a

                                   of Electrical              Decomposition.                                 207
of hydrogen.       The experiment was repeated with acid of spec.
grav. 1:5; from the positive point 3-3 volumes were collected,
from the negative 2-6; the gas from the negative pole contracted
to 0-9 of             its
                volume; the residuum was pure oxygen; that from
the   positive  contracted        0-4       to                   its

                                                          of

   The receiver was then exhausted, and the vapour which had
formed at the top of the tube soon dilated sufficiently to expose
the point and plate; the spark was then passed across the
vapour, and a permanent increase in volume of the vapour was
soon detected.        The experiment was continued for a week, the
apparatus working five hours each day; at the end of that time
much of the gas formed had escaped into the receiver, and on
letting in the air the water rose in the tube until a bubble of gas
of 0.03 c. i. remained in the top; this was analysed, and proved
to be pure hydrogen.
    On the interior of the tube was a dark pulverulent deposit,
far too minute in quantity for analysis, but which had evidently
proceeded from the platinum.
    The only possible mode in which I can account for this expe
riment       is,

 I      have made many variations            the above experiments, but

would       betedious      detail them. The following are the general
                                 to
results:—

phuric acid, there is always a notable     of hydrogen; in one
                                                         excess
case the oxygen was only one-fifteenth of the whole volume of
gas evolved.  With solution of potash a similar result takes
place.
   2nd. When the quantity of acid is increased to the point at
which the electrolytic power of the solution is the best, the ex
cess of hydrogen is less; and probably if the exact point of the
solution were attained, there would be no excess.
    3rd. When the solution is much stronger than that which
makes the best electrolyte, there is a notable excess of ozygen.
    4th. When the electrodes exceed a certain size, water conducts
without any apparent signs of decomposition.
    On making a search for any previous experiments on this sub
      I
ject, find that Faraday (Phil. Trans. 1834, p. 91) has observed
that when a strong solution of sulphuric acid, formed by mixing
two measures of           oil   of
                        vitriol with one    water, was subjected

place. The strength         the acid of   then  employedhe would                                     be
very nearly that employed        me

a screw form and enclosed in two small glass tubes which were
filled, the one with oxygen and the other with hydrogen; the
tubes were immersed in two similar vessels containing equal
quantities of water, which served as a calorimeter.     When the
circuit was established, the wire immersed in the oxygen became
white-hot, while that in the hydrogen exhibited no visible red
ness.    At the same time the heat yielded by the wires raised the
temperature of the surrounding water, that in which the hydro
gen tube was immersed being elevated from 60° to 70°, and
that which surrounded the oxygen tube, from 60° to 81°.
  In a similar manner Grove compared other gases with hydro
gen, and found the following numbers, which have been reduced
by M. Clausius, who takes the quantity of heat yielded in each
experiment by the hydrogen as unit:--

   In publishing   a translation of the first communication of Grove
upon this subject, Poggendorff expressed the opinion* that the
cooling of a wire heated by galvanic electricity in different gases fol
 lows mutatis mutandis the same laws that Dulong and Petit have
 established in the case of bodies heated in an ordinary manner, and
 according to which hydrogen possesses the greatest cooling
 capacity. This manner of explanation is objected to by J. Müller
in his “Report on the latest Progress of Physics,” p. 396; the
last-mentioned experiment being regarded by him as unmistake
ably opposed to such an explanation.        He says —“This experi
 ment   proves  decidedly  that the feebler glowing of the wire in
hydrogen, with an equal strength of current, is not to be referred
to the circumstance that the hydrogen abstracts the heat most
quickly from       its
                   wire, for     this case the water surrounding the
                                          in
hydrogen tube must         most speedily heated.

                                                                                                        in by
stances   point     to
                    the conclusion,   that    the wire surrounded
                                                               in
hydrogen the actual quantity          heat produced
                                                 of       less than                is
the other wires.”     Müller closes his report with the statement,
that  in his opinion the experiment stands “completely isolated
and unaccounted for.”
    M. Clausius, however, can find                        no
                                           such difficulty attached                                     to

 American herbivores are shown to agree with each other in characters
 of greater value, derived from the osseous and dental systems, than
 any of those by which the Nesodon resembles either the Perissodac
 tyle or Artiodactyle divisions of hoofed animals.
    The genus Nesodon is characterized by the following modifications
 of the teeth, which in number and kind are according to the typical
 dental formula above given.    Incisors trenchant, with long, slightly
 curved crowns, of limited growth: canines small, not exceeding in
length the contiguous premolars.      Molars, in the upper jaw, with
long, curved, transversely compressed crowns, which contract as they
penetrate the bone and ultimately develope fangs; the outer side of
the crown ridged, the inner side penetrated by two more or less
complex folds of enamel, leaving insular patches on the worn crown:
enamel thin. The lower molars, long, straight, and compressed;
divided by an external longitudinal indent into two unequal lobes,
both penetrated at the inner side by a fold of enamel, which is com
plex in the hinder lobe. All the teeth have exserted crowns of
equal height and arranged in an unbroken series.      The bony palate
is entire and extends back    beyond   the molars, the maxillaries and
palatines forming the back part in equal proportions.        A distinct
articular cavity and eminence for the lower jaw; the eminence long
and concave transversely, short and convex longitudinally; a protu
berant post-glenoid process; a strong and deep zygoma, the orbit
and temporal fossa widely intercommunicating; the premaxillaries
join the nasals.
     Of   the genus presenting     the above dental and osteal characters
the author defines four species:—the first, about the size of a Llama,
is the Nesodon imbricatus; the second, of the size of a Zebra, is the
Nesodon Sulivani; the species to which belong the portions of skull,
with the teeth, described in the present memoir, did not exceed the
size of a large sheep, and is termed the Nesodon ovinus; fourthly, a
species of the size of a Rhinoceros, Nesodon magnus, is satisfactorily
indicated by a grinder of the upper jaw.    In conclusion, the author
remarks, that the osteological characters defining the orders of hoofed
quadrupeds,   called Proboscidia, Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla, are
associated with modifications of the soft parts of such importance,
as not only to establish the principle of that ternary division of the
great natural group of Ungulata, but to indicate that the known mo
difications of the skeleton of the extinct Toxodons and Nesodons of
South America, in the degree in which they differ from the osteology
of the already defined orders of Ungulata, must have been associated
with concomitant modifications of other parts of their structure which
would lead to their being placed in a distinct division, equal to the
Proboscidia; and, like that order, to be more nearly allied to the Pe
rissodactyla than the Artiodactyla. This new division of the Ungulata
the author proposes to call Towodontia, and he remarks that       its
                                                                  dental
and osteal  characters, while they illustrate the close mutual affinities
between the Nesodons and Toxodons, tend           dissipate much
                                                     to                 of

                                                          the Torodon, and

genus     in   the mammalian class.

F.R.A.S.
  The author, referring to a former communication on this subject,
published in the Phil. Trans. 1841, states that, in the value of ir
 here given to 208 places of decimals, there exists, in the latter
part of one of the terms of the series for determining the value
of   tan";         a transposition      of the figures of         a    recurring decimal,
which vitiates a considerable number of the figures in the latter part
of the value. This error had been detected in consequence of Pro
fessor Schumacher having observed that in the value of it which had
been given him by M. Dase, who had calculated it to 200 places,

author. The accuracy of M. Dase's result was confirmed by a
double computation of Dr. Clausen of Dorpat, who deduced the
value of T to 250 places of decimals, both by Machin's formula

   Having been informed by Mr. W. Shanks of Houghton-le-Spring,
that he had pushed his computation of the value of T to the extent
of 318 decimals, the author resolved to extend his operations to
upwards of 400 decimals.     As Mr. Shanks had employed Machin's
formula, the author resolved to make use of the same. At his request
Mr. Shanks resumed his calculations, and has not only verified the
author's value of r to 440 places of decimals, but has carried his
own to the extent of 530 places.  The author states that the values of
  –        1                 1                                                 -

subjoined,      have been obtained        by    the independent          computations    of
Mr. Shanks and himself, and that they both feel confident that
these values are correct         in   every figure   as   far   as    440 decimals.

           in                       diameter.  When 7706 fathoms  in
had run off the reel the sea-bottom was reached. Captain Denham
states that Lieut. Hutcheson and himself,      separate boats, with                  in
their own hands, drew the plummet up 50 fathoms several times,
and after     had renewed its descent,   stopped, on each occasion,       it

    The whole time therefore taken by the plummet in descending
through 7706 fathoms, or nearly 7-7 geographical miles of 60 to the
degree, was 9"24"45". The highest summits of the Himalaya, Dha
walagiri and Kinchinginga, are little more than 28,000 feet, or 4-7
geographical miles above the sea.         The sea-bottom has therefore
depths greatly exceeding the elevation of the highest pinnacle above
its surface.
    The strength of the line tried before the sounding was found to
be equal to bear 72lbs. in air. The 7706 fathoms which ran out
weighed, when dry, 77lbs., exclusive of the plummet, 91bs.           Great
care was taken in the endeavour to bring the plummet again to the
surface to show the nature of the bottom, but, whilst carefully reel
ing in, the line broke at 140 fathoms below the water-line, carrying
away a Six's thermometer which had been bent on at 3000 fathoms.
    Jan. 27.—A letter was read giving an account of “An Explosive
Meteorite.”      By Francis Higginson, Esq., R.N.
    The writer states that his attention having been aroused by the
 highly electrical state of the atmosphere during a severe gale of wind,
 he proceeded along the beach in the vicinity of Dover, at 2 A.M. on the
 morning of Friday, the 17th of December 1852.
     It had blown very hard during the night, the wind veering from
 West to W.S.W., in occasional heavy squalls of rain and sleet,
 accompanied at intervals by faint flashing scintillations, which at
 first, being considered sheet lightning, were only noticed from their
 unusual colour, a deep and sombre red. At about 4"50" A.M., how
 ever, these flashes constantly emerging from a dense, triangular and
very remarkable cloud in the S.E., which perceptibly increased in
 size with great rapidity, he was induced to observe it with minute
 attention.    At 4* 55" A.M., Greenwich mean time, the cloud had
 assumed the form of a right-angled triangle, its hypothenuse, or
 longest side, tending east and west.      At this instant he first heard a
 singular and extraordinary hissing sound in the air, not unlike that
  of a passing shot, which, although at first not very loud, was yet
 clearly distinguishable above the howling of the gale. At 5 A.M. the
 cloud had nearly doubled its original size, advancing steadily from
 the S.E. in a N.W. direction, or from nearly dead to leeward, to
 wards the wind's eye; whilst the scintillations spoken of were

emitted with increased rapidity. He also then first perceived in the
centre of the cloud, a dull, red, obscure nucleus, or fire-ball, appa
rently about half the diameter of the moon, having a tail five or six
times that length, from which the flashes mentioned were sent forth,
of surpassing brilliancy, as the meteor clearly descended with great
velocity through the air, accompanied by a detonating, hurtling,
hissing sound, impossible to describe, yet resembling that which
precedes the shock of an earthquake.      At three minutes past five
 o'clock A.M., the meteor having apparently spanned the Channel
 from S.E. to N.W., upon approaching the land—evidently throw
ing off portions of      substance  its   passed through the atmo

  Laplace, Damoiseau, Plana, and Hansen; the principal change made
  by the latter writers from Laplace's values being in the motion of
  perigee.
     The method of computation adopted by the author is then ex
  plained.    He adopts the Greenwich mean motions and Damoiseau's
  coefficients for progressive change of secular mean motion.      He then
  repeats the calculation with an arbitrary change of longitude of
  node; considering that, from the loose nature of the early Green
 wich observations, this element is most likely to be in error, and that
 its errors will produce the greatest effect.
     The author then discusses the account of the eclipse of Agathocles,
 B. c. 310, August 15. Adopting Alhowareah (under Cape Bon) as
 his landing-place in Africa, he states his belief that Agathocles sailed
 northward from Syracuse (a conjecture which he owes in the first
 instance to    J. W. Bosanquet, Esq.), and was not far from the Straits
 of Messina. On the usual supposition of his sailing to the south,
 he would be near Cape Passaro.
     On making the calculation with the Greenwich Elements unvaried,
 it is found that the eclipse would be total on the southern possible
 place of Agathocles, but not on the northern.       The calculation being
 repeated with an arbitrary change in the place of the node, a gra
 phical construction is employed to discover the numerical amount of
  the changes that must be made to satisfy the four following condi
 tions:–1, the northern edge of the shadow touches the south station;
  2, the northern edge touches the north station; 3, the southern edge
 touches the south station; 4, the southern edge touches the north
 station.     If the south station be adopted, the change must lie be
 tween those of conditions 1 and 3; if the north, the change must
 lie between those of 2 and 4. The numerical values must be slightly
 increased for application to a more distant eclipse, as to that of
Thales.
     The eclipse of Thales is then considered. There appears to be no
reason for connecting the locality (as Mr. Baily supposed) with the
river Halys. The historical circumstances indicate with great pro
bability that two large armies had met; and the question appears to
be, in what part of Asia Minor is it likely that such bodies of troops
would be collected.        The author adverts to the form and passes of
the    mountains,   and decides that the Median army entered most pro
bably by the pass of Issus, or possibly by that of Melitene, and that
the battle-field might be anywhere in the space bounded by Melitene,
Issus, Iconium, Sardes, and Ancyra.
     On calculating the eclipses which occurred for many years before
and after B. c. 600, it appears that only the eclipse of B.C. 585, May
28, answers to the requisite conditions, and that it does so in a most
satisfactory way. [This is the date adopted by the principal ancient
chronologists; it would seem that it was first verified, by calculations
founded on good elements, by         J. R. Hind, Esq. during the prepara
tion of this    paper.]    The  path  of the shadow which is most agree
able to the      military and  geographical   circumstances, is one which
implies a correction to the Greenwich Elements corresponding to that
     Phil. Mag. S. 4.     Wol. 5.  No. 31. March 1853.

which would make the eclipse of Agathocles nearly central over the
northern station, and excludes the possibility of his passing by the
southern route.
   The author then adverts to the principal remaining causes of un
certainty in these conclusions, and points out the values of progress
ive change in the secular mean motions as peculiarly deserving
investigation.        -
   Allusion is then made to a record in the Persian poetical history,
preserved by Sir John Malcolm, which appears to point to a total
eclipse as occurring under similar circumstances in the province of
Mazenderan.      It appears however on calculation, that no total
eclipse passed over Mazenderan, at least for many years, about the
time in question.
   The author then calls attention to the statement of Herodotus,
that something like a total solar eclipse occurred when Xerxes was
setting out from Sardes for his invasion of Greece.      On calculation
it appears impossible to explain this by a solar eclipse, and moreover
the peculiar turn of the answer of the Magi to the inquiries of Xerxes
would seem to be irreconcileable with a solar eclipse. The author
thinks it most likely that the phenomenon really was the total eclipse
of the moon which occurred on the morning of B. c. 479, March 14.
If this were adopted, the date of the invasion of Greece must be
brought down one year later than that given by the received chro
mology.

tation the conclusion did not seem so sure. As some further rela
tions of the sun and the earth would have finally to be submitted,
the audience were reminded, by the use of Arago's idea, of the rela
tive magnitude of the two; for, supposing that the centres of the
two globes were made to coincide, the sun's body would not only
extend as far as the moon, but nearly as far again, its bulk being
about seven times that of a globe which should be girdled by the
moon's orbit.
      For the more careful study of the magnetic power a torsion
balance had been constructed, which was now shown and its mode
 of operation explained. The torsion wire was of hard drawn pla
 tinum, 24 inches in length, and of such diameter that 28°5 inches
 weighed one grain. It was attached as usual to a torsion-head and
 index. The horizontal beam was a small glass tube terminated at
 the object end by a glass hook. The objects to be submitted to the
 magnetic force were either cylinders of glass with a filament drawn
 out from each, so as to make a long stiff hook for suspension from
 the beam; or cylindrical bulbs of glass, of like shape, but larger
 size, formed out of glass tube; or other matters. The fine tubular
  extremities of the bulbs being opened, the way through was free
  from end to end; the bulbs could then be filled with any fluid or
  gas, and be re-submitted many times in succession to the magnetic
  force.     The source of power employed was at first a large electro
  magnet; but afterwards, in order to be certain of a constant power,
  and for the advantage of allowing any length of time for the obser
  vations,    the great magnet, constructed     by M. Logeman upon the
  principles developed by Dr. Elias (and which, weighing above 100
  lbs., could support 430 lbs. according to the report of the Great
   Exhibition Jury), was purchased by the Royal Institution and used
   in the inquiries. The magnet was so arranged that the axis of
   power was five inches below the level of the glass beam, the interval
   being traversed by the suspension-filament or hook spoken of above.
   The form and position of the terminations of soft iron are shown in
   plan by the diagram upon a scale of <U+017F>º, and also the place of the
    object.   All this part is enclosed
   in the box which belongs to, and
    carries the torsion-balance, which
    box is governed by six screws
    fixed upon the magnet table; and
    as both the box and the table have
    lines and scales marked upon them,
    it is easy to adjust the former on
    the latter so that the beam shall be over and parallel to the line
    a, e with the point of suspension over c, or, by moving the whole
     box parallel to itself towards m, to give the point of suspension any
     other distance from the angle c.    As already said, the objects were
     constructed with a suspension filament of such length as to make
     them coincide in height with the angle in the magnetic field.   When
     suspended on the beam, they were counterpoised by a ring or rings
     of lead on the further arm of the beam. These when required were

moved along the beam until the latter was horizontal; and that state
was ascertained by a double arm support, which sustained the beam
when out of use, brought it into a steady state when moving, and
delivered it into a condition of freedom when required.                  The motion
of the box to the right or left, so as to place the object in the middle
of the magnetic angle, was given by two of the screws before spoken
of; the motion to the given distance from c, by the other four.
   Supposing the distance from c towards m to be adjusted to 0:6 of
an inch, when the beam was loaded above, and no object before the
magnet (the beam having been of course previously adjusted to its
normal position, and the torsion-index placed at zero), it then
remained to determine the return of the beam to                      place when the                    its
object had been suspended                 and repelled: this was done

changes the action on the object, and there are abundance of sub
stances which when surrounded by air are repelled, and when by
water are attracted, upon the approach of a magnet. When a cer
tain small glass cylinder weighing only 66 grains was submitted on
the torsion-balance to the Logeman magnet surrounded by air, at
the distance of 0-5 of an inch from the axial line, it required 15° of
torsion to overcome the repulsive force and restore the object to its
place. When a vessel of water was put into the magnetic field, and
the experiment repeated, the cylinder being now in the water was
attracted, and 54°5 of torsion were required to overcome this attrac
tion at the given distance of 0.5. If the vessel had contained a
fluid exactly equal in diamagnetic power to the cylinder of glass,
neither attraction nor repulsion would have been exerted on the
latter, and therefore the torsion would have been 0°. Hence the
three bodies, air, glass (the especial specimen), and water, have their
relative force measured in relation to each other by the three expe
rimental numbers 15°, 0°, and 54°5.             If other fluids are taken,
as  oil, aether,  &c., and  employed   as the media surrounding the same

   The result here is that the greater the distance of the diamag
netic bodies from the magnet, the more diamagnetic is it in relation
to water, taking the interval between water and air as the standard :
and it would further appear, if an opinion may be formed from so
few experiments, that the more diamagnetic the body compared to
air and water, the greater does this difference become. At first it
was thought possible that the results might be due to some previous
state induced upon the body, by its having been nearer to or further
from the magnet; but it was found that whether the progress of the
experiments was from small to large distances, or the reverse; or
whether, at any given distance, the object was previous to the mea
surement held close up to the magnet or brought from a distance,
the results were the same ;-no evidence of a temporary induced
state could in any of these ways be found.
   It does not follow from the experiments, if they should be sus
tained by future researches, that it is the glass or the bismuth only
that changes in relation to the other two bodies. It may be the
oxygen of the air that alters, or the water, or more probably all these
bodies; for if the result be a true and natural result in these cases,
it is probably common to all substances. The great point is that
the three bodies concerned, air, water, and the subject of the expe
riment, alter in the degree of their magnetic relations to each other;
at different given distances from the magnet the ratio of their mag
metic power does not, according to the experiments, remain the
same; and if that result be confirmed, then it cannot be included by
a law of action which is inversely as the square of the distance.          A
hydrometer floating in a fluid and subject to the gravity of the earth
alone, would (other things being the same) stand at the same point,
whether at the surface of the earth, or removed many diameters of
the earth from       it,
                     because the action        gravityof   inversely     theis                   as
square   of the distance; but       we suppose the substance
                                           if                        the hy                of
drometer and the fluid       differ magnetically,

the hydrometer would, according          the experiments, stand

6'-61, and the year 1848 as presenting a maximum variation of
11' 15.
   Sabine” (March, 1852), in searching for periodical laws amongst
the mean effects of the larger magnetic disturbances, found a simul
taneous period of increase and decrease both at Hobarton and To
ronto, on opposite sides of the globe; the minimum effect was in
 1843, and the maximum effect in 1848, according therefore almost
exactly with Lamont's observations at Munich.        But, besides that,
he pointed out the extraordinary circumstance that this similar vari
ation of the daily magnetic declination is the same in length of period
 as that discovered by M. Schwabe for the solar spots; and still more,
 that the maxima and minima of these two most different phaenomena
 coincide; for 1843 presents the least diurnal variation and the
 smallest number of solar spots, and 1848 the largest magnetic
 variation and the greatest number of solar observations.       He has
 also observed that the same period of increase and decrease exists
 with the same epochs in the diurnal variation of the magnetic incli
 nation of the earth's magnetic force in both hemispheres.         The
 phaenomenon is general both as regards         the magnetic elements,     all
and     in   parts      of   the globe most distant from each other.

ON THE PRESENCE             OF BORACIC         ACID IN THE THERMAL WATERS
   contAINING ALKALINE sulPHURETS AT D'olETTE (EASTERN
   PyRENEEs).      By JULEs BoNIs.
   The  progress  of analytical chemistry is continually making known
to us the  presence  of substances in the water of springs, which may
to a certain extent account for their effects either in agriculture or
therapeutics.    During the last few years a number of very important
investigations have been made upon this subject, and it is only by
means of the consideration of a great number of experiments and
well-established facts that we have arrived at a knowledge of the
true nature and mode of formation of mineral waters.
   H. Rose has recently proposed a method for detecting the pre
sence of very minute quantities of free or combined boracic acid in
solution, by taking advantage of the reaction which it gives with
turmeric paper.
   The analogy which exists in certain respects between the waters
of the Pyrenees and those of Tuscany induced me to seek for boracic
acid in the former, and I selected the waters of Olette as being the
type of sulphuretted waters discharged at the earth's surface with a
high temperature.       These waters issue from a quartzose and fel
spathic rock, which is decomposed under their influence, giving rise
to products which I shall bring before the Academy upon a subse
quent occasion.
   In order to detect the presence of boracic acid in a mineral water,
I  evaporate a certain quantity in a porcelain capsule and acidulate
the residue with hydrochloric acid, when if boracic acid is present
it communicates to turmeric paper the characteristic red colour.
Generally speaking, the simple coloration is not sufficient evidence
     its
       presence; and notwithstanding the opinion              H. Rose,                    so
                                                                          on of

with advantage, I cannot offer an opinion until I have made a quan
titative determination.   It is probable that the acid exists in combina
tion with  soda, as in the waters occurring in China, Persia and Peru.
In the water of the Tuscan lagoons, on the contrary, it is in a free state.
   The alkalinity of thermal waters issuing from granitic rocks and                                                           .

induces me to conjecture that they likewise contain boracic acid. I

HAVº
  of
              recently had occasion to examine a great number
           Diamonds, and having discovered in by far the greater
number of them cavities of different shapes, round which the
substance of the diamond had been compressed when in a soft
state by the expansion of their gaseous contents,            I
                                                    was anxious
to re-examine some specimens of Amber in which had observed I
the same phaenomena, and other specimens which were likely to
exhibit them.
   The general character of the cavities in diamond was that of
extreme irregularity, and hence the sectors of polarized light and
the black cross which separated them partook of the same cha
racter. In most of the cavities in amber, on the contrary, their
form was accurately spherical, and the polarizing structure which
surrounded them extremely perfect and beautiful.      I have found,
however, numerous microscopic cavities which are very irregular,
and which, like those of the same minuteness in the diamond,
give regular sectors of polarized light.            I
                                             have found also cavi
ties of this kind existing in groups twelve or fifteen in number.
    In a specimen of amber containing spherical cavities of various
magnitudes, and exhibiting around them the polarizing structure,
I  have observed several cavities quite close to them without the
slightest trace of such a structure.     The circumference of the
latter was encrusted with a sort of reddish powder, which had
probably been deposited by a fluid that had been carried               off   by
absorption.

 234               On Cavities in Amber containing                         Gases and Fluids.
         In   my second paper               “On
                                   the Refractive Power of the two new
 Fluids in Minerals,”                      I have
                                  mentioned some specimens of amber,
 shown me by the late Mr. William Nicol, in which the inner
 surfaces of some of the cavities were rough, like finely-ground
 glass, and contained a fluid with a moveable vacuity*.                Upon
 subsequently examining one of these specimens,               found that the                I
 apparent roughness of the cavity arose from                  surface being                its
 covered with minute striae parallel          one another.      to

 cavities     the  specimen
                  in            were   very irregular,   while others were
 perfectly spherical; the latter were quite full         fluid, fact which            of             a
 became obvious                  by
                        comparing the refraction          their boundaries            at
 with the refraction       the boundaries of the other cavities which

                  Action of Zinc upon Iodide of Methyle.

WHEN   iodide of
   perature of about          150° C. in a sealed tube, the zinc
gradually dissolves with the evolution of gas, whilst a mass of
white crystals and a colourless mobile liquid, refracting light
strongly, occupy, after a few hours, the place of the original
materials. The gas evolved on breaking off the capillary extre
mity of the previously exhausted decomposition tube, was col
lected and preserved over sulphuretted water in the manner
already described:          I
                     will refer to this gas again under the name
of 2. On cutting off the upper portion of the decomposition
tube and pouring cold distilled water upon the mobile liquid and
white mass of crystals just mentioned, a very violent action
ensued, and a column of flame several feet high shot up momen
tarily from the mouth of the tube; but the action soon became
 more moderate, and a cork and gas-delivering tube being fitted
into the decomposition tube, the gas, after                              all

   Zincamylium.—This body is generated when iodide of amyle
is decomposed by zinc at the temperature of 180°C. It is a
colourless and transparent liquid which emits white fumes in
contact with the air, but does not spontaneously inflame; it is
decomposed in contact with water into oxide of zinc and hydrid

252                Dr. E. Frankland             on a New Series            of
I have not yet further             examined   the reactions of this remarkable
body, nor have         I attempted        the isolation of the hydrargyrome
thvlium.
  % corresponding compound containing amyle is formed, though
with difficulty, under similar circumstances, but I have not yet
succeeded in producing one containing aethyle, the iodide of this
radical yielding, as         I
                       have shown”, when exposed to sunlight in
contact with  mercury, iodide of mercury, and a mixture of aethyle,
hydride of aethyle and olefiant gases.
     Ihave also made some preliminary experiments with other
metals, and find that most of them are capable of thus entering
into combination with the organic groups, methyle, aethyle, and
amyle; amongst those which thus combine under the influence
of light most readily, and seem to promise the most interesting
results,  Imay mention arsenic, antimony, chromium, iron, man
ganese and cadmium.                  I
                            hope to have the honour of laying
before the Royal Society, at an early period, the results of my
experiments upon these compounds.
   Imperfect as our knowledge of the organo-metallic bodies may
yet appear,       I
                am unwilling to close this memoir without direct
ing attention to some peculiarities in the habits of these com
pounds, which promise at least to throw some light upon their
rational constitution, if they do not lead to extensive modifica
tions of our views respecting chemical compounds in general,
and especially that interesting class termed conjugate compounds.
   That stanaethylium, zincmethylium, hydrargyromethylium, &c.
are perfectly analogous to cacodyle there can be no reasonable
doubt, inasmuch             as,
                        like that body, they combine directly with
the  electro-negative   metalloids forming true salts, from which,

but no compound corresponding to arsenic acid can be formed,
and yet it cannot be urged that cacodylic acid is decomposed by
the powerful reagents requisite to procure further oxidation, for
concentrated nitric acid may be distilled from cacodylic acid
without decomposition or oxidation in the slightest degree; the
same anomaly presents itself even more strikingly in the case of
stanaethylium, which, if we are to regard it as a conjugate radical,
ought to combine with oxygen in two proportions at least, to
form compounds corresponding to protoxide and peroxide of tin;
now stanaethylium rapidly oxidizes when exposed to the          and                        air
is converted into  pure  protoxide,  but this   compound    exhibits

                                             to
by then existing facts, had they not assumed, that the proper

undoubtedly have contributed           the development

to a still greater extent than it has already done; such an
 assumption could only have been made at a time when the data
 upon which it was founded were few and imperfect, and, as the
 study of the phaenomena of substitution progressed, it gradually
 became untenable, and the fundamental principles of the electro
 chemical theory again assumed their sway.            The formation and
 examination of the organo-metallic bodies promise to assist in
 effecting a fusion of the two theories which have so long divided
 the opinions of chemists, and which have too hastily been con
 sidered irreconcileable; for, whilst it is evident that certain
 types of series of compounds exist, it is equally clear that the
 nature of the body derived from the original type is essentially
 dependent upon the electro-chemical character of            single atoms,        its
and not    merely   upon  the relative  position      those atoms. Let of
us take, for instance, the compounds formed by zinc and anti
mony;      by  combination with         equiv.   l  oxygen the electroof
positive quality             of
                        the zinc      nearly  annihilated;

advance of our   knowledge       of the organic bases and their con
geners, cannot now long remain unanswered.                    -
   If the views which     I  have just ventured to suggest should be
as well borne out   by future researches as they are by the facts
already known, they must occasion a profound change in the
nomenclature of the extensive series of compounds affected by
them:   I   have not, however, ventured to introduce this new
system of nomenclature, even in the case of the new bodies
described in this memoir, since hasty changes of this kind, unless
absolutely necessary, are always to be deplored.         In accordance
with the suggested view of the constitution of the organo-metallic
compounds, the following plan of nomenclature would probably
be found most convenient.

 260          Mr. A. Tylor on Changes of the Sea-level effected by
gradual subsidence has occurred during that particular formation;
because the condition of equal depth of water during any deposit
might be produced either by subsidence of the sea-bottom or
elevation of the sea-level, or by both conjointly.
   In discussing these questions, the writer has not assumed that
during gradual subsidences or gradual elevations, greater denu
dations or depositions would occur than when the level of the land
and sea-bottom was stationary; because it is not certain, either
that during such gentle oscillations the forces that would pro
duce denudation are sensibly diminished or increased, or that
the rocks which are brought within the reach of denuding forces
are necessarily more easily worn away than those which were                                                  pre
viously exposed to the same influences.

    It has long been acknowledged that the quantity of detritus
annually carried into the ocean from various sources must dis
place an equal volume of water, and thus tend to raise the level
of the sea. Many years since it was estimated by an Italian
that this change might amount to one foot in a thousand years.
The general opinion on this subject has been, that the effects
produced by the present supplies of detritus would be too minute
to be perceptible, and on geological inquiries the ocean-level has
been considered as permanent for                        all
                                         practical purposes+.       here                             I

262            Mr. A. Tylor   on Changes   of the Sea-level effected by
are the same in this district at the same period of two consecu
tive years, the water sufficient to produce the above-mentioned
4 inches of the total of rain-fall upon the whole of this district
must have been annually derived from clouds which have been
charged with vapour in parts of the earth beyond the confines
of the tract of country under consideration; since, if the 4 inches
of rain annually carried into the Gulf of Mexico were not replaced
from foreign sources, the levels of the rivers, lakes, and springs
must rapidly fall.
   The estimate of denudation obtained from these countries may
be incorrect when applied to other lands differing in altitude and
receipt of rain.   Besides, many rivers empty themselves into
lakes and inland seas, and other extensive tracts are entirely
without rain.   Since there must thus be extensive districts which
contribute no detritus whatever to rivers, I propose to assume
that one-half the earth's surface only is drained by rivers flowing
directly into the sea”, and that the average supply of detritus
does not exceed that afforded by the district through which the
Mississippi flows (a country where there are no very high moun
tains, and only a moderate quantity of rain).
   The quantity of soluble salts annually carried into the ocean
must amount to a very large volume, particularly as river-water
always contains matter in solution, while it is only during two
or three months of the year that alluvium in suspension is carried
down in large quantities. The proportion of soluble salts in the
water of the Thames is 17 to 70,000, or 1 to 4117; while the
proportion of alluvium suspended in the water of the Mississippi
is as 1 to 3000+.
   The level of the land is as much reduced by what is carried
away in solution, as if this were mud and sand removed in sus
pension; and a submarine deposit formed from materials brought
into the sea in solution will displace a volume of water equal to
their former bulk; and therefore, when the annual supply of
soluble salts to the ocean does not exceed the quantity separated
from solution, the same effect will be produced upon the sea-level
by matter introduced, whether it be in solution or suspension.
While the proportion of the land to the ocean remains as 1 to 3f,
it is evident that a reduction of 3 feet in the mean surface-level

of land drained by rivers running into European lakes and inland seas may
be seen,

     The cliff on the western side of the harbour is about 1 mile
  long and 40 feet high, and the encroachment of the sea appears
  to have been at the rate of 1 foot per annum between the years
  1709 and 1756, so that the annual supply of detritus was equal
  to 40 cubic feet for each foot of frontage.        Between 1756 and
   1804 the advance increased to    nearly  2  feet per annum; so that
  the annual removal of cliff amounted to       nearly  80 cubic feet for
  each  foot of frontage.
     Between 1804 and 1844 the encroachment of the sea averaged
  10 feet per annum, and the annual removal of detritus must have
  amounted to 400 cubic feet for each foot of frontage.           It was
  during this latter  period that extensive  dredging   for cement stone
  took place at the base of the cliff.
     On the eastern side of the harbour events of an opposite cha
  racter have occurred, for Landguard Point has gained 50 feet
 per annum in length during the last 30 years. The addition
 thus made to the land, and to the “littoral zone,” presents an
 interesting example of the rapid accumulation of a local deposit
 under favourable circumstances.          From the appearance of the
 beach, it would appear that the shingle and sand of which it is
 formed have been brought from the north, in which direction
 there are recorded instances of great destruction of land

 storms during the last 300 years. The aspect, however, of much
of the coast-line appears as if it had remained unaltered for a
very long period, except in the manner Mr. R. A. C. Austen+
alludes to when he remarks, “that although the sea for months
together, and in places even for whole years, may not acquire

274           Mr. A. Tylor            on Changes        of the Sea-Level               effected by
country the large quantities of silt brought into them by winter
freshets do not tend to choke the channels, but that, at that
period of the year, former accumulations of deposit are actually
removed by the force of the stream; and therefore, that although
winter-freshets bring down silt with them, they carry into the
sea a larger quantity than they have introduced into river chan
nels.     If
           it were allowable to assume that the unequal supply of
water at different seasons of the year produces effects in the chan
nel of the Mississippi similar to these just described on our own
streams, the following account would represent the course of
events.   The diminution of the speed of the current of rivers
assists the deposition of silt upon their beds, as much as its
increased speed in the winter season favours                 removal. The      its
summer       deposit,  however thin        may    be,
                                                  it  cannot occur without
contracting the sizes                 of
                               the channel.
                                                                           -

                                                        rain would raise the

raise   it    to   its
                   former  capacity.     Accumulations         silt, small       of                     at

any one place, must each raise the water little above                  aproper
level, and the point                 of

small elevations amounts             more than the height
                                           to                       the banks           of

upon the banks they pass over, which increases the capacity                                             of
the channel; and until new deposit has again reduced the area
of  the stream below                 its
                              proper size, inundations will not occur.

 no  artificial banks. These banks assist the scouring power                                            of
rivers   in  winter, because they retain more water                the river;          in
but,     on the other   hand,   silt that would have been carried over
the banks         kept
                   is   within the channel, and this may            the reason           be
                         of
why the beds             navigable rivers have become

     This being admitted, we have     explanation       an

deep on one side and shallow on the other.        The principal
deposit therefore takes place on the shallow or quiet side, and
the principal removal occurs from the deep side where the cur
rent runs more quickly.
   This may explain why the traveller on the Mississippi sees for
hundreds of miles a caving bank on one side, and an advancing
sand-bar on the other (Lyell).             When the action of the river
is also unequal on its two banks in different places along                                                             its

the complete horse-shoe form, the water,             travelling round the       by
outer circumference           the bend, will have its effective speed

thus become more nearly equal                  parts                 all
                                                         the channel, and

276        Mr. A. Tylor         on Changes     of the Sea-Level               effected by
verted into lakes ordinarily communicating with the river, but
sometimes with the sea after high tides.
   The present marine or fluvio-marine deposits must be composed
of mud that has passed the mouth of the river, or washed up by the
sea, while the freshwater strata must be entirely formed from sand
and mud carried over the river banks, or deposited on the bot
tom of lakes supplied by the stream before it enters the Gulf of
Mexico.    An idea of the amount of denudation that has taken
place in the interior of N. America might be either obtained from
the extent of the marine deposits formed of mud that had passed
the mouth of the river, or from that of the purely fluviatile and
contemporaneous deposits formed from mud which had never
entered the Gulf of Mexico.
   But it is also               to estimate what proportion of the
                           necessary
 total quantity of mud brought down by the river is carried com
pletely out to sea, compared to what is left either upon the
marine or fluviatile portion of the delta.
    Sir Charles Lyell has remarked, that the alluvium now
remaining in the valley of the Mississippi can only represent a
fragment of what has passed into the Gulf of Mexico; and this
can readily be believed when we reflect upon the depth and
breadth of the channel, and upon the short period of the year
that the stream would throw any large quantity of mud into the
plains even if there were no artificial banks. We must also bear
in mind that only the coarse mud could settle near the shore,
for the finer particles could not deposit except in very deep water.
For these reasons, even if the mud carried beyond the mouth of
the river is only ten times the quantity left behind on the fluvia
tile portion of the delta and plains of the Mississippi, this amount
of detritus could not be obtained without the mean level of one
fifth part of North America being reduced 100 feet by denuda
tion affected by the action of rain, the atmosphere, and running
water*. But Hutton (vol.                      p.

XLIII.    Analysis of a Siliceous Deposit from the hot Volcanic
    Springs of Taupo, New Zealand.    By J. W. MALLET, Ph.D.”
Thisconcretion,
       substance occurs as a porous but tolerably compact
                opake, and of a white colour slightly tinged
with yellow, very tough and difficult to break, and intermediate
in hardness between felspar and quartz.
   Its specific gravity, taken in small fragments, is 2-031.
   Digested in a cold solution of caustic potash it dissolves almost
completely, though with great slowness.
   It was analysed by fusion with carbonate of soda in the usual
way, the portion employed being first dried at 212° in order to
separate merely hygroscopic moisture.
   By digesting the finely pulverized mineral in boiling water,            I
found on testing the water with nitrate of silver that some soluble
compound of chlorine was present; and by employing a larger
quantity of the siliceous sinter, having separated the chloride of
silver and removed the excess of silver by muriatic acid, on eva
poration to dryness the substance in combination with the chlo
rine was found to be sodium. Nothing but chloride of sodium
had been dissolved out by the water; and by testing the solution
of the portion thus washed obtained after fusion with an alkali,
it appeared that of by the chlorine existed      such, and had
                                                             as            all

according to the two methods.          They are reproduced here in
terms of the same notation, and with the same numbers affixed.
The first-mentioned method is expressed by the formulae (16),
(17), (18), and the other by (8) . . . . (15).        The formulae
marked with letters     (a),  (b), &c. in the present paper express
details of which                I
                     had not preserved exact memoranda.
   Let A and B designate the two spherical conductors; let a
and b be their radii, respectively; and let c be the distance
between their centres.       Let them be charged with such quanti
ties of electricity, that, when no other conductors and no excited
electrics are near them, the values of the potential+ within them
may be u and v respectively.
   The distribution of electricity on each surface may be deter
mined with great facility by applying the “principle of suc
cessive influences” suggested by Murphy (Murphy’s Electri
city, Cambridge, 1833, p. 93), and determining the effect of
each influence by the method of “electrical images,” given in a
paper entitled “Geometrical Investigations regarding Spherical
Conductorst.” The following statement shows as much as is
required of the results of this investigation for our present
purpose.
   Let us imagine an electrical point containing a quantity of
electricity equal to ua to be placed at the centre of A, and an
other vb at the centre of B. The image of the former in B will be

Hence,       and E denote the quantities of electricity on the two

spheres  in the present case, and if W denote the mechanical
value of the distribution of electricity on them, we have

Now if the two spheres, kept insulated, be pushed towards one
another, so as to diminish the distance between their centres
from c to c—de, the quantity of work that will have to be spent
will be F. de, since F denotes the repulsive force against which
this relative motion is affected.   But the mechanical value of
the distribution in the altered circumstances must be increased
by an amount equal to the work spent in producing no other
effect but this alteration. Hence F. de= —d W, and therefore

there could scarcely, I apprehend, have been found any difficulty
in the demonstration, and that there is no necessity for any indi
rectness of procedure in    according    the common apprehen

sion of the term indirect.
     Mr. Sylvester                makes           an
                                             inquiry also regarding      theorem,                        a
            of to. we
which              may,        if   wechoose, treat    subordinate    as
                                                                       that above                   to
alluded                      The data are, that straight lines are drawn from the
middle                  an   arc,   that the portions
                                    so                    these lines intercepted
                                                                            of
between the chord and the opposite part
                                                                                      be of
                                                the circumference
shall   be
        equal.  The conclusion sought                      that the              to           proved     is,
portions    the lines between the chord and the arc are equal;
or, which      is of
             the same thing, that the sums       both portions are.                    of
equal.   Now here are three positions, such that any one being
assumed       portion
                as
                a          the hypothesis, the other two become
                                            of
easy conclusions; any case being converse        any other.   Now                       to
it may      be
          stated       general rule, that
                                   as   a   converse   most easily           a                      is
and elegantly established                              by
                                    indirect demonstration. an The
correct mode                 in
                  such cases therefore       proceed directly with         is,   to
that demonstration which          the most easy, and
                                                  is        take the others                    to
indirectly         as        its
                    converses.    These easier cases are determined by
this principle, viz. that the constituents, whether lines            angles,                                 or
whose relations are assumed             data, are,           their position,
                                                            as                         as      to
origin,      termination, connected with points, the relations                                                             of
         to or
which      others are settled                          by
                                     theorems already known.          When
the data are       regardin    origin,  position,
                                            to          termination,  other           or
wise dispersed, the demonstration ought

and    be indirect. But            not necessarily indirect,
                                            it    is                                                      or     is   so   in

                        avoided. This        easily settled. The position

isa   mean proportional between the whole straight lines and their
nearer portions.      This necessarily and directly affords the con
clusions, that these wholes and portions are equal each               each.                                   to
    From this we can show          directly,  that      two  triangles  have      if
equal bases, equal vertical angles, and equal angle-bisectors                                                              at

    If elementary books of geometry were, like those of more
modern sciences, accommodated to the character of the age, it
could not, I presume, have happened that any one should have
felt puzzled by such theorems as the above. The general rela
tions of the subjects considered would then be better understood.
The theorem now discussed is only a modified instance of one
more general, viz. that in any triangle the smaller angle has the
larger bisector.      Both may be deductions from the following
                                       of all
position, viz. that of       straight lines passing through the same
point      in
           the bisector         angle, and limited
                                                an        constituents,                  by   its
that which has the smaller inclination             the bisector     the        to                             is
longer, and those that are equally inclined            the bisector are              to
equal, and conversely,                          by
                                direct demonstration, those which are
 equal are equally inclined.
    From these truths                      we
                               may derive the modified case relating
to  the isosceles triangle, either directly    indirectly; the indirect   or
 mode   being,         as
                      the case
                            is generally  when      properly employed,         it

 the easiest and the most elegant.

from this     coarse experiment                  to one more             delicate,          where nature
herself has imposed the conditions of aggregation.                                          A plate taken
from    a mass of shale, picked up a few weeks ago in the coal district
of   Blackburn, was suspended between the poles; although strongly
magnetic, it set its longest dimension at right angles to the line
joining the poles. This deportment was at once explained by re
 ference to the structure of the mass: it also, though apparently
 compact, was composed of layers transverse to its length; these
layers set from pole to pole, and hence the length equatorial.           Let
 us ascend to a case still more refined. A crystal of sulphate of
 nickel was suspended between the poles, and on exciting the magnet
 a certain determinate position was taken up by the crystal.            The
 substance was magnetic, still                   its

 pole. The crystal was removed from the magnetic field and the edge
of   a penknife placed along the line which set axial        slight pressure      ;   a

the case at once flash upon him : Would he not regard this de
portment as a beautiful, but still special example of that all-pervading
law with which he was previously acquainted         Would he not con
gratulate himself on the possibility thus opened to him of searching
out the mysteries of crystalline structure, and rendering apparent to
his mental eye the manner in which the molecules are aggregated
together      He would never have assumed the existence of forces al
together new to account for the observed actions; much less would
he have affirmed that they were wholly independent of magnetism or
diamagnetism; for he would know beforehand that the modification
of these forces by the peculiarities of aggregation was the exact
thing calculated to produce the phaenomena. But magnecrystallic
action was discovered when its universality was unknown; and
hence its discoverer was led to regard it as something unique.         A
great temptation lay in his way : years before, a magnet, now
present, had twisted a ray of light, and thus suggested a connexion
between light and magnetism.         What wonder then if this unifying
instinct, this yearning to find the mystic bond which unites these
forces, this prediction of the human mind that all the forces of
nature are but branches of a common root, -what wonder, I say, if

body.     Anything therefore which tends to increase density increases
magnetic power; and whatever diminishes density diminishes mag
netic power also. Knowing this, the conclusion is inevitable, that
the local action of the sun upon the earth's crust must influence, in
some degree, the resultant effect.         The action here meant is wholly
different from that hitherto       speculated  on, and which had reference
to the  generation     of thermo-electric currents which affect the needle.
The   simple   mechanical change of density is what is meant.            It is a
true cause, and no complete theory can omit taking it into account.
   The Lecturer then proceeded to remark on the influence of geo
logical changes upon the earth as a magnet, and concluded as follows:

   With regard to the second group, the period of revolution of the

the period of the eighth, Japhet, five times that of the sixth, Titan.

   Of the satellites of Jupiter, it is known that the period of revo
lution of the first is about one-half that of the second, which is itself
again one-half the period of the third satellite.     M. Behr also points
out that the  period   of revolution of the fourth satellite is double that
of the third, plus 3 of the difference between the periods of the
second and the first.

L.    On the Relations between the Atomic Weights of analogous
            Elements.   By               J.
                              H. GLADstoNE, Ph.D.”
      HEMISTS     who have turned their attention to the series
        of numbers representing the atomic weights of the ele
mentary bodies, have frequently remarked curious relations
between them.     It is between similar elements that these nume
rical relations occur.; and to such an extent is this the case, that
Berzelius, after mentioning numerous instances, says, “We see
that bodies which present the same properties up to a certain
point have certain relations between their atomic weightst.”
   To illustrate this statement, to show the extent of        truth,       its
and    todraw certain analogical inferences tending     the  proper   to
understanding      of
                    such    fact, are the objects

  If  we glance at this list we notice some peculiarities, but no
very striking ones.   We might ask, for instance, Why should
there be so   many  elements congregated about No. 28; and,
again, about 52 : Why should there be only one atomic weight
between 80 and 99, and then a group of four *
   The following letter, kindly sent me by Professor De Morgan,
will give the data for calculating the probabilities of this.                                 I

     Looking more closely into this arrangement                                  of    numbers,        we
shall find the observation                of
                             Berzelius borne out                                in   every instance,
but one,        of
               well-defined chemical group.
                     a

              Atomic Weights                  of analogous Elements.                    317
   These numerical relations are of three kinds.     The atomic
weights of analogous elements may be the same; or may be in
multiple proportion; or may differ by certain increments.
   Of the first class we remark the strictly analogous metals,
chromium 26:7, manganese 27-6, iron 28, cobalt 29.5, and
nickel 29-6. Then a double group of the platinum ore metals:—
palladium 53-3, rhodium, 52:2, and ruthenium 52:2; and also
platinum 98-7, iridium 99, and osmium 99-6. We are tempted
to add to this—mercury 100. Again, in the mineral cerite we
find together—cerium 47, lanthanium 47, and didymium 50. It
has been remarked, not only that the metals of each of these
groups have similar properties and weights, but that they are
found associated together in nature. The question has often
been   put,  Would more accurate determinations show these
atomic  weights to be not nearly but exactly the same? It may
be doubted. Yet it ought to be remembered that these numbers
are the actual results of experiment, and are not controled by
any theory, as is always the case with organic compounds.
   As to the second class of numerical relations among atomic
weights, namely, multiple proportions, Who has failed to remark
that the platinum group has double the atomic weight of the
palladium group, and that gold 197 is again the double of pla
tinum ? These two pairs have frequently been noticed—boron
10.9, and silicon 21.3; oxygen 8, and sulphur 16. We now
come to a large group, those metals whose oxides principally
affect an acid character, being also insoluble in water. The
highest of these in weight is tantalum 184; half 184 is                                 92–
the equivalent of tungsten; half 92 is 46—the equivalent of
molybdenum; and half 46 is 23—just below the recognized
equivalent of titanium 25*.   Three times 23 is 69: now 68-6
is the equivalent of vanadium, being intermediate between tung
sten  and molybdenum.      Tin has certain claims to be grouped
along with the same elements;        equivalent  its
                                                   58: now 57-5        is
would   be   two and  ahalf times 23, and intermediate between
molybdenum and vanadium.        Taking 11-5     the basis number as
of this series, we have—

   Silicon is certainly very similar to the first of this group, tita

of Gmelin given above.    They are—
The metals of the alkalies:—

The members              of    the last two groups generally occur together                                         in
nature.
   There are certain analogies which may perhaps lead                                                          us   to
some understanding                  of
                            these facts.
   First,     in
              the case where there       the same atomic weight.
                                                         is                                                         If

                         element were carried through
                                   an                                 com                         all    its
pounds, we should have what occurs                 the iron and similar    in
series.    The only partial instances        this which       of
                                                             remember are              I

                         of          remarked      asBerzelius, and silicic     by
acid, the two conditions         which bear  of  striking analogy      athe                                  to
two   allotropic forms      the  elementary
                                    of        silicon itself.
   Secondly,         in
                   the case      multiple atomic weights,

examples       organic chemistry?

                                           the modifications
                                                        to           metal,                           of a

whatever source,          always the same mercury.

                               is
     Thirdly,      in
                the case where     element     intermediate proper

             intermediate atomic weight.      regard this     strictly I                                as

respect the one quasi-metal differed from another, we should
have a series of bodies precisely analogous to the metals of the
alkalies: but we do know
                                             it;       we
                                   know that methyle hydrogen                               is

series   is,

This will equally apply       any other cases
                                         to         the addition                of                           of

  Why should this numerical relation always give                                                us     triads?

      I
    believe that, with one exception, every well-defined group of
elements has been considered under these three classes. That
 exception is in the case of arsenic and antimony, which are un
 questionably analogous, phosphorus being also closely allied to
 them: the three are placed together in Gmelin's arrangement,
          I
 but see no ratio between their numbers 31, 75, 129. Schroet
 ter’s reduction of the equivalent of phosphorus has prevented
 our considering antimony, 129, as four times that element. It
is, however, double tellurium, 642, which                some respects
                                                              is   in                             an

                               perhaps not inelegant, cannot pretend
to be important: indeed a hint has been given (in a note) of a
quite elementary way, in which they may be geometrically
demonstrated.     But I think that the analytical process, by which
I was led to the formulae of art. 5, whereof the geometrical state
ments of art. 6 are in part an interpretation, may deserve to be
considered with attention, on account of the novelty of the
method employed: and especially for the examples which it sup
plies of calculation with biquaternions.

where h is used as a temporary and abridged symbol for the old

 M-1,   and regarded as being always a free or commutative factor
in any multiplication: so that

now proved, a posteriori, by actual substitution, that those expres

but having  once come to see that this result held     good, it was
easy then to pass to a much more simple proof, such as that
given in the last-cited article, which was entirely independent of
the imaginary symbol here called h, and employed only real
quaternions.
    12. It may be regarded as still more remarkable, that the
same real results are obtained, when we combine a real root with
an imaginary one, instead of combining two real roots or two
imaginary ones. Thus the quadratic” equation (15) has one
root, namely k, which must be considered as real in this theory,
whether by contrast to the symbol h (or to the old imaginary of
algebra), or because in the geometrical interpretation it is con
 structed by a real line, namely by the chord CE drawn to the
point of contact E of the spheric surface (8) with the right line
 (9), under the condition (13); c, and 8 being then for conve
 nience replaced, as in art. 5, by the more special symbols                                                    i–k

more generally admitted by the best and most competent in
quirers. Forms as extreme as any that can be found within
the pale of the same species are to be found within that of the
species Homo. Transitions as gradual as those between any
varieties elsewhere are also to be found.       In summing up the
value of the data supplied by man towards the natural history of
varieties, it may be said that they are those of a species which has
its geographical distribution everywhere, and a moral as well as
a physical series of characteristics.   Surely if the question under
notice be a   question that must be studied inductively, Man gives
us the field for our induction.

328               Dr. Latham on the Subjectivity of
closely can most accurately and conveniently be grouped. When
this is done, the more distant outliers will be distributed over
the debateable ground of an equivocal frontier. To recapitulate:
varieties as opposed to species imply transitional forms, whilst
transitional forms preclude definite lines of demarcation.
    Yet what is the actual classification of the varieties of man
kind, and what is the current nomenclature? To say the least, it is
very like that of the species of a genus.      Blumenbach’s Mon
golian, Blumenbach’s Caucasian, Blumenbach’s AEthiopian,—
where do we find the patent evidence that these are the names of
varieties rather than species? Nowhere.       The practical proof of
a clear consciousness on the part of a writer that he is classifying
varieties rather than species, is the care he takes to guard his
reader against mistaking the one for the other, and the attention
he bestows on the transition from one type to another. Who
has ever spent much ethnology on this? So far from learned
men having done this, they have introduced a new and lax term
—race.     This means something which is neither a variety nor
yet a species—a tertium quid. In what way it differs from the
other denominations has yet to be shown.
    Now if it be believed (and this belief is assumed) that the
varieties of mankind are varieties of a species only, and if it can
not be denied that the nomenclature and classification of ethno
logists is the nomenclature and classification of men investigating
the species of a genus, what is to be done? Are species to be ad
mitted, or is the nomenclature to be abandoned?         The present
remarks are made with the view of     showing  that the adoption of
either alternative would be inconsiderate, and that the existing
nomenclature, even when founded upon the assumption of broad
and trenchant lines    of demarcation   between varieties which (ea.
vi termini) ought to graduate into each other, is far from being
indefensible.
    Man conquers man, and occupant displaces occupant on the
earth's surface.    By this means forms and varieties which once
existed become extinct.      The more this extinction takes place,
the greater is the obliteration of those transitional and interme
diate forms which connect extreme types; and the greater this
obliteration, the stronger the lines of demarcation between geo
graphically contiguous families. Hence a variational modification
of a group of individuals simulates a difference of species; forms
which were once wide apart being brought into juxtaposition by
means of the annihilation of the intervening transitions. Hence
what we of the nineteenth century,         ethnologists, politicians,
naturalists, and the like—behold in the way of groups, classes,
tribes, families, or what not, is beholden to a great extent under
the guise of species; although they may not be so in reality,

duated into another and the integrity of the chain of likeness
was intact.      This explains the term subjectivity. A group is

   3. The    circumpolar populations supply similar illustrations.
Beginning with Scandinavia, the Lap stands in remarkable con
trast with the Norwegian of Norway, and the Swede of Sweden.
Why is this? Because the Northman represents a population
originally German,—a population which, however much it may
have graduated into the type of the most southern congeners of
the Lap, is now brought into contact with a very different mem
ber of that stock.                                           -
   4. This phaenomenon repeats itself in the arctic portions of
America, where the Algonkin and Loucheux Indians (Indians of
the true American type) come in geographical contact, and in
physiological contrast, with the Eskimo.    Consequently along
 the Loucheux and Algonkin frontiers the line of demarcation
 between the Eskimo and the Red Indian (currently so-called) is
abrupt and trenchant.      Elsewhere, as along the coast of the
Pacific, the two classes of population graduate into each other.

 between the cases where no      nitric acid is present, and where    it
 occurs, when the substance is heated with muriatic acid and
 the ferrocyanide. When nitric acid is not present, the mixture
 quickly becomes of a blue colour; but where that acid exists, it
 first becomes of a yellowish-green, then of an olive or dark brown ;
 but these indications alone are not sufficient to prove the     pre
 sence or absence of nitric acid, until afterwards confirmed by the
 action of an alkaline sulphuret.       In heating the mixture, the
temperature stated should be maintained for a few moments          till
it ceases to acquire a darker shade, thereby indicating that all
the nitroprusside is formed.
     Sulphuric acid may be substituted for muriatic in using this
 test; but    I prefer the latter, as being more easily procured
pure, and as strong sulphuric acid aided by heat will decompose
the nitroprussides.
     This test may also admit of application to nitrous acid and
the nitrites; but as those compounds are comparatively unim
portant,    I will not now enter on this subject.
Ll W.    On a proposed Test of the Necessity of Indirect Proof      in
     Geometrical Demonstrations,     with Remarks on Methods        of
    Demonstration.      By JAMEs ADAMSON, D.D.
                         [Continued from p. 299.]
    T   does not seem difficult to discover a characteristic capable
       of determining what are the character, relation, and effect
of truths of different orders employed in reasoning. All truths
so employed, in a definite series of arguments, are separable into
two divisions, according as they are, or are not, primarily made
use of as hypotheses. We are perfectly sure that that proposi
tion is essential, which is either singly modified to become a con
clusion, or which is combined with something else to constitute
a conclusion.      Any other truths expressible in general terms,
can be introduced only to facilitate the transition from the one
form of statement, or the hypothesis, to the other form or con
clusion. They therefore are auxiliary only, and the employment
of them individually will be contingent on the form of argument
which may be adopted.
    Names employed to designate such orders of truths ought to
classify distinctly things so different.    No truth of the essential
or  hypothesis   class should rank  among   those of the individually
non-essential, or auxiliary class.     The distinction does not rest
on a proposition being more or less certain, or more or less ob
vious, but on their well-defined dissimilarity in use and value.
This is dependent on a difference in generality of character; for

that which is only auxiliary in one science, may be auxiliary in
others also.       Aviom is the title for such auxiliary truths, and it
ought to be restricted to them alone.
    With a correct nomenclature, therefore, the question whether
axioms in geometry are essential as the foundations of                      theo                                     its
rems,       easily settled. They enter into
            is                                            hypothesis, and are             no
therefore not essential, but are auxiliary only.                  The relations
expressed             by
                  them necessarily occur, but the expressions               them                                     of
in  general terms, which make them                    axioms, are non-essen    to    be
tial.       Infact those truths          which the name     to    generally ap                         is
plied, are corollaries from definitions
                                                                                    on of

                  axioms     depends    therefore      the existence         such                                    of

Nothing purely geometric can enter among them.               Axioms in
fact may be either corollaries or theorems.        In the former case,
they may need no demonstration, or may be termed self-evident;
in the latter case, they may, in some instances, to some minds,
and in some instances, to                     all
                                 minds, require demonstration; but
this does not affect their essential nature, nor the relations they
bear  to the subjects           of
                         specific sciences.
   Everything, except their application, ought               eliminated                to      be
from the reasonings        specific sciences; and

ally.   Geometry therefore has not assumed               proper logical             its
form until we have relieved its demonstrations from all those
portions      them which constitute reasonings applicable not

endeavour, though sometimes unconsciously,                       geometry,        to     in
definitions must be made the foundation of all conclusions. Pro
perties     objects are necessarily derived from their nature, either
           of
when assumed for consideration individually,                  combination,        or   in

Postulates are therefore inadmissible, except they be of such a
character as determines the whole processes of the science; such
as, that things defined or proved may be exemplified, or that ob
jects may be conceived to be superimposed, &c. Any proper
ties becoming the foundation of argument must belong to the
nature of the things argued about, and must be found in defini
tions, or in conclusions from them.
    A definition ought to express a single property of the thing
defined. To object to a definition that it contains something
which may be proved, is futile; for any property may become a
conclusion, if some other be assumed as the hypothesis.              But a
 definition must not contain both a hypothesis and a conclusion,
as is the case with some proposed definitions of parallelism, such
as, their equidistance at indefinite points, or their common incli
nation to indefinite straight lines.
    Things ought to be considered in the first instance individu
 ally, and as they are in themselves, without involving them in
 combinations. Common sense or sound logic, therefore, requires
 that when, in constructing definitions, we find more properties
 than one of an object offered to our choice, we should prefer
 that which, assumed as a hypothesis, affords the shortest and
 clearest arguments.       Thus there are three properties character
 izing straightness of line. Now if we assume as the defining
 property minimum distance, expressed in the formula “shorter
 than any other between two points,” we establish at once,—
 1st, the property of singleness; 2nd, that of coincidence.             We
 cannot attain the same result, of thus instantly proving all, if
 we assume either of the others as the definition.
     When the hypothesis of a proposition is single, it can have
 but one converse statement. Such propositions ought perhaps
 to be termed corollaries. A normal theorem is a proposition in
 which the hypothesis is twofold.                           Its
                                                  demonstration     the is        lo
 gical combination     of these two truths.      There are therefore three
 truths    sorelated, that two being assumed         hypothesis, the other
                                                                  as
 follows as   conclusion.     Hence such       theorem has two converse
                                                           a
 forms.     Now         obvious that when the hypothesis announced
                  it
                  is
 is, strictly and solely, that which          used     the argument, and
                                                      is           in
 the conclusion announced                 is,
                                     strictly   and  solely,  that which           is
  gained    by the combination,                 all
                                        converses are necessarily true.
 All apparent exceptions          this arise from incorrect statements
                                     to
of    hypotheses,     or   of
                            conclusions.      This logical position may
 therefore legitimately         be

parallelograms have equal diagonals;”            that we may have the           to
direct negative; “Non-rectangular parallelograms have unequal
diagonals,” without determining the inequality.                                                                             be,

of  course,   converse affirmative, and
                          a                  converse negative. Now        a
we shall find that       we demonstrate any two which are either
                                         if

criteria, from any one       these dualisms,   of   determine      cases;         to                        all
while the other two possible arrangements                 not serve that                    do
purpose.                  It
                   therefore sufficient

the direct affirmative and       converse.     This      the  proceeding                   is
which the mutual relation        such truths always suggests.
     Ifwe assume      the defining characteristic
                                     as                  proportion that                   of

tients, we                 do
                 not find this criterion           readily  applicable     to
geometrical magnitudes.        Euclid's criterion,     his definition,                   in                                is to

  stated.                   It is
                  therefore of importance that the latter be derived
 from the former by rigid argument.                 The question being,
 whether ratios are equal or not equal, there will be four state
 ments, by which relations between the two properties may be
indicated.
    1. In regard to four proportionals, equimultiples of alternate
 terms, when compared adjacently, have symmetrical relations as
to magnitude.
    2. In regard to four non-proportionals, equimultiples of alter
 nate terms, when compared adjacently, have non-symmetrical
relations as to magnitude.
    3. Four magnitudes, of which the alternate equimultiples,
when compared adjacently, have symmetrical relations as to
magnitude, are proportionals.
    4. Four magnitudes, of which the alternate equimultiples,
when compared adjacently, have non-symmetrical relations as to
magnitude, are not proportionals.
    Of these four statements, two are enough to afford criteria
both of proportionals and of non-proportionals.              But to serve
this end, we must, as has been already stated, take either, two
which are converse to each other, or else those which are both
affirmative, or else those which are both negative. To take the
second and third, or the first and fourth, will not suit.
    The character of a definition is such, that its direct and con
verse statements are both applicable.           Hence Euclid's criterion
of proportion includes both the first and third. When, how
ever, we treat                         all
                         theorems dependent  as     equality     fractions,    on               of
the case     different.                 treat the first and fourth only,

   Again, if there be two magnitudes D and F, and a third
magnitude C such that when equimultiples are taken of D and
F it is found that no multiple of C can exceed either of the
equimultiples nD or n F, without also exceeding the other, then
D is equal to F. For if either of them as F be the greater, or
F= D +Q, then substituting D + Q for F, and assuming n such
that n() is greater than C, we must have mo greater than
nD+ C when mG is greater than nD, whatever m may be ; or in

altered intercellular substance, acquired a still darker hue, whilst
those, on the contrary, which were stained by the reduced silver
became somewhat paler, as if a portion of the argentine film were
soluble in that menstruum ; though it should be observed, that
no further effect was produced on the stain even by a protracted
digestion in ammonia.      Now, upon making comparative experi
ments with a piece of the linen wrapper that had been recently
‘marked in the usual way with a solution of nitrate of silver,
the fibres were found to present a very similar appearance to that
before described; the only difference being that the yellow
coloration was not quite so distinct, and more of the silver
stain was removed by the solution of ammonia; whereas on the
other hand, fibres that had been stained by solutions of chloride
and oxide of silver in ammonia were uniformly coloured of a dark
brown or black, and exhibited no trace of yellow coloration.
   These results, conjoined with the corroded state of the linen in
the vicinity of the marks, justify us,                    I
                                           think, in concluding that
the ancient Egyptians were really acquainted with nitric acid;
and, as my father has already suggested, employed the nitrate of
silver as a marking-fluid.    In what manner, however, they pre
pared the acid, whether by the distillation of the nitrate of soda

methods of accounting for ground ice by Dr. Farquharson and
M. Arago to my friend Mr. James Elliot, then resident on the
banks of the river Teviot; he there tested the theories of the
formation of ground ice by the facts presented to him through
a careful examination of the bed of the river, and came to the
conclusion that they did not agree well with one another. After
a lapse of some time I submitted to him a new explanation of
the phaenomenon    of the appearance of ground ice, which was
based on details given in Mr. Knight and Mr. Eisdale’s published
papers on the subject”, and also from the valuable evidence sup
plied by Mr. Elliot against the theories in question. The theory
I gave of the formation of ground ice was, that it was      formed                                       all

qualified sense. When water has different temperatures at dif
ferent depths, for example, 35° at the bottom and 31° at the
surface, then it is easy to see that motion, by mixing the water
at 35° with the surface-water, must retard                     freezing; and this           its

formation of ground ice, that in the Teviot he often found it in
plenty in localities where the stream appeared to be well-shaded
by trees. The fact of ground ice being found in such places at once
shows that it never could have been produced there, for to form
surface-ice in small quantity under an arch requires a more intense
frost than we had had. The temperature of the stream where
the ice was found under the arch was 32°, atmosphere 36°5;
the thickness of the ice on exposed ditches measured

2 inches.
    Wherever there are running streams readily cooled down to
 32°, there can be no doubt about ground ice being found, but
 this temperature is essential; for if the water of the stream rise
 only a small portion of a degree above the freezing-point, the
 ground ice soon disappears.
    While examining the waters in the vicinity of Altcar, have                                   I
 often tried to estimate the relative power of a stream and of a stag
 nant water in producing ice. The Brook appears to come so soon

that the stream has brought it there. But where the icy spiculae
were formed, and when they were lodged, are questions that
require a local inspection before an attempt could be made to
answer them. In the basin drained by the Neva, consisting of
lakes, swamps, and mountain ranges on its confines, these spi
culae may have had a long journey from the interior before they
reached their place of rest, the five months’ winter to which the
region is subjected affording ample time for the transit.
    In the Tay, near Perth, it has been noticed that ground ice
makes       itsappearance before surface-ice; and when the latter
has become strong enough            walk on, the subaqueous ice may

     The purity        of    the copper               is       remarkable           at   this stage             of    the

                     Mr.  J.  Napier on Copper Smelting.          347
operation. We have seen moss upon blue metal from the most
impure ores equally as good as that from the best.
    When blue metal is put into water immediately after setting,
it assumes a red-brown colour. When this is examined with
a lens, the colour is seen to be caused by the reduction of copper
in fine grains, not only over the surface but through the mass,
bearing out the supposition that the copper moss may be pro
duced by moisture.
    Copper moss occasionally occurs in some of the other opera
tions, but it is most common in the blue metal.
    The sharp slags obtained with the blue metal are also of varied
composition.        The following three analyses give a fair average
of their qualities:–

    Some of the iron in these analyses was in a higher state of
oxidation than protoxide.
    By referring to the table of equivalents of flux for silica,
p. 455, vol. iv., the value of these sharp slags will be apparent,
and also the proper proportions in which they should be added
to an ore. Taking the mean of these analyses, we have—
                       Silica    .    .   .   .    . 37.5
                       Oxide of iron      .   .    . 56°l

                                                     95.9
not including the copper. Then, as 46 silica requires 36 oxide
 of iron, the 37-5 will take 30 of the oxide of iron, leaving upwards
 of 27 per cent. of these sharp slags available as flux.
    Several modifications have been introduced at this stage of the
 operation.      Some smelters, instead of tapping the mat into
 sand-beds to make blue metal, tap it into deep pits of water in
 the same manner as we have described for coarse metal, granu
 lating it for the purpose of giving it another calcination. When
 this is done, the granulated mat is termed fine metal, in contra
 distinction to coarse metal.
    The calcination of the fine metal is conducted in the same
 manner as that of the coarse metal, and the chemical changes
 which take place in the furnace are the same. When the cal
 cined fine metal is fused, some refinery slags rich in copper are

   The mat or metal will be described further on. This calcina
tion and fusing replaces a roasting of 24 hours; and where the
process of selecting is required, it is considered preferable.
   When oxides and carbonates, such as the Australian ores, are
on hand, they are generally fused with the calcined coarse metal,
by which means a double advantage is obtained; the excess of
oxide of iron in the calcined metal fluxes the silica of the ore
which has little iron, and the copper in the ore is converted into
subsulphuret, a condition necessary for reduction by the present
method of smelting. The produce of this fusion is a mat termed
pimpled metal, from            its
                         having small rough pimples      the sur                             on

  The reactions which occur in the process of roasting are the
same.   The oxygen of the air combines in the first place with a
portion of the sulphur, forming sulphurous acid. A portion of
the copper is also oxidized, and instantly reacts upon another
portion of the subsulphuret, reducing the metal, as shown above.
The process is a very beautiful one, and exhibits a nice adapta
tion of principles to practice. The sponge regulus has a specific
gravity of 5, the reduced copper about 8; so that the copper
sinks to the bottom where it is protected, and a new surface of
regulus becomes exposed to the action of the air.
     If
      the ore was pure, or if no select copper is required, the
operation of roasting is continued until the whole of the copper
is reduced, when it is tapped out into sand-moulds, forming
coarse copper, bed copper, pimpled copper, or blistered copper,
according to quality.    The term coarse copper is applied occa
sionally to      all
                these kinds except the blistered.       the ingot sets                            If

    Copper bottoms are occasionally found at the bottom of the
first pig in roasting blue metal; these are more impure than
when selected ore is used, and is no doubt the sort given by
Le Play. They are also found in fusing calcined coarse metal
with Australian ores, and in fusing calcined fine metal. When
best select is to be made from Cornish ores, the last process is
considered best.    The method of selecting is sometimes practised
with inferior ores to obtain tough cake copper.
    The next operation the copper is subjected to depends in a
great measure upon the quality of the copper obtained from the
roasting operation.     If it be blistered, nothing further is required
but refining; but if coarse copper, it must have another roasting.
In some smelting-works it is put into the refining-furnace and
there roasted before refining; in other works a separate furnace
is used for this operation, in which it is brought to the quality
of blister. The separate furnace is preferable, as it preserves
the refining-furnace from being contaminated with impure metal,
a prevalent source of annoyance.          This roasting is done in the
same manner as described for the        regulus.    About four tons of
coarse copper form a charge.          The high heat required to fuse
the copper facilitates the scorifying of the alloy. The action may
be defined thus:—the copper is oxidized by the air, which oxide

  This white metal is used for making buttons and such articles
as are cast, and is sold for little more than the value of the
copper it contains.  Any process that would separate the tin
easily from the copper, and make it marketable, would be of
importance to the smelter.

duced into both circuits.     By suitable arrangements the hydro
electric current   may  electrolyse  a large quantity of water in a
given time, whereas the thermo-electric current will not evolve a
single bubble of gas, however long the action be continued.
   Perfectly similar phaenomena may be observed on comparing
two hydro-electric currents, one of which arises from a battery
of a great many small elements, the other from a battery of only
a few large cells.   The electro-magnetic and the electro-chemical
effect of both may be exactly the same, or even the latter may
prove to be the stronger when thus tested; and yet on submit
ting the human body to the former current it may experience a
powerful shock, whereas on submitting it to the latter one there
will not be the slightest perception of pain.
   Puzzled by these contradictory results, electricians had recourse
to the hypothesis of two distinct qualities, which they assumed
to belong to every current, namely intensity and quantity. They
admitted that the electro-magnetic and the electro-chemical
action of the current gave the measure of the so-called quantity
of electricity, and the amount of specific power to overcome any
obstacle brought into
ments, the additional length
                              path (in the  its

                                            intensity.   Thus       was                        it

term in any one cycle is a periodic function of the third order of
every term in either of the other two cycles; a sort of relation

  The Principles of Mechanical Philosophy applied to Industrial         Me
     chanics.   By Thomas Tate, F.R.A.S.              London: Longman,
     Brown, Green and Longmans. 1853.
  A     BOOK containing 342 pages so usefully filled it has rarely
         been our lot to peruse.      The matter is well-chosen, well-ar
 ranged, and treated in a manner which proves how thoroughly com
 petent the author is to execute the task which he has undertaken.
 A considerable portion of the work is devoted to questions of the
 highest practical importance.         It is hardly generous to take    ex
 ception to a single passage of so excellent a volume, yet we cannot
 help thinking, that, in reference to the loss of work alluded to in
 page 187, Mr. Tate is unconsciously transmitting an opinion belong
 ing to an epoch of science which he has evidently left behind him.
 Even here, however, he might retort that the fallacy of the said
 opinion is not yet universally acknowledged.           The exercises ap
 pended to each section of the book cannot fail to enhance its value
to both teacher and student.

   1853.           1. “On the determination of the Mean Temperature
 of   every  day  in the year, as deduced from the Observations taken
at the    Royal   Observatory,   Greenwich, in the Years from 1814 to
 1851.”     By  James  Glaisher,   Esq., F.R.S.
     This paper  has for its object  the determination of the true distri
bution of heat over the year, and is based upon an extensive series of
observations taken at the Royal Observatory during thirty-eightyears.
     In order to obtain a correct determination of the mean daily tem
perature of each month, necessary to the proposed object, the author
at the commencement of his memoir explains how the entire series
 of observations has been divided into groups, according to the re
 corded times of observation, for the purpose of applying the neces
 sary corrections calculated from his tables of Diurnal Range, published
in the Phil. Trans. for 1848. Having carefully explained his method
of arranging and testing his data, and providing for exceptional days,
upon which but few observations were recorded, the author gives
the results in twelve separate tables, which exhibit the mean daily
temperatures of every month in each of the thirty-eight years.        In a
note to the table for each month are given        :-1.   The mean tempe
rature of the coldest day of that month, with the day of the month
 and the year, from 1814 to 1851; 2. the mean temperature of the
hottest day of that month, with the day of the month and year, and
the extreme difference of mean temperature of two days in that month;
 3. The day of the month on which the mean temperature was sub
jected to the greatest change, with the minimum and maximum
mean temperatures, the year of the minimum and of the maximum;
4. the day of the month on which the mean temperature was sub
jected to the least change, with the minimum and maximum mean
 temperatures, the year of the minimum and of the maximum.          These

   The author then treats of the method adopted to deduce the most
probable true mean temperature due to every day in the year; and
concludes his paper by observing that there are periods of some dura
tion which are very remarkable on account of the difficulty of as
signing a physical cause for the anomalies apparent in the mean
temperature.     Starting from the lowest temperature, in January, it
increases till the beginning of March, when, between the 3rd and
10th, not only is the increase checked, but there is a remarkable
depression of temperature.     After the 10th, the increase proceeds
and is very rapid towards the end of April and the beginning of May;
this rapid increase is rather suddenly checked, and followed by a
period of cold towards the middle of May: this period is very marked.
As remarkable a depression of temperature at this time of the year
seems to have taken place in France, having been noted in Paris
and at various localities, some situated near the coast; but it does
not appear that the equally remarkable rise at the end of April has
been noted.    After the middle of May the numbers steadily increase
till the 5th of July, when they attain their maximum value. The
decline in the temperature towards the end of July is followed by
an increase at the beginning of August, after which the decline of
temperature is very regular till towards the end of November, when
a sudden and considerable increase of temperature takes place; after
this the curve declines to                   its   lowest point        on    the 8th       of   January.

end of the magnet towards the east and towards the west, and the
effect of each considered separately.
   The periodical character of disturbances at St. Helena and the
Cape in a cycle of years is indicated insofar as the limited extent of the
observations would permit; sufficient however to point to the year
1843 as that of least disturbance at these two places, by showing a
regular decrease from the previous years, and an increase in every
succeeding year of observation.       Though the hourly observations
were discontinued before 1848, the year which Colonel Sabine has
shown to be that of periodical maximum, as 1843 was that of mini
mum magnetic activity at Toronto and Hobarton, the observations
now discussed are shown to be quite consistent with this period, and
thus tend to establish it as a general law of magnetic phenomena.
In the aggregate of each year the disturbances towards the west are
shown to preponderate over those towards the east, both at St.
Helena and the Cape of Good Hope; a similar preponderance of
westerly over easterly has been found in every year of observation
at Hobarton, but at Toronto the easterly disturbances exceeded the
westerly both in number and amount in every year.
   Arranging the disturbances into the several months of their oc
currence,  the greatest disturbance is found to occur in January
and the least in June at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope;
the same months being those of greatest and least disturbance at
Hobarton, whereas at Toronto, both January and June are months of
minimum disturbance, the maxima disturbance occurring there in
April and September.
   From this identity of the epoch of greatest and least disturbance,
—at St. Helena, where the months of January and June are not
those of opposite seasons, viewed either with respect to the sun's ex
treme altitude or to extreme periods of temperature, -at the Cape,
situated in S. latitude 33° 56', and at Hobarton in S. latitude
42° 52',-and contrasting this identity with a different law at To
ronto in N. latitude 43°39', the author infers that the principal
causes which produce an annual period of disturbance are not de
pendent upon local seasons.       It is likewise pointed out that about
the  period of the  equinoxes   there is a tendency to maximum dis
turbances at     all
                 the stations, producing     absolute maxima    Toronto,           at

   The westerly disturbances were found            exceed the easterly

                                 at
with the results deduced from the Hobarton observations, while                                    it
appears from the observations         Toronto that the easterly disturb
                                           at

at Hobarton again coincide with this result; and     slight and less  in  a
perfectly marked degree, Toronto has the same peculiarity.

about 2-6 times as great at the Cape of Good Hope; while at Ho
barton the sum of the twelve night ratios slightly exceeded the day;
at Toronto the excess was larger, viz. as 1-3 to 1. The laws of
easterly and westerly disturbances, in relation to the local hours, are
then examined separately. At St. Helena and the Cape, the easterly
day-disturbances     exceed the easterly might-disturbances, and the
westerly day-disturbances exceed the westerly night-disturbances.
These results are compared with those at Toronto and Hobarton.
   At St. Helena, although but comparatively few disturbances occur
during the night hours, those disturbances are almost            westerly                            all

position of a sulphate moves the group SO" to the positive pole,
where it either combines with a metal or undergoes decomposition.
    One of the strongest arguments against the view that the oxygen
acids contain water, is afforded by the results of recent researches
(especially of MM. Laurent and Gerhardt) on the atomic weight of
acids. Those chemists have rendered more definite and exact than
they had been before our ideas on the distinctions between mono
basic, bibasic and tribasic acids, and have clearly established that
the correct expression of the atom of nitric acid must be such as
contains half as much hydrogen as is contained in 1 atom of water
(inasmuch as water is bibasic, and nitric acid monobasic).            Of
course this proportion may be as well established by doubling the
atomic weight of water as by halving that of hydrated nitric acid; but
either way it is clear that hydrated nitric acid cannot contain water.
    Such was the position of the question, when an English chemist
proved that the formation of aether from alcohol (which was con
sidered chemically as the hydrate of aether) does not consist in a
separation of two already-formed compounds, but in a substitution
of hydrogen by the organic radical aethyle. A similar fact M. Ger
hardt has proved respecting a great number of organic acids, by
preparing bodies which stand to them in the same relation       as aether
does to alcohol.
    The researches of M. Cahours had led to the discovery of a series
 of  bodies necessary for Gerhardt's process.     These were obtained
by the action of pentachloride of phosphorus on various hydrated
organic acids, and consisted of chlorine combined with the oxygen
ized radical of the acid. Thus from benzoic acid was prepared
the chloride of benzoile, C7H8 OCl, and the corresponding bodies
from cuminic, cinnamic, and various other acids. Gerhardt has
since made by the same process the body C* H3 OCl, which is the
chloride of the radical of acetic acid, called othyle. Now on bring
ing any one of these chlorides in contact with the potassium salt of
the corresponding acid, the chemical force of combination between
chlorine and potassium induced the decomposition.
    These results can be most simply stated in the form adopted by
M. Gerhardt, the discoverer, which consists in comparing the com
position of these bodies with that of water, from which they are
formed by the substitution of one or both atoms of hydrogen by
organic radicals.
    Thus water being represented by the formula       #o,  acetic acid is
formed from    it by the action of chloride of othyle, C*H* OCl, which
            # °o-HCl,

acid.    If a second atom    of chloride of othyle is made to act upon
                                                          C2     O

to the fecundity of the methods of investigation by means of which

liquids.
    Silica and Quartz (SiO").-Silica generally occurs in the form of
quartz, insoluble in alkalies, and sometimes in a hydrated state so
luble in alkalies, as in opal, and the deposits formed by mineral
waters. We are indebted to M. Ebelmen for some interesting
researches on the artificial production of hydrated silica in a hard
transparent state, like rock crystal, by exposing silicic aether to
the action of moist atmospheric air; this silica has the formula
2SiO3+3HO, and its density is 1:770. These conditions are obvi
ously not those under which silica has been formed naturally.
     On the other hand, M. de Senarmont has shown that by heating
under pressure a solution of silica, in water saturated with carbonic
 acid, or in weak hydrochloric acid, to 392° or 572°Fahr., anhydrous
 silica is obtained in the form of quartz, and insoluble in   reagents                              all
 except hydrofluoric acid.          probable that quartz has actually
                                           It    is
 been formed        this way
                       at in    nature, for the conditions are such
                                           in                                                                        as
may co-exist           a       certain depth below the surface                            of   the earth.
  Further, M. Fremy has recently succeeded         obtaining solid                    in
hydrated silica by decomposing sulphuret   silicium by water, and         of
under conditions which may coexist naturally. Mr. Cross has, by

as   I was assured by M. G. Rose. These lamellae therefore resemble
  quartz.
.   These facts show that silica is precipitated in the different states
 I  have mentioned, at the instant that the carbonic acid of the atmo
  spheric air which enters the flask combines with the potash holding
  the silica in solution, and that at the same time the carbonate of
 potash formed reacts upon and decomposes the sulphate of lime.
 The effects produced must be attributed to this double reaction.
    Double Carbonate of Copper and Soda (NaO, CuO, 2003).-I
 have in a previous memoir” stated that bibasic carbonate of copper,
 (malachite) 20uO, CO’, 2HO, may be obtained by immersing a
 fragment of limestone covered with crystallized subnitrate of copper,
 4CuO NO”, 3HO, into a dilute solution of bicarbonate of soda, and
 that if the action is allowed to go on until the whole of the sub
 nitrate has been converted into bibasic carbonate, the latter is itself
  decomposed with production of a double carbonate of copper and
  soda in very minute crystals of a clear blue colour, which adhere
 firmly to the chalk. At the time that I wrote that memoir I com
 menced several experiments, with the intention of leaving them to
  spontaneous action during several months.      Last November, on
  taking the fragments of limestone covered with submitrate of copper
  out of the solution of bicarbonate of soda, in which they had been
  placed six months previously, I found the bibasic carbonate                                           for   the
  most part decomposed and converted into double carbonate      copper                             of
     and soda,   in     beautiful microscopic             crystals, having the form                   of   right
     rhombic prisms with truncated summits.

    I must here mention a circumstance which may not be without
some interest for the geologist.           Mineralogists are not agreed as to
the   composition    of the arseniate of lime, formerly called pharmacolite,
which would       appear   to lead to the opinion that several natural com
pounds of lime and arsenic acid exist.                 M. Dufrenoy          for this                     is,
reason, inclined         the  opinion
                                   to   that this    compound           product                is   a                    of
the decomposition            arseniferous minerals, and that             frequently

contains              an
                  excess       base and hygrometric water which entirely
alter the proportions.           will here add, that all the natural crystals

means by which they may be obtained, have convinced me that they
will become useful to the chemist and manufacturer;       I have there
fore decided upon submitting to the Academy the details of the
operation, which, I trust, will not be found unworthy of attention.
   The apparatus which I employ is a simple furnace 30 centimetres
high and 18 centimetres diameter, supported upon a plate of cast
iron pierced with holes arranged in a circle 5 centimetres from the
centre.   This is placed in communication with the bellows             a                    of
portable forge.
   The best kind of crucibles melt down at the temperature in ques
tion to a perfectly liquid glass, and for a substitute I was obliged to
have recourse to pieces of well-burnt lime, which may easily be
brought into the shape of thick crucibles.    Their covers are likewise
made of lime.    M. Berthier observed that hydraulic limes were rea
dily fused at a high temperature, and I have found that perfectly
pure lime very frequently agglutinated. It is therefore indispensable
to employ a somewhat porous lime, slightly siliceous, which will
only become compact at the most elevated temperatures.
   With regard to the combustible, it must be very porous and in a
state of very fine division; and I should add that I succeeded only
when I made use of the residue of the imperfect combustion of coal,
the clinkers mixed with cinders which fall from the grate of the
heating apparatus and still at the École Normale, passed through a
wire sieve. With coal of the best quality, in very small particles,
the effects are much more feeble and do not differ from those which
have already been obtained.
   This extremely elevated temperature is developed with such rapi
dity that in a few minutes it reaches   maximum. itsBut     does not         it
extend beyond small distance upwards, carbonic oxide being formed
                     a a

perfectly explained this phaenomenon, the cause       which     nowof                  is
generally known.—Comptes Rendus, November 1852.

of nitrate of silver, it will disappear;if the paper or glass be now
exposed to the light for a few seconds, the iodide of silver, into which
the iodide of amidone which formed the primitive design has been
converted, being much more sensitive than the nitrate of silver with
which the rest of the surface is imbued, is acted upon much more
rapidly; if the paper or glass be then dipped into a solution of gallic
acid, the design is immediately reproduced, and it is then treated
with hyposulphite exactly as is done with photographic pictures.
By this process the design becomes as permanent as these latter,
and it will probably be adopted in many cases.
   M. Bayard has just made another application of the vapour of
iodine; after exposing the engraving to the vapour of iodine, he
applies it upon a glass prepared with sensitive albumen, so as to form
a negative picture, with which he then takes positive impressions on
paper in the usual manner.    In this manner he has obtained beautiful
reproductions of very old engravings without any distortion of the
image.—Comptes Rendus, March 28, 1853, p. 581.
        REMARKS     ON    THE STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS                             OF IRON.
                             BY T. R. W. FUCHS.
    The difference in physical characters presented by the several
kinds of iron is generally attributed to the presence of a variety of
substances, among which carbon is considered the most important.
It is contained in       all
                       kinds      iron, almost always accompanied
                                        of                                                      by
silicon, which perhaps exercises the same influence.          Raw iron
contains the largest quantity      carbon, bar iron the least, and steel
                                            of
is
in    some sort intermediate between the two; but the quantity                                  of
carbon does not      any case bear
                    in                 constant proportion
                                                 a             the iron,            to
nor are these three kinds              of
                               iron separated from each other      any                   by
definite limits. These two facts are sufficient     show that the car  to
bon cannot
                 be
              no in state     very intimate combination with the iron,
                                   of
and there are    asufficient grounds for assuming that the different
conditions   of
              this metal are determined solely     the quantities          by                   of
carbon contained       inThe numerous, and
                            it.                 many respects valu   in
able analyses     iron have served only
                  of                        prove the truth    to the                    of
above remark.    Upon the gratuitous assumption that the varying
per-centage    of
                carbon    the cause
                                  is  the differencesof   character              to in
of iron, attention has been too exclusively devoted         this point,
while another,  and perhaps more essential one, the crystalline  struc
ture, has been overlooked.
  Fuchs expresses his conviction that iron     dimorphous substance,
                                                               is
                                                                a
that there are,  fact,
                  in   two species (varieties)    iron,--the tesseral of
and the rhombohedral.      He considers                   it   as    proved that malleable
iron belongs   tothe tesseral system; and                  if       any doubt still exists,
may     be                                                                                      all it
         inferred from analogy that such                   is   the case, inasmuch         as
other malleable metals             possess       crystalline forms belonging             to   this
system.
     The crystalline form         of
                          raw iron has not been ascertained with                                 so
much certainty, but Fuchs considers      highly probable that
                                                       it       be                         it

longs to the rhombohedral system, because it comes within                                                                    the   class
 ofperfectly brittle metals, the crystalline forms which,                                       of                       as        far   as
 we are acquainted   with them,  are rhombohedral.
        But the difference between malleable and                                          cast iron does not con
 sist merely      the crystalline structure, which may

rounded groups,   a heap of distinct particles is produced, which may
be compared with what mineralogists call granular minerals.       The
continuity of the mass is thus to some extent destroyed, inasmuch
as these granular particles only adhere together more or less, and
consequently the greater the size and number of these particles the
greater is the diminution in tenacity.    According to the statement
of   Kohn, the original condition of iron thus altered cannot be
restored by heating to redness and forging, but only by exposure to
a welding heat; and Fuchs considers this a sufficient proof that this
alteration of iron consists in a breaking up of the continuity of the
mass. The restoration of this continuity requires that the granular
iron    should, by exposure to a welding heat, be rendered amorphous,
when the cohesive force again becomes active, a condition which in
the case of most other bodies obtains only when they are liquid.—

           object of this communication is to determine the motion
THEof electricity      at any instant after an electrified conductor,
of given capacity, charged initially with a given quantity of elec
tricity, is put in connexion with the earth by means of a wire or
other linear conductor of given form and resisting power. This
linear conductor, which, to distinguish it from the other or prin
cipal conductor, will be called the discharger, is supposed to be
of such small electrical capacity that the whole quantity of free
electricity in it at any instant during the discharge is excessively
small compared with the original charge of the principal con
ductor.     Now any difference that can exist in the strength of
the current at any instant in different parts of the discharger
must produce accumulations of free electricity in the discharger
itself, and therefore must be very small compared with the actual
strength of the current depending on the discharge of the prin
cipal conductor.     The strength of the current throughout the
discharger will therefore be considered as the same at each
instant, and, being measured by the quantity of electricity dis
charged per second, will be denoted by y. Again, the conduct
ing property and extent of surface of the principal conductor,
and the resistance of the discharger, will be considered as so
related that the potential throughout the principal conductor is
uniform at each instant.        Hence if q denote the quantity of
electricity which the principal conductor possesses at any time t,

as might have been foreseen, independently of the complete solu

  We conclude that the “duration” of the discharge is propor
tional to the capacity of the principal conductor, and to the
resistance of the discharger; and that it is independent of the
          of electricity in the primitive charge, and of the electro
  ynamical capacity (denoted above by A) of the discharger.
The only doubtful assumption involved in the preceding investi
gation is that of the constancy of k during the discharge. Joule’s
experiments show that the value of k remains unchanged for the
same metallic conductor kept at the same temperature, whatever
be the strength of the current passing through it; but that it
would be increased by any elevation of temperature, whether
produced by the current itself or by any other source of heat,
since an elevation of temperature always increases the galvanic
resistance of a metal. When large quantities of electricity are
discharged, or when the discharger is a very fine wire, great
augmentations and diminutions may therefore take place in the
value of k, and therefore the solution obtained above is not appli
cable to such cases.

merely a small ball or knob is substituted for a principal
conductor fulfilling the conditions prescribed above; but those
conditions not being fulfilled, the circumstances would not be
exactly expressed by the formulae of the present communica
tion.   The resistance would be much diminished, and conse
quently the whole quantity of water decomposed much increased,
by substituting large platinum electrodes for the mere points
used by Wollaston; but then the oxygen and hydrogen separated
during the first direct current would adhere to the platinum
plates, and would be in part neutralized by combination with
the hydrogen and oxygen brought to the same plates respectively

   This result shows how, when a linear conductor, initially in a
state of electrical equilibrium, becomes subjected to a constant
electromotive force W between its extremities, a current com

This limit cannot be perfectly reached in any finite time, although
in reality only a very minute time elapses from the commence

full strength; that no further augmentation is perceptible+.

 it must happen that boundlessness of extent in two non-concur
  rent lines, combined with straightness in the individual lines,
  must occur as a hypothesis, from which, unaided by anything
 else, we must deduce positive conclusions as to equality of angles
 or of lines. And it is as evident that whether we take as the
 defining criterion of parallelism, that two perpendiculars are
 equal, or that two alternate angles are equal, the difficulty equally
 awaits us, with regard to other perpendiculars and other alter
 nate angles.
    Assuming the hypothesis that two straight lines are equally
 inclined to a straight line crossing them, it is easy by a short
 argument to prove that if they met each other on either side of
 the crossing line, they would meet also on the other side of                                                              it,

 crossing lines                 on

 as  they approach, angles which are more and more nearly equal,
 therefore the limit between the two groups, which does not

                       either side, must make angles which are equal,

 But the argument fails          establishing the singleness
                                        in                             the limit          of

cess for the comparison of certain results, and a sound and suffi
cient hypothesis expressed in a definition.    The process alluded
to will be found in this, that if there be two equal straight lines,
and others at their extremities forming angles with them, which
are equal each to each, then we show by application and coin
cidence, that if the straight lines attached to one of the given
equals meet each other, those attached to the other will also
meet.      This is a consequence of equality in angles, which rela
tion however we should take care to define.                     Our argument
affords the    conclusion,   that from a    point   in a  straight   line, or out

may            be

straight line passing through            definite (given  a     single) point            or                        in

is  also perpendicular         A.; and then to        the lemma above-menby
tioned, the converse position            deduced, that every straight line

which meets           must also meet
                              B                                  A.
                                                 Thus the defining test                                            of
parallelism              is
                   extended        the form      to    theorem—“ that every

straight line which meets one must meet the other.”
    From this the conclusions readily emerge                  theorems, “that           as

                                experimental researches of M. Re
THEgnault
     results of the recent
           on the specific        heat of air at constant pressure
(Comptes Rendus, April 18, 1853) agree so closely with those de
duced by me theoretically, about three years since, from the
principle of the convertibility of heat with mechanical power,
that a tabular comparison of them may prove interesting, espe
cially as they have an important bearing on the theory of heat
in general. The annexed table contains also the mean result of
Mr. Joule’s experiments, as given in the Philosophical Transac
tions for 1852, page 74.
   The theoretical calculation may be found in the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xx. p. 192. The ratio
of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to that at constant
volume, as determined from the velocity of sound, is there taken
as approximately equal to 1-4; but as the true value of this ratio
probably lies between 1:4 and 1:41, I have added the results of a
computation in which the latter value is used.
   The following are the numerical data and formulae employed:—

     1st. It exhibits the pseudoscopic image either reversed, or in
its true aspect, each of these appearances being instantaneously
changeable into the other at pleasure. This change is effected
by the alternate removal and replacement of the mirrors a, b
 (Plate VI. fig.            1).
                          When these are removed, the visual rays                                       of
the two    eyes  are  transposed;     and being twice reflected, the image
of   course     not reversed.
                 is                When they are replaced, the rays are
not transposed; but being now thrice reflected, the image                                               is
reversed.         both cases the pseudoscopic phaenomena are exhi
                     In
bited, but not equally well                  in
                                       cases where the mode           which the        in
 object     illuminated
            is                unfavourable,
                                    is          namely,   where side-light             a
 occasions corresponding shading.                 objects thus illuminated,
                                                        In
 the conversions         relief are more easily seen with the reversing
                            of
 arrangement than with the other. This seems                    arise from the   to
 reversed position             of
                           the shading corresponding              some degree     in
 with the converse form        suggested         the    by
                                                      instrument,     while the
 unaltered position                                 strongly contradicts the
                                  of                           so

 placed one behind the other appears increased.                                   As examples           of
 these effects   may instance the following:—A round ball seems

this effect is not so ludicrous as might at first be expected, being
unaccompanied with anything like unequal or local distortion of
the features.
           these effects of alteration of distance are necessarily
      Of course
accompanied (as will be shown when the principle of the instru
ment is explained) with corresponding variations of apparent
magnitude, or lateral extension in the field of view. This is best
exemplified       a square card, which, when viewed perpendicularly
at a certain       '.
               distance,   appears of                   its
                                           true form and dimensions;
but when turned upon                    its
                                diameter without changing its mean
distance, the side which approaches the observer diminishes,
while that which recedes enlarges; and these changes combining
with the more rapid elongation          the other two sides, convert
                                                    of
the  square   into     long
                         a    trapezium   seen rather more obliquely
than the card really           and withis,                     its
                                               smallest side next the
observer. Thus         appears
                         it      that when       object approaches,an                             its
breadth and    height   are  diminished;    when     recedes, these are   it
increased.    Beyond and within certain distances, however, these
changes      of
             size        as
                      well      the exaggeration
                                       as             depth cease, and    of
the object     seen double; because binocular combination
                 is                                                ren                       is
dered impossible             in
                         the one case                      by
                                             the visual rays from the
same point entering the eyes convergently, and            the other             in                by
their divergence increasing beyond what the eyes can accommodate
themselves         to   by
                     squinting.
   Another effect which         producedis    both forms       by

never both       the same time

If  the sizes appear the same, the distance            the image seems    of

dental      to
            the   construction,  and arises from the reflected visual
ray being necessarily longer than the straight line drawn between
the eye and the object.
      The above binocular effects are      the results   all  increase          of     an         of
the difference between the   right  and left retinal images.    That this
is      adequate cause for them, and how
       an                                              operates, will     it                      be

illustrated by fig. 2, in which also an attempt is made to indi
cate the nature and mode of production of the binocular effects.
In this drawing R and L are intended to represent the right and
left eyes; O and o two real objects at different distances; Ir and
ir the reflected images of these objects seen by the right eye
alone; Il and il the images seen by the left eye alone; and B
and b the binocular images of the two objects, resulting from
the combinations of the reflected images when viewed by both
eyes at once.    All these reflected and binocular images are repre
sented as near as may be in their true places, positions, and
forms relative to the objects O and o, and the rest of the draw

continuations of signs and of variations of signs between the
several terms and those that are immediately contiguous to them
is the same for the two series; a condition which evidently may
be satisfied without the order of such changes and continuations
being identical.       I   am now able to enunciate the following
remarkable theorem of signaletic equivalence between two distinct
series of terms, each generated from the same improper continued

to say, the convergents corresponding to the given continued
fraction reversed.

 448               Mr.      J. J.           Sylvester on a remarkable                          Modification
 the present I shall content myself with showing a posteriori the
 truth of the theorem for a particular case. Let n=3. The two
 series which are to be proved to be signaletically equivalent may
 be written
                 1, A, BA–1,                                             CBA–C–A
                             1,             C,        BC–1,             ABC–A–C.
Call these respectively S and (S). In S we may substitute in
the third term, in place of BA— 1, CA without affecting the
signaletic value of the series; for if the second and fourth terms
have different signs, the third term may be taken anything
whatever, since the sequence of the second, third, and fourth
terms will give one continuation and one change, whatever the
middle one may be.     Suppose, then, that the second and fourth
terms have the same sign, and
                                                                  = A let
                                            CBA–C–                           m”.

                                  ... ...
                                            (BA–1). AC= (m^+ 1)A*.
Hence (BA–1) and AC                                     will      have the same                    sign; hence           S   is
signaletically equivalent                             to    S',   where       S'    denotes the series

                                 Remark.
   I am  not aware that anyone has observed what the effect would
be of omitting to change the signs of the successive residues in
the application of Sturm’s method, i.e. of employing a proper
-    -         -               -           -                 a’
in lieu of an improper continued fraction to express       fr’
   Although easily made out, it is well worthy of being remarked.
Suppose
and in general (P being any letter) use      P  to denote  – P. Now
we may   write

    April 26.—The Rev. Mr. Kingsley gave an account of the appli
cation of Photography to the Microscope.
   The earliest attempts in photography were directed both by Sir
H. Davy and Mr. Fox Talbot to the fixing upon prepared paper the
images of objects by the solar microscope, and the latter gentleman
succeeded completely, as far as his instrument allowed, in obtaining
pictures of minute structures.       Shortly after the publication of Mr.
Talbot's  process,  various    attempts were made to apply the oxyhy
drogen microscope to the same purpose, as that instrument had
 superseded the solar.      The result however was, that it was aban
doned on account of the great time that was found to be necessary
for impressing an image; and after a great variety of trials by Prof.
 Owen, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Leeson and others, the use of the instru
 ment for this purpose was given up.
    The discovery of the collodion process, so much more sensitive
 than that of Mr. Talbot, led the author to think, as soon as he be
 came acquainted with           it,
                              that we were    possession    in the means         of                        of
 impressing microscopic objects by means           artificial light without

 by about    a aminute's exposure. On examining the instrument, how

of three large lenses, a meniscus, plano-convex and double convex,
being a combination of three lenses similar in effect to Herschel's
doublet; the second set for condensing the light on the object is a

 similar set of lenses, but of much shorter focal length, and turned
 the other way; between these two sets is a plano-convex or plano
 concave lens placed at its focal length from the convergence of the
rays from the first group, so as to make the rays pass to the con
 densers in a state of parallelism, and so do away with the necessity
 of changing the distance between the collectors and condensers
 for each adjustment of the latter: the third group forms the object
 glass, which must be so corrected as to have the rays of the spec
 trum between the fixed lines G and H as much as possible brought
 to a point, as these rays are those that produce the maximum ac
 tion on the silver salts used in photography; this will require the
 red rays to be left untouched, just in the same way as Fraunhofer
 left those of the blue end of the spectrum dispersed in correcting an
 object-glass for light.   The fourth group is the common eye-piece
 left under-corrected.    A rather better form for this is a Ramsden's
 eye-piece with the first lens partially achromatized, by making it a
 compound lens with the radius of curvature of the common surface
 nearly double that of the surface that would render it achromatic.
 This form of eye-piece gives a better correction of the oblique pen
 cils than the common negative.

    Note.—At the time that this communication was made to the
Society, Prof. Stokes had kindly made known to the author the re
sults of his discoveries with regard to the rendering visible the che
mical spectrum, but as he had not then made them public, the author
of this communication could not state the use that Prof. Stokes's
discovery enabled him to make of a screen composed of uranium
glass, or of infusion of horse-chestnut bark, for finding the focal di
stance of the chemical image, or of arranging the lenses of the con
denser so as to produce the maximum of chemical action.
    Also, since the communication was made, it has been found that
the instrument described gives light enough to impress an image on
any of the ordinary papers or Daguerreotype plates in periods ran
ging between one and five minutes, with the oxyhydrogen and lime
light; and with direct sunshine the impression is almost instantane
ous; of course sunlight is much better than any artificial light when
it can be procured, both as regards speed and the clearness of the
picture produced.

    Nov. 8.—Mr. Adams, F.R.S. &c., gave an account of some Tri
 gonometrical   Operations to ascertain the difference of geographical
 position between the Observatory of St. John's College and the
 Cambridge Observatory.
    The observations, especially those of eclipses and occultations,
 which were made during many years by the late Mr. Catton at the
 Observatory of St. John's College, and which have recently been
 reduced under the superintendence of the Astronomer Royal, render
 it a matter of some importance to determine the exact geographical
 position of that Observatory. The simplest and most accurate means
 of doing this appeared to be, to connect it trigonometrically with the
 Cambridge Observatory.       For this purpose, a base was measured
 along the ridge of the roof of King's College Chapel, by means of two
 deal rods terminated by brass studs, the exact lengths of which were
 determined by comparison with a standard belonging to Professor
 Miller. The extremities of the base were then connected by a tri
 angle, with a station on the roof of the Observatory at St. John's,
 from which, as well as from the two former points, a signal post on
 the roof of the Cambridge Observatory could be seen. The angles
  at the extremities of the base, combined with the corresponding ones
  at the station at St. John's,    furnished two determinations     of the

distance of the Cambridge Observatory, which served to check one
another.   The meridian line of the transit instrument at St. John's
passes through King's College Chapel, so that by observing the point
at which it intersected the base, the azimuths of the sides of the
triangles could be immediately found.
   The result thus obtained                        is,
                                that the transit instrument      the                                              of

   But the amount of this self-correction is uncertain, and some
times one set of errors preponderates and sometimes the other; and
so a dead escapement clock sometimes gains and sometimes loses
simultaneously with either an increase or a decrease of the arc of
vibration. And, consequently, none of the contrivances for iso
chronizing a pendulum for different arcs can secure isochronism of
the clock; and no further material improvement in clocks can be
expected, but from the solution of what has long been known as the
great problem of clock-making, viz. the invention of a simple escape
ment which will give a constant impulse to the pendulum without
any sensible friction.
    Mr. Denison showed that his new gravity escapement satisfies all
the requisite conditions, mechanical, mathematical, and oeconomical.
 Its principal features are, that the scape-wheel has only three pins,
not far from the centre, which lift the pallets or gravity-arms, and
three long teeth which are locked by stops on the arms. The velo
city of the scape-wheel, which usually produces tripping, if the force
of the train is increased beyond what is just enough to lift the arms,
is moderated by a fan-fly set on the axis of the scape-wheel.      The
arms are   necessarily longer in this than in any other gravity escape
ment, and this also gives a greater depth of locking within a given
angle, and therefore a still further security against tripping. And if
an arm is by accident lifted a little too high, the tooth does not
escape, and the arm falls down again to its proper height until the
pendulum carries it off, the pressure of the long teeth on the stops
not being enough to hold it up. For these reasons also there is no
difficulty in satisfying the mathematical condition investigated by
Mr. Denison in a paper read before the Society in 1848, viz. that y
(the angle at which the pendulum leaves one arm and takes up the
other) should    = #5 or at         any rate not be less than
                                                                           : (a being         the
extreme arc of vibration).     The escapement requires no            the           oil   in
parts affecting the pendulum; and        contains
                                                it    delicate work, and

the Processes requisite to render Quicksilver tremorless for Astro

   The great improvements recently introduced, and especially by
the present Astronomer Royal, in the construction and methods of
using astronomical instruments, require a far more extended use of
reflexion from mercury than heretofore.      Unfortunately, however,
both the convenience and the accuracy of these methods have been
greatly limited and impaired by the tremors to which mercury is
liable. Many attempts have been made both in France and in Ger
many to remove or obviate these tremors, but hitherto by no means
with perfect success. The Rev. C. Pritchard, of Clapham near
London, has proposed a method which appears fully adequate to the
requirements of astronomy.    It consists in the adoption of a silver
plated or amalgamated copper vessel of a peculiar form, admitting
the use of a very thin stratum of mercury without the necessity of
an inconvenient amount of shallowness in the vessel itself. Mercury,
however, placed in an amalgamated vessel after a short time becomes
covered with a singular film of amalgam, which impairs the reflect
ing power of the surface, and if at                 all
                                     agitated, soon entirely destroys
it.    And this       is   the case even when the vessel
                                                      made      amalga    is             of

XIV. contain    hygrometrical  observations made at various stations in
April and July 1848, and in December 1850 and July 1851.
    In the remarks which follow the tables, the author states that the
past year is distinguished by several marked peculiarities, of which
the most prominent are—the very large amount of rain and its very
unequal distribution over the different seasons; the enormous and
unprecedented fall in the first two and last two months; and the pro
tracted drought of ten weeks in the spring, the longest, though not
the most severe which has occurred in the northern counties within
the memory of the existing generation.          The year is further re
markable for its high temperature; the large amount of surface eva
poration; the great heat of July and August; the great quantity of
free electricity, as manifested by the unusual number and almost
tropical severity of the thunder-storms; the small number of frosty
 nights, and the entire absence of snow; and, lastly, for the violent
 gales of wind which prevailed during the last week of December,
 particularly the hurricane on the morning of Christmas-day. After
 the discussion of these irregularities, tables are given showing the
 excess or deficiency per cent. of the principal mountain gauges over
 or under the quantity of rain received by the adjacent valleys, both
in the summer and winter months, in each year since the instruments
 were erected in 1846. The remainder of the paper is occupied with
 details referring to the temperature and the hygrometrical observa
tions at the mountain stations.
    March 10.—The following letter, addressed to Michael Faraday,
Esq., and by him communicated to the Society, was read:—
                                        Dumse  (N. Britain), March 1, 1853.
    DEAR SIR,-In     the report in the Athenaeum of your lecture at the
 Royal Institution on the 21st of January,    I observe that you refer to
 the highly interesting observations of Schwabe,    Sabine, Wolf, Gautier,
 &c., from which it would appear that a connection exists between the
 solar spots and the variations of the terrestrial magnetic forces.
 Since a connection has been demonstrated to exist between the lat
 ter and auroral phenomena,      I was induced to look over my notes
 relating to the aurorae observed at this place, with a view to ascer
 tain whether these also exhibited maxima and minima, and if so,
 whether the periods of such agreed with those of the solar spots and
 of the magnetic variations.     The subjoined table shows the distri
 bution of the aurorae seen here in the years 1838 to 1847 inclusive:—

wards observed.
   Last summer several masses of spawn were procured from my
cellar, having been found deposited amongst decaying potatoes, &c.,
and subsequently young toads were noticed.        The cellar is free
from water, and at a considerable distance from any brook.
   Secondly. Young toads are observed about hot-beds.
   In the kitchen-garden at Highfield House (which is entirely walled
round) young toads have been noticed about the cucumber- and
melon-beds.     The gardeners have been in the habit of bringing
toads to these beds to destroy the insects; these have continued
amongst the warm damp straw             summer.          all

likely, owing to spawn having been found previously to the young
toads.
   Mr. Higginbottom tells me, the same remark on the birth of the
Triton, without the stage of tadpole, has been mentioned to him.
  These are the facts; should the subject be deemed worthy of
further investigation, I shall be glad to continue observations upon
these reptiles during the present year, or to make any experiments
that may be deemed advisable.

           REMARKS      ON   ELECTRIC LIGHT.    BY A. MASSON.
      HE  researches” which have already been made known by the
       author lead to the following results.
   A barometric vacuum offers a resistance to the passage of electric
currents which increases with its length; this resistance is less in
the partial vacuum produced by an air-pump.
   A ponderable medium is necessary for the production of the
electric light.
   The author, together with M. Breguett, has likewise succeeded
in verifying most completely the identity of the luminous phaenomena
produced by induced currents and those which are caused by the
discharge of a condenser.    The former have the advantage of being
continuous, the latter possess greater tension.     Some recent ex
periments which they have made serve to establish the accuracy of
these propositions.
    The impossibility of making the current of a powerful inductive
 apparatus traverse a Torricellian vacuum three decimetres in lengthf,
 can only be attributed to the fact that the electrical tension is       in
 sufficient, since the discharge of a very small condenser illuminates
the vacuum, and the authors have obtained currents in the vacuum
 of a barometer.
    The following experiment made with improved instruments con
 structed by Ruhmkorff confirms this assumption.       The exhausted
 tube   having  been placed between the two  poles of an induced cur
rent, the phaenomena described in their memoir upon electrical
 spectres were produced; the entire vacuum was filled with a pale
white phosphorescent light.
    The tube presented the same appearance when perfectly isolated
on being connected at one end with a single pole of the induced
current. In this case the current is interrupted, and the discharge
from the opposite extremity of the tube must necessarily take place
into the air. This curious fact is very analogous to those mentioned
in the author's memoir on induction.

    The rapid succession of discharges of an induced current, which,
since the publication of Masson's researches on the physiological
effects of electricity*, has been so successfully applied in the treat
ment of paralysis, the continuity of the effects obtained by means of
induced currents, render it a very desirable object to increase the
tension of these currents, and the results already obtained in this
direction by M. Ruhmkorff, justify the opinion that the electrical
machines now in use will be superseded by an apparatus of induc
tion.
    In order to increase the power of such an apparatus, the authors
have attempted to make the induced current of two coils traverse
the same wire; the primary currents were kept apart and inter
rupted at the same instant.
    When both the induced currents were in the same direction, the
luminous phaenomena in the vacuum indicated that the action of the
 combined currents was greater than that of a single current, but the
increase of the action was not such as had been anticipated.
    When the two currents traversed the same wire in opposite di
 rections, they did not exercise any mutual influence on each other,
 and the results observed are not unimportant. The two balls form
 ing the poles in the vacuum were surrounded, as well as their sup
 ports, by the violet-blue atmosphere, previously described by the
 author and M. Breguett. The two poles were of the same sub
 stance, and between them was a reddish flame which disappeared
 when the balls were brought nearer together; at a distance of 4 or 5
 centimetres the space between the poles is perfectly dark, although
 they were surrounded by their luminous atmospheres.           The lumi
 nous phaenomena appeared to be more intense than in the former
 experiment.—Comptes        Rendus, February 1853.
           ON THE     PERMEABILITY OF METALS TO MERCURY.
                              BY J. NICKL}s.
    In an interesting memoir on the permeability of metals to mer
 cury, by Prof. Horsford, this author establishes the fact of the per
 meability of tin, lead, gold, silver, zinc and cadmium, and contests
 that  of copper and brass.
    The negative results which this chemist has obtained with copper
 and brass have evidently proceeded from the process which he has
 followed; for some time since, while engaged in my researches on
 magnetization,     I  observed positive facts to the contrary.     I  was
 using at this time a Bunsen's battery with zinc exterior. The con
 necting pieces of copper were riveted to the zinc, and on amalga
 mating the latter metal, it often happened that the mercury spread
 itself over the copper in contact with the zinc.; and after a certain
 time the metal of the connecting pieces became brittle, and had on

breaking a white colour.        It was obviously no longer copper, but
an  amalgam    of this metal.
   This fact had too important a bearing on the amalgamation of
zinc, which occupied me at that time, to be allowed to pass without
examination.     The experiments which I made on this subject led to

                          By M. W. REGNAULT.

                                       have been occupied in col
        lecting the data necessary for the solution of the following
problem:—               -
   What is theoretically the motive power which may be ob
tained from a given quantity of heat by applying it to the deve
lopment and dilatation of various elastic fluids under the various
conditions which are practically realizable 7
   The complete solution of this problem should furnish not
merely the true theory of the steam-engines used at the present
day, but likewise that of machines in which the vapour of water
may be replaced by another vapour, or even by a permanently
elastic fluid whose elasticity is augmented by heat.
                                I
   At the time when entered upon these researches, the ques
tion appeared to me more simple than it does at present. Adopt
ing the views then recognised in science, it was easy to define
precisely the various data upon which it rested; and I pictured
to myself the methods by the aid of which        hoped to be able  I
successively  to discover the laws and determine the numerical
data. But, as is usually the case in sciences of observation, in
proportion as        I
                    advanced in my studies, the subject continually
expanded; the questions which in the first instance appeared to
be very simple, now present a considerable degree of complexity;
and perhaps      Ishould not have had the courage to enter upon
the  investigation                                    I
                     of the subject, if had from the first perceived

474                     M. Regnault's              Researches upon the
quantities of heat were dependent only on the initial and final
conditions of temperature and of pressure, and that they were
independent of the intermediate circumstances through which
the fluid had passed.      In 1824, Carnot published, under the
title of Réflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu, a work which
did not in the first instance attract much attention, and in which
he assumed as a principle that the motive power produced in a
steam-engine is due to the passage of heat from           source     the                 its              to
colder condenser       which  by   finally  collected. M.

has shown that the quantities        heat gained   of of

 gas does not    depend   solely upon      initial state and   its final                                its
 state, but likewise upon the intermediate states through which
it   passes.
     Within the last              few years, the mechanical theory heat has                      of
met with more favourable consideration, and                    the present               at

 each its   proper    influence.    The  experimenter       should therefore
 endeavour to modify the circumstances in which he operates in
 such a manner as to vary as much as possible in the several ex
periments the influence of each of the elementary phaenomena
 and the law which expresses them.            He will thus obtain equa
tions of   condition,    which  may  be of very   great assistance towards
discovering the general theory, for that, whatever it may be,
should always be fulfilled.

     It is from this point of view that have prosecuted my re
searches; and       I have always striven to define, in the most pre
cise manner, the conditions under which           I have operated, in order
that whatever theory may finally prevail, some advantage may be
derived from my experiments.
     In 1847,    I  published the first part of my researches; they
constitute the twenty-first volume of the Mémoires de l’Aca
démie. Since that time        I have not ceased to carry them on ; but
the    necessary   experiments   were so numerous, the numerical cal
culations so long and laborious, that it would have been impos
sible for me to execute them if left to my individual efforts.              I
have been very considerably aided by M. Izarn, who had already
taken part in the first part of my labours, and by a young
mining engineer, M. Descos, whom the Minister of Public Works
has given me as an assistant, in order to hasten the completion
of the investigation.
    The subjects to which my recent experiments relate are the
following:—
    1. The relations which exist between the temperatures and
tension of a great number of vapours in a state of maximum
density, from the most feeble tension to that of 12 atmospheres.
    2. The tension of the same vapours at their maximum density.
    3. The tension of vapour of maximum density produced by
mixed liquids.                                                   -
    4. The latent heat of these vapours under different pressures,
from the most feeble to that of 8 or 10 atmospheres.
    5. The latent heat of vaporization of the same substances in
g a SCS.
    6. The specific heat of permanent gases and vapours under
different pressures.
    7. The quantities of heat absorbed or disengaged by the com
pression and the expansion of gases, either when that expansion
is effected in a space the capacity of which is augmented, or
when it takes place during the passage through a capillary
                                                                              *

   During the last century           great number      a   physicists have            of
been engaged with investigations relating              the specific heat         to                              of
elastic fluids. Crawford, Lavoisier and Laplace, Dalton, Clément
and Désormes, Delaroche and Bérard, Haycraft, Gay-Lussac,
Dulong, De          Rive and Marcet, have successively published
                           la
researches upon this subject. Most             these physicists have enof

most instances very erroneous.
   The memoir          Delaroche and Bérard, which was rewarded
                                of

480                      M. Regnault's             Researches upon the
with a prize by the Academy in 1813, is at the present time the
most complete one upon this subject, and that in which the
results differ least from the truth. This superiority is owing not
only to the extreme care with which these skilful experimenters
carried out their investigation, but likewise to the direct method
which they adopted; while the greater number of other physi
cists have had recourse to indirect methods, in which the ele
ment sought frequently exercised but a very slight influence.
   The general results at which Delaroche and Bérard arrived
are the following:—
   1. All gases do not possess the same specific heat in regard
either to volume or weight.     The specific heat of equal weights
or  equal volumes of the several gases has the following values for
these two modes of comparison:—

   4.  Delaroche and Bérard assumed, for theoretical reasons
founded upon the direct experiments       Gay-Lussac, that the
                                                             of
specific heat    gas increased rapidly with the temperature.
                        of   a
   Such are the most accurate views which        possess     the       we             at

                         Specific Heat    of Elastic Fluids.                                  481
present day upon the specific heat of gases, and which are gene
rally recognised by physicists.   The limits within which      am                         I
compelled to restrict myself in this abstract render it impossible
to enter upon any discussion of the methods which have been
adopted by my predecessors, or any description of those which
I have followed myself.   It will be sufficient to remark, that                                 I
háve encountered in this class of investigations very great diffi
culties, not only in regard to the actual experiments, but like
wise in a theoretical point of view. The remarks which have
been made at the commencement of this abstract will render this
easily conceivable.    Thus, although my first experiments were
made five  years  ago, and announced at that time in my memoirs
upon the specific heat of solid and liquid substances, it is only
now, after having employed the most different methods, and
having caused the elements of correction to destroy each other,
that    I
       can with confidence lay the results of my investigation
before the Academy.
   According to my experiments, the specific heat of air in rela
tion to that of water is
                  Between      –
                             30° and +  10°                             O-2377
                  Between + 10° and    100°                             O-2379
                  Between + 100° and   225°                             0-2376
   Thus, contrary to the experiments of Gay-Lussac, the specific
heat of air does not vary sensibly at different temperatures. Ex
periments made with several other permanent gases have led to
a similar result.
    In experimenting with atmospheric air under a pressure
varying from 1 to 10 atmospheres,                    I
                                             have not found that there
is any sensible difference between the quantities of heat disen
gaged by a given mass of                 air
                                          cooling
                                               in     certain number
                                                                   a                           of
degrees.     Thus, contrary       the experiments
                                    to                     Delaroche and  of

   On looking through this table, it will at once be seen that the
specific heat of oxygen differs but very little from that of an
equal volume of either nitrogen or hydrogen; thus one would be
led to infer that the specific heat of simple gases is the same for
equal volumes under the same pressure.                    But for chlorine and
bromine numbers have been obtained which are almost equal
to each other, but much greater than those which have been ob
tained for other simple gases:—

These are all the volatile substances of which      was able to pre          I
pare considerable quantities in a state of purity.
   The specific heat which                I
                                  have obtained for the vapour of
water in a great number of experiments is 0.475; this is barely
one-half of that found by Delaroche and Bérard.         It is remark
able that the specific heat of the vapour of water should be nearly
equal to that of solid water, and only one-half that of liquid
water.
   It now remains for me to discuss the values which               have                             I
found for the specific heat of compound elastic fluids, in relation
to the specific heat of the simple gases of which they are com
posed, and to the amount of condensation which the latter have
experienced; to compare the specific heat connected respectively
with the solid, liquid, and gaseous states in several substances
which are capable of assuming                       all

throws up jets of metal, forming a miniature volcano. These
phaenomena are caused no doubt by the presence of gases in the
copper.     Several metals when in fusion absorb oxygen; but the
fact that  copper, when it sets in this way, does not refine well
by the operation of poling, which would soon take away oxygen,
is presumptive that the gas which escapes is not oxygen, and
renders probable the prevailing idea that it is caused by the
presence of sulphur or sulphurous acid.
    When the setting of the metal in the ladle is favourable, the
charge is ready for the operation of poling.             A quantity of
charcoal or anthracite coal is first thrown upon the metal to
prevent oxidation by the air, and then the end of a large pole of
green wood, generally of birch or oak, is inserted into the melted
 copper, and kept pressed down to the bottom of the metal, which
 occasions violent ebullition, the metal spurting and boiling with
 loud noise. The action which takes place during this operation
 will be apparent to every one slightly versed in chemistry—the
 reduction of any oxide or suboxide.       But the reason why such
 an operation as poling is required, is owing to the peculiar
 nature of copper in relation to          oxides.          its
                                                          for example,       If,                      a
  quantity      of
              melted lead      exposed    be

                                                             to   but the   it
  oxide formed floats upon the surface        the metal, and may of                                   be
  reduced       by
              putting wood                  or
                                other carbonaceous matters            the                       on
  surface; but when copper             oxidated, the oxide formed
                                                is    so
  dissolved         in
                the metal       completely as       salt           as

  water, which renders the copper brittle.     To    put  pieces    wood                       of
 or   charcoal upon the surface would not remove the oxygen;
  hence the necessity     poling    of
                                     order     bring the carbonaceous

lead is generally added, from 10 lbs. to 30 lbs., to the charge;
this softens the copper and renders it more tough. Sometimes,
when the trial cracks upon the edge, a little additional lead will
cure it.                              -
   The addition of lead is supposed to effect the complete deoxi
dizement of any remaining oxide of copper, and it is imagined
that all the lead comes off as scoria, or is volatilized.   In our
analyses of copper, and they have been very numerous, the pre
sence of lead was always detected wherever it had been added
in the refining operation, and often in quantity equivalent to
what had been added.     Smelters finding in their practice that
copper made from the ordinary quality of ores will not roll
without lead being added, are of opinion that          presence                            its                      is
essential  for toughening the copper; but          only     when            it   is              so               im
purities are present. We have often seen copper refined without
lead; and when the metal was pure and free from antimony,
was superior         those containing lead. Copper made from

preferred for this purpose.        Overpoled metal expands in setting,
giving the ingots a roundness on the top. Select metal is cast
into ingots about 8 inches long and 3 thick. The moulds are
fitted upon a frame placed over a pit or tank of water, so that
whenever the metal becomes solid, the mould which moves upon
a pivot is turned over and the copper ingot drops into the water,
which takes off               all
                        oxide from the surface. Each          these ingots              of
weighs about                15
                      lbs. The ingot-moulds are sometimes made                                            of
iron, but these soon give way, crack upon the surface, and dis
figure the ingot; they also retain the heat             much           give  so               as   to

    2nd. Overpoling causes the copper            expand when setting.
                                                                  to

 bules of solid metal coated with suboxide.
    These favour the idea that, whatever           the substance present,
                                                                      be

combined with the metal.       The following are the appearances
which   copper             in
                  different states  poling have under the micro
                                                        of
scope, with their specific gravities:–
   lst. Copper ready for poling. Red-brown colour, vitrified,
sandy fracture. Spec. grav. 8,491.
   2nd. After     little poling. Colour redder than last, sandy
                           so a
fracture, not    vitreous-looking.   Spec. grav. 8:526.

   3rd. Further poling.      Colour lighter, with more lustre, frac
ture hard, not sandy, but vitreous.      Spec. grav. 8,481.
   4th.  Longer   poling.     Colour   brighter,  with more of the
metallic lustre, less vitreous than former, and having minute
cavities. Spec. grav. 8.397.                                     -
   5th. Near to  tough   pitch,   Colour still brighter, fracture full
of minute cavities, as if the metal had set during escape of
gaseous matters, slightly vitreous.   Spec. grav. 8:582.
  6th.  Tough  pitch.  The   appearance of this was singular; the
cavities in the last specimen seemed now collapsed, giving a
fracture resembling a honey-comb, strongly compressed, the
colour of silvery brightness and a soft metallic appearance. Spec.
grav. 8:654.
    7th. A little overpoled.      The collapsed cells extended some
thing like No.     5;  some of the cavities oval, as if a gas had
escaped; fracture, a reedy hard appearance.            Spec. grav. 8:594.
    8th. Further    overpoled.     Fracture    crystalline  and vitreous,
full of cavities.    Spec. grav. 8:518.
    9th. Much     overpoled.     Fracture like a crystalline network,
very hard and vitreous. Spec. grav. 8:298.
    These appearances seem to indicate the changes going on
within the metal during poling, and the specific gravity of
each corresponds with these appearances.               In Nos. 4 and 8,
when the cavities are very numerous, the specific gravities are
lowest.
    From these experiments and observations, we think that the
first reaction in poling is the reduction of the oxide of copper,
and the complete reduction of the oxide constitutes the tough
pitch.    Overpoling we think to be the imbibition of carbonic
oxide or carbonic acid, and not the formation of a carburet of
copper. That metals imbibe gas when in a melted state is well
known; some of them, as silver, give it out when setting.
That overpoling is due to gaseous matter contained in the metal,
we think is evident by         itseffervescence, and           by   its
                                                                 becoming
tough  if  kept melted until this effervescence ceases.
  It  is worthy   of  remark, that green wood          much more effect
                                                          is
ive  in poling than dry wood          charcoal; probably the hydrogen
                                     or
in  the moisture and juices     ismore effective     reducing the oxides.

struck     by
            a  hammer    or thrown upon another ingot gives            dead

solid   sound,    not  sonorous;     while  copper    with the    slightest
quantity    ofalloy when      sotreated gives     sharp clink.

   The relation of the antimony to the copper in this analysis is
3.8 per cent., showing the accumulation of that metal, caused
no doubt by the strong attraction which silica has for the oxide
of antimony; and suggests the probability of some of the anti
mony existing in the copper, not as an alloy, but in the form of
a compound, probably antimoniate of copper, which the silica of
the bottom decomposes.     All the impurities found deteriorating
copper exist in the ore; and we repeat what has been previously
stated, that if these metals be not removed before the copper
reaches the state of metal, their entire separation is as yet com
mercially impracticable.
   The effect of minute quantities of metal in copper has not yet
been fully investigated, and a considerable difference of opinion
exists on this question.  A few years ago a quantity of copper
was returned to the makers as unfit for the purposes for which it
was sold, being brittle.  This on being analysed gave a trace of
nickel, which was considered the deteriorating impurity. Expe
riments made by Bunsen on this subject showed that small
quantities of nickel do not affect the rolling property of copper.
   Arsenic in copper is considered very deleterious both by
smelters and copper-workers.         Dr. Percy has shown that the
presence   of that metal is not hurtful.
   Silver has been found in copper complained                  and con                  of,

these two equations having a common factor of a lower degree

    We may, it is true, very readily perceive that there cannot
generally exist a common factor of either the first or the second
degree with rational coefficients, since, no cubic radical could
under such circumstances be involved in the solution.            And
when m=4 (for every other case         may     be excluded as  being
 already solved by the first method in which X=4)*, it is mani
fest that q and 5, which are each of them expressible as rational
 functions of the roots of the original equation in w, will neces
 sarily lead from the equality of the typical forms to identical
 equations of the sixth degree; unless, indeed, there can, exist,

   4. Among the metallic oxides great differences of conducti
bility exist. Those which are opake and endowed with lustre,
are in  general better conductors than the -others. M. Necker
has noticed this circumstance.
   5. The same remark applies to the metallic sulphurets.
   6. The chlorides are in part conductors and in part insulators.
   7. The same variety exists among the salts.   The great majo
rity of them are insulators.
   8. The molecular state determines the conductibility or non
conductibility of the same substance.   Diamond insulates, gra
phite conducts well.
   9. Among the minerals of vegetable origin, the more perfect
the carbonization the better the conductibility.
   10. Among the conducting minerals which do not crystallize
regularly, some present differences of conductibility when the
direction of the current through the mass is varied.

I      now prepared some so-called purpurine from garancine.
The garancine was treated with boiling alum liquor, and the
liquor was strained boiling hot through calico. On cooling there
was formed       a copious deposit, which was redissolved       fresh                     in
alum    liquor.    The  deposit  formed this time,  which was very
trifling, was separated, and the substance contained       the liquid            in

                                        alizarine and verantine, for                               it
consists sometimes          one alone, sometimes
                            of                          the other, someof
times of variable mixture of both.

I      now treated some purpurine, made                          in
                                                    the same manner                                 as

gaged, the bulk         the substance diminished very much, and

colour became lighter.           After the action was completed,                                   I
allowed the      liquid      cool,

    Its composition therefore, with the exception of a slight defi
ciency in the amount of hydrogen, was that of verantine.
    The acid liquid filtered from the substance was evaporated
almost to dryness, when it yielded a quantity of yellow crystals.
These were washed with cold water, and then redissolved in a
little boiling water.      The boiling solution was decolorized with
animal    charcoal,  and after being filtered boiling hot deposited
on   cooling a quantity   of colourless crystals, having the appearance,
and as their analysis showed, the composition of Laurent’s naph

    Wolff and Strecker mention, that purpurine yields this acid
when subjected to the action of nitric acid, but the verantine
which is found in an undecomposed state, after the action of the
nitric acid has ceased, seems to have eluded their observation.
                                 I
    From these experiments infer that purpurine, madder-purple,
and the various similar bodies derived from madder, owe their
property as colouring matters to an admixture of alizarine, and
that they simply consist of the latter substance in a state of im
purity.
LXXX.      Mathematics and Mathematicians.            The Journals of the
    late Reuben Burrow.        By   T. T.    WILKINsoN,  Esq., F.R.A.S.,
    and Corresponding Member of the Manchester Literary and
    Philosophical Society.

      INCE   the preceding article of this series was written, the in
        defatigable Astronomer Royal has communicated a paper
to the Royal Society which sets at rest the occurrence of an
eclipse when Xerxes was setting out from Sardes on his expedi
tion to Greece (Phil. Mag. March 1853, pp. 216–218).
    “The     author thinks it most likely that the phaenomenon
really was the total eclipse of the moon which occurred on the
morning of Marsh 14, B.C. 479; ” but Mr. Burrow appears to
have been led to the conclusion that an eclipse of the sun must
have taken place about the same period, as is evident from a
memorandum which          I have since met with, as follows, in an ob
scure corner of some      disfigured    leaves at the end of the Journal.
    “In the year 478 before Christ.

    “Costard has treated this eclipse particularly in a disser
tation.
   “Apparent conjunction at Smyrna, 35 minutes past 12 at
noon; 11% digits eclipsed.”
   The disfigured pages to which I allude are mostly occupied
by rough sketches of the diagrams belonging to the geometrical
papers inserted in the first number of Carnan’s Diary. One of
these has reference to the properties of Halley's Diagram, which
has since been found so prolific of relations in the hands of
Davies, Weddle and Elliott, under the title of Horae Geome
trica; another belongs to the “very useful Lemma" that “the
difference of any two sides of a plane triangle is less than the
third side” (Diary, 1776, p. 34);-of the rest several relate to the
papers on “Geometrical Sums and Differences,” “Limits of
Geometrical Quantities; ” and one or two appear to have been
sketched when considering the “very difficult problems on the
maxima and minima,” subsequently proposed as prize questions
in his Diary. A “List of Oxford and Cambridge terms,” and
a series of notes on the “Eclipses in 1776,” which occur among
these rude sketches, with a memorandum to “take the rest from
the Ephemeris,” afford sufficient evidence that the Lady’s and
Gentleman’s Diary was in active preparation, and suggest the
reflection that at all events Mr. Burrow knew “ how to make
an Almanack,” whatever might be the defects of Hutton and
Maskelyne.                                             -

seemed to think that              I

 the Diary, but have not been able to find that Mr. Wales ever
 had any connexion with this periodical, either anonymously or
 otherwise.     Mr. Burrow’s opposition to Dr. Maskelyne does not
 appear to have rested on good grounds, and there is little doubt
 that many of his supposed injuries were merely imaginary.          All
 who are acquainted with the writings and labours of this Astro
 nomer Royal will not place much credit in such depreciations of
 scientific character as are exhibited in this extract; whilst the
 fact that the mutual friends of both parties disapproved of Mr.
 Burrow’s views and conduct, affords strong presumptive evi
 dence that Dr. Maskelyne's proceedings are not represented
 under their real character.         In a subsequent extract we shall
 find that Mr. Burrow had an advertisement in the St. James’s
 Chronicle relating to these differences, but      I have not been able
 to ascertain its nature.

tailor made my coat without a side-pocket, which is the reason
why   I  neglected to keep my Diary as I used to do.       I put up
for the    place of Mathematical Master of Christ's    Hospital and
lost it.
   “December 26.       I called on Clarke and went to New Square,
where I found a note for me to wait on Mr. Humfrey, junior,
in the Tower. Waited on him, and am to go tomorrow to give
him a Lesson in Geometry.
   “December 28. Did nothing or worse; was with Rogers in
Chancery Lane.
   “January 6, 1776. Was at the Nest, and Isaac Dalby was
there.
   “January 12. Called and supped with Mr. Robertson at the
Royal Society. In conversation Mr. Robertson said that Mr.
William Jones, who was Secretary to the Royal Society, lived in
Beaufort's Buildings.      He was a little shortfaced Welshman,
and used to treat his mathematical friends with a great deal of
roughness and freedom.         He rated Mr. Thomas Simpson in such
a manner about his paper against De Moivre, that Simpson said
he would never go to see him more, but he did see him again how
ever.    Gardiner, the Logarithm fellow, and Dodson he used to
treat very harshly.     Mr. John Robertson was his great favourite:
the first of their acquaintance was caused by Mr. Robertson's
book of Mensuration.         Mr. Jones asked Dr. Bevis if he knew
the author, when the Doctor replied that he was a young man
of his acquaintance. ‘Tell the young man,’ said Jones,    ‘I should
like to see him.” On Mr. Robertson calling, Mr. Jones told him
there was an error in his book, and gave him some papers to copy
where it was corrected.       After some few visits, Jones began to
take the liberty of talking in his harsh manner to Mr. Robert
son, and he took it once or twice, but finding that it increased,
he resolved to take it no longer, and began to retort. Jones
seemed surprised to find that Mr. Robertson had more spirit
than others had exhibited, but never talked to him in that strain
again, and ever afterwards treated him with the greatest kind
ness.     It was Mr. Jones's failing to be always speaking of the
faults of his mathematical acquaintances:—one was conceited,
another was obstinate; this was ignorant, and that had some
fault or other. His remarks, however, were generally shrewd
and satirical.    He left a whole Course of Mathematics nearly
ready for the press, and Mr. Robertson was to have had the care
of printing them, but when Mrs. Jones found that it could not

                     the   Journals of the late Reuben Burrow.                                                519
be done without incurring considerable expense she dropped the
intention of publishing, although her husband (Mr. Jones) died
worth some two or three thousand pounds.       Mr. Jones left his
library, which was considered the most curious and valuable of
any at that time, to Lord Macclesfield, who was very anxious to
publish a catalogue of                 it,
                          which Jones had made out after very
curious method. This     manuscript catalogue was shown       Dr.                                        to a
Bliss, who was afterwards Astronomer Royal, and       pretended                                he
that the Latin was very erroneous     the declensions and cases,in
and that     would
               it                be    an

manuscript over again corrected. This was occasioned                                                          by   a
pique that Bliss had against Jones, for the latter refusing him
a  copy       of
            the Abstract      the Conic Sections, which was after
                                            of
wards   printed            by

actions. When Bliss      applied  for the copy,   Mr. Jones made ex
cuses and pretended                   he
                           had not got them          him, but when             by                                  he
next saw Mr. Robertson he told him that he had refused Dr.
Bliss copy for the following reasons:—‘In the first place,

                           had intended        publish, fell into Lordto
Macclesfield's hands, who about this time had            electioneering               an
affair against Sir Francis Dashwood,          Oxfordshire, which costin
him more than       hundred thousand pounds, and almost ruined
                           a

Macclesfield ordered       his papers all      burned except suchto   be                                           as
related     money matters. Mr. Jones's papers were never heard
               to
of  more, and some think they were burned among the rest, but
 Horsfall     the Temple, who was one
                of                              those employed, says      of

     “January 21.          I         called      on   Mr. Robertson and dined with him.

   520    Mr. T. T. Wilkinson   on Mathematics and Mathematicians:
   He told me that in the latter part of Sir Isaac Newton’s life,
   when foreigners used to ask him questions about mathematical
   subjects, he used to inform them that he had no time to apply
   himself to such subjects, but if they would apply to Dr. Brook
   Taylor, he would resolve them anything they might desire.”
      From several successive entries in this portion of the Journal,
  it would appear that Mr. Burrow was pretty fully occupied with
  private pupils, amongst whom Mr. Humfrey, “Mr. Chapman,
  the schoolmaster at Redriff,” Mr. Grove and his two sons, are
  most frequently mentioned.       His associates at this time com
  prised most of the ablest members of the Spitalfields Mathe
  matical Society; the name of Mr. Dalby, afterwards Professor
  Dalby of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, occurs on several
  occasions as having been in his company and on terms of great
  intimacy.    Mr. Dalby was in fact one of the principal writers in
 the   early portion  of Burrow’s Diary; contributing occasionally
 in his real name, and frequently under the fictitious signature
  “Caput Mortuum,” to both the mathematical and poetical de
 partments.     The assistance rendered by Mr. Burrow to “poor
  Clarke” appears worthy of notice, since it confirms Mr. Swale's
 remark, that “his heart was good although his habits had not
 been formed by the hand of a master:”—most probably Mr.
 Clarke was entirely dependent upon such assistance during the
 latter part of his stay in London. The failure at Christ's Hospi
 tal is very laconically noticed, but his temper seems to have been
 somewhat more seriously disturbed by the oversight of the un
 accommodating tailor than by the decision of the Hospital ex
 aminers. The terms in which his opinions of the workman's
 default are expressed, rendered it necessary to suppress a portion
 of the Journal at this point. Mr. Samuel Rogers was a frequent
 contributor to the early numbers of the Diary, and at one time
 I  was led to conclude that he was identical with the noted poet
 and banker of Lombard Street; subsequent examination, how
 ever, in the absence of positive proof, has led me to doubt the
accuracy of this conjecture. The application to Lord Townsend
 eventually proved successful; since the Diary for 1777 contains
an announcement that correspondents must address their com
munications to “ Mr. Reuben Burrow, Mathematical Master of
the Drawing Room in the Tower; ” his salary, however, was not
on a very liberal scale, being only 100l. a year; nor did the
Board of Ordnance think proper to grant him any remuneration
for the extra duties they imposed upon him in making surveys
of the Essex and Sussex coasts, during the time he held the ap
pointment, for on the “27th August, 1782,” he complains to the
Board that “he has been allowed nothing; when at the same
time that wretched compiler of other men’s productions, the

                     the   Journals of the late Reuben Burrow.                                            521
Mathematical Master at Woolwich (Dr. Hutton), is paid with
profusion for his extra services; though he has more than double
the salary that                I
                    had, and his scholars never made half the
improvement that those in the Drawing-room did in the same
                                                                -

     Mr. William Jones, F.R.S. was the father of the late cele
brated Sir William Jones, and this extract adds many curious
particulars respecting him to the sketch of his life given by Mr.
Robertson in Hutton's Mathematical Dictionary.                    No doubt
Mrs. Jones acted upon the best advice when she relinquished the
project cf publishing her late husband's Course of Mathematics;
she had now the prospect of having an infant son to protect,
educate, and prepare for the actual struggles of life, and under
such circumstances the considerable outlay which must have been
incurred in case of publication, could not be justified by the un
certain sale of a Course of Mathematics, although her husband
                                                                                                         lot
had died in better circumstances than usually falls to the                                               of
mathematicians.         The pamphlet referred                 having been  to    as
written         by

    If we examine these physical singularities with a view to their
classification, we shall find that some of them are the rigid con
sequences of general laws with which we are acquainted.                         For
example, the existence of magnetic poles, that                            points             is,   of                 at

524      Mr. R. Carmichael              on the Singularities       of Physical      Science,
this illustration at some length, as it is suggestive of some points
most valuable in a theoretical point of view.
   At first sight it would seem as if a knowledge of the con
ditions which have been just stated would be sufficient to deter
mine the law of expansion, the method employed being appli
cable to all similar cases.
   Thus 8, being the coefficient                   of expansion, supposing gene
rally that
                                             8, = f(t),
it is evident that the form of
                    t=75°,
                                               f
                               must be discontinuous;                               the first
break occurring for         and a second at the value                             of t cor
responding to the point of vaporization.
   Moreover for t=55°, we should have
                             f'(55)=0,             f"(55) > 0;
for t=35°,
                             f'(35)=0,             f"(35) < 0;
and since the volume at 75° is equal to the volume at 35°,
                                        f(75)=f(35).
    These conditions, however, are manifestly insufficient to deter
mine the form of f, or the law of expansion of the metal; indeed
it is evident that an infinite number of curves might be described
so as to satisfy those conditions, but that one curve alone can
give the law required.
   This remark will serve to explain a difficulty alluded to by
M. Pierre” with regard to the expansion of liquids. He has
shown, that, although the formula
                                    8,-at-bt”.4-ct}
in general represents their expansion with considerable accuracy,
in some cases we must adopt different coefficients for the upper
and lower parts of the thermometric scale.    Thus in the case of
amylic alcohol, or fusel oil, the coefficients for temperatures
from — 15° to +80° Cent. differ from those suited to the range
from 80° to 131°.    M. Pierre states also that a formula of this
kind fails to represent the expansion of water between the limits
–13°14 and 100°, and that he has not succeeded in discovering
any simple expression which will do                        so.
   From what has been said             obvious that
                                                 it   ispriori this          à
should     be
           so, unless the formula express the ea'act law     expan                of
sion, which     is    by
                   hypothesis unknown.   The partial coincidence                           of
the deductions from the formula with the results       experiment            of
is easily intelligible from the circumstance, that any two curves
possessing tolerable regularity and passing through the same

three points, which are necessary to determine the three coeffi
cients a, b, c, will nearly coincide between those points.
   We may also now anticipate what the ultimate form of coeffi
cients of expansion must be, if ever the knowledge of molecular
physics shall be so far advanced, that this form may be investi
gated a priori from the laws of the elementary molecules, with
out the necessity of having recourse to experiment except for
verification.
     It is
        well known that most solids expand uniformly by increase
of temperature until they reach the point of liquefaction. At
this point an abrupt change takes place, and the expansion of
the body commences to follow a different law. This new law
holds until the body reaches the temperature corresponding to
the point of vaporization, when a second abrupt change takes
place, and the expansion obeys a third law differing in character
from both the preceding.
   In the present state of our knowledge we are obliged to em
ploy three distinct coefficients of expansion, expressed by empi
rical formulae, for these three several stages.    It would seem,
however, that in general coefficients of expansion should be repre
sented by discontinuous     functions, with breaks corresponding to
the  points  of liquefaction    and vaporization respectively, and the
temperatures corresponding to the points of maximum and
minimum condensation, if there be such, being given by the
roots of the respective derived functions.           Any discrimination
of substances into    solids,  liquids and  gases, may   be regarded, so
far as the    previous  remark is    concerned,   as  unnecessary,  since
modern skill has shown that they may be                   all
                                                     reduced    the class to
solid.
   Of the two classes         which we have proposed
                              to                              reduce all

consequences         known laws, and the other those not yet

purposes. Thus,          in
                         the science       optics, we avail ourselves
                                               of                               of

water, man has traced the wise design, the benevolent provision
of the Almighty, by which our seas, lakes, and rivers are avail
able for human purposes, and not converted into solid frozen
masses.    He has wondered, but as yet his wonder has resulted
in no discovery for the benefit of his species.
    In France, indeed, philosophers have adopted this point as a
natural unit of density.   It has thus supplied us with a particular
standard; but how little is this in comparison with the advan
tages which ought to result from a due application of this sur
prising phaenomenon       Again we repeat our inquiry, How comes
it that this second class of physical singularities has contributed
little or nothing for the practical good of mankind?
    The answer plainly     because   is,                    we
                                         are unacquainted with the

of that of the parent; in metamorphosis      a similar ratio is always
observed.
   Apart from the apparent exceptions about to be noticed, the
weights of equal volumes of gases and vapours are their equiva
lent weights, and the doctrine of chemical equivalents is that of
the equivalency of volumes. According to the atomic hypothe
sis, these weights represent the relative weights of the atoms,
and as equal volumes contain the same number of atoms, these
must have similar volumes, so that we come at last to the
equivalency of volumes.         As chemical combination is not a
putting together of molecules, but an interpenetration of masses,
the application of the atomic hypothesis to explain the law of
definite proportions becomes wholly unnecessary.             Chemical
species are homogeneous; “tota in minimis evistit natura.” Solu
tion is chemical union, as is indicated by the attendant conden
sation; mechanical mixtures are not accompanied by any change
of volume.
    As two volumes of water-vapour yield one volume of oxygen
and two of hydrogen, this was assumed to be the equivalent of
water and of hydrogen, while oxygen was represented by one
volume, whose weight was 8, that of the volume of hydrogen
being ‘5, so that the weight of the equivalent of water was 9.
But two volumes of hydrogen unite without condensation, with
two of chlorine, and the resulting four volumes of hydrochloric
gas are found to be equivalent to four volumes of chlorine, hy
drogen or water-vapour.        Hence four volumes are to be taken
for the   equivalent   of water,   and it becomes H* O°, with an
equivalent of 18, corresponding to HCl, and to volatile species
generally, whose equivalents are represented by four volumes of
vapour; from these, the equivalents of non-volatile species are
 determined by comparison.
    Hydrogen, chlorine, and some other primary species offer
apparent exemptions to the general law of condensation and
 equivalency of volumes.      When four volumes of chlorine unite
 with four of olefiant gas, or naphthaline, the product is condensed
into four   volumes;     but if the chlorine unite with the same
volume of hydrogen gas, there is no condensation, and eight
volumes or two equivalents of hydrochloric gas are produced.
This, however, is explained when we find that four volumes of
 ...
 the chloro-hydrocarbon MH, Cl*, may break up into four of a
 new species MCI, and four of HCl, a change which with the
          of etherene is effected by the aid of hydrate of potash,
 and with the chloride of naphthaline takes place spontaneously
 at an elevated temperature.      In the production of hydrochloric
 gas from chlorine and hydrogen, union takes place followed by
 immediate expansion without specific difference or metamor

532        Mr. T. S. Hunt              on the Theory                 of Chemical              Changes,
species from the density              vapour, the inquiry arises whether

determined from their        specific gravities.
    A connexion between equivalent weight and density                 evident                           is
in  some allied and     isomorphous      species.        Kopp,       dividing    H.                 in

some     ofthese related   species.    These numbers       evidently   repre
sent the volumes                 of
                            equivalents, and         accordance with the in
atomic   hypothesis,   are said                  to
                                      denote the atomic volumes.         The
inquiry      Kopp has been pursued
             of                                                 by

whom are Schroeder, Filhol, Playfair and Joule, and more re
cently, Dana. Their results show that the volumes thus calculated
for related species      similar crystallization are generally identical,
                               of

tration.   This system                 of
                            formulas has introduced such difficulties
into the  study         of
                    the relations before us, that we find Mr. Dana
led   tothe conclusion that “the elemental molecules are not com

                      and on Equivalent Volumes.                 533
bined together or united with one another in a compound, but
that under their mutual influence each is changed alike, and be
comes a mean result of the molecular forces in action*.”
   The solution of these difficulties is very simple, and will have
been inferred from the plan of our inquiry.        It is found in the
principle that all species crystallizing in the same shape, have
the same equivalent volume; so that their equivalent weights, as
in the case of vapours, are directly as their densities, and the equi
valents of mineral species are as much more elevated than those
of the carbon series, as their specific gravities are higher.      The
rhombohedral carbonates must be represented as salts having
from twelve to eighteen equivalents of base, replaceable so as to
give rise to a great number of species, and the variations in
the volume of different carbonates, as observed by Kopp, indi
cate the existence of several homologous genera, which are
isomorphous.
    The researches of Playfair and Joule have led them to the
conclusion that in some hydrated salts which crystallize with
twenty and twenty-four equivalents of water, as the carbonate,
the triphosphates and triarseniates of soda, the calculated volume
coincides with that obtained by multiplying the volume of ice
 (9.8 for HO with an equivalent weight of 9) by the number of
equivalents of water. This result is thus explained; water in
these salts is in the same state of condensation as in ice, and
24 HO thus condensed would occupy the volume of 24 x 9.8
 =235, which is identical with that of the rhombic phosphate, as
20 x 9.8–198 is with that of the carbonate of soda, C*Na” O’,
20 HO. Alum, crystallizing with 24 HO, has a volume which
is greater than that of phosphate of soda, and according to Play
fair and Joule, equals that of the water in the state of ice, with
the addition of the bases, the acid being excluded      t.  In reality,
the   equivalent volume of alum is to that of the rhombic phos
 phate as 270: 235, and 24 HO crystallizing in the monometric
 system, would have the same volume as alum with a specific
 gravity of about 8, giving for HO 11:25 instead of 98.
    What are called the atomic volumes of crystallized species are
 the comparative volumes of their crystals. In the rhombohedral
 system, the length of the vertical axis being constant, the volume
 varies with the length of the lateral axes, or in other words,
 increases as the rhombohedron becomes obtuse, and diminishes
 as it becomes acute, the cube being the limit between the two.
 So in the dimetric and trimetric systems, the length of the vertical
 axis being unity, the volume diminishes as the base of the prism,

may be calculated as if derivatives of the trimetric system, with
which they will be found to correspond in volume.
   It is now necessary to determine what equivalent corresponds
to a given specific gravity in any crystalline solid, or in other
words, what is the value of the condensation which takes place
in the change from the gaseous to the solid state; and here a
degree of uncertainty is met with, because the equivalent of a
crystallized species may often be a multiple of that deduced from
those chemical changes which only commence with the destruc

 tion of more extensive subjects, and have consequently presented it
 in a shape not so well adapted as it might be to the beginner.            Of
 course no one can attempt even to commence such a study without
 a previous familiarity with all the other branches of mathematics,
 such as dynamics, differential calculus, &c., necessary to its com
prehension, and a knowledge of these is of course assumed by all
 the writers on the lunar theory in a greater or less degree.            But
supposing this preliminary knowledge in the reader, there yet remain
numerous difficulties peculiar to the lunar theory itself, and it is in
treating of these that the author of the work before us has shown
his aptitude and abilities as a teacher. To those who are not already
familiar with the science, it would be impossible to state what are
the peculiar merits of the work; to those who are, it will be suffi
cient to say, that there are improvements introduced here and there
throughout the whole, and more especially in those parts where the
beginner is most likely to make mistakes.           In particular we would
direct their attention to the sixth     chapter  on the “Physical Inter
pretation” of the various terms in the equations, and to the last
chapter on “The History of the Problem before Newton,” in both
of which the author shows himself greatly superior to very many
of the Cambridge mathematical book-makers (especially those of his
own college) who slur over the principles and real foundations and
difficulties of a subject, in order to hasten to the mere mechanical
part, requiring only algebraical dexterity. In short, Mr. Godfray's
“Lunar Theory’ is the work of a man who thoroughly understands
the subject himself, and possesses more than the usual ability to
convey his knowledge to others.           As an elementary treatise and
introduction to the subject, we think it may justly claim to supersede
all former ones, and we have little doubt that as such it will soon be
adopted as the text-book at Cambridge and elsewhere.

  ON A METHOD OF DISTINGUISHING THE WOLATILE OILS OF                    THE
             SERIES cº Hº.      By c. GREv1LLE williams.

        GENTLEMEN,                                     April 25, 1853.
YTYHE fact has       long   been   notorious,  that we possess no strictly
        chemical means of     distinguishing  the volatile oils of the series
C5 H4 from each other.        The taste, smell, and the action of polarized
light have been hitherto the only distinctive character.          Any facts
tending to throw a light, however small, on this branch of the
science, cannot, I think, be otherwise than acceptable.
    Schönbein tells us that certain of the oils, when ozonized, have
the power of converting the black sulphuret into the white sulphate
of lead; but from some experiments which I had occasion to make
 some time back, I felt convinced that several of the oils possessed

this property in their normal state, or at least in the condition in
which they are found in commerce; others appear destitute of this
property, and it is upon these differences that I propose a means of
distinguishing them.
   My method of experimenting is to take slips of lead test-paper
and hold them over a bottle of hydrosulphuret of ammonia until it
acquires a uniform brown tint; I then let a drop of the
                                                                                                    oil

little electricity; but when, on the contrary, this current meets with
obstacles, and only attains slight development, the poles give much

a   great development, and this            the case because the electricity

would not take place with the same facility, the sparks would be
less brilliant, and the current would acquire a smaller development.
   A very efficacious mode of diminishing the tension is to have
recourse to the well-known properties of the Leyden jar, and other
apparatus founded on the same principle. A condenser is formed of
two leaves of tin in juxtaposition, but separated and insulated from
one another by a layer of varnish, and each of the leaves put into
communication with each extremity of the inductive wire; the points
of attachment must be on both sides of the point of interruption
when the sparks are produced.       Then the two electricities, before
arriving at the point of interruption, spread over the two surfaces
of the tin, where they lose their tension to a great extent, in conse
quence of the mutual influence exercised across the isolating layer
of varnish.
   When the condenser presents a sufficient surface (5 or 6 square
decimetres), the light is seen immediately to become weakened at
the point of interruption, whilst the machine acquires a remarkable
increase of energy; the poles then give stronger sparks and at a
greater distance than before.  The condenser may be conveniently
placed in a horizontal position, a little above the electro-magnet,
and sustained by four glass supports.    With this addition, which is
very easily made, not only does the machine give more electricity,
but it also continues longer in regular action, because the surfaces
of the breaker are no longer exposed to the action of the very intense
                                                                -
 sparks which change them so rapidly.
   An arrangement invented by M. Sinsteden, in which the principle
of condensation has been employed to obtain stronger discharges with
inductive machines, has only an apparent analogy with the method
which   I here indicate; the principle and the effects of the two
methods   being, in reality, very different.     In fact, it is the electricity
developed in the second wire, the inductive wire, which is modified
by M. Sinsteden, so as to cause more brilliant sparks; but these
stronger discharges are not accompanied by an augmentation of
tension, which      is,   on
                        the contrary, weakened.        The employment         of
this method does not         any way injure the efficiency
                               in                                  ofthat pro
posed   by me, and they may both            be
                                         employed together, where such
a course     found advisable.

   To furnish an idea of the increase of effect which have obtained
