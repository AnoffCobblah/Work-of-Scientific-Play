I.       Electrodynamic            Measurements.     By Professor WILHELM
        WEBER.—Sixth              Memoir, relating specially to the Principle of
        the Conservation          of Energy*.
         HE
        law of electrical action announced in the First Memoir
       on Electrodynamic Measurements (Elektrodynamische
Maassbestimmungen, Leipzig, 1846) has been tested on various
sides and been modified in many ways.      It has also been made
the  subject of observations and speculations  of a more general
kind; these, however, cannot by any means be regarded as having
as yet led to definite conclusions.   The First Part of the follow
ing Memoir is limited to   a discussion of the relation which this
law bears to the Principle of the Conservation of Energy, the
great importance and high significance of which have been
brought specially into prominence in connexion with the Mecha
nical Theory of Heat. In consequence of       having been asserted    its
                                 contradiction with this principle,

2                 Prof. W. Weber on Electricity in relation to
velopment of the equations of motion of two electrical particles
subjected only to their mutual action.   Albeit this development
does not lead directly to any comparisons or exact control by
reference to existing experience (on which account it has hitherto
received little attention), it nevertheless leads to various results
which appear to be of importance as furnishing clues for the                                                         in
vestigation of the molecular conditions and motions of bodies
which have acquired such special significance in relation to Che
mistry and the theory of Heat, and to offer to further investiga
tion interesting relations in these still obscure regions.

celeration due to other causes (namely to the acquired velocity of
the particles perpendicular to r, and to the mutual action between
them and other bodies).     The first part, however, or that due to
the mutual action of the two particles, is proportional to the
force arising from this mutual action, and is represented by the
quotient of this force by the mass upon which it acts.

  5. Principle       of the    Conservation of Energy for Two Particles
                           which form a detached system.
   The two fundamental laws laid down in the foregoing section,
which may be called
      The Law of the dependence of the Potential on the distance
        for a constant relative motion, and
      The Law of the dependence of the Potential

        motion for a constant distance,
require to be further discussed in relation to their bearing upon
the principle of the Conservation of Energy.
   In accordance with the principle of the conservation of energy,
three forms of energy are to be distinguished from each other—
namely, energy of motion (kinetic energy), potential energy, and
energy   of   heat (thermal energy).
   The energy of motion is that part of the energy which depends
upon the existing movements; and a special determination is
given of the way in which it depends upon movement—namely,
partly upon the magnitude of the moving mass, and partly upon
the velocity with which this mass moves.
   The same determination also appies to thermal energy, if this
is regarded, in accordance with the mechanical theory of heat,
the two particles;    while the first two parts taken together, namely
                                                         <U+017F>º

as an internal motion of the particles of bodies.    But if we are
dealing with a system of two elementary particles   (that is to say,
particles such that there can be no motion within them), it is ob
vious that in the case of such a system thermal energy has no
existence, and energy of motion and potential energy alone remain.
   Lastly, the potential energy is that part of the energy which
depends on the existing potential; and a special determination is
needed of the way in which potential energy depends upon the
potential, exactly as, in the case of the energy of motion, it is
needful to determine the special way in which it depends on
 movement.
   Now this special determination has been made by equating
potential energy (without regard to the sign) and potential+.
   The justification for this proceeding has been found in the fact
that the potential is a magnitude which is homogeneous with
kinetic energy, which, when taken with the negative sign and
added to the kinetic energy, gives always the same sum, so long
 as the two particles constitute a detached system which does
 not undergo either gain or loss of energy from without.

      two electrical particles which do not form a detached system.
     If potential energy is taken, as is done in the previous section,
as equal and opposite to potential, the principle of the conserva
tion of energy holds good for two particles only so long as these
two particles constitute a detached system—that              long    the                    is,   so              as

     This, however, certainly does not occur                                  in   reality for           a   system

     We understand, in fact, by the potential of two particles, the

longing to the two particles—that is to say, upon their relative
vis viva—and not upon the second part of the total vis viva, or
that which the two particles possess in virtue of their revolution
about one another in space or of the motion of their centre of
gravity in space; for this latter part depends upon relations
which the two particles do not of themselves directly present.
For the two particles taken by themselves do not directly pre
sent any relation to space except their distance apart, from
which no knowledge can be had of their rotation or of the
motion of their centre of gravity in space.
   Consequently, in what follows, by the kinetic energy of two
particles is to be understood, not the total vis viva possessed by
the two particles, but only their relative vis viva.
   But it is easy to see that, in accordance with this, while a
system of two electrical particles e, e receives from without an
amount of kinetic energy = a, it really undergoes an alteration
of    its

     tial energy which they possess along with this kinetic energy,
     together give always the same sum.
     Upon this the following remarks may
     (1) One particle regarded
                                              made

energy.
   (2) Two particles likewise possess    the first place kinetic                          in
energy, which     the sum   those which
                             is         they possess when con

     (3) This sum consists of a part A, which may be ascribed
 partly to the motion of their centre of gravity, and partly to
 their rotation about one another in space—and of another part
 B, which the particles possess relatively to each other when con
 sidered by themselves.        This latter part, B, is called the relative
 kinetic energy, or that belonging to the system formed by the two
particles.
     (4) But in the system of two particles there is a something,
 in addition to        its
                      kinetic energy, which does not belong                the                            to

   the demonstrations given in two previous papers in this
           (January 1870 and February 1871), we have sup
posed the water to be limited to an equatorial canal, the moon
also being in the equator.    It is desirable to consider what mo
difications will be introduced, first, by supposing the earth to be
uniformly covered with water, and, secondly, by taking into ac
count the moon’s declination.
   It will save repetition if we state once for       certain general    all
principles which           we
                        shall have      employ.    First, suppose

independent of the density of the medium is proved experimen

   for publishing  it in extenso at the present time is that propose               I
   to make use of the results relating to the variations of atmo
   spheric pressure due to the moon’s attraction in a discussion of
   the hydrodynamical theory of magnetism, and was desirous of
  previously exhibiting the mathematical reasoning by which the
  results are obtained.      In my work on the Principles of Ma
  thematics and Physics (pp. 662–665),          have attempted to acI
  count for the lunar diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism
  by attributing it to the gradations of the pressure of the earth’s
  atmosphere caused by the moon’s gravitation; but at that time
  I  was not acquainted with the proper method of ascertaining
  theoretically the laws of the moon's disturbance of the atmo
  sphere.    This problem having been subsequently solved by the
  method explained in this communication,           then found that       I
  the resulting laws and amount of the variation of the atmo
  spheric pressure fail to account for the observed laws of lunar
  diurnal variation of magnetism.       The consequent necessity of
  abandoning this mode of explaining the phenomena has led to
  a considerable modification of the views contained in the same
 work (pp. 670–676) respecting the causes of cosmical magnetism,
 the particular reasons for which                     I
                                    hope to be able shortly to ex
 plain in the course of a general review of the Hydrodynamical
 Theory of Magnetism.

   The best direction-instrument at present in use is that                                                           in
vented by Messrs. Beckley and Casella, in which a moving chain
is substituted for the shaft. In this, however, there must, I
think, be some momentum,                                      and the chains must                         pass in an
approximately straight line from the vane to the printing
instrument.
* In the electrical anemometer there is no momentum whatever.
The (four) wires being stationary, can pass anywhere where
most convenient; for instance they can come down outside the
house and enter through a gimlet hole in the window-frame.
   The cups and fans can be placed at any distance from the
printing-instrument.    For instance, the vane might be at Ports
mouth and the printing-instrument in the meteorological office
in Westminster*.     Very small battery-power is required; six
Walker cells are used, with acid diluted 14 to 1, equal to rather
less than one Grove’s cell.
   The direction-apparatus is moved by a set of Beckley fans,
the force by a set of Robinson’s cups.
   The mechanism is as follows:—
                                   The Direction          Contact-apparatus.
   On the axis (Plate I. fig. 1) of the fans is a crown cog-wheel

16 points to the compass; the instrument can, however, be
made to give 32 or 64 if required.   On this axis are two con
tact-breakers; one makes a contact for each complete revolution
in one direction, the other for each complete revolution in the
other direction.                                                -
   The contact-breakers consist of two ebonite disks.     Fig. 2 is
a front view of one of the disks.  In the surface of it are turne
two grooves—one concentric with the axis of the disk, the other
excentric and of larger radius than the first; the two grooves
run into each other for rather more than half their circumfe
rence.

          In the grooves are two slides or valves; these move on
       at one        the other end has a piece of wire fastened t
it; this wire passes through a little curved slot at the bottom
the groove (the radius of curvature equals the length of the
valve); the wire projects right through the slot, and is pressed
on by a spring fixed on the back of the disk. In one of the
disks the valves are pressed by the springs into the positions
shown in fig. 2; in the other

   Near the disks are slips of thin brass fixed on little upright                                    pil
lars and insulated from one another.     The ends of the brass slips
are fixed at right angles to them, and dip into the grooves.      The
 ends are made circular, and can revolve so as to lessen the friction
 against the sides of the grooves. When the disk & revolves in the

   When the wind changes, the pin fixed on the vertical axis
moves forward till it comes to one of the stops; then, pushing
on the stop, it moves the crown wheel and causes the disks to
revolve and raise the weight. As soon, however, as the weight
has passed the top, it falls over, moving the crown wheel and
causing the stop to gain a little on the pin; the disks then
remain at rest till the pin has again overtaken the stop.
   The disks are so adjusted that contact is always commenced
after the weight has begun to fall, and finished before the weight
has quite done falling.
   Thus a perfectly uniform and steady contact is obtained.
       The Dial and Registering Instrument (figs. 3 and 4).
    The Dial.—On the stand of the dial instrument are two
electromagnets placed horizontally.      Opposite the poles of these
are armatures hinged to the base; these form parts of levers, the
                                                  -
upper parts of which are of thin brass.
   At the top of each lever is a kind of brass claw hinged so that
it can rise a little, but prevented by the hinge from falling below
a certain position.     Fixed rather lower down on the lever is an
other brass claw of the form shown; opposite to the claw is a
ratchet-wheel with sixteen teeth (as shown). When a current
passes in the magnet the armature is attracted, the point moves
the ratchet-wheel on one tooth, the hinge allowing it to rise over
the top of the wheel; at the same time the stop (or lower claw)
prevents it moving more than one tooth.          When the current
ceases, the armature is drawn back by a spring; a set screw pre
vents the armature going back too far. The two wheels and the
hand are fixed on one axis, the wheels being placed as near
together as the thickness of the magnets will allow.
   A slight spring with a friction-roller at the end of it is so
arranged that the roller rests between two of the teeth of one
of the ratchet-wheels; this keeps the wheel always in the right
position for receiving the push on the lever.     The wheels are
 made adjustable on the axis by means of               set
                                               screws, partly that
 the rollerin putting one wheel into position may also adjust the
other, and partly that the hand may          be
                                            made     rest    tothe even   at
points.
   One magnet drives the hand        one direction; the other drives
                                        in
it in the other direction.
    This is the indicating part     the instrument;

INglaciers
    order that the question of the possibility of the descent of
           by their weight only may be discussed     one of exact                       as
science, it is necessary that some geometrical form be assigned to
a glacier. I have assumed the simplest.     have imagined a glacier       I
having a uniform rectangular cross section of equal roughness,
and of a constant slope and direction. My argument       1st, That                           is,
it   impossible such
     is                glacier should descend with that differen

 argument. To follow it out completely, a somewhat difficult ap
 plication of the principles of dynamics is required.        The question
 of the descent of   glaciers  is indeed essentially one of mechanical
 philosophy, and, as such, cannot be argued with precision other
 wise than by mathematical reasoning.          It is a question which has
 nevertheless   long   been in   possession   of that kind of scientific
 opinion (as distinguished from exact science) which refuses to
 take account of mathematical reasoning.            Unless     discard all                                I

a glacier bend itself down?' My answer to this question shall
be founded on Mr. Mathews's own experiment.       He placed
a plank of ice 2; inches thick between two supports six feet
apart, and found that it sank in the middle until, in seven
hours, under the influence of a thaw it had deflected seven
inches.      Of this experiment Mr. Mathews says,                 regard it as   “I
absolutely subversive of the Canon's theory that the descent
of glaciers by their weight alone is a mechanical impossibility.”
These are strong words.            I can only understand them by sup
posing that Mr. Mathews has other reasons than he has alleged
for considering his experiment conclusive on the question at
 issue; for the conditions under which his ice-plank bent and the
conditions under which a glacier descends are entirely different
 and have nothing in common.            A glacier is nowhere an ice-plank,
 nor is it anywhere placed flatwise between two fixed supports
 and left to bend vertically with nothing beneath it to rest upon.
 If the Mer de Glace descends by bending, it must bend in the
                                                                                                of its
 direction of      itslength, because           the direction
                                                    it   is   in         length        of
 that     itdescends.     To present     parallel   a the descent       to   gla                      a
  cier, Mr. Mathews should have placed his ice-plank between two
  supports, not flatwise, but endwise, and should have observed
  whether then      it bent      the direction
                                    in                   length. Moreover

longer covered the line when the light of portions of the other
limb fell on the slit. In order to avoid flexures, the precaution
was taken of fixing the telescope and letting the image of the
sun pass over the slit by the diurnal motion. With direction to
the vicinity of the north or the south pole of the sun (where no
displacement was to be expected), the coincidence of point and
spectrum-line remained perfectly unaltered; and this was a
guarantee that any alterations that, with a little movement of
the refractor, may happen to take place in the spectrum-appa
ratus are so small as to be without influence on the observations.

    processes different from those employed in the investigations

         I partly
             dissent from the solution of Problem (I.) by polar
               as given by Mr. Todhunter in pp. 68–70 of his
    coordinates,
 ‘History,’ on the ground that the process of integrating with
 respect to 6 from 0 to 27 depends on assuming the position of
 the pole to be within the closed curve, whereas it is a general
 rule that the nature of a curve which is required to fulfil the
  condition of a maximum or minimum admits of being deter
  mined independently of the arbitrary position of the origin of
  coordinates.     This might be done in the present instance by
  adopting the principles expressed by the two Lemmas                have                             I
  announced in the Philosophical Magazine for July, p. 28.
     The method of integration by the intervention of an evolute,
  employed in the solutions of the second and third problems dis
  cussed in the July Number, is so entirely new that I might have
  anticipated that              its

varying in strength from 50 to 3200 grains in 20 ounces of liquid,
more feeble results, even, than those with tartaric acid were obtained,
and the plates were not tarnished.         Probably, with this substance
and with others where the resulting currents were very feeble, more
distinct effects would be obtained by employing a galvanometer of
much greater electrical resistance.

   The negative condition excited in the hot platinum cup in the so
lutions of citric, and tartaric acid agrees with the results obtained
with copper in those                liquids.

66          Royal Society             —Mr.            G. Gore      on the Thermo-electric

potassium (strong solution); carbonate, acid carbonate, and bichro
mate of potassium; aqueous ammonia y chloride of ammonium; cya
nide and ferrocyanide of potassium; acetate of zinc.; and acetate of
sodium.     And negative in the following ones:—nitric, chloric, hy
drobromic, hydrofluosilicic, and sulphuric acids; ferrous sulphate;
chloride of copper (strong solution); sulphate of copper; sulphate
of zinc (strong solution); nitrate and iodide of sodium (weak solu
tions); bromide and iodide of potassium (weak solutions); iodate
of potassium ; chrome alum; nitrate of ammonium; oxalic, acetic,
tartaric, and citric acids. The number of liquids in which hot cop
per was positive was thirty-six, and of those in which it was negative
was twenty.
   In several instances where the hot metal was negative with a weak
solution, it became positive with a strong one—for instance, with
sulphate of zinc, nitrate, iodide, and sulphate of sodium, bromide
and iodide of potassium; but with chloride of copper the reverse
occurred.     These results may be connected with the fact that in weak
neutral solutions the chemical action is generally the most feeble, and
therefore interferes the least with the direct influence of the heat in
producing electric currents.
   The influence of free hydrochloric, hydrocyanic, boracic, ortho
phosphoric, and chromic acids was to make the hot copper positive ;
whilst that of nitric, chloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluosilicic, sulphuric,
and some of the organic acids was to make it negative.
   In consequence, probably, of the small amount of interference by
chemical action in solutions of oxalic, acetic, tartaric, and citric
acids, the direct influence of the heat made the copper negative—
similar to        its
                influence      platinum    on    acid liquids which
                                                              in   all      not                        do

             of                                                                                             is

 viz, increased strength of solution and diminished conduction-resist
 ance; in a very few cases, however, the opposite result took place,
as with solutions of chloride and nitrate of strontium.
    Inversions of the direction of the deflection by difference of strength
of the liquid occurred with solutions of chloride of copper, sulphate
of zinc, nitrate, iodide, and sulphate of sodium, bromide and iodide
of potassium.
    Irregularities of the amount of deflection were very apt to take
place with liquids which gave strong deflections, or which acted much
upon the copper plates (for instance, nitric acid), especially if bubbles
of air remained under the plates, or the dishes were wetted on their
side above the liquid by the solution.
    In certain acid liquids, viz. nitric, chloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluo
silicic, and sulphuric acids, the hot copper was strongly negative (not
withstanding the chemical action upon it was distinct, and in some
 cases even strong); this is similar to the electrical behaviour of pla
 tinum in such liquids, and may be attributed either to the more
 direct influence of the heat alone (such as occurs with platinum
 plates), or to a different influence of the chemical action produced
 by the heat. Both these causes probably operate in such cases.
    It is probable that in             all
                                    cases where the hot copper was positive
in   liquids     of
                  strongly acid reaction, the positive condition was due                            to
chemical action alone.
    With some liquids, especially with solutions               hydrocyanic, bo
                                                                        of
 racic, acetic, tartaric, and citric acids, the deflections were very feeble,
and the chemical action                on
                                    the plates not perceptible; whilst with
                                                                             of of
others, such         nitric and chloric acids, solutions
                      as                                         the chlorides                      of
strontium, sodium, potassium, and ammonium, and                   carbonate, acid
carbonate, and cyanide             potassium, the deflections were consider
                                      of
able, and the chemical action distinct, and              some cases strong.

 none  of   the  liquids  (except   hydrobromic    and chromic acids) did the
hot plate appear            to   be
                               less stained                 or
                                                 corroded than the cold one;
probably     in   all
                    cases    was the most eorroded, although
                                it                                     some cases     in
the corrosion was not        perceptible.
    The amount             of
                          deflection was not always proportionate              the             to
amount      of chemical action; for instance, with solutions              chloride        of
of  copper and iodate            of
                                potassium there was considerable corrosion,
but    only  feeble  currents,   probably because the plates became covered
with  a   badly    conducting   film, whilst with hydrochloric acid, chloride

the weaker mixture up to the same level and the bung slowly with
drawn.       The two copper dishes, previously connected with the
galvanometer, were next simultaneously immersed in the mixtures
and the effect noted. The following are the results obtained by this
method:—
                              Nitric Acid.
    Experiment    1.—In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes.
In B,   1 volume diluted to 40. Copper in A was positive tempo
rarily, value 0270; and permanently, value 0.198.
    Experiment 2.-In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.
In B, 1 volume of acid diluted to 20 volumes. The copper plate in
A was first positive temporarily, value of deflection '0064; and then
that in B permanently, value 2850.
    Experiment 3.—In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.
In B, 1 volume diluted to 10 volumes. Copper plate in B was po
sitive temporarily, value 4863; and permanently, value 0819.
                           Hydrochloric Acid.
   Experiment     1.—In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.
In B,   1 volume diluted to 20 volumes. The copper in B was positive
temporarily, value 9608; and permanently, value 1087.
   Experiment 2.—In A, 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 volumes.
In B, 1 volume diluted to 26-66 volumes. The copper in B was po
sitive temporarily, value 3479; and permanently, value 0702.
                              Chloric Acid.
    In A,  1  volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes. In B, l volume
diluted to 40 volumes. The copper in B was positive temporarily,
value 0036; and permanently, value 0009.
                             Sulphuric Acid.
    In A,  1  volume of acid diluted to 80 volumes.      In B, 1 volume
diluted to 40 volumes. The       copper  in B was  positive temporarily,
value   0467;    and permanently,   value 0330.
    On examining these results, it will be perceived, 1st, that onl
in one half the number of the experiments did increased strengt
of liquid produce electrical currents similar in direction to those pro
duced by increased temperature; and therefore the heat does not
act simply by causing a greater number of molecules of each indi
vidual substance to touch the hot plate; and, 2nd, that only in one
of the experiments was the copper in the weaker liquid both tempo
rarily and permanently positive to that in the stronger; whilst in
five of the experiments the copper in the stronger liquid was tem
porarily and permanently positive to that in the weaker. Increase
of strength of the liquid therefore made the copper positive in five
cases out of six.

    In the fourth experiment with hydrochloric acid with difference
 of temperature, and in the second one with difference of strength, the
 mixture in each case consisting of 1 volume of acid diluted to 40 vo
lumes with water, an increase of temperature from 16° to about
 98°C. produced a deflection of the value 2854, whilst an increase
of strength to 1 volume in 26.66 gave a deflection in the same
direction of the value 3479.      An increase of temperature of about
82°C. was not quite equal in electrical effect to an increase of 50
per cent. in the number of molecules of the acid which touched the
plates.
   In the third experiment with chloric acid with difference of tem
perature, and in the single one made with difference of strength, the
mixture in each instance consisting of 1 volume of the acid diluted
to 80 volumes with water, an increase of temperature of about 82°C.
produced an electrical effect of .0040; whilst an increase of 100 per
cent. in the number of molecules of the acid which touched the
plates produced an opposite electrical effect of .0036.
   In the third experiment with sulphuric acid with difference of
temperature, and in the single one made with difference of strength,
each being with a mixture of 1 measure of acid in 80 of water, an
increase of temperature of about 82° C. caused an electrical effect of
•0418, and an increase of 100 per cent. in the number of molecules
of acid which touched the plates caused an opposite electrical effect
of '0467.

                         Influence of Friction.
   To ascertain if the friction of one of the electrodes against the
liquid had similar effects to those produced by the direct application
of heat, I employed the apparatus shown in fig. 10. The sketch
does not require explanation.
   Experiment 1.-By immersing two stout copper wires vertically
in an acidulated solution of cupric sulphate and rotating one of them
at a speed of about 5000 revolutions per minute, the rotating wire
became electropositive.
   Experiment 2–With a saturated solution of borax, the rotating
wire was positive.
   Experiment 3–With a solution of cyanide of potassium, the
rotating wire was negative.
   Experiment 4.—With stout platinum wires in an acidulated solu
tion of cupric sulphate, the rotating wire became negative.
   Experiment 5.-With platinum wires in a solution composed of
200 grains of carbonate of potassium in 40 ounces of distilled water,
the rotating wire was faintly positive, and similarly in a very dilute
solution.                                                              -
   Experiment 6.-With two platinum disks one above the other
in a strong solution of carbonate of potassium, revolving the upper
disk at a speed of about 5000 revolutions per minute made it electro
positive.
   Experiment 7.—With an acidulated solution of cupric sulphate,
the revolving disk became feebly negative.
   On comparing these results with those obtained by unequal tempe
rature, we find that the directions of the currents in the two classes
of cases were reverse with copper in solutions of acidulated cupric
sulphate and cyanide of potassium, and similar in a solution of borax;
and with platinum in solutions of acidulated cupric sulphate or car
bonate of potassium the influence of friction and of increased tem

    The  following  communications were read:—
    1. “On the persistence of Caryophyllia           cylindracea, Reuss, a
 Cretaceous   Coral,   in the Coral-fauna of the Deep Sea.” By P.
Martin    Duncan,  M.B. Lond., F.R.S., F.G.S., Professor of Geology in
King's College, London.
    The author first referred to the synonyms and geological distribu
 tion of Caryophyllia cylindracea, Reuss, which has hitherto been
regarded as peculiar to the White Chalk, and as necessarily an ex
tinct form, inasmuch as it belonged to a group possessing only four
 cycles of septa in six systems, one of the systems being generally
 incomplete.    The distribution of the Caryophyllia of this group in
 the Gault and the Upper Chalk, the Miocene, and the Pliocene was
 noticed, and also that of the species with the incomplete cycle. The
 falsity of this generalization was shown to be proved by the results
 of deep-sea dredging off Havannah, under Count Pourtales, and
 off the Iberian peninsula under Dr. Carpenter and Mr. Gwyn Jef
freys.    The former dredged up Caryophyllia formosa with four
 complete cycles; and the latter obtained, from depths between 690
and 1090 fathoms, a group of forms with four complete and incom
 plete cycles. This group had a Cretaceous facies; one of the forms
could not be differentiated from Caryophyllia cylindracea, Reuss;
and as a species of the genus Bathycyathus was found at the same
time, this facies was rendered more striking. The representation of
the extinct genera Trochosmilia, Parasmilia, Synhelia, and Diblasus
by the recent Amphihelia, Paracyathi, and Caryophylliae was
noticed; and it was considered that, as the Cretaceous forms throve
under the same external conditions, some of them only being per
sistent, there must be some law which determines the life-duration
of species like that which restricts the years of the individual. It
was shown that deep-sea conditions must have prevailed within the
limits of the diffusion of the ova of coral polyps somewhere on the
Atlantic area ever since the Cretaceous period.
    2. “Note on an Ichthyosaurus (I. enthekiodon) from Kimmeridge
Bay, Dorset.”     By J. W. Hulke, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    In this  paper   the author described the skeleton of an Ichthyo

saurus from Kimmeridge Bay, agreeing in the characters of the
teeth with the form for which he formerly proposed the establish
ment of the genus Enthekiodon. The specimen includes the skull,
a large portion of the vertebral column, numerous ribs, the bones of
the breast-girdle, and some limb-bones.      The first forty-five ver
tebral centra have a double costal tubercle.   The coracoids have an
unusual form, being more elongated in the axial than in the trans
verse direction, and this elongation is chiefly in advance of the
glenoid cavity.    The articular end of the scapula is very broad.
The paddles are excessively reduced in size, the anterior being larger
than the posterior, as evidenced by the comparative size of the prox
imal bones. The species, which the author proposed to name I. en
*
thekiodon, most nearly resembles the Liassic I. longirostris and I. te
nuirostris.   The length of the preserved portion of the skeleton is
        10 feet; the femur measures only 2 inches, and the humerus
  ‘7 inches.
   3. “Note on a Fragment of a Teleosaurian Snout from Kim
meridge Bay, Dorset.”   By J. W. Hulke, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author described a fragment of the snout of a
Teleosaurian obtained by J. C. Mansel, Esq., F.G.S., from Kimmeridge
Bay, and which is believed to furnish the first indication of the
occurrence of Teleosaurians at Kimmeridge.        The specimen con
sists of about 17 inches of a long and slender snout, tapering slightly
towards   the apex, where the praemaxillae expand suddenly and
widely.   The nostril is terminal and directed obliquely forwards;
the praemaxillae ascend 2.5 in. above the nostril, and terminate in
an acute point; and each praemaxilla contains five alveoli.         The
lateral margins of the snout are slightly crenated by the alveoli of the
teeth, of which the three front ones are smaller than the rest: most
of the teeth have fallen out; but a few are broken off, leaving the
base in the sockets.

          AN EXPLOSION     ON    THE SUN.         BY   C. A. YOUNG.
    the 7th of September, between half-past 12 and 2 P.M., there
ONoccurred an outburst of solar energy remarkable for its sudden
ness and violence. Just at noon the writer had been examining with
the telespectroscope.* an enormous protuberance of hydrogen cloud
on the eastern limb of the sun.
   It had remained with very little change since the preceding noon
—a long, low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense or brilliant, nor
in any way remarkable except for      its

The velocity of ascent also, 166 miles per second, is considerably
greater than any thing hitherto recorded.     A general idea of its ap
pearance, when the filaments attained their greatest elevation, may
                                -
be obtained from fig. 2.
   As the filaments rose they gradually faded away like a dissolving
cloud; and at l” 15" only a few filmy wisps, with some brighter
                                                  -
streamers low down near
the chromosphere, remained
to mark the place.
    But in the meanwhile
the little “thunder-head,”
before alluded       to, had
grown and developed won
derfully into a mass of
rolling and ever-changing
flame, to speak according
 to appearances.       First it
was crowded down, as it
were, along the solar sur
face; later it rose almost
pyramidally 50,000 miles
in height; then its summit
 was drawn out into long fi
laments and threads which
were most curiously rolled
backward and downward,
like the volutes of an lonic
 capital; and finally it faded
away, and by 2" 30" had
vanished like the other.
 Figs. 3 and 4 show it in its
 full development—the former having been sketched at 1' 40", and
 the latter at 1° 55m.
   The whole phenomenon suggested most forcibly the idea of an
explosion   under the great prominence, acting mainly upward, but
also in all directions outward, and then after an interval followed by

                       Intelligence and Miscellaneous                     Articles.                         79
a corresponding in-rush: and it seems far from impossible that the
mysterious coronal streamers, if they turn out to be truly solar, as
now seems likely, may have their origin and find their explanation
in such events.
   The same afternoon a portion of the chromosphere on the oppo
site (western) limb of the sun was for several hours in a state of
unusual brilliance and excitement, and showed in the spectrum more
than 120 bright lines, whose position was determined and catalogued,
—all that I had ever seen before, and some 15 or 20 besides.
   Whether the fine aurora borealis which succeeded in the evening
was really the earth's response to this magnificent outburst of the
sun is perhaps uncertain; but the coincidence is at least suggestive,
and may easily become something more                           if,

Twºtheessentially different theories have gained acceptance in
        explanation    of the origin of the galvanic current.
Volta himself, the creator of the galvanic pile, admitted that the
contact of heterogeneous bodies was sufficient of itself to produce
a development of electricity, even if those bodies exercised no
chemical action on one another.       According to him, chemical
affinity between the bodies whose reciprocal contact excited the
electric current, was of no importance, or at least singularly sub
ordinate, in an electromotive point of view.       Volta based his
opinion chiefly on his fundamental experiments, by which he
believed he could demonstrate that two chemically indifferent
metals produce by their reciprocal contact a decomposition of the
electricity—the one becoming electropositive,       and the other
electronegative.   This is the so-called theory  of contact, which,
without   any important  modification, has hitherto been admitted
as correct by a great number of scientific men.
   Nevertheless weighty objections were early made to the theory
of contact, by several eminent physicists, who endeavoured to
demonstrate that chemical affinity between the bodies whose
contact called forth electrical phenomena was of preponderant
importance in the development of electricity. Among other

82             M. E. Edlund's                 Researches       on the Electromotive
objections to the validity of Volta's fundamental experiments,
the defenders of the electro-chemical     theory contended that it
was impossible to be certain that the decomposition of the elec
tricity at the time of the contact of the two metals really proceeds
from that contact—that, on the contrary, it might have           true                                     its
cause      the circumstance that the surface of the metal
          in                                                 covered                             is

                             Force in the Contact of Metals.                                                                83
if we admit the presence of an electromotive                                          force at the point
of contact between the two metals.         the                             If          galvanic current
passes in the same direction as the current                                            produced by the
electromotive force, a cooling results at the                                          point of contact,
which is changed into a rise of temperature in                                        the opposite case.
The theory further demonstrates that the quantities of heat pro
duced or absorbed are proportional to the electromotive forces,
and consequently are found to be in full conformity to that
which experiment requires”.     In the present state of science it
is  impossible  to account for the modifications of temperature
noted at the surface of contact without admitting the presence
of an electromotive force at that surface.  Experiments have de
cisively proved that a quantity of heat actually disappears at the
surface of contact, and not merely that a less production of heat
takes place there than in other parts of the circuit; Lenz’s ex
periments have given evident proof of this fact.     Now it is im
possible that heat should disappear without producing mecha
nical work, external or internal, which is then the equivalent of
the vanished heat, or without                            its
                                   changing into another form                                                               of

84             M. E. Edlund's                 Researches on the Electromotive
gation or modification of the position of the molecules at the
surface of contact.    The intensity of the thermoelectric force
in the contact of two different metals depends, to a high degree,
on the molecular condition of the metals.         If that condition
undergo a modification (as, for example, by tension, compression,
&c.), the result is also a modification in the thermoelectric force.
Now we know that, if one of the points of the soldering of a
thermoelectric ring be heated, we obtain, for a determinate dif
ference of temperature between the surfaces of union, a current
of given amount, which remains constant as long as the respec
tive temperatures of those surfaces remain unchanged.            now,                                      If,
the metals underwent         molecular modification

vanic current.  But it is clear that such a current could only
have a momentary duration.       Immediately after contact the
particles would be at rest; the rise of a galvanic current would
be impossible, seeing that it cannot be created out of nothing.

   When a galvanic current passes through a wire composed of
two different metals, there result two sources of heat, one inde
pendent of the other: in the first place, in consequence of the
galvanic resistance, a quantity of heat proportional to that resist
ance and to the square of the intensity of the current is developed
in the wire; in the second place, there ensues at the point of
contact a production or absorption of heat proportional both to
the electromotive force of that point and to the intensity of the
current. The first source of heat is in general, but above all
with metallic wires which present great resistance, infinitely
greater than the second, and, besides, increases more rapidly
with the intensity of the current.              then,         experiment theIf,                   in   an
intensity varies      little,   a    not impossible that the variations

                                                                      greater                                            be

                                              measured, and consequently

for the passage of the before-mentioned brass tubes, of the brass
collars which served for turning the cocks, and of the wires to be
experimented on and for that purpose introduced into the copper
cylinders.
   In the brass tubes, cc and c'c', through which the wires passed
intended for the experiments, small disks of wood pierced with
one hole were placed, and introduced far enough to be near the
ends of the copper cylinders.    The aperture in these disks was
quite large enough for the passage of the thickest wires.    They
were for the purpose of cutting off the wires from conductive
contact with the copper cylinders, and also to form a sort of bot
tom in the tubes.    To make an hermetical closure around the
wires     the following process was          adopted:—I first introduced,
round the       wire,   a small flock of cotton, which was strongly

one cylinder toward the other; and this movement did not di
minish or cease until the current had been in continual circu

follow an intense current which had circulated some hours in the
wires, the displacement of the index was effected in the opposite

sequence of the action of the water on the zinc, one of the cylin

passing from the annular space round the cylinder of copper to
the mass of water; consequently the temperature about the cop
per cylinder rose, and occasioned a continual increase of heat in
the cylinder itself.   The zinc jackets having been opened and
cleaned, the inconvenience mentioned was, to a very great extent,
removed.    This shows how necessary it is that the jackets be in
every respect perfectly equal the one to the other.       The best
procedure         is,
                 coat their interior with
                        to                  metal that will remain  a

to the sources of heat existing in each cylinder.             It  may now
easily happen,      in the course of the observations; that the tem
perature of the sides is relatively low in the cylinder in which
the point of contact commences to cool at the moment of the
reversal of the current, and that the temperature of the sides of
the other cylinder is relatively high at the same moment; the
deviation of the index will then be much less than in the former
case. It is consequently impossible to measure with certainty
by a single observation the movement of the index; this mea
 surement can only be obtained by taking the mean of a great
number of observations.
    The metals investigated were in the form of wires of about 1
 millim. diameter, except those of bismuth, tin, and lead, which
 were thicker.       The copper used had been precipitated by the
 galvanic method; and the metals bismuth, tin, lead, gold, zinc,
 and cadmium had been chemically purified from foreign elements.
 The silver likewise could be regarded as pure; for it con
 tained only 0.01 per cent. of foreign matter. The iron con
 tained 0.032 per cent. of carbon, 0.006 of siliciam, 0.028 of
 phosphorus, and a slight trace of manganese, but was free from
 sulphurºk.      In each combination, copper constituted one of the
 wires—with the exception of the pair containing palladium
 (which was soldered to a platinum wire), and that containing
 zinc (which was soldered to a silver wire). All the solderings
 were made with tin; the aluminium wire, however, had to be
 covered with a layer of copper, galvanically deposited, before the
 soldering could take place.
     The intensity of the current was regulated by means of a
 rheostat, and measured by a tangent-compass.               The circuit was
 furnished with the commutators required for the reversal of the
 current. Before the commencement of a series of observations,
 the current circulated in the wires during one or several hours,
 in order that the apparatus might have time to acquire equili
 brium of temperature.
     I  pass now to the observations properly so called.
    *   I owe the purification of these metals to the kindness of Professor
 s
 Ekman and MM. Cleve and Wimmerstedt.          I  received the gold and silver
 from the royal mint, through M. Akerman, the Director in Chief of that
 establishment, and the iron through Assistant Professor Akerman.       I had
 obtained the palladium from England, by the kindness of Mr. Nassau
            Secretary of Legation of Her Britannic Majesty at the court of

      GENTLEMEN,
IT     appears to me that Canon Moseley has overlooked, in
      valuable researches into the cause   the movement    gla                     of                               of

ciers, two considerations, both important,     am not mistaken,                      if  I
in reference     that question, namely:—1st, the accumulation
                      to                                                                                                      of

accumulate    till the resistance was overcome.    Hence the particles
of  glacier-ice,  though    to our senses  they  seem stationary, are
always slowly moving, under the influence of the thrust behind
them, gliding past the sides of their mountain-bed and past each
other with velocities varying according to the direction and                                                     in
tensity of the lines of pressure acting upon them.
   In regard to this motion, we must also bear in mind that the
accelerative action of the particles moving in front of any given
particle must always in great part counterbalance any retarding
action of those moving at its sides; so that the accumulated
pressure exerted by those behind it in order to keep up                                                              its

Tº:
      GENTLEMEN,                                 Bonn, January 6, 1872.
              has recently appeared a very valuable book, entitled
      “Theory of Heat, by J. Clerk Maxwell,” in which the me
chanical theory especially is regarded with favour, and many
quotations and historical notices in reference to             origin and                       its
development are given.                these      In
                                             details,   all

exception               of
                the “Molecular Constitution           Bodies”), my wri          of

moir, “An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of
Heat, with Numerical Results deduced from Regnault's Experi

Carnot's view, that heat can perform work without the quantity
of heat present being altered. It is true, he adduces a difficulty
which opposes this view, and says                 545),              (p.

    The heat expended for internal work      united with the heat                I
 actually present in the body into one quantity, which has the
 character previously assumed to be that of the total heat, viz.
 that it may be represented by a function of the volume and tem
 perature.  To this function, which denoted by U, Thomson               I

a whirling motion of the molecules, and very skilfully deduces
from it a series of theorems on the behaviour of heat. It must
particularly be mentioned that he also found the specific heat of
saturated steam to be a negative quantity.          He was unable, how
ever, to effect so accurate a quantitative determination of this
quantity as I, because at that time he still assumed for saturated
steam the validity of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac’s law.
    The second theorem of the mechanical theory of heat was not
treated by Rankine in this memoir, but first in another, which
was brought before the Edinburgh Royal Society a year later
 (April 1851)*.       He there says himself, speaking of my hand

110                        Prof. Clausius on        the   History   of
second theorem of the mechanical theory. At the same time he
amplified the considerations: while, in the mathematical treat
ment of the subject, I confined myself to the consideration of
gases and the process of evaporation, merely adding that it
would be easily seen how corresponding applications to other
cases also could be made, Thomson developed a series of more
general equations independent of the state of aggregation of the
bodies, and then passed on to more special applications.
   In one point, however, this later memoir also remained behind
my own.     That is to say, here also he adheres to Mariotte and
Gay-Lussac’s law in the case of saturated steam, while he hesi
tates about an hypothesis relative to permanent gases which                                         I
had made use of in my developments. On this point he says+:—
“I   cannot see that any hypothesis, such as that adopted by
Clausius fundamentally in his investigations on this subject, and
leading, as he shows, to determinations of the densities of satu
rated steam at different temperatures, which indicate enormous
deviations from the gaseous laws of variation with temperature
and pressure, is more probable, or is probably nearer the truth,
than that the density of saturated steam does follow these laws
as it is usually assumed to do.     In the present state of science
it would perhaps be wrong to say that either hypothesis is more
probable than the other.”
   Several years later, after he had convinced himself, by experi
ments which he and Joule made in common, of the correctness
of the hypothesis adopted by me, within the limits already indi
cated by myself, he also, for the first time, employed the same
procedure as       I
                 for the determination of the densities of saturated
steam    f.
   The position above stated has always, so far as know, been               I
most readily acknowledged by Messrs. Rankine and Thomson
as that occupied in relation to one another by our first writings
on the mechanical theory of heat.     Thomson, in his memoir of
1851 f, says:—“The whole theory of the motive power of heat
is founded on the two following propositions—due respectively
to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius.”      Accordingly he pro
ceeds to cite the second theorem of the mechanical theory of heat
under the designation of “Prop.                     II.
                                        (Carnot and Clausius).”
Then, after communicating      demonstration discovered
                                            a                him                        by

   In spite of these utterances by W. Thomson, Mr. Maxwell
has thought proper to leave my writings unmentioned.      He cir
cumstantially explains (pp. 145–155) that, in an essential point,
Carnot was in error in his considerations, and that consequently
the proposition expressed by him, as well as his demonstration
of  it, required          altered; yet

Carnot's proposition . . . . established, on a new foundation, in
the dynamical theory of heat.”
   Very soon after the publication of those propositions, appeared
an essay by Rankine “On the Reconcentration of the Mechanical
Energy of the Universe”*, wherein a view was stated which is
in opposition to them, namely that by concentration of the heat
rays the lost differences of temperature might be restored.                                                        I
have shown, however, in a special memoirt, that, even by radia
tion, under no circumstances can heat pass from a cooler into
a warmer body and thereby increase an existing difference of
temperature.

   In other memoirs have endeavoured to reduce to a definite
quantity the universal tendency in nature to transformation, the
value of which quantity can only alter in one direction and not
in the contrary.   In a memoir in 1854t I introduced a quantity,
N, relative to any circular processes, naming it the uncompensated
transformation, and defining it by the equation

 114        On   the    History of        the   Mechanical Theory of Heat.
 dissipated during the cycle.” The place which he cites as that
 in which Thomson had given this expression is the above-men
 tioned article “On a Universal Tendency” &c.”          But in that
 article there is neither the above-quoted nor any equivalent ex
 pression; in it altogether only four formulae occur, which are
 totally different.   Therefore Mr. Tait's assertion and the accom
 panying citation are to me inexplicable.
                                I
    In a later memoirit carried the considerations to still greater
 completeness.      The above proposition on uncompensated trans
 formations, which by omitting the symbol N can be written
 referred only to circular processes.                     I
                                              now endeavoured to
 obtain a quantity valid for any alteration of a body, and whose
 value can only change in one direction.       For this purpose, to
 the hitherto considered two sorts of transformation (viz. the trans
 formation of work into heat and vice versd, and the passage of
 heat from a warmer into a cooler body and vice versd)       added a   I
 third relative to the change of state of a body, and represented
 by the quantity Z; this Imamed the disgregation of the body.
 With the aid of this quantity and H, denoting the heat actually
 present in the body,       I
                           was able, in place of the above relation,
 to construct the  following  more general one:—
It   was the sum
                             (****-o:
                                    dIH

            I
for which introduced the name entropy of the bodyS.           By ap
plying this new idea I was able to express the tendency of nature
to transformation, more completely and definitely than it had hi
therto been expressed by any one, in the short proposition:—
The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.
  From the foregoing it will be sufficiently evident that the theory
of the dissipation of energy, or entropy, was not developed by
                                    I
Thomson alone, but that had an essential share in           develop. its
ment.    How novel my treatment         the subject was, compared

116       Mr. H. Wilde               on the Influence             of Gas- and Water-pipes
   The ever extending introduction of gas- and water-pipes into
the interior of buildings armed with lightning-conductors has,
however, greatly altered the character of the protection which
they formerly afforded; and the conviction has been long forced
upon me that, while buildings so armed are effectually protected
from injury of the mechanical kind, they are more subject to
damage by fire.
   The proximity of lightning-conductors to gas- and water-mains,
as an element of danger, has not yet, so                    know, engaged far   as

   That the direction of the electric discharge had in this case
been determined by the gas-pipes which passed under the floor
of the church, was evident from the fact that the watches of
several members of the congregation who were seated in the vi
cinity of the gas-mains were so strongly magnetized as to be
rendered unserviceable.
  The church at Crumpsall is about a mile distant from that at
Kersal Moor; and the ignition of the gas by lightning, which
undoubtedly caused    destruction,  its

                  their action on each other.
         HE    fundamental electrical law determines the action exerted
         by any given particle upon another under any circum
stances.    The simplest and most obvious application that can
be made of this law, would seem to be to develope the laws of
the motion of two particles which act mutually upon each other.
Greater practical interest, however, attached to the determina
tion, in the first place, of the laws of the distribution of electri
city at rest upon conductors, and of the laws of the forces exerted
by a current of electricity in a closed conductor, by reason of the
current existing in another conductor, upon this latter conductor
itself—as well as to the development of the laws of the (electro

   According to the last section, there exists an equation between
the relative velocity u and the relative distance r of two particles
moving anyhow in space under the action of their reciprocal
forces, namely the equation
                        #–E;(;
                        ccr—p \ro +***)

in which p denotes a constant that is positive for two similar par
ticles, and negative for two dissimilar particles.
   Now from this there follow results relative to the free motions
of two particles in space, which move, under the influence of their
own reciprocal action, with unequal velocities in a direction per
pendicular to the straight line joining them, quite similar to
those arrived at in relation to the motions considered in section 10
in the direction of the straight line r. There results, in fact, in
this case also, a distinction between two states of aggregation
for two similar particles—namely, a state of aggregation in which
the two particles move in such a way as to return periodically
into the same position relatively to each other, and a state of
 aggregation in which the two particles move so as to become
always more and more distant from each other and never return
to the same position.   No transition from one state of aggrega
tion to the other takes place so long as the two particles move
only under the influence of their own reciprocal forces.
                                          13.
   A rotation of   the two particles about each other implies the
 existence of a certain attracting force if the two particles are to
 remain at a constant distance from each other during this rota
 tion; and this attracting force required for the rotation increases,
 for the same distance, according to the square of velocity of ro
 tation. According to this, one would expect that, for two similar
 electrical    particles at    a distance   roºp     (at   which they attract each

126                Prof. W. Weber                   on       Electricity in relation to
other), there would be always a certain velocity of rotation ao
for which the attracting force required by the rotation should be
equal to the attracting force resulting from the reciprocal action
of the two particles, so that the two particles rotating about
each other would remain, for this velocity of rotation, at the
same distance          This, however,

is to say, becomes infinite, if the velocity of rotation ao differed
from nothing for the instant at which r=ro. From this it fol
lows that the interval of time 9 in which the two particles ap
proach each other from the distance r=ro to r=0 has a finite
value.     The fact that for the instant at which r becomes equal
to 0 the value of the relative velocity of the two particles becomes

signifies here only that this relative velocity is to be henceforward
taken as a velocity of separation = +oo, whereas it was, up to
this point, a veloctiy of approach = —oo. This being premised,
it easily follows that, in a second equal interval of time 6, the
two particles will separate from each other again from the dis
tance rao to the distance r=ro.               The interval of time 20, in
which the two particles approach each other with increasing ve
locity from the distance r=ro to r=0 and then separate again
from the distance r=0 to r=ro, may be called the time of oscil
lation of the atomic pair formed of the two electrical particles.
     There still remains the problem of determining the time of os
 cillation 20 of such   an atomic    pair.
     This time of oscillation can be readily deduced from the equa

by atomic pairs, may possibly also determine similar states of
aggregation of ponderable bodies.   For in the general distribution
of electricity it must be assumed that an atom of electricity
adheres to each ponderable atom.       But if atoms of electricity
adhere firmly  to ponderable atoms,  nothing  will be altered in the
relations of the electrical atoms except the masses which have to
be moved by the forces acting on the electrical atoms.       But in

   The molecular state of aggregation of two dissimilar electrical
particles that has just been described, namely that in which the
distance of the two particles alternately increases and diminishes
between exactly defined limits and the path in which one particle
moves about the other becomes a circular orbit at the two limits,
is deserving of closer consideration, especially in those cases in
which it is admissible to regard one of the particles as being at
rest and the other particle as moving in a circle about the first.
   The relation between the particles in respect of their partici
pation in the motion depends upon the ratio of their masses e
and     e';
          and, according    section 15, the values

144               Prof. W. Weber on Electricity in relation to
the increase of thermal energy found by observation, it would
then be absolutely necessary, according to the principle of the
conservation of energy, that a transference should take place of
the kinetic energy of the electrical particles in the Ampèrian
currents to the other particles whose motion constitutes heat.
And indeed it would be needful that all the kinetic energy pro
duced by the current in the electrical particles of the Ampèrian
currents should be completely transferred to these other particles
at each instant.
   But apart from the consideration that it is impossible to con
ceive how such a complete transference could take place, it
is self-evident that any even partial transference of the kinetic
energy of Ampèrian molecular currents to other particles is con
tradictory of the permanence which belongs to the essential
nature of Ampèrian currents. If such a transference of kinetic
energy from electrical particles in molecular currents to other
particles were really to occur, it would simply prove that the
molecular currents formed by these particles were not Ampèrian
molecular currents, since they would not possess the permanence
wherein the essence of Ampèrian molecular currents consists.

electrical  particles exist       the state in  aggregation correspond

152                      Royal Society:—
Academy of Sciences of Vienna a paper entitled “On the depend
ence of the Earth's Magnetism on the Rotation of the Sun.”
   He shows that the changes of each of the three elements of the
force of terrestrial magnetism (declination, inclination, and horizontal
force) indicate a period of 263 days. The periodic change of declina
tion for Prague (1870) amounts to 0.705 sin (r-H 190° 20'), where
a =0° at the commencement of 1870, and w=360° at the commence
ment of 1871. For Vienna the range is a little larger. The range
of inclination is nearly one-third of that of declination, that of the
intensity nearly 24 units of the 4th decimal (the intensity in June
1870 was nearly 2.0485).
   Professor Hornstein regards these changes of the earth's magne
tism as the effect of the sun's rotation, and by a mean of several
determinations finds for the duration of the period 26-33 days.     This
number may consequently be regarded as the result of the first at
tempt to determine the synodic period of the sun's rotation by
means of the magnetic needle.        The resulting true periodic time
of the sun's rotation is 24:55     days,  almost exactly agreeing with
the time of rotation of the    sun-spots  in the sun's equator deduced
from astronomical observations    (according  to Spörer 24°541 days).
    “Corrections to the Computed Lengths of Waves of Light pub
lished in the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1868.”       By
George Biddell Airy, C.B., Astronomer Royal.
    The author, after adverting to the process by which in a former
paper he had attempted the computation of the Lengths of Waves of
Light, for the entire series measured in the Solar Spectrum by Kirch
hoff, from a limited number of measured wave-lengths, and to the
discordances between the results of these computations and the ac
tual measure of numerous wave-lengths to which he subsequently
had access, calls attention to his remark that means existed for giving
accuracy to the whole. The object of the present paper is so to use
these means as to produce a table of corrections applicable through
the entire range of Kirchhoff's lines, and actually to apply the cor
rections to those computed wave-lengths which relate to spectral
lines produced by the atmosphere and by many metals.
   Adopting as foundation the comparisons with Angström's and
Ditscheiner's measures given in the former paper, and laying these
down graphically, the author remarks that in some parts of the spec
trum the agreement of the two experimenters is very close, that in
some parts they are irreconcilable, and that in one part (where they
agree) there is a peculiarity which leads to the supposition that some
important change was made in Kirchhoff's adjustments.          He then
explains the considerations on which he has drawn a correction-curve,
whose ordinates are to give the corrections applicable to his former
computed numbers. A general table of corrections is then given,
and this is followed by tables of the Lengths of the Light-Waves for
the   air
        and metals  as  corrected  bythe quantities deduced from that
general table.
   The author remarks that    he has not yet succeeded   in discovering
any relation among the wave-lengths      for
                                           the various lines given   by

              current passes from the batteries at the Royal Obser
vatory, Cape Town, at 1 o'clock, and discharges a gun at the Castle,
and through relays drops a time-ball at Port Elizabeth. It appeared
to the author that a valuable determination of the velocity of sound
might be obtained by measuring upon the chronograph of the Ob
servatory the interval between the time of the sound reaching some
point near the gun and that of           arrival      its

     The author commenced        by referring   to the general conditions of
 the surface of the country under consideration, and to the evidence
 afforded by it of a great decrease in the amount of rainfall, and a
 great change in the nature of the rivers.           His object was to show
 that the   superficial  deposits  of the  plains  of India were formed by
 the action of   mountain-streams,     the  deposits  being irregular trans
 versely, but exhibiting a uniform section longitudinally, in a curve
 which the author believed to be a true parabola, as indicated by
 Mr. Tylor. The connexion of this with the author's theory as to
 the transporting power of water was indicated.              The author also
 showed that the beds of the large Indian rivers are rising rather
 than being lowered, and pointed out that this was in accordance
  with his theory.

         ON THE SPECTRUM        OF HYDROGEN AT LOW          PRESSURE.
                         BY   G. M. SEA BROKE, Esq.
       URING    the late summer months I have been comparing the lines
       given by hydrogen in the spectroscope with the lines of the solar
 spectrum, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any lines in the
 sun's chromosphere were due to hydrogen, besides those usually
  supposed to be due to this element.          The observations are as yet
                                                            I
  incomplete; but as it will be some months before can again pro
 ceed, I therefore produce the results obtained up to the present
 time. The experiments have been conducted in a room adjoining
 the Temple Observatory lately erected at Rugby. My mode of
 proceeding has been briefly as follows:—I use a vacuum-tube con
 taining hydrogen, and connected with a Sprengel's air-pump.             The
  tube is of the ordinary form, having the part between the bulbs,
  into which the platinum wires pass, about <U+017F>o inch internal diameter.
  The pressure in the tube varied from 3 to 4 millims. of mercury.
  Preliminary experiments showed that at this pressure the lines ap
  peared most distinct; but a slight change of pressure near 4 millims.
  made little alteration in the lines.         There is a battery of twelve
  Smee's to work the coil for      passing   the spark in the vacuum-tube.

156                Intelligence and Miscellaneous                 Articles.
The light     from the hydrogen-tube passed through a lens which con
centrates it on the slit of the spectroscope.                      A dispersive power of
four   prisms   of 60° was          used, the   arrangement       of the instrument being
such that the ray of light traverses each prism twice.                         The room is
kept perfectly dark, and sunlight is reflected down from the roof by
means of a heliostat.               At first I tried the usual mode of comparing
spectra, viz. by having the hydrogen and solar spectra side by side.
I found this answer very well for the bright lines; but the faint ones
could not be distinguished by the side of the bright solar spectrum.
I  therefore placed a very fine platinum wire in the eyepiece of the
spectroscope, and brought the lines under examination into coinci
dence with the wire, and then passed the sunlight in, and found
which black line coincided with the wire, or, where there was no
coincidence, the position of the wire with respect to the black lines.
I  have made from ten to twenty observations on each line that I
have at present examined.                 I have every reason to believe that the
limit of error is within two divisions of Fraunhofer's scale either
way. The Table below gives the positions of the lines I have already
compared. These I hope to examine again next year, and also to
finish the remainder.

     ON    THE DISENGAGEMENT OF HEAT WHEN CAOUTCHOUC IS
                  STRETCHED.  BY PROF. E. WILLARI.
     In a communication      made to the Royal Society in 1857, Joule”
describes some      investigations   on the thermal effects which occur
when threads of various substances are stretched or contract.                It
results from an accurate        investigation   of this   subject  that metal
wires cool on being stretched, and become heated on contrac
tion—but that threads of vulcanized caoutchouc have quite the
opposite comportment, becoming heated when they are stretched, and
cooled when they contract.         This remarkable fact has since been
investigated by other physicists, for instance by Govit, and recently
by Pierret, and always with the same result.
    In my recent investigations on the elasticity of caoutchouc, had                            I
occasion to repeat Joule's experiment on threads, cords, and strips
of caoutchouc of various dimensions, and by means of very simple
apparatus.      It consisted of a thermopile connected with a galvano
meter, and so suspended to silk threads that it could be easily lowered
upon the caoutchouc band to be examined, or raised away from                                         it.
The strip       caoutchouc was thus horizontal, fastened
                  of                                                one end          at              to
a  strong table, and           at
                           the other       lever,    to
                                                     that
                                                      a         so
                                                             could      readily
                                                                           it              be
stretched and afterwards loosened.           Each time the caoutchouc was
stretched        loosened, the thermopile was raised, and then placed
                  or
with      its
           whole weight upon the caoutchouc,                         so    as
                                                                determine the   to
change        temperature produced.

on contraction, are measured by the thermopile.              Yet, as the thermal
indications are mostly restricted to deflections of 8 or 10 degrees of
the galvanometer, it will be easily understood that the small differ
ences are concealed and annulled by the unavoidable errors in such
observations. The phenomenon is most conclusively demonstrated
when the extensions and contractions are repeated several times in
succession, in such a manner that the greater increase of tempera
ture on extension may accumulate as against the smaller decrease
on the corresponding contraction.            And, in fact, when I frequently
and successively stretched and loosened two caoutchouc threads, one
 6 to 7 millims. and the other 10 millims. in thickness, I observed
with the thermopile so strong an increase on stretching, that the
deflection of the galvanometer amounted to 60, 70, or even 90°,
especially in the experiments with the thicker thread.                  -
    I repeated the same experiments on two caoutchouc bands—one a
perfectly smooth one, 25 millims. in breadth and 3 millims. in thick
ness, and one, which was rough from the impression of the fabric
 on which it had been made, 27 millims. in breadth and 4 millims. in
 thickness.     Both these strips gave the same results as the above
 mentioned threads—that                    is,

 rapid stretching and loosening. These strips were frequently drawn
 out with the hand, but usually by means                                  of

    which takes place in stretching and in contracting the caoutchouc.
    We know, in fact, that when the permanent gases in expanding
    perform work they become cooled, and the more so the more they
    were heated while in the compressed state—and, further, that the
    work performed on compressing a gas by a given amount is equal to
    that which it produces when it expands, if there is no loss. In
    caoutchouc there is no such reciprocity, owing to the small mobility
    of the particles and the resistance which they must overcome in
    order to displace themselves. Part of the force communicated to
    them is used up in internal work, and during expansion is con
    verted into work; and another part is also used and changed during
    the time of contraction.  Hence it is that the force used in the ex
    pansion of the caoutchouc is not entirely reproduced in the contrac
    tion.   Such a conclusion results from the following observation.
    In studying the elasticity of caoutchouc,                  I
                                                   have observed that on
    adding given weights this substance lengthens to a greater extent than
    that by which it shortens when they are removed. I have recently
    repeated these experiments; and the results are contained in the

         It   follows from the last column of this Table, and of others,
    which for shortness' sake I will not give, that when a given load is
    removed the thread is less shortened than it had been lengthened
    by the addition of the load; and the difference is greater the greater
    the lengthenings have been.
       This observation leads to the assumption that the shortenings are
    smaller than the lengthenings, not on account of diminished elas
    ticity, but because caoutchouc in               its

XIX.  On the Constitution of Matter.     By M. B. PELL, B.A.,
  Professor of Mathematics in the University of Sydney, late Fel
  low of St. John's College, Cambridge*.
INsomethe following paper an attempt is made to account for
          of the properties of matter upon mechanical principles.
I assume that solid bodies consist of isolated atoms, whose linear
magnitudes are so small compared with the distances between
them, that the atoms may be supposed incapable of giving or of
receiving any energy except that of translation—and that the
mutual action between two atoms is some function of their dis
tance, and acts in the line joining their centres of gravity.
   Some writers, whose opinions are entitled to much respect,
have expressed an entire want of faith in the theory of isolated
atoms acting upon one another at a distance; and some even
hold that such a state of things is inconceivable.   This is one of
those half metaphysical questions upon which perhaps no two
men would be found to be exactly agreed; but to me it seems
no more difficult to conceive that atoms should have been created
with the property of acting upon one another at a distance, than
it is to conceive that they should have been created, or have in
any way come to exist or to have any properties at all. It may
be that the bodies of the solar system do not act upon one an
other directly; but they appear to do so, and we are content to
assume, provisionally at      all
                              events, that they    really
                                                  do         act.so

There should be no difficulty then in making a similar supposi
tion respecting the atoms of which matter is assumed to consist.
     If
      matter does not consist of isolated atoms but is continuous,
any  inquiry   into                    its
                          real nature would seem          hopeless                               as                  as   a
similar investigation respecting time           space.   We could not            or

            to                       the facts, for instance, that gold

        The dynamical theory                          of   gases, due chiefly                    to   the labours         of

          Prof.    M. B. Pell   on the Constitution   of Matter.       163
 Clausius and Maxwell, helps us somewhat.               This theory may be
 regarded as established, and as forming the most important
 addition which has been made to our real knowledge of the laws
  of inorganic matter in this generation.             Maxwell, for reasons
 assigned, assumes that the gaseous molecules repel one another
 according to a certain law which makes the force insensible, ex
 cept at very small distances.          The theory of elastic molecules
 involves a similar   assumption;      for the elasticity of the molecules
 must be caused     by a  repulsive   action between their atoms, unless
 we are to accept an elastic molecule as a finality, beyond which
 our inquiries into the nature of matter cannot extend.            The con
 densible   gases   and  vapours     so  closely  resemble the   permanent
 gases in so many of their properties, that it is impossible not to
  believe that they are governed by the same laws.             If the mole
 cules of hydrogen repel one another at certain distances, we can
 not doubt that the same is true with respect to chlorine, and
 carbonic acid gas, and steam.           Indeed it would be difficult to
 know where to draw the line between hydrogen and the most
 refractory solid. But if the molecules of carbonic acid gas be
 brought near enough together, they undoubtedly attract, and at
  still shorter distances again repel one another. If we assume the
  existence of isolated atoms, there seems no escape from the doc
  trine of an alternation of actual attractions and repulsions.
      Sir Humphry Davy supposed that the repulsive forces between
  the particles of matter might be of a nature analogous to that
  which keeps the planets from falling into the sun, or to what
  commonly goes by the name of centrifugal force.               Except that
  this view of the case is mentioned with            approval   by  a recent
  writer, I should not have thought it necessary to make use of
  any arguments to show that the complicated actions which take
  place between particles of matter cannot be accounted for by
  Newton’s law of attraction alone. That the particles of a solid body
  should be not only kept apart, but in permanent general relative
  positions, by centrifugal force alone, seems to me utterly incon
  ceivable under any known mechanical laws.              It may be demon
  strated  moreover,   assuming     the  theory   of atoms,  that the cohe
  sive forces of any substance, having any appreciable tenacity, are
  not only greater, but many millions of times greater than what
  would be caused by Newton’s law.              It is so far certain, then,
  that that law is not    absolutely    universal,  but is replaced or sup
  plemented by something totally different at very short distances.
      The atoms or particles of a solid body certainly seem to be in
  a  position of stable equilibrium, or rather to be vibrating about
  such a   position;  and there seems no good reason for doubting
  that such  is,  not apparently only, but really the case. The fol

the first place, that probably the liquid condition cannot exist
with any permanence except under the combined effects of tem
perature and pressure; and in the second place, I must anticipate
so much as to say that I hope to succeed in showing that it is
probable that the atoms of a solid, under the action of heat, ag
gregate themselves into molecules, and assume the liquid and
gaseous conditions at a far lower temperature than what could
correspond to the velocity necessary to carry the atom from A
to B. That velocity corresponds, not to the melting-point of
the substance, but to the far higher temperature—higher perhaps
than any at present existing in the solar system, under which a
molecule would be resolved into atoms.
     If a
       be the distance between the atoms, and f(a) the dynami
cal measure of the attraction between them, the conditions which
have been stated may be approximately expressed by supposing
                             f(a) = (x-a)(3–w)°p(r),
where O A= 2,           O'B-8,       and p(v) is a function which does not
change sensibly           within     the small limits a = 2, was 3.    Let
AE-2 =h, w= 2+2,              h     and 2 being  supposed  small compared
with a ; then

     It
      must be observed that this is little, if anything, more than
a statement in a mathematical form of some of the most obvious
properties of ordinary matter.      It remains to be seen whether
this statement or assumption is consistent with, and can explain
other and more recondite properties.
   In order to satisfy approximately the condition that f(3)

This is what might be inferred from the above considerations;
      pM+qM
for                   is the average mass of an atom of the compound,
           p-H q
      pM+qM1
and                   s the average heat per atom to produce a rise                of
1° from the absolute zero, and therefore equal to c.
   This subject is very fully treated in a valuable memoir by
Kopp in the Philosophical Transactions. He points out that
the circumstance that k is nearly the same for most simple solids,
does not indicate necessarily that they are really simple, but that
they are of the same order of composition. There is some diffi
culty in the theory, however; for Kopp remarks that the known
change of specific heat with change of temperature is not suffi
cient to account for the observed differences in the values of k,
even for those substances which nearly satisfy the law.       This
difficulty disappears, I think, when we observe that the quantity
estimated and recorded as the atomic heat is
                                      Ma (1 + et),
and although     e is very small it is different for different sub
stances, and t being the absolute temperature is considerable.
If we had the means of reducing the observations with certainty
to the absolute zero, it is probable that the discrepancies would
disappear.
   The most general case which                   I
                                     have yet attempted to investi
gate in connexion with the motion of atoms, is that of n atoms in
a straight line.   This is far, of course, from being an arrange
 ment which the atoms of a molecule would really assume and
 maintain: but it is a theoretically possible combination; and
 having some generality,             its

              any system, not subject to loss of energy by friction
or  any similar cause, be vibrating about a position of stable equi
librium, the average proportion of the energy in a potential state
depends greatly upon whether or not there is any position of
unstable equilibrium within, or nearly within, the scope of the
motion. When the system passes slowly through such a posi
tion, a large proportion of the energy becomes potential; and if
the motion constitutes heat, a large proportion of the heat be-,
comes latent.   The existence of the position of unstable equili
brium, B, appears to be the chief cause of the various changes
which are observed in the specific heats of solids, gases, and
vapours.

heat of considerable intensity, in which case there would be dif
ferent values of p for different wave-lengths.        The molecular
arrangements of such a substance would display great instability.
A molecule formed under one wave-length would be decomposed
and otherwise arranged by heat of a different kind.       As we have
every reason to believe that this kind of instability does not exist in
the case of simple substances, we may infer that Jº is not very
small, the general conclusion being that for ordinary substances
*   is small but not very small.
;  The particular value of ºr which for any substance is equal to
      is not the one which produces the greatest effect in arranging
the atoms into groups.                        The greatest effect is caused by the
value of Jº which makes                      (2n+1)} equal to an odd multiple of
7r                          -                                                          -                -

the expression for the relative displacement becomes infinite.
This does not indicate that there would necessarily be a rupture
of the system, but merely that the displacement cannot be ex

   There is thus a concentration of heat at the joints; so that at
those points a greater softening takes place than would occur if
the heat were uniformly distributed. This effect is increased as
the temperature increases, on account of the increasing propor
tion of the heat employed in softening the joints, which becomes
latent. The temperature, therefore, at which the melting occurs
is much lower than what, if uniformly distributed, would dissever
the atoms.
   The effect of radiant heat upon a system of n atoms, such as
that under consideration, may perhaps be represented by sup
posing the additional atom at the beginning of the series to be
of feeble power, proportional to Am”, when A is very small. Let
 aro   be   the displacement             of   this atom, and

   The principle which have stated, if established, would afford
some hope of our being able to understand the facts of “spectrum
analysis.” The fixed character of the bright lines makes it im
possible to conceive that the energy due to the translation or
rotation of the vapour molecules can have any thing to do with
their production. They must be caused by the internal vibra
tions of something of which the molecule is composed.     A com
plete knowledge of the arrangement and mode of vibration of
the atoms of a molecule would involve a complete knowledge of
the corresponding bright lines. We may imagine that the mo
lecule of the very simple structure which we have been consider

I believe that the constitution of the luminiferous aether is such
as to render it incapable of propagating waves of less than a cer
tain length.
    Isee some hope also of an explanation of what has always
appeared to me one of the greatest difficulties in connexion with
molecular physics—that the wave-length should be so nearly the
same for all kinds of heat.    It is not difficult to conceive that the
molecules in the sun and     elsewhere,    whose vibrations are the
chief sources of heat, should have been so constituted as to vi
brate nearly in the same time. The difficulty is to understand
                                                      in all
why the molecules of bodies of        kinds and constitutions, being
heated and then left      vibrate      their own way, should
                                       to                            vi                                   all

         nearly     unison. But we hold that the arrangement

of atoms into molecules      caused                            by

heat, and differ sometimes so entirely from inorganic substances
formed of the same chemical elements, may involve abnormal
molecular arrangements not in accordance with the prevailing
wave-length, and thus be liable to decay when removed from the
local influences under which they were produced ?
   The present uniformity of wave-length is a condition of dy
namical equilibrium, which may have existed from the begin
ning, but which may, I think, have been brought about by the
operation of natural causes.    Supposing a number of atoms,
enough to make a solar system, to have been created anywhere
in space, but at such distances apart as to cause by their conflu
ence, a sufficient        amount         of heat to animate the whole.

beginning there would be a true chaos. There would be every
variety of wave-length, and consequently every variety of mole
cular arrangement with no stability anywhere, but a continuous
process of composition and decomposition.     But out of this
chaos order would be gradually evolved.             The principle of na
tural selection would begin to operate even at this early period.
Every radiating molecule would endeavour to impress                     own                    its
constitution upon others within              influence, its  propagate            to                  its

                                           the conqueror.        The mole

weaker kinds; and any additional stability                structure which    of
might accidentally arise amongst themselves would                    propa                be

 the wires, the end of the index, and the radial line on the bottom
 of the frame must coincide, so that parallax is avoided.           The
 object of the frame is therefore twofold: first, it serves to limit
 the vibration of the needle; and, secondly, it gives us a very
 exact means of noting a deflection.        There is a small needle
 point attached to the bottom plate, forming a prolongation of
 the line; and, finally, upon the dial-plate are engraved, instead of
 a number of degrees or other arbitrary divisions, simply a line
 at right angles to the coil, to serve as a zero-line, and two
 radial lines on each side, the use of which we shall presently see.
    There is a small socket in the top of the cover of the instru
ment, immediately over the centre of suspension of the needle, in
 which may be fixed a rod carrying a directing magnet.                In
testing ordinary resistance, this magnet may be made to oppose
the earth’s magnetism, so as to render the needle nearly astatic;
or it may be made to counteract a deflection, as in taking battery
or line-resistance, as already explained, so as to bring the needle
into      its
          most sensitive position;       may                or

    will perhaps render this description clearer.
       Although quite convinced myself of the fact of the radial po
    larization of the corona,                    I
                                      was anxious this time to place it
   beyond doubt by taking actual measurements of it in such a
   position that, if the polarized light proceeded from the unobscured
   portion of the earth reflected into the atmosphere and again
   back to the eye, it could not be measured.           I therefore chose the
   southern limb for my observations, and carefully got my bands
   radial to the sun, and consequently making but a small angle
  with the horizon, before totality, keeping the field as nearly
  as  I   could in the same position-angle with respect to the sun
  by means of the right-ascension tangent-rod during totality.
  Immediately totality commenced, the white-centred bands ap
     eared.         I
                 turned the axis of the frame with the glass plates
  until the bands disappeared. The angle the plates had to
  be turned through was 35°.              I then turned the declination
  tangent-screw      slightly, so as to get a portion of the corona
  a small distance from the limb (I think about 10') into the
 field. The plates had then to be turned through an angle of
 45° before the bands disappeared.            Three other measurements
 were taken in about the same position, the result showing that
 the polarization increased considerably with distance from the
 limb.
      It is evident that if the polarized light were really due to the
 reflection from the unobscured portion of the earth, it would be
 polarized in a plane nearly at right angles to the plane of my
 bands, and consequently                        its
                                     polarization could not        neutralized              be

                                          in        which they were used.
 When the plates were inclined,                                 so   as
                                                     neutralize the coronato in

deduction of the law of facility of Xple, when n is made very
large, is also presented in a form somewhat different from that of
either Laplace or Ellis; and the general formula is verified in
several instances by assuming special laws for the individual
errors, so as to render the n integrations capable of accurate per
formance.     The principle made use       which    due    Lejeuneof,              is        to

stration depend on principles the general truth of which is ap
parent on consideration, and the mathematical difficulties are not
of a very serious kind. The illustration derived from the deflec
tion of a stone let fall on to a plane, first given by Sir John
Herschel in the Edinburgh Review, has been sometimes regarded
as a proof of the law*. So far from being self-evident, it appears
to me that the assumption there made of independent w and y
deflections is one of the most striking consequences of Laplace's
law of facility.   A priori, one would be inclined to think that
the largeness of an a deflection would increase the probability
of a small y deflection, as then the total deflection would be ren
dered less.            At      all

     we further substitute for the pipe stopped at one end an
open tube twice the length of the former, like results will con
tinue to be perceptible.
   The method of explanation        have already

                                                 developed applies
in principle to this latter case also.
   For, suppose the first wave propagated by the bell down the
tube to be a condensation.      At the moment when the front of
 the wave reaches the aperture, a reflection will begin to take place
 from the latter; the reflected wave, as shall presently show,         I
 being a wave of rarefaction, and not a wave of condensation, as
 would have been the case had the reflection taken place from a
 fixed obstacle.  Such being the case, if we represent by 2t the
period of vibration, going and returning, of the bell, we shall
 have within the tube at the end of 2t a rarefied wave travelling
from the aperture and completely filling the tube. Hence, du
ring the third interval t                   (i.

rises to the surface in bubbles. In this way ten or twelve bub
bles of air may form a ring on the surface in contact with the
glass.   If a small flame of a spirit-lamp be now applied to the
bottom of the tube, a bubble of steam will often ascend through
the oil and fish down one or two or three of these bubbles, which
may burst and scatter a multitude of minute bubbles against the
side of the tube, where they remain a long time.      It would be
quite natural to suppose that these bubbles are derived from the
water instead of from the superincumbent air.      It is curious to
see how easily a bubble of steam adheres to a bubble of air.      I
believe this to be the source of the air found in boiling liquids
in the form in which this experiment is arranged. .

   In conclusion, will give the results of a few experiments
which were made after reading M. Solaro's paper.
   Exp. 1. Distilled water was poured into a clean flask, and
this was placed over the flame of a spirit-lamp. Two vortices of
steam-bubbles    continued to ascend from two small but visible
black specks in the bottom of the flask so long as the boiling
was continued.
   Eajp. 2. A rat's-tail file placed in boiling water gave off steam
from every part of the immersed surface.        The file was washed
in soap and water. It was now active at several points. It
was then washed in alcohol, it was still active, and on closely
examining these points they were evidently rust. The file was
  ut into dilute sulphuric acid and dried in hot air. It was then
inactive. Now                let
                     me ask why the file, after the first cleaning,
should act      onein   two points only, and not over
                                   or                          whole         its
surface,     if,
             according     the theory, rough bodies are most effec

lightly smeared with oil.    The file when introduced into the hot
water was immediately covered with bubbles, and bubbles escaped
from   its
         surface during several minutes,      long        so   as
                                                      the water was
just about the boiling-point.

      GENTLEMEN,                      Cincinnati, December 30, 1871.
    SHOULD like to submit to scientific men a brief exposition
     of my researches on Malaria, as think they will be re     I
ceived with some degree of interest.      The present communica

of Medicine of this city; but it is prepared with more care and
better adapted to the character of the Philosophical Magazine.

        While excessively moist lands in warm climates are known to
be very unfavourable to health, no adequate cause for the evils
is to be found in the local variation in the gaseous constituents
of the air, or in any direct influence of the aqueous vapour
which it contains.   To remove the mysteries connected with the
insalubrity of such localities, the course of experimental inquiry
has recently been directed to a search for the organic matter in
air and in water; but an examination of the sources from which
 this matter is derived may contribute much to reveal                pecu           its
 liar characters and its effects on the human frame.               For the
greater portion            of

210        Mr. D. Vaughan     on the Origin    of Malaria.
to correspond to those malarious emanations which marshes are
ready to send forth in obedience to the elevation of temperature.
   From the limited scale on which they are produced on our
globe, these volatile oils could have little influence on the con
dition of human health if they were uniformly diffused through
the atmosphere, or even if they entered it by vegetable exhala
tion alone.   But, from their slight solubility in water, they are
collected during  rains into low marshes ; and under the influ
ence of heat the air in these localities must be filled with the
vapours of the volatile organic matter produced on the high lands
around them.     The course of nature in this case is very similar
to that exhibited on a small scale in obtaining volatile oils or
perfumes from different parts of plants by aqueous distillation.
On distilling with water the vegetable products in which they
are contained, the essential oils pass over with the steam and
are obtained by condensation in a pure or in a concentrated form.
Though it is not always necessary that they should dissolve in
the fluid before volatilizing, yet the solution generally takes
place; and it contributes to the success of the operation in
cases where the essential oils form but a small part of the mate
rials from which they are manufactured.        In obtaining the fer
ment    oils, the leaves and other parts of plants capable of afford
ing them require to be steeped in water for some days; and
distillation is not performed until the odour of the fluid gives
indication that the oils have been generated.       The mode gene
rally adopted for obtaining these volatile principles from.vege
table matter depends on their slight solubility in water, and on
the manner in which they are affected by an increase of tempe
rature.
   From these results it is easy to trace the inevitable course of
similar operations transpiring in nature on a far more extensive
scale.   Of the rain which falls during warm seasons, a large
part comes into repeated contact with numerous vegetable forms
as it descends along the leaves and branches of trees or moves
through the flowers and herbage of verdant fields; so that on
reaching the valleys the water must be contaminated with the
essential oils of living plants, and with the ferment oils of their
decaying parts.      In this manner a marsh, an enclosed lake, or
a pond becomes the receptacle of a large portion of the volatile
organic matter generated within the basin from which         its
                                                             waters
are collected.   The volatile oils which, on  the occurrence   of
                                                                cool
and heavy rains, are thus concentrated from       a wide area into  a
marsh, change into vapour      as  the water becomes warm; and
they will  be  most readyto   contaminate the   airover such perma
ment abodes     of
                 moisture   during  the intense heat  ofsummer.

 nature and of art for concentrating into a limited space the
 diffusible oils of plants, does not require that the water of a
 marsh should be subjected to a boiling heat.   This will appear
 evident from well-known facts and principles respecting vapori
 zation; and without insisting on the rigorous accuracy of
 Dalton's law, we may use it to determine approximately the
amount of these volatile oils which at a certain temperature can
exist as vapour in a given volume of air, or rather in a given
space. This may be estimated theoretically from the boiling
point of the                   oil
                and from the density                                         its

has        contributed so much        the career of intermittent
                                                to check
fever in the New World.      It is partly in consequence of the
storms with which they are accompanied that excessive rains
arrest for a time the effects of malaria; but the mitigation of
the evil also depends on the excessive dilution of the volatile
oils with water, and their diminished liability to escape into
the air.
    In dry valleys, in marshes which have been drained, and in
lakes having an outlet, the excessive accumulation of the vapour
of malaria is in a great measure prevented; but the evils which
it is capable of inflicting are generally transferred to other places.
Though volatile oils oxidize and become inert in the air, they
are slow to change their characters in water; and, accordingly,
a river which drains lands teeming with verdure and bearing a
luxuriant vegetation must be impregnated with the volatile
organic matter which they supply, and which is ready to escape
into the air when favoured by the influence of heat and evapora
tion.    It is on this account that the rivers of Italy contribute
much to the insalubrity of the lands through which they pass;
and many marshes along their banks exhibit the effects of
malaria imported from distant localities, and surrendered to the
air by the water which is imprisoned and evaporated in stagnant
pools. Rivers also find the conditions for diffusing their volatile
organic matter when they pass through lakes, or when they
spread their waters over the deltas which are so generally formed
at their mouths in tideless seas.
   As volatile oils slowly escape from the water or change their
characters            by oxidation,        there must be a               limit to the distance
 to which their poisonous characters can be transmitted by rivers.
 An instance of the effects which these causes produce may be
 found in the case of the Nile, which in the latter part of                                              its
 course runs over       thousand miles without receiving

 of current as in experiment        3, and, in the same manner, the
 deviation in experiment 5 to the intensity of the current in
 exp. 4, we obtain respectively 33.38 and 1405.                Taking the
 means of these numbers and those        directly observed for the same
 intensities of the current, for tan 16° 55' the deviation 33.40 is
 obtained, and for tan 5° 53' the deviation 13-74.
    By calculating these observations in the manner above indi
 cated, we obtain, as mean value, &=3-1825, and,

    Several     months  after  the preceding experiments, and after
 other metallic combinations had been investigated, the iron
 copper combination was again put into the apparatus and sub
 mitted to fresh researches with the view of ascertaining, among
 other things, whether during that long time the apparatus had
 undergone any alteration.           The following results were - ob

    The passage of the positive current from the aluminium to the
 copper produced a cooling at the surface of union.
    Three values of a have been obtained for each of the above
 mentioned      combinations.        The concordance of these values
 within the limits of     possible   errors of observation proves that the
 formulae of calculation made use of answer their purpose.               An
 other series of observations on the iron-copper combination, for
        I
 which used two copper cylinders not silvered (and which is not
 inserted here, because it is not comparable with the others), fur
 nished five values of a, likewise agreeing with each other within
 the limits of errors of observation.          The same result was given
 by the experiments in which the observations took place at               in

   The calculation    of these three experiments gives 3=0 and
a=14.5. The circumstance that B is here =0, and conse
quently the deviations are proportional to the intensity of the
current, proceeds doubtless from the very slight elevation of the
temperature within the cylinders, this resulting from the mini
mum development of heat in the two wires, which are good con
ductors. The cooling of the cylinders becomes then proportional
to the excess of temperature of their sides, and this excess, in its
turn, proportional to the excess of temperature of the enclosed air.
   If we calculate the three experiments supposing the propor
tionality of the deviations to the intensity of the current, we ob
tain the following comparison between the observed and the
calculated numbers:–

   Another series of observations, made with the unsilvered cy
linders before mentioned, gave, for the copper-gold combination,
a = 12:56.    The series effected with the same cylinders upon
the iron-copper combination gave a = 11573. Both these values
are inferior to those before indicated, viz. 14.5 and 132-73.

duced a cooling at the point of contact.   Thus, from the last
two  experiments,  a, should be = 0.24 for the combination of
zinc and copper.

     I
    soldered these two metals together in the supposition that
the electromotive force between them would be less than that
between palladium and any one of the metals previously inves
tigated. As, however, the length of palladium wire at my dis
posal was only enough for one of the copper cylinders, put into             I
the other a platinum wire only.                     I
                                       considered that the incon
veniences  resulting from slight variations in the intensity of the
current could be more easily avoided if the current could traverse
the two cylinders in wires offering nearly the same resistance,
than if it only passed through one of the cylinders.    From what
precedes, it is evident that, when there only exists a point of
soldering in one of the cylinders, the deviation can only attain
to half what it is when in each cylinder there is a point of sol
dering, of which one becomes heated while the other is cooled.
The result must therefore be multiplied by 2 to make it compa
rable with the preceding ones.

   The theoretic proof of the signification of Peltier's phenomena
demonstrates the production of a cooling at the point of contact
when the current circulates in the same direction as the current
produced by the electromotive force of that point.       As the cool
ing takes place at the point of contact (between iron and copper,
for example) when the current passes from the copper to the iron,
this signifies that the electromotive force of the point tends to
produce a current from the copper to the iron.      In contact, then,
the iron becomes    electropositive, and the copper  electronegative.

Researches on the Calculus of Variations, principally on the Theory of
  Discontinuous Solutions ; an Essay to which the Adams Prize was
  awarded in the University of Cambridge in 1871.         By I. Tod
  HUNTER,   M.A.,   F.R.S.,   late Fellow and Principal Mathematical
  Lecturer of St. John's College, Cambridge. London and Cambridge:
  Macmillan and Co.            1871.     (Pp. 278.)
     terms in which the        subject of the essay was originally pre
THEscribed are these :—“A          determination of the circumstances
under which discontinuity of     any kind presents itself in the solution
of a problem of maximum or minimum in the calculus of variations,
and applications to particular instances.       It is expected that the
discussion of the instances should be exemplified as far as possible
geometrically, and that attention be especially directed to cases of
real or supposed failure of the calculus.”     As far as we can venture
to sum up the result of Mr. Todhunter's researches in a few words,
it is this:—that the discontinuity arises from conditions imposed,
either explicitly or implicitly, which limit the generality of the ques
tion. Thus, suppose it is required to determine the curve which,
taken between fixed limits          (A   and   B), shall give \{4)de         a   maxi
mum or minimum.       There is no difficulty in showing that the re
quired curve is a parabola, and for some forms of bit will be a maxi
mum, for others a minimum ; and there is no discontinuity.       But
now suppose that we introduce the condition that the curve shall
pass through a third point (D). If D is in the parabola already de
termined, there is again no discontinuity.    But if D is not in this
parabola, the required curve will consist of two parabolic arcs, one
passing from A to D and the other from D to B; or it may be one
passing from A to B, and the other from B to D. This is a case of
discontinuity introduced by a condition consciously imposed; it may,
of course, be introduced by a condition unconsciously imposed.
   The fundamental principle, which is extensively applied through
out the   essay, is    this;–“Let there        be an integral     Jºde which       is   re
quired to be a maximum or a minimum, where p is a known function
of y and    its
             differential coefficients with respect     Change

                  a
statements are universally admitted                    be

throughout the whole range of the integration 3y is essentially posi
tive, then it is no longer necessary that M should vanish.     If M is
positive through the whole range of the integration, we are sure of
a minimum; and if M is negative through the whole range of the
integration, we are sure of a maximum.        We assume, of course,
that we are able to satisfy the condition L=0, or to ensure
that L shall be positive in the former case and negative in the latter
Case.
   “Next suppose that by may have either sign through part of the
range of the integration, but that it is essentially positive during
the remainder of the range. Then, if M vanishes through the former
part and is positive through the latter part of the range, we are sure
of a minimum; and if M vanishes through the former part and is
negative through the latter part of the range, we are sure of a maxi
muin.”—P.      13.                 -
     After exemplifying     the discontinuity       arising from conditions
in several  simple   cases,  Mr. Todhunter       goes  on to discuss—mainly
by the aid of the above principle—various          cases of the questions of
chief historical importance on the subject, viz. minimum surface of
revolution, maximum solid of revolution, brachistochrone under the
action of gravity, problem of least action, solid of minimum resist
ance, area between a curve and its evolute.           To each of these ques
tions a   chapter  is devoted. The       way   in which they are discussed
may be judged of from the contents of a single chapter, viz. that on
the brachistochrone (c. 7). The well-known general solution is first
mentioned, viz. that, when the body falls from a fixed point (A) to
another fixed point (B), the curve is a cycloid with a cusp at A and
a horizontal base.      The following particular cases are then consi
dered in order:—(a) when the path must pass through a third point
 C either fixed or on a given curve; (b) when an obstacle with an
aperture of given size is interposed between A and B; (c) when C
is on a given surface; (d) when the condition is that the moving
point must not descend below a horizontal line through B ; (e) when
it must not pass outside a circular arc of which B is the lowest
point, and A B does not exceed a quadrant;                  (f)
                                                             when it must not
pass inside the circular arc ; (g) when the condition is that the radius
of curvature shall never be less than a given constant, and that there
is no abrupt change of direction.         With regard to the discussion of
the cases which we have marked          (d),  (e), (f), (g), Mr. Todhunter
says   (p. 146) that they completely illustrate the general principles
laid down.      In each case the discontinuity arises from a condition
or conditions imposed. This            is,   fact, the theme which
                                             in                             he

Technical Arithmetic      and Mensuration.  By C. W. MERRIfield,
       F.R.S.     London:  Longmans and Co.   1872. (Pp. 308.)
    This book is intended for the use of persons who have already
learned arithmetic, but who wish to renew and extend their
acquaintance with the subject.       It consists of a treatise on Arith
metic of 183 pages, a treatise on Mensuration of 64 pages, and an
Appendix of 60 pages, comprising Examination Papers, somewhat
elaborate Tables of Money, Lengths, Areas, &c., and Answers to
Questions.     The treatise on Arithmetic gives clearly and concisely
an account of the fundamental operations of Arithmetic; it notices
with sufficient, but not more than sufficient, fulness the points
which have to be dwelt on in oral instruction; and it illustrates
the rules by a very considerable number of examples, most of which
Mr. Merrifield says he has himself made. Very many of these ex
amples are mere illustrations of rules, such as must of necessity
occur in every book of Arithmetic; e.g.,             “If
                                                  3% of a share cost £5,
what will   5;  cost ”    Many,   however, occur here and there which
illustrate elementary scientific principles; e.g., “Express miles per
hour in metres per second, having given a metre =39-37 inches.”
The chief novelty, however, is the last chapter, which treats of “the
applications of Arithmetic to Machines, Work, and Motion.” This
is a very useful chapter; it contains sufficient explanations to render
intelligible the examples with which it concludes. The number of
these examples might easily have been increased with great advan
tage. The objection to introducing, except with very great judg
ment, examples on points of science into a book of Arithmetic, is
that they presuppose knowledge which the student probably does
not possess.     This objection does not, of course, apply in the above
case; we are inclined to think it does apply to such examples as
(19), p. 53; (16), (17), (25), (26), p. 76—not to say that (25) is
inexactly stated, and (26) clearly in the wrong place.
    On pp. 66, 67 there is a statement with regard to proportion
which is worth notice.      In the text occur these words:—“Propor
tion may include the comparison of ratios which are not definite, and
which are incapable of being expressed as fractions.”        And to this
statement the following note is added:—“I do not think it neces
sary to restrict the idea of proportion to numerical ratio.      In fact,
it appears to me to be a consequence of
                3 shillings: 5 shillings    ::   6 yards : 10 yards,

   * Phil. Mag. June 1866, vol. xxxi. p. 425. The question to which Mr.
Todhunter applied the principle was this:—To determine a solid of revolu
tion of given surface so that it may cut the axis of revolution at given
points and have a maximum volume.     A chapter of the essay is devoted to
examining this question and some cases arising out         of   it.

and that while             I   do not know what exactly is the meaning of the
ratio
                                          3 shillings : 6 yards,
I am  enabled to assert that there is a connexion between 5 shillings
and 6 yards in the nature of a ratio, and subject to the rules of pro
portion, which is the same as the connexion between 5 shillings and
10 yards, whatever that may be. To deny this appears to me to
imply an objection to concrete arithmetic generally.     I do not assert
that the ratio is definite.”     It is much to be regretted that Mr.
Merrifield did not omit this altogether, or else that he did not ex
plain his views more fully.      Had he taken the latter course, we are
sure that his  explanation  would have been clear of objection.     But
as the note  stands, it is very liable to mislead. We need hardly say
that such a proportion as
              3 shillings: 6 yards :: 5 shillings : 10 yards
is commonly     held to be merely an improper mode of stating that the
ratio of 3  shillings  to 5 shillings is equal to the ratio of 6 yards to
10  yards;  and it is by no means obvious that the common view does
not  go to the bottom of the matter.           At     events, Mr. Merri        all
field could  hardly   complain      from his premises
                                                if    we were    draw the                               to

But what meaning can                      this proportion, beyond
                                          be                            rela

also find that the change either                      is perfectly reversible, we
speak of the one state as being an ordinary gaseous, and the other
as being an ordinary liquid state of the same matter; and the ordi

terms boiling or condensing, or occasionally by other terms nearly
equivalent, such as evaporation, gasification, liquefaction from the
gaseous state, &c.          Cases of gasification from liquids or of con

the abrupt change of density, are not among the subjects proposed

    Now it will be my chief object in the present paper to state and
 support a view which has occurred to me, according to which it ap
pears probable that, although there be a practical breach of continuity
in crossing the line of boiling-points from liquid to gas or from gas
to liquid, there may exist, in the nature of things, a theoretical con
tinuity across this breach having some real and true significance.
This theoretical continuity, from the ordinary liquid state to the
ordinary gaseous state, must be supposed to be such as to have                                                       its

at about the commencement of the rapid ascent from the liquid
state is to be ascribed to a trace of air unavoidably present in the
carbonic acid—and that if the carbonic acid had been absolutely pure,
the ascent from the liquid to the gaseous state would doubtless have
been quite abrupt, and would have shown itself in his diagram by a
vertical straight line, when we regard the coordinate axes for pres
sures and volumes as being horizontal and vertical respectively.
Now in the diagram here submitted the continuous curves (that is to
say, those which are not dotted) are obtained from Dr. Andrews's

diagram, with the slight alteration of substituting, in accordance
with the explanations just given, an abrupt meeting instead of the
curved transition between the curve for the liquid state and the
upright line which shows the boiling stage.     Looking to either of
the given curves which pass through boiling, and, for instance,
selecting the curve for 13°1, we perceive, from what has been said
as to the conditions to which boiling by bumping is due, that for
the temperature pertaining to this curve the liquid state does not
necessarily end at the boiling pressure for this temperature, and
that thus in the diagram the curve showing volumes for the liquid
state must not cease at the foot of the upright line which marks
the boiling stage of pressure, but must extend continuously, for

some distance     at least, into lower pressures in some such way as is
shown by the dotted continuation from a to b.               But now the ques
tion arises, Does this curve necessarily end at any particular
 point b! We know that the extent of this curve in the direction
from a towards or past b, along which the liquid volume will con
tinue to be represented before the explosive or bumping change to
gas occurs, is very variable under different circumstances, being much
affected by the presence of other fluids, even in small quantities, as
impurities in the fluid experimented on, and by the nature of the
surface of the containing vessel, &c.
   The consideration of the subject may be facilitated, and aid towards
the attainment of clear views of the mutual relations of temperature,
pressure, and volume in a given mass of a fluid may be gained, by
actually making, or by conceiving to be made, for carbonic acid,
from the data supplied in Dr. Andrews's experimental results, a solid
model consisting of a curved surface referred to three axes of rect
angular coordinates, and formed so that the three coordinates of
each point in the curved surface shall represent, for any given mass
of carbonic acid, a temperature, a pressure, and a volume which can
coexist in that mass.        It is to be noticed here that in his diagram of
curves the results for each of the several temperatures experimented
on are combined in the form of a plane curved line referred to two
axes of rectangular coordinates—one of each pair of ordinates repre
senting a pressure, and the other representing the volume corre
sponding to that pressure at the temperature to which the curve
belongs.     Now to form a model such as I am here recommending,
and have myself made, Dr. Andrews's curved lines are to be placed
with their planes parallel to one another, and separated by intervals
proportional to the differences of the temperatures to which the curves
severally belong, and with the origins of coordinates of the curves
situated in a straight line perpendicular to their planes, and with
the axes of coordinates of                     all
                                       them parallel      pairs    one another,in              to

not only have fragments of similar iron been met with in the basalt,
but the basalt itself, upon being examined, is found to contain
minute particles of metallic iron, identical in chemical composition
with that of the large masses themselves, whilst some of the masses
of native iron are observed to enclose fragments of the basalt.
    As the chemical composition and mineralogical character of these
masses of native iron are quite different from those of any iron of
terrestrial origin, and altogether identical with those of undoubted
meteoric iron, Professor Nordenskjöld        regards them as aérolites,
and accounts for their occurrence in the basalt by supposing that
they proceeded from a shower of meteorites which had fallen down
and buried themselves in the molten basalt during an eruption in
the Miocene period.
    Notwithstanding that these masses of metallic iron were found
lying on the shore between the ebb and flow of tide, it has been
found, upon their removal to Stockholm, that they perish with ex
traordinary rapidity, breaking up rapidly and falling to a fine powder.
Attempts to preserve them by covering them with a coating of
varnish have as yet proved unsuccessful; and it is actually proposed to
preserve them from destruction by keeping them in a tank of alcohol.
    2. “On the Geology of the Diamond-fields of South Africa.” By Dr.
John Shaw, of Colesberg. Communicated by Dr. Hooker, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author described the general structure of the region in which
diamonds have been found.        He considered that the diamonds origi
nally belonged to some metamorphic rock, probably a talcose slate,
 which occupied the heights during a late period of the “trappean
upheaval” to which he ascribed the origin of the chief physical
features of the country.      This upheaval was followed by a period of
lakes, the traces of which still exist in the so-called “pans” of the
 region; the Waal river probably connected a chain of these lakes;
 and it is in the valley of the Waal and the soil of the dried-up “pans”
 that the diamonds are found. The author referred also to the
 frequent disturbance and removal of the diamantiferous gravels by
 the floods which prevail in these districts after thunder-storms.
    3. “On the Diamond-gravels of the Waal River,           South Africa.”
 By G. W. Stow, Esq., of Queenstown, Cape Colony.           Communicated
 by Prof. T. Rupert Jones, F.G.S.
    The author described the general geographical          features of the
 country in which diamonds have been found, from           Mamusa on the
 south-west to the headwaters of the Waal and Orange Rivers.            He
 then indicated the mode of occurrence of the diamonds in the gravels,
 gravelly clays, and boulder-drifts of the Waal valley, near Pniel,
 including Hebron, Diamondia, Cawood's Hope, Gong Gong, Klip
 Drift, DuToit's Pan, and other diggings. By means of sections, he
 showed the successive deepenings of the Waal valley and the gradual
  accumulation of gravel-banks and terraces, and illustrated the enor
 mous catchment area of the river-system, with indications of the
  geological structure of the mountains at the headwaters. The spe
  cimens sent by Mr. Stow, as interpreted by Prof. T. R. Jones, showed
 that both igneous and metamorphic rocks had supplied the material

of   these   gravels.       The author concluded that                   a large proportion               of
these materials have travelled long distances, probably from the
Draakensberg range; but, whether the original matrix of the dia
monds is to be found in the distant mountains or at intermediate
spots in the valleys, the worn and crushed condition of some of the
diamonds indicates long travel, probably with ice-action.  Polished
rock-surfaces and striated boulders, seen by Mr. Gilfillan, were
quoted in corroboration of this view.

   1. “Notes on some Fossils from the Devonian rocks of the
Witzenberg Flats, Cape Colony.”      By Prof. T. Rupert Jones, F.G.S.
   In this paper the author noticed some Devonian fossils like those
of the Bokkeveld, found on Mr. Louw's farm on the Witzenberg
Flats, Tulbagh.    Orthoceras vittatum, Sandberger, was added to the
South-African list of fossils. The fossils under notice were stated
by the author to help to substantiate the late Dr. Rubidge's view,
that the old schists termed “Silurian" by Bain are of Devonian
age, and continuous across the Colony.   Their presence in the
Witzenberg Flats was also shown to be conclusive against the idea
of Coal-measures being found there.                                                                  -

 ON SIGNALS        OBSERVED IN A WIRE JOINING THE EARTH-PLATES
     IN THE NEIGH BOURHOOD OF A THIRD EARTH-PLATE USED FOR
     A TELEGRAPHIC cIRCUIT.                BY  G.  K. WINTER,    TELEGRAPH
     ENGINEER, MADRAs RAILWAY.
        the course of some       experiments on earth-currents an effect was
 IN observed       which has     led to the discovery of a fact which may be
 of some    practical     value,  besides throwing additional light upon the
 part played by the earth in telegraphic circuits.
     Although several telegraph-wires pass through Arconum, only
 two are terminal at that station,-one connecting it with Cuddapah,
 a town lying 120 miles to the north-west; and the other, which is
 very little used, connects it with Conjeveram.
   Two earth-plates were imbedded in the ground in a line running east
 and west and nearly radial to the office earth-plate; they were about
 a quarter of a mile apart, and the nearest was about the same distance
from the office plate.        A wire was erected on separate poles, connect
 ing the two experimental earth-plates. When a reflecting galvano
 meter, similar to those used for cable signalling, was inserted in this
 circuit, there was a pretty strong deflection; but riding on this de
flection, as it were, were distinct signals, which were ultimately, on
 comparison, found to agree perfectly with the signals passing in the
 Cuddapah wire.
    The experiments were made in a building at least 150 yards from
the telegraph office; and the poles carrying the experimental wire
were at least that distance from those carrying the Cuddapah wire.
It is utterly impossible, therefore, that any accidental leakage could
account for the signals.           On other wires running in other directions
and    varying   from one to two miles in length, the same effects were
observed; so that the currents going to earth at the office earth
plate must radiate from it through the earth, and the signals in the
experimental wires must have been derived from these radiations.
    The signals I have now made perfectly legible by using a thick
wire reflecting galvanometer, filling the mirror-chamber with water
to steady the needle and mirror.
    I have, in conclusion, to express my thanks to Mr. Lundy, of the Bri
tish Indian Extension Telegraph Company, for having kindly lent me

On A REMARKABLE              FAULT  IN THE NEW RED SANDSTONE OF
     whiston, cHESHIRE.           BY PROFEssoR EDw ARD HULL, F.R.S.,
     DIRECTOR     OF  THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF IRELAND.
     The position of this fault is marked on the Geological Survey maps
of Lancashire (1-inch map 80 N.W.) as forming the boundary be
tween the little isolated tract of coal-measure one mile west of
Rainhill station and the New Red Sandstone.             The fault ranges in
a nearly meridional direction; and on the west the upper coal-mea
sures with Spirorbis limestone, first discovered by Mr. Binney, F.R.S.,
are brought to the surface, and on the east the upper mottled sand
stone of the Bunter division of the Trias.
     The Corporation of St. Helens, in order to increase the water
supply of the borough, commenced sinking a well, on Mr. Hull's re
commendation, at a distance of 200 yards from the fault in the New
Red Sandstone, close to Cumber Lane bridge *; this well was carried
down 75 yards, and from the bottom a bore-hole, 18 inches diame
ter, was driven 35 yards further; but at 104 yards from the surface
it passed through the fault and entered hard micaceous sandstone of
a purple colour belonging to the upper coal-measures.
     As the horizontal distance from the outcrop of the fault where it
 crosses the railway is 200 yards, and the depth 104 yards, it appears
 that the slope of the fault is about 2 horizontal to 1 vertical, or 28°
 from the horizontal.
     The usual slope of the fault in South Lancashire being 2 vertical
 to 1 horizontal, such a result was unexpected ; and as the thickness
 of New Red Sandstone was thus reduced below the calculated
 amount, the quantity of water obtained (about 400,000 gallons per
 day) was consequently much less than that required and anticipated.
 Other means have been adopted for increasing the supply.—Commu

 Society of Ireland, February 14, 1872.
      DISPLACE MENT OF THE SPECTRAL LINES BY THE ACTION OF
         THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PRISM. B.Y. M. BLASERNA.
      I have still a fact to communicate which is not unimportant for
  spectroscopy.      On looking at the sun's spectrum through a bisul
 phide-of-carbon prism, I observed that the Fraunhofer's lines were
 considerably displaced. This fact is not new in reference to liquids.
  It was observed in Verdet's laboratory. As regards the refractive
  index, it has long been known that it changes with the temperature.
      But it has been universally assumed in reference to solids that
  these changes are unimportant.        I had therefore the idea of working
  with the substances most important for spectroscopy, and used a
  flint-glass prism by Duboscq.        The displacements of the lines are
  here far feebler, yet distinctly visible. This is easily manifested
  if the prism be heated in sunshine, then rapidly inserted in a spec
  troscope in the shade and adjusted to any line.         As the prism cools,
  the line is displaced, and in such a manner, in the case of glass, that
  the deflection increases as the temperature sinks; the reverse being
  the case with bisulphide. If the temperature of the prism is not
  uniform, the Fraunhofer lines become confused and but barely visible.
      * This site was selected, notas being the best for water-supply, but the
  best available.

XXX.   On     Relations between the Atomic Hypothesis and the
            the
  Condensed Symbolic  Expressions of Chemical Facts and Changes
  known as Dissected (Structural) Formulae.       By C. R. A.
  WRight, D.Sc., Lecturer on Chemistry in St. Mary's Hospital
  Medical School*.
         comparing the published views and statements of different
ON       chemists on the subject of the Atomic Hypothesis, it is
evident that in some instances the same meanings are not always
given to the words employed in stating the fundamental posi
tions of the various lines of argument, and that the meaning
and scope of the phrase “Atomic Hypothesis” are very differ
ently understood by different thinkers. Thus highly contra
dictory statements are to be met with—one chemist considering
that the “law of multiple proportions has no existence apart
from the atomic theory,” and that the atomic theory is “the
very life of chemistry,” while others deny in toto the truth of
the first proposition, and say that “the science of chemistry does
not require or prove the atomic theory.”
    The object aimed at in the following pages is to show:—first,
that the main salient facts and generalizations on which chemical
philosophy is founded are capable of expression in words, and
 of representation by the symbols in ordinary use, without in any
 way involving the ideas bound up in the hypothesis of the ex
 istence of material atoms as devised by Dalton (in              its
                                                           chemical
relations) and subsequently extended; and secondly, that this
hypothesis, though affording       clear raison d’étre for many
                                     a                                      of
 these  facts,
            is  yet incapable   accounting readily for

                                                              them,    of

242       Dr. C. R. A. Wright on the Relations    between the
—in    other words, that the conceptions involved in this hypo
thesis are both unnecessary and insufficient.
    In pursuance of this object it is clearly necessary, first, to
enumerate the fundamental facts in language that clearly ex
presses them without at the same time involving any theoretical
views whatever, and then to enunciate the theory and show how
far it accounts for these facts.     In most writings on the subject
it unfortunately happens that terms such as atom, molecule,
structure, &c. are employed in stating fundamental data, these
terms necessarily involving the ideas and notions of the very
hypothesis under consideration; to avoid the petitio principii
thus rendered imminent, it is desirable to eliminate such terms
altogether from the language employed in stating the funda
mental facts, and the way in which they are expressed and alluded
to by the ordinary symbols.
    1. The volume occupied by 1 gramme of hydrogen             under
given circumstances as to temperature and pressure in any expe
riment is termed a “Relative Vapour-volume Unit, or more
briefly, a “Volume.”
    2. The specific gravities of vapours (vapour-densities) with
respect to hydrogen mean the numbers of grammes that a volume
of the gases or rapours weighs, the pressure and temperature being
respectively    such that the compounds in question are aériform.
    Thus the volume occupied by 1 gramme of hydrogen at 0° and
760 millims. is 11.2 litres; 11.2 litres of oxygen at this pres
sure and temperature weigh 16 grammes; hence 16 is the spe
cific gravity of oxygen.
    The volume occupied by     1 gramme  of hydrogen attemperature
                     p millims. is 11.2                         760,
tº and     pressure                      × (1 +0.00365 x t)   ×
This volume of water (the pressure and temperature being such
that the water is aériform) weighs 9 grammes; hence the vapour
density of water is 9.
    3.  A  homogeneous body, when submitted to analytical pro
 cesses,  is either capable of furnishing simultaneously more, or
 not   more,   than one substance dissimilar in properties to the
 original body.     In the first case the body is said to be a com
pound, to be composed of the several substances which it can thus
 furnish on analysis; in the latter case it is called an element;
 and if it furnish one substance dissimilar to the original body,
the original substance is said to be an allotropic modification of
this element.
    Thus ozone analyzed by heat or by induction-sparks yields
 but one body dissimilar from ozone; this new product is termed
oxygen, and ozone is said to be an allotropic modification of the
element oxygen : oxygen itself, never having been analyzed into
any two substances, is therefore termed an element.

   Atomic Hypothesis and Dissected (Structural) Formulae.                       243
   Mercuric oxide when heated, however, yields not only oxygen
identical with that from ozone, but also metallic mercury;
hence mercuric oxide is said to be a compound of mercury and
oxygen.
   The questions as to whether oxygen and mercury are present
as such in mercuric oxide, whether both are essentially altered
in the combined state, whether bodies generally are simply force
determined in some or other different ways, &c., are speculations
with which the chemist who wishes to deal solely with facts has
nothing to do.     Mercuric oxide is a name given to a body which,
on  heating, furnishes the two bodies termed oxygen and mercury
respectively; and this fact is referred to when it is said that mer
curic oxide is a compound of mercury and oxygen; this, and the
converse proposition that mercury and oxygen can under certain
conditions reproduce the original mercuric oxide, are referred to
when it is said that mercury and oxygen unite together to form
mercuric oxide, or that mercury and oxygen are components of
mercuric oxide.
   4. Bodies that are not decomposed by a rise in temperature
are either acriform at common temperatures, gasefiable at higher
temperatures, or non-volatile at measurable temperatures.     Many
elements which are themselves non-volatile   yield gasefiable  com
pounds with elements belonging to the other two classes; the
composition by weight of these compounds is known by analysis
or synthesis.    From this composition and the vapour-densities
of the  compounds   the volumetric ratio between the compounds
and the gasefiable components is known.        In many instances
this ratio admits of being also directly determined by experi
menting with the components in the gaseous state.
   Thus water is found to consist of 88-89 per cent. oxygen and
                                             º
11:11 per cent. of hydrogen: the vapour-densities        of steam,
oxygen, and hydrogen are respectively 9, 16, and 1.           Hence

and phosphorus,which contain only multiples of , volume of phos
phorus or arsenic vapour in 2 volumes of compound vapour, and
not multiples of 1 volume; also compounds that dissociate. The
former compounds are excluded from consideration on the as
sumption that the bodies examined in the vaporous condition
under the names of phosphorus and arsenic are not the true ele

an analogy similar to that of ozone to oxygen, a view corrobo

platinum the combining numbers of these elements are respect
ively fixed as 23, 24, 56, and 198.       The composition of some
of the compounds of these elements with chlorine are then ex

PtCl", in which instances the law of multiple proportions is
 noticeable as holding.   It is manifest that any of the formulae

 Mgº C1, Feº Cl", Ptº C1, Fe3C19, Piº Cliº, &c. would equally well
 express the composition by weight of these compounds.     Vapour
 density being the sole means of deciding on the formula of a
 body (apart from reasons based on analogy), and being inappli
 cable in such cases, the simplest integral formula is chosen, not
 because there is any evidence in                              its
                                         favour, but solely for the
 sake     simplicity.

 position that tuo volumes       vapour         of

would contain weights                    of   the constituents indicated                    by   the simplest
integral formula.
      In
       some cases, however, the progress      discovery has shown            of
that the formula deduced from this  supposition      lower than the                    is
correct one: thus the composition        ferric chloride     expres of                            is
sible      by
          the simplest integral formula FeCl”, which was accord
ingly attributed       until the vapour-density

   Similarly, arguments from analogy and other considerations
sometimes lead      the adoption
                              to     formula higher than that de

duced from the above convention.      Thus two carbon chlorides
 whose simplest integral formulae are CCI* and CCI* exist; vapour
 density shows that the true formulae are C*Cl" and C*C1"; hence
 it   inferred that,
      is                            as
                       ferric chloride has the formula     Cl", fer                               Fº

 is  C18H31NO3; but the first product obtainable from this sub

 hence      it inferred that the true formula for codeine      double                               is

                             bodies are thus fixed from consideration
  of the following points:—Quantitative volumetric composition                                                  in

volatile elements; and generalizations, analogies, and conventions
of various kinds, occasionally leading to higher formulae than
those deduced from the convention as to the simplest integral
formula.
   When fixed in these ways, several remarkable relations be
tween the formulae of bodies and their physical and other pro
perties are found to exist.    Thus a number of crystalline bodies
of analogous  and similar formulae are found to crystallize in forms
of the same   geometrical  structure, and are frequently capable of
forming different portions of the same regular geometric crystal.
Such bodies are said to be isomorphous; and the law of isomor
phism (Mitscherlich’s law) may be simply expressed                                        thus
similar formula, similar crystal.  Thus potassium nitrate and cal
cium carbonate, whose formulae are analogous, viz. KNO”, CaCO",
are not merely isomorphous, but also isodimorphous.         The alums,
the  magnesium-     and  copper-sulphate   families,  and many   others
might also be cited.
   13. The following connexion is found to exist between the
specific gravities of solid and liquid substances and the formulae
attributed to them.*: if certain numbers be assigned to each ele
mentary symbol in a formula, these numbers sometimes varying
                                                                                                of all
in different classes of compounds, but being constant for
members        the same class, the sum got

    analogous, but differ in the value of the suffixes, it is noticed that
    a difference in the boiling-point occurs precisely proportionate to

    connexions do not appear to be so distinctly marked.
       The specific heats of solid substances of analogous formulae
    are also frequently found to be inversely proportionate to the
    sum of the product obtained by multiplyiug the combining num
    bers of each symbol in the formula by           suffix and adding                        its

   Hence the formula of a compound expresses the nature and
number of the constituent atoms present in a molecule of the
substance.
   27. This hypothesis does not explain why a molecule of free
mercury should consist of but 1 atom, while the molecule of
oxygen (which is also a bivalent element) contains 2 atoms;
nor why a molecule of phosphorus should contain 4, and one of
sulphur at low temperatures 6; but it enables us to explain the
allotropy of the elements by the assumption that the molecules
of the different modifications are made up of different numbers
of constituent atoms (thus the molecule of gaseous oxygen con
tains 2 atoms, of ozone 3, of sulphur at low temperatures 6
atoms, at higher temperatures 2 atoms), and therefore allows of
the inference being drawn that under different conditions of
pressure and temperature phosphorus vapour might contain
only 2 atoms, or even l atom in the molecule, or mercury vapour
2 or 4 atoms to the molecule.
   28. The phenomena of dissociation are to some extent ac
counted for by the atomic hypothesis; the atoms in a molecule
are held together by certain forces, which are altered in character
by variation of temperature; at some given temperature the
molecule is in a state of unstable equilibrium; and at a higher
temperature    the component atoms alter their mutual relations,
taking up more stable positions.      The observed facts that dis
sociation always causes a molecule to form less complex mole
cules, that atomic weight and specific heat of elements are      in
versely proportional, that compounds are more stable according
as more heat is evolved in their production, and that the boil
ing-points and melting-points are usually higher the more com
plex the formula, indicate the existence of some general law con
necting together the mutual relations of atoms in a molecule and
the effects of the force termed heat upon      them,-a conclusion
strengthened by the analogous connexions         between electricity
and equivalents, specific refractive energy and formulae, specific
gravity and formulae, crystalline shape and formulae, which ap

their being expressed in concise phraseology: thus the law of

will give rise to the same crystalline form. In order to eaylain
the facts, assumptions other than the primary one as to the

actions;   but whenever he is led by any of these considerations
to a formula which contains a fraction of any atomic weight, he
takes a multiple of the formula sufficiently high to be entirely
free from such fractions.     In no case does he reason on a basis
independent of the atomic theory.”
   From the exposition given above, and employing the term
atom in the sense ascribed to it by Dalton, it is evident that the law
of multiple proportion is simply the statement of a generaliza
tion first made gravimetrically by Dalton, and subsequently ex
tended volumetrically by Laurent and Gerhardt, viz. that, if cer
tain numbers be attributed to each element respectively, the
quantitative compositions of compounds are expressible by taking
simple multiples of these numbers and comparing the products
thus obtained: these numbers being in the ratios of simple mul
tiples or submultiples of the vapour-densities of the elements;
the volumetric composition of compound vapours must necessa
rily be expressed by simple integral numbers—i.e. 1 volume of
one constituent to 1 of another, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, &c. This ge
neralization is not identical with the hypothesis of the existence
of material atoms, advanced to account for the facts summed
up in the generalization; and to say that the law has no exist
ence apart from the atomic hypothesis is to give a meaning to
the term atom different from that attributed to it by Dalton *.
    Similarly the method of finding the formula of a body from
 its percentage composition         simple deduction from Dalton's
                                                         is   a
generalization, but has        necessary connexion with his hypo

The metals, therefore, keep the same order in the electromotive
as in the thermoelectric                      series.
                                                        § 6.
     If
     we compare the electromotive series, as determined in the
preceding pages, with the electric-tension      series, as given by
Volta, Pfaff, Péclet, and others, it is impossible to find the least
concordance between them.         Thus, for example, according to
Volta's  series, zinc is positive  to iron, while it is the opposite
according to the series above given; according to the tension
series, bismuth is positive to platinum, while in the above series
bismuth is found far below platinum in the negative direction;
according to the tension-series, lead is much more positive than
copper, while it is the contrary in the series determined by me,
&c. Yet the cause of this want of concordance is now not diffi
cult to discover.    Grove’s gas pile and galvanic polarization are
proofs that gases are electromotive in contact with solid bodies.
I  have, I think, demonstrated in a former paper* that galvanic
polarization produces a veritable electromotive force by the con
tact of the gases precipitated on the polar surfaces.    The polari
zation-current produced cannot be regarded as proceeding from
chemical activity in the polarization-vessel, but has     true cause                     its
in  the polar plates being  covered     the precipitated gases.by
                                                                The
difference, therefore, between the two series results from the fact
that gases are electromotive      contact with solid bodies.
                                                       in          The

scope is a measure of the resultant of these three forces; it is
therefore not a result of the metallic contact exclusively, but of
all three combined; and we ought not                surprised that the               be

      Inthe experiments related above    was shown that,      the       it                                            at

                          Force in      the Contact      of Metals.                             275
warmer point of contact, the thermoelectric current always fol
lowed the same direction as the current produced by the electro
motive force of the point of contact.    This force was conse
quently more intense at the warmer than at the cooler point of
contact; or, in other terms, the electromotive force of contact
increased with the temperature.   These experiments took place
between limits of temperature of about + 10 and +20 degrees.
In the experiments executed for the purpose of ascertaining the
change of temperature at the point of contact on the passage of
a current, the temperature of the wires did not exceed +30
degrees, and in most cases was much lower.     We are therefore
authorized to formulate the following proposition:—
  3. The electromotive force of contact, for the eleven metallic
combinations investigated, increased with the temperature when the
experiments took place at a temperature not exceeding +30 degrees.
   That this proposition cannot be applied to            temperatures    all
results from the researches,              on
                                   thermoelectric phenomena, which
several men         of
                   science have executed        higher temperatures.

From these      it  known that the thermoelectric current may
                     is                                                                         di

contact.    From the numbers given for the two series,         follows              it
that the thermoelectric current        greater for the metallic com
                                               is

sessing   an inferior electromotive force.    The exact ratio between
the electromotive forces and the corresponding thermoelectric

mination of the electromotive forces, may be pretty large;
nor is this very astonishing, the differences of temperature to
be measured being so very small.       In the case of the zinc-copper
combination, for example, the difference does not amount to one
thousandth of a degree; in that of the cadmium-copper, hardly
to one and a half hundredth; and for copper-bismuth (which,
of      all
        the combinations,     possesses the greatest electromotive
force),          degree.                       observation are, after

not much differ from that between the two latter.                  the                                      It   is
same with most                 of
                    the other combinations.     The   only ones which
can betray     greater uncertainty are the zinc-copper and copper

proposition              :-                                                                                     of

beats; or they may constrain each other into a common forced
oscillation; and thus both will give the same number of vibrations,
yet may be removed from equality when separately sounded.
The process I have adopted is as follows:–Three forks are taken
that are supposed to make the same number of vibrations in a
given time. They are supported on india-rubber tubing and
are thus insulated.        One of the forks is now loaded, so that it
gives two or three beats in a second with one of the other two
that are to be brought into exact unison. The interval of time
occupied by twenty or thirty of these beats is accurately mea
sured by means of a chronograph (one of Casella’s registering
stop-watches does well).          The interval occupied by the same
number of beats       given  by   the second fork is now ascertained;
and if it differs from that given by the first, the quicker vibrating
fork is made to give the same number of beats as the slower by
loading it with wax.        When the forks have thus been carefully
adjusted, I have had no difficulty in projecting the ball in exp. 1
at a distance of 60 feet; and I believe that it could have been
accomplished at a distance of 100 feet.
   The ball of cork should be spherical, so that it will always just
touch the fork, no matter how it may rotate around                suspend               or its

H   N     these investigations, which I carried out in Geh. Rath
        Helmholtz's laboratory at Heidelberg, I endeavoured to
analyze by means of a prism as large a cone of light as possible.
For this purpose the following arrangement was hit upon.
    Solar rays, reflected from the mirror of a heliostat, were col
lected by means of a lens of 3 inches aperture and 25 inches
focal distance.      Into the focus of the lens a slit was brought,
the   length   of which was exactly equal to the diameter of the
sun's image. The issuing luminous pencil was analyzed by a
flint-glass prism of 2 inches aperture and a refracting angle of
60°. The separated rays were collected by an achromatic lens.
This lens was placed at twice                           its
                                          focal distance both from the
slit and from the linear thermo-apparatus.           The latter consisted
       a 12
of       pairs     bismuth-antimony elements, and was connected
                      of
with      thermo-multiplier after Magnus. With this arrangement
the luminous rays covered the entire face             the prism; and     of
the investigation         the ultra-red rays the prism was placed
                            of                                                                         at in
the minimum of deflection for the red.
    Hence resulted         very pure spectrum, the investigation

      On the Heat-Spectrum                     of   the    Sun and the Lime-Light.                        283

mention that these apparatus were of the same dimensions as
the above-mentioned glass ones, were of perfectly transparent
Stassfurth salt, and excellently made by W. Steeg, optician, of
Homburg; and I fresh-polished them before each experiment.
My experiments have reference to the forenoons in the summer
and autumn of the past and the present year, and were only
made with a cloudless sky, as the slightest cloud occasioned a
 marked difference in the deflections.
  In     all
           such experiments,     our observations, commencing
                                                if                                                         at

not proportionately, stronger, until they attain certain maxi                  a

therefore see here     discontinuous distribution of heat

   This want    continuity was proved     Sir John Herschel          by                                    in
the following manner (Phil. Trans. 1840).   By means     flint                                 of  a

distinctly separate spots.       Herschel's chief concern, however,
was merely          to
                ascertain the conditions under which these four
spots made their appearance.        He observed that        the spectrum        in

    first is much more sharply separated from the second than the
    second from the third.    It may easily happen, if the movement
    of the thermo-apparatus be not sufficiently delicate, that the
    second and third appear as one common broad break.
        Nevertheless we can only obtain a correct notion of the nature
    of these bands from experiments with rock-salt apparatus, be
    cause the ultra-red rays are strongly absorbed by glass.    At the
    end of August and in September last, when we here had very
    fine, hot, sunny days, I made many experiments on this point.
    At that time I could examine the heat-spectrum of the sun be
    tween 7A.M. and 1 P.M.; and I took care to make two parallel
    experiments in one forenoon—one in the morning, and the other
    about noon.       In each such experiment                             I
                                                         traced the thermal
    effects from the line D to the ultra-red end, to where the heat
    effect entirely ceased or had become very feeble.
       These parallel experiments showed that the breaks become
    somewhat narrower with increasing altitude of the sun.               They
    were rather   deeper    on the days  when the relative moisture of the
    air was greater.      But the observations cited are at         events not                all

bringing to a conclusion the investigations, thus commenced, on
the limit of refrangibility; so that I am not yet in a position to
allege direct proofs in favour of the above-mentioned conjecture.
    As regards the position of the maximum of thermal effect
in the flint-glass spectrum, it also is found outside the red.

statements                the various investigators  the subject have beenon
so different.
   When     the solar spectrum we trace the heat-effect from the
                 in
line   into the luminous portion, the deflections decrease gra
       D

obscure heat was ascertained     means                  by

 II.   Distribution           of       the   Heat     in      the   Spectrum         of   the   Lime-Light.
   These experiments were carried out                                     in    the same manner                   as

was placed, and at twice that distance from each of them. The
distribution of the heat in the spectrum of the lime-light was
likewise investigated both with flint-glass prisms and with rock
salt apparatus.
    In the experiments with flint-glass prisms         was obliged to              I
work with a rather broad slit (2 millims.), as the thermal effects
were very feebly expressed.        In the luminous part of such a
spectrum,     could  Ionly verify a slight heat-effect in the red and
orange.     From the red outwards to the ultra-red end the deflec
tions gradually augmented until they attained a certain maxi
 mum; then a gradual diminution commenced, yet without that
 interruption of continuity which we have always seen in the solar
 spectrum.     I will here mention that Tyndall, in the account of
 his well-known experiments on “Calorescence” (Phil. Trans.
1866), called attention to the circumstance that the discontinuous
distribution of heat, first observed by Sir John Herschel in the
solar spectrum, does not exist in the spectrum of artificial sources
of light.
    On comparing the distribution of heat in the spectrum of the
lime-light with that in the solar spectrum, we find that the posi
tion of the maximum of heat-effect is much further from the end
of the visible red in the former than in the latter. In other
words, with the feebler sources of heat the intensity of heat
effect attained                    its
                       maximum for rays             greater wave-length  of
than with more      powerful   sources     heat.               of
                                                    Moreover this result
             expected; for we have here the same case as, for ex

                   so that W, Ol, which is necessarily the instru
 mental direction of the object at the instant the image is seen at
W,   is parallel to OP and points to Pi, the position of the ob
ject at that instant.   Hence there is no aberration.
   Supposing, now, the ray to be retarded by passing through the
lenses and the water, the argument above referred to shows that
the image of the object may still be assumed to be at some point
W, in P'O produced, although the distance O W, will not be
the same as before.        Draw P, O W, parallel to PO. Then
during the passage of the light from O to Wi the object moves
through a space PP, greater than PPI, and the optical centre
through a space O O2 equally greater than O Ol. Thus the                                              in
strumental line of collimation is W1 O2, which does not point
to Pa; and consequently,           if P, O2 W, be drawn parallel to
Pi O, WI, there is a forward aberration equal to the angle
W. O.W. But M. Hoek found no aberration, the reading of
the micrometer for bisection of the object being, quam provime,
the same whether the telescope was directed northward or south
ward; whereas if such aberration existed, it would have had op
posite signs in the two positions of the telescope. To account
for this fact it is necessary to admit that the ray, after passing
 through O, is dragged by the water and the lenses, so that the
image is formed at a point W, such that W, Wa-O, O2=P, Pa.
The instrumental direction of vision thus becomes W202 pointing
 to the object P, ; and hence there is no aberration.        shall pre                   I
 sently endeavour to give a theory of this dragging of the ray.

anomalous dispersion in a very great number of substances has
                                                                  -
turned general attention to the subject.
   Anomalous dispersion of light appears to occur only in those
bodies which very strongly absorb light, so as to be almost
opaque.   This coincidence is the more striking, as at the same
time other optical properties are almost always found in combi
nation with these two: namely, the bodies exhibit likewise elliptic
polarization of the reflected light, and frequently a surface-colour
different from the body-colour.
   That elliptic polarization and anomalous dispersion are com
bined in the case of metals was observed by Brewster*.             In
Cauchy’s theory of metallic reflectiont elliptic polarization ap
pears to be necessarily united with strong absorption, i.e. opa
city; this we learn from the structure of his formulae, in which,
to the periodic functions representing the oscillations, exponen
tial functions are added which measure the weakening of the
light.    It is moreover well known that several metals, and gold
above   all, transmit light of a different colour from that which
they reflect—that        possess  is,body-colour different from the
                                                           a
colour of their surface.
   The same number                      of
                                         properties are found united    other                        in
classes          of   bodies      besides the   metals—namely,      the many            in

                                   those properties have been clearly

aether in such media. This resistance must depend on the velo
city of the particles, and vanish with them.   On the supposition
of small amplitude and consequently little velocity of the oscilla
tions, the assumption that these resisting forces are proportional
to the velocities appears perfectly safe.
   A so much the more weighty doubt, however, must arise as
to whether the seat of the assumed force is in the ponderable
matter, or whether the force upon an oscillating aether-particle
is exerted by the neighbouring particles of aether.        In the first
case we   may  without hesitation  regard   the ponderable    particles
as motionless, and accordingly we have to suppose this force pro
portional to the absolute velocity of the aether-particle on which
it operates. In the other case, on the contrary, considering the
force a reciprocal operation of the oscillating particles of aether,
 we must suppose                its
                       value proportional     their relative velocities.  to

According to this formula, with increasing value of the wave
length X the ratio of refraction likewise becomes greater.    This
law is exactly the opposite of the  ordinary law of dispersion, and
therefore comprehends anomalous dispersion.

   Accordingly both theories explain anomalous dispersion of
light, and both, too, from hypotheses which find their justifica
tion in the opacity of the medium. At the same time elliptic
polarization of light results from both theories; for the formula
                   v= [A cos (at-8w)+B sin (at—&r)]e-Yº
is the very one on which Cauchy grounded his theory of metallic
    veflection.
       Our theories, however, fail us in one important point.                                                   It
    results from the values of y in both cases that the light of shorter
    wave-lengths   is more strongly absorbed than that of greater
    wave-lengths.    Those bodies should therefore        appear red             all                            by
    transmitted light.
       Further,        on

                              satisfactory agreement.
       The preceding theory, therefore, does not yet completely ex
    haust the subject.  But since     gives     account

mistaken, the maps of the barometer and wind will prove to be the
most valuable portion; but we greatly regret that the area over which
the elements are given is so small that by our instruments we can only
obtain fragments of them; and unless the meteorologist combines the
data given in these charts with other data obtainable on the continent
or ocean, we apprehend his work will not be easy from the charts before
us to obtain a general view of the affections of the atmosphere as they
exist in their entirety.

   The various English Treatises on the Differential Calculus so

                                    Mr. Ogilby (p. 14):—“It               difficult                                                   to is a

                     these arbitrary assumptions, unless                  supposing
that the mind         Newton was   of        completely absorbed   so     his grand

                   Notices respecting New Books.                  309
discovery, that he could recognize no other principle than attraction
in the regulation of phenomena.” These words refer to Prop. XIX.
of Book 3 of the Principia, which contains what Mr. Airy calls “this
astonishing investigation,” adding that “it is one of the many     in
stances in which Newton has obtained a correct result by means ap
parently quite inadequate.”     This seems strange. It may of course
be that Newton and      Laplace  are both wrong; but then it may be
that Mr. Ogilby is wrong.      Suppose, then, we try to ascertain his
qualifications for discussing a difficult question by seeing how he'
deals with a comparatively simple one.      Here, for instance, is his
notion of the effect of “the centrifugal force" on a fluid in a state
of rotation. “The centrifugal force generated by rotation would
repel the fluid particles from the interior parts and leave a vacant
ellipsoidal space round the axis, of greater or less extent, according
to the velocity of rotation and the density of the fluid mass” (p. 97);
from this he argues that the hypothesis of the original fluidity of the
earth is inconsistent with itself.  However this may be, it must at
least be allowed that according to this beautiful conception a cylinder
of the fluid coinciding in direction with the axis of revolution would
be supported by nothing, and that this is a view of the effects of ro
tation which will perhaps find acceptance when the views of Newton
and Laplace are forgotten.
    Here is another instance of Mr. Ogilby's powers.        It must be
premised that gravity at the equator is to be represented by 288 and
at the pole by 289, or more generally by m and m + 1. By a process
of reasoning he finds (p. 53) that the following relation exists be
tween these numbers,
                   3(m+1)"+}m"=m”x (m+1)*.
   That there may be no mistake as to his meaning, he enunciates
this equation in words printed in italics, and goes on to state,
“this theorem enables us to correct errors both of astronomical and
geodetical observation in measuring the ellipticities of the earth and
planets.”  The reader will notice that the above equation may be
written   thus:–
                         {(m+1)*—m”}*=0,
and that this gives, as alternative results,
                           1   = 0 or 577 = 0.
    Need we add that the treatise has been written in the interests of
true religion (pp. xii, 50, 51, 103,104);
    We have spent a good deal of time on this treatise, and have got
little profit from it; for we are not psychologists.     Had it been
otherwise, it would have suggested many curious questions as to
possible types of mind and character, and we should probably have
ended our study of the book by classifying        itsauthor with the
squarers   ofthe circle.

THE“On        a supposed Alteration in the amount of Astronomical
Aberration of Light, produced by the passage of Light through a
considerable thickness of Refracting Medium.”            By George Biddell
Airy, C.B., Astronomer      Royal.
   Å discussion has taken place on the Continent, conducted partly
in the “Astronomische Nachrichten,            partly in independent pam
phlets, on the change of direction which a ray of light will receive
(as inferred from the Undulatory Theory of Light) when it traverses
a refracting medium which has a motion of translation.          The subject
to which attention is   particularly  called is the effect that will be pro
duced on the     apparent    amount of that angular displacement of a
star or   planet  which is caused by the Earth's motion of translation,
and is known as the Aberration of Light.         It has been conceived that
there    may  be a difference in the amounts of this displacement as
seen with different telescopes, depending on the difference in the
thicknesses of their object-glasses. The most important of the papers
containing this discussion are:—that of Professor Klinkerfues, con
tained in a pamphlet published at Leipzig in 1867, August; and
those of M. Hoek, one published 1867, October, in No. 1669 of the
‘Astronomische Nachrichten,” and the other published in 1869 in a
communication to the Netherlands Royal Academy of Sciences.
Professor Klinkerfues maintained that, as a necessary result of the
 Undulatory Theory, the amount of Aberration would be increased,
in accordance with      a formula which he has given; and he sup
ported it by the following experiment:—
   In the telescope of a transit-instrument, whose focal length was
about 18 inches, was inserted a column of water 8 inches in length,
carried in a tube whose ends were closed with glass plates; and
with this instrument he observed the transit of the Sun, and the
transits of certain stars whose north-polar distances were nearly the
same as that of the Sun, and which passed the meridian nearly at
midnight.      In these relative positions, the difference between the
Apparent Right Ascension of the Sun and those of the stars is affected
by double the coefficient of Aberration; and the merely astrono
mical circumstances are extremely favourable for the accurate test
ing of the theory.       Professor Klinkerfues had computed that the
effect of the S-inch column of water and of a prism in the interior
of the telescope would be to increase the coefficient of Aberration
by eight seconds of arc. The observation appeared to show that

the Aberration was really increased by 7":1.                  It does not appear   ---
that this observation was repeated.
    A result of physical character so important, and resting on the
respectable authority of Professor Klinkerfues, merited and, indeed,
required further examination. Having carefully considered the astro
nomical means which would be most accurately employed for the
experiment, I decided on adopting a vertical telescope, the subject of
observation being the meridional zenith distance of y Draconis, the
same star by which the existence and laws of Aberration were first
established. The position of this star is at present somewhat more
favourable than it was in the time of Bradley,                         mean zenith             its
distance north         the Royal Observatory being about 100" and still

                            in the Chair.
   The following communications were read:—
   1. A Letter from G. Milner Stephen, Esq., F.G.S., to the late
Sir Roderick Murchison, dated Sydney, 5 October, 1871, announcing
the discovery of a rich auriferous deposit on the banks of the river
Bondé, on the N.E. coast of New Caledonia, and of a great deposit
of Tin-ore in the district of New England, New South Wales.
The gold in New Caledonia is found in drift; and there are indica
tions of the near proximity of a quartz-reef.    The Tin-ore in New
South Wales is said to be in “pepitas, crystals, and beds of conglo
merate, especially in Micaceous granite, more or less decomposed.”
   2. “Remarks on the Greenland Meteorites.”          By Prof. A. E.
Nordenskjöld, For. Corr. G.S.
   The author stated that the masses of meteoric iron brought from
Greenland by the recent Swedish expedition seem to have formed
the principal masses of an enormous meteoric fall of Miocene date,
extending over an area of some 200 miles. The iron appears to be
free from silicates. Against its eruptive origin the author urges
that when heated it evolves a great amount of gaseous matter, and
that it contains imbedded particles of sulphide of iron, the mass
itself being nearly free from sulphur. The masses are composed of
meteoric nickeliferous cast and wrought iron, or of mixtures of the
two ; in the last case the Widmannstaetten's figures are best deve
loped. The author further noticed the various modes in which the
iron occurs, viz.:-1, as meteorites; 2, filling cracks; 3, as breccii
form stones cemented with oxide and silicate of iron; and 4, in
grains disseminated in the basalt.
   3. “Further Remarks on the Relationship of the Limulidae     (Xi
phosura) to the Eurypteridae and to the Trilobita.” By Henry
Woodward, Esq., F.G.S.
   In this paper the author described the recent investigations made
by Dr. A. S. Packard, Dr. Anton Dohrn, and the Rev. Samuel Lock
wood, upon the developmental history of the North-American King
crab (Limulus Polyphemus), and discussed the conclusions as to the
alliances of the Xiphosura and Eurypteridae, and to the general
classification of the Arthropoda, to which the results of these inves
tigations have led Dr. Dohrn and some other continental naturalists.
According to this view, the Xiphosura and Eurypteridae are more
nearly related to certain Arachnida (the Scorpions, &c.) than to the
Crustacea; and this opinion is further supported by the assertion
of Dr. Dohrn, that in Limulus only one pair of organs (antennules)
receives its  nerves from the supracesophageal ganglion, and that the

the heads of the valleys of the Atlas, both of which he ascribed to
glacial action.  An elevation of the coast line of at least 70 feet was
indicated by raised beaches of concrete sand at Mogador and else
where; and the author considered that a slight subsidence of the
coast was now taking place.    The surface of the plain of Marocco
was described as covered with a tufaceous crust, probably due to the
drawing up of water to the surface from the subjacent calcareous
strata and the deposition from it of laminated carbonate of lime.

out tube; the air contained in it penetrates and ascends in the
liquid. The experiment, repeated several times, always gave the
same result.
     Let us now assume that at a certain distance below the surface of
the suspended water there is a current of visible aqueous vapour;
if this vapour consists of vesicles, each of them, on coming into contact
with the fluid surface, will introduce a microscopic air-bubble into
the water, which will immediately ascend in it; and the whole of these
vesicles will form a cloud in the water of the tube, which slowly
rises and destroys the transparency.
     M. Duprez was good enough to make the experiment at my re
 quest. The water was suspended in a glass tube of 13 millims. in
 ternal diameter. A small metal vessel with an aperture of several
 centimetres diameter and containing a certain quantity of water,
 was placed under the free surface of the water of the tube over a
 lamp; the mouth of this vessel was about 12 centims, from the sur
 face. A continuous boiling was thus obtained, and a current of
 visible vapour which rose to the surface of the suspended water; but
 though the experiment lasted more than half an hour, no cloud was
 observed in the water of the tube. The vapour condensed on the
 outside of the tube, and from time to time was wiped away; but

has repeated the experiment in such a manner that this surface was
concave and remained so in spite of the fact that the volume of
water increased owing to expansion by heat and the condensation
of vapour; but now in this case a large number of vesicles should
have rolled towards the apex of the concavity, have accumulated
there, and therefore must soon have placed themselves in contact
with the fluid surface: but nothing in the result was different; no
cloud disturbed the transparency of the water.

very powerful argument against the hypothesis of the vesicular con

than a few wave-lengths within the medium.           There can be
little doubt that in this Cauchy was perfectly right; for it has
been found that bodies which, like many of the dyes, exercise a
very intense selective absorption on light, reflect from their sur
faces in excessive proportion just those rays to which they are
most opaque.         Permanganate of potash is a beautiful example
of  this,  given     by Professor Stokes.           He found (Phil. Mag.

ance  of these facts from the point of view of theoretical optics;
but it lies beside the object of the present paper to go further
into the question here.
   That a sufficient opacity is as competent as a high optical
density to produce an abundant reflection is evident without any
analysis.   So long as the medium into which the light seeks to
penetrate remains nearly at rest, the greater part of the motion
must be thrown back without any regard to the cause of the ap
proximate quiescence. Whether the sluggishness be due to a
great inertia or a correspondingly great friction is in this respect
of no importance.                      In
                         order, however, to account for the reflec
tion from silver (90 or 95 per cent.) without opacity, a very high
optical density would be required, much higher than we have
any reason to think at        likely.          all
                                        On the other hand,       know                                     we

324              The Hon.        J. W.   Strutt         on the Reflection and
   This is for one surface. If the plate be quite transparent,
the reflection may be nearly the double of the above. Now for
glass at an angle of 45°, Magnus found no smaller value of                                        I
than 084; and as this must be attributed almost, if not entirely,
to the first surface, it is clear that something not taken account
of in Fresnel's theory must have come into operation.         But by
far the most remarkable result was with fluor-spar for the reflect
ing, and rock-salt for the radiating plate. The reflection at 33°
was no less than 23, at 45° 242, and at 62°-335; and to this
the second surface cannot contribute sensibly.       Unquestionably
therefore the reflecting-power      of fluor-spar for a certain kind
of dark radiation is greatly in excess of what can be accounted
for without an extreme opacity—a result which is the more re
markable because for dark radiation in general fluor-spar is one
of the most transparent things known. The reflection from a
plate of rock-salt was found to be much the same as from glass;
but here,        I
             presume, we may consider both surfaces to be ope
rative, in which case the result is normal4.      It is curious that
opacity first diminishes the reflection from a plate, and then
when extreme increases it again, and that without limit.
   The effect of opacity is represented mathematically by the                                    in
troduction into the differential equation of a term proportional
to the velocity.   If we suppose that was 0 is the surface of sepa
ration, and that the vibrations are parallel to 2 and perpendicular
to the plane of incidence ay, the differential equation in the
opaque medium is

it is evident that, in order to aid in reflection, opacity must be

    We have hitherto supposed that the reflection takes place at
the bounding surface of the opaque medium and air; but it is
easy to adapt our formulae so as to express the result when the
first medium, still supposed transparent, or at least not very
opaque, has a refractive index u' different from unity.    The only
 change required is to write R--u' for R. Thus at perpendicular

334                    The Hon.             J. W. Strutt on        the Reflection and
transmitted wave, the influence of opacity is altogether different
from that of density. According to a method used by me in
the investigation of the light scattered from very small particles
(as in the sky)*, we may suppose that the incident wave passes
on undisturbed, if suitable forces are imagined to act on the
aether in the metal in order to compensate for the alteration of
optical properties.    In the case when the thickness of the me
tallic plate is small compared to the internal wave-length, this
point of view possesses considerable advantages, and gives a
clear insight into the peculiarities of the question.     The forces
which we must suppose to act in the region of the metallic
layer divide themselves into two groups—one dependent on va
riation of density, and the other on opacity. The first set cor
respond in phase with the acceleration of the aether, the second
with the velocity.    There is thus a difference of a quarter of a
period. In my former paper                                I
                                     showed that the effect of a force
acting at any point is to produce at another, distant r from                                                     it, a

 XLII.        On Hamilton's Principle and the Second Proposition of
             the Mechanical Theory of Heat.   By C. Szilyºk.
THEdecidedly
     history of the development of modern physics speaks
             in favour of the view that only those theories
which are based on mechanical principles are capable of affording
a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena.
   The first proposition of the theory of heat would certainly not
have spread so quickly, and in a year or two have penetrated
every branch of physical science, if it had not been preceded by
an analogous proposition, viz. that of the equivalence of work
and    visviva.   The perfect concordance which prevails between
the first proposition          the theory
                                      of          heat and                of

                                                of                  the   present          up    to

of electricity are not yet known.
   The second proposition              the theory      ofheat      scarcely two      of         is
years more recent than the first;               bearing              its

   The first who, to my knowledge, occupied himself with this
 question was Ludwig Bolzmann.       His memoir relative to it
 was presented to the Vienna Academy on the 8th of February,
 1866, and appeared in the Sitzungsberichte under the title “On
 the Mechanical   Signification of the Second Proposition of the
Theory of Heat.”
   Independently of Bolzmann, and evidently unaware of the
existence of his memoir, Clausius laid before the Society for
 Natural and Medical Science of the Lower Rhine, on the 7th
November 1870, a memoir entitled “On the Reduction of the
Second Axiom of the Mechanical Theory of Heat to general
Mechanical Principles”*.
   The result in both memoirs is much the same:—“The second
proposition of the mechanical theory of heat is capable of being
explained from the principles of analytical mechanics.    For this
purpose, however, new and peculiar developments are necessary;
and the calculations relative to it are very similar to those ge
nerally made use of in order to demonstrate the so-called ‘prin
ciple of least action.’”
   Clausius investigated, in the first place, what connexion exists
between the periodical motions of a material point in a closed
path, presupposing conservative forces (that            possessing                is,                    a
force-function);               he

in  the different cases.      the third part

uninteresting to investigate the question, what connealion subsists
between the second proposition               of the theory of heat and Hamilton’s
dynamic principle” which relates to varying action.
  Hamilton's principle may be expressed as followst:—
     If
     any conservative system of material points be in any free
motion between any initial and final configuration, the following
equation will be universally valid for an infinitely small altera
tion of this motion:—
                          8A-Xmv18s, –Xmvoëso--iöE,    . .   .   .  (1)
where m is the mass of a    point  of the  system;     8s, and 8so are
the displacements of the same point from the previous final con
figuration into the new one, and from the previous initial confi
guration into the new one, respectively; v1 and vo denote the
velocity, measured always in the direction of displacement, of the
same point in the earlier final configuration and initial configu
ration respectively; i is the time during which the system passes
from the first initial configuration to the first final configuration.
8A is the difference of action, and 8E the difference of total
cnergy, between the new and the former path. By action is
understood the time-integral of twice the           viva for the time     vis
during which the system passes from the initial          the final con          to
figuration;         by

jar sparks from 7 to 9 inches in length, and of most dazzling
brilliance, at the rate of seventy a minute. When, in a darkened
room, the eye is screened from the direct light of the spark, the
illumination produced is sufficient to render every thing in the
apartment perfectly visible; and, what is remarkable, every con
spicuous object is seen twice at least, with an interval of a trifle
less than a quarter of a second—the first time vividly, the second
time faintly; often it is seen a third, and sometimes (but only
with great difficulty) even a fourth time. The appearance is
precisely as if the object had been suddenly illuminated by a
light at first bright, but rapidly fading to extinction, and as                                                        if,

  It   may be seen, with some difficulty, by the help                                     of an induc
tion-coil and Leyden jar; or even by simply charging a Leyden
jar with an old-fashioned electrical machine and discharging it
in a darkened room. The spark must be at least an inch in
length; and, furthermore, the size and distance of the electrodes
and the charge of the jar must be so adjusted that the discharge
shall be single—a condition not always easy to fulfil with a short
striking-distance.

      accompanied by changes in the mean temperature of the streaming

flowing liquid, so that the platinum plates which are immersed
in the liquid for the observation of the current act in such a
manner that the plate first touched corresponds to the zinc end,
the plate which is last touched to the platinum end of a Grove's
battery. The electromotive force of these currents is very large.
Using, for instance, a diaphragm of common quartz-sand, the
electromotive force is 6-2 times as great as that of a Daniell’s
cell; so that Quincke, at the end of his paper, formed the idea
of making such a source of electricity practically useful. He
remarks as follows:—
     “I have lastly tried to make use of the water-works of this
town to produce an electric current, as the large electromotive
force made me hope to obtain currents of practical application.”
   The experiments made with an instrument constructed for
this purpose under a pressure of about 2% atmospheres and an
hourly use of 5 cubic feet of water, showed only weak electric
currents. Quincke explains this result partly by the salt con
tained in the water, and partly by oxide of iron present in the
   º,
p 1DeS.
         electromotive forces seem to be (according to the experi
ments hitherto made) independent of the thickness and surface
of the porous walls, but proportional to the difference of pressure
causing the flow of the liquid.
   The origin of this source of electricity has, until now, not
been reduced to the known disturbances of the electrical equi
librium.
   Even not considering the possible connexions of this kind of
current with the following phenomena, it is of the highest im
portance for the present considerations that in a common river
these electric currents can be shown to exist if the two plates at
the ends of galvanometer-wires        are inserted one in the more
                                                                                   weits

 with the conductor and cushions of the electrical machine.
    In turning slowly the disk of the electrical machine, a move
 ment of the particles of starch, in the direction of the positive
 current, was observed near the walls of the tube; in the middle
 of the liquid the movement was in the opposite direction. It was
 observed by a microscope magnifying thirty times.                  If the                                              in
 tensity of the current is increased, the particles in the middle
 of the tube move more quickly, while the larger particles near
 the walls change their direction and move now with the negative
 current.    Increasing still more the intensity of the current,                                                         all

seven hundred years round the earth.     It is easily seen that
nothing is gained by hypotheses which are neither supported by
analogy nor facts, and at present the best thing is to confess
that we cannot make any acceptable supposition about these
mysterious phenomena.”

or  their beds may         modified.be  We shall consider now more
closely these consequences.

    It may therefore be of interest to determine accurately the
magnetic constants in places where the deviation of the pen
dulum is observed, in order to be able to find out a connexion
between these phenomena.      But such influences of mountain
chains may possibly be explained by the assumption of magnetic
minerals contained in them.    A treatise of Menzer lately pub
lished, “On the Connexion of the Configuration of the Conti
nents with the Situation of the Magnetic Poles of the Earth,” is
                                   This paper will be found in
of great interest for this question.
Poggendorff’s Annalen, supplementary volume v. p. 592, and is
dated “Halberstadt, November 3, 1870.”     The number of the
Annalen was  published in the beginning  of August 1871, and
came into my hands on the 5th of August.
   It is easily understood that some indications given therein, as
well as the results arrived at, must be of the greatest interest for
my theory, which I had already stated on July 25. In fact, we
may even from some indefinite hints draw the conclusion that
Dr. Menzzer was conducted to quite similar views as myself on
the origin of the earth's magnetism.
   So, for instance, at once in the beginning of the researches for
the foundation of the mathematical       formulae we find the fol
lowing passage:–
     “We     may deduce from the earth’s rotation that the positive
currents   going  round the earth from east to west are really the
cause of      magnetic polarity; and we may even find the origin
             its
of these currents.    But     itnotis   present my intention
                                            at                     give        to
this deduction.     What  I  want      show to   merely how we can
                                                       is
derive from these currents         in
                                 the earth the situation      the mag     of
netic  poles.
     “If the earth were covered throughout             by
                                                   homogeneous solid
                                                            a
crust, the currents connected with               its
                                            rotation would go round
the earth exactly from east       west+; the result would
                                    to                            that         be
the  magnetic   poles would coincide  exactly  with the  geographical
poles.    This      approximately the case with that part
                   is                                               the        of
earth's crust which reaches from below          about half the depth
                                                       to
of the sea.    But the part above consists        land and sea; and
                                                        of

356        M. F. Zöllner        on the Origin       of the Earth's Magnetism,
  “The    cause that the magnetic poles of the earth are shifted
relatively to the geographical poles, lies in the different action of
this backward tendency; and if the statement which has only
been made as an assertion is true, we ought to be able to cal
culate the situation of the magnetic poles from the configuration
of land and water.”
   It appears to me, from the indefinite expression “this back
ward tendency,” that the author was not acquainted with the
relations shown above to exist between electrical currents and
 currents of liquids. At any rate, the fact remains qualitatively
 correct; as to the sufficiency of the quantitative data for the ex
 planation of the facts in question,                I
                                        do not take upon myself to
judge.
    The result of the numerical calculation is certainly remarkable
 for the very exact coincidence with Hansteen's observations *
    At the end of his paper the author makes the supposition
 that, by a gradual rising or falling of the continents, a change in
 the position of the magnetic poles, and hence secular variations
 of the magnetic constants, may be effected. According to my
 theory, the distribution of heat and cold in the earth’s crust, if
 with decided differences, ought to be of great influence. A great
 lowering of temperature on the surface will cause a more rapid
 cooling at the particular spot in the crust and thus cause in the
 liquid streams a tendency to descend. To such a tendency the
 poles of cold owed at an early phase their formation.          have                  I
 shown in my paper on the Law of the Sun's Rotation that the
  distribution of heat on the sun's surface, as observed by Secchi,
 may be very simply deduced from the thermic reactions which
 the atmospheric currents exert on the glowing surface.       As this
 distribution of temperature is always such that by itself it would
 produce the currents by which it is generated, any irregulari
ties which at the earliest state of development had influenced
these currents would increase with increasing lowering of tem
perature, and so          fix
                     permanently the position    the poles     of
                                                               cold.              of
It    is   to   be
             seen from this that   generally  these poles  will not
                           rotation,                    on                                on
                                   in of
coincide with the poles                the sun      well         the  as         as
earth.       It   follows that             these points the descending          currents
will predominate, and poles                   of   currents will    be     formed which
must coincide with the magnetic poles.
  It   therefore evident that, also looked
        is                                    from this point at                               of
view, permanent differences     the temperature

   The  facility with which the so-called magnetic disturbances
and their connexion with volcanic processes are explained by the
aid of my theory is of much greater importance than     the facts                                 all

of the globe will present the same general appearances as a magnet
on the surface of the earth.     Suppose, now, that in one of the
circular wires surrounding the globe an alteration in the electric
current takes place; the needle will then be influenced in the
same way in which that particular turn of the wire would influence
it if acting by itself alone. Suppose the turn of the wire in ques
tion is just below the freely suspended needle and the current is
increased. We see at once that the horizontal intensity will be di
minished and the dip increased. The direction of the disturbance
will always be the same, if those currents are increased which are
running through wires whose distance from the equator is smaller
than that of the needle (i.e., speaking of the earth, have a lower
geographical latitude). A disturbance taking place in higher
latitudes than that of the needle, must consist in a decrease of
the current if the needle be deflected in the same direction as
before.

where A signifies a constant determined by the nature of the
body, and v, the linear velocity of a point on the solid crust at
the equator.
    Hence the velocity     which    a   particle loses going from the
equator to lat. q is

 and subtracting (3) from (2), we have
                       vº-v.-vi.[1–(cos            p +p sin” p)]     .   .  (4)
This expression represents the law according to which the differ
ence in linear velocity of the inner glowing streams (v) and the
solid crust (v.) varies with the latitude. But this difference is
evidently nothing else than the relative velocity of the glowing
 liquid with respect to the earth’s crust.
    The constant p will always have a mean value considerably
less than (1); so that the above expression will generally increase
with increasing latitude and have a maximum value at the poles.
    As, according to the developed theory, the magnetic appear
ances on the surface of the earth are only effects of the streaming
movement in the liquid nucleus, the magnetic phenomena must
increase in intensity with increasing latitude.           It follows from this
that the peculiarities of magnetic disturbances characterized as
above by Lamont must be much more intense in higher latitudes,
and can generally only consist in a decrease of the intensity of
the current, as this was supposed to be the case in the above

      creasing latitude is mentioned by Lamont in the following
      words (l.c. p. 271):-‘‘The magnitude of the movements                                                          in
      creases gradually from the equator towards the north and south
      pole; in the equatorial zone only slight movements are observed.”
         Another remark about the magnitude of the movements of the
      magneticneedlein disturbances is to be found on the following page.
         “I   have seen myself changes in declination of 10 minutes of
      arc   taking  place in one minute's time.      In our neighbour
      hood such rapid movements are extremely rare; in the polar
      regions, however, it is frequently the case that the movement of
      the instruments cannot any more be accurately measured.        Bra
      vais and his companions, in the North-pole Expedition, 1838–39,
       had several times opportunity to convince themselves of this
      fact.   Already in Petersburg and Sitka very rapid movements
      are not rare.”

         In both cases the hydrostatic equilibrium which has been                                                sud

locity peculiar to the liquid—similar to the circular waves going
out on a quiet surface of water from a point where a stone has
fallen into the water.
    It is evident that the velocity of propagation, as well as the
form of the waves, will be essentially modified if the liquid is not
quiet, but flowing with a uniform velocity.
    In a direction perpendicular to the current the waves will pro
pagate themselves with the velocity peculiar to the liquid; par
allel to the current they will propagate themselves more quickly
in the direction of the current than in the opposite direction. At
the same time the form of the waves will be more extended and
drawn out on the side of the centre of the waves situated in the
direction of motion.      The height of the waves will depend upon
the borders of the     liquid;   it will increase where- the liquid is
hemmed in.
    Let us now apply these simple laws of hydrodynamics, mutatis
mutandis, to the glowing liquid in the nucleus of our earth.
Other modifications of the wave, generated in the above manner,
will appear in the direction of the circles of latitude than in the
meridian. In the first direction the wave will proceed as in a
circular channel on both sides of the disturbed spot, and cause
at a point about 180 degrees distant from it the opposite phase
of that by which the wave was originated. In the present case
this would be a wave-mountain.          But as a rising of the liquid ne
cessarily increases the pressure against the solid crust, and must
hence also increase the friction of the glowing mass flowing east
ward, it is clear that an oscillation of the magnetic constants
will take place parallel to the direction of propagation.
    It is clear moreover that the direction of propagation of a
liquid wave must be distinguished from the direction of the cur
rent as regards the electromotive action produced by                  Theit.

     Lamont, indeed,  draws our attention to the fact that the
causes which  generate  a daily period in the changes of the mag
netic constants are as a rule only increased by the disturbances,
so that the latter may be considered to be only reinforcements
of the causes which generate the daily variations.   The words of
Lamont    upon this subject are (in the work   mentioned,  p. 271)
the following:—
   “Every hour in the day has                         its
                                  own predominant disturbances;
and   ingeneral they are only reinforcements      the daily varia          of

   The modifications of a magnetic disturbance in the direction
of the meridian are explained in the same satisfactory manner in
their general features by the developed theory, as are the modi
fications for the same parallel.
    If we remember that as the wave proceeds towards the poles it
must be necessarily hemmed in between           borders, and that the           its

   the wave proceeding towards the poles must increase,         the
height                                                                           by

surface    the earth.    By the second circumstance the intensity
of the disturbance      increased  is  well;    that             as

                                         but for drawing; viz. it rotates
horizontally on a table (being moved, not from the inside by the
axle of the lathe, but from the outside by a handle-frame), carry
ing a drawing-board which works under a fixed pencil supported
by a bridge. Two points of the drawing-board describe circles;
and the curve traced out on the drawing-board is consequently
that described by a fixed point upon a moving plane two points
of which describe circles; or, what is really the same thing, it is
the curve described on a fixed plane by a point rigidly connected
with two points each of which describes a circle.             The apparatus
 is at once convertible into an oval chuck of          nearly   the ordinary
 construction; viz. it may be arranged so that the curve described
on the drawing-board shall be an ellipse.
    Bottom plane is a rectangular board (1) (see figure) about
 30 inches by 24 inches, having in the middle a sliding-piece (2)
 carrying a block (3).
    Second plane contains two circular segments (4) fixed to
 the bottom plane, serving as an axle for the moving piece (5)

   which is the centre of the block (3); and D rotates about the
   point A, which is the centre of the segments (4), each hole being
   capable of describing a complete circle; and the distances A B,
   BC, CD, and D A are (within limits) adjustable to any given
   values: the distance of the holes C, D is made equal to that of
   the two pegs next referred to.
      Connected herewith by means of cylindrical pegs working in
   the holes C, D respectively, we have a carrying-frame; viz. the
  fourth plane contains two sides (13) of this carrying-frame,
  and two moveable bars (14), attached to the remaining two sides
  (15) of the carrying-frame, and having on their lower surfaces
  the pegs which work in the holes C and D respectively—each
  bar being free to rotate about one extremity, and being clamp
  able at the other extremity so as to allow the two pegs to be ad
  justed at a given distance from each other. And then in the fifth
  plane we have the remaining two sides (15) of the carrying-frame.
      Rigidly connected with the carrying-frame we have the draw
  ing-board; or, to make the whole more complete, this should be
  adjustable to any given position in regard to the carrying-frame
  by giving it two sliding motions crosswise, and a rotating motion,
  in the manner of an eccentric chuck.

       XLVI.           On a Collector           for Frictional Electrical Machines.
                                      By Dr. H. EMSMANN*.
                   observing
                 how effective the condenser is when                                 applied
Frºm
   to Ruhmkorff's coil, notwithstanding the small space that
it occupies,           I
               was led to imagine that a compendious collector,
which would nevertheless increase the effect considerably, might,
in like manner, be adapted to the ordinary frictional electrical
machine.
                   I
   In this have been completely successful. At an inconsider
able outlay            I
                 have attained what the remarkable and compa
ratively expensive ring (now, however, disproportionately expen
sive) produces when adapted to Winter's electrical machine.
   My original idea was to form the collector of a single long
strip of tinfoil to be folded up between two overlapping strips of
waxed paper, and which would be enclosed in a cover of similar
material of about octavo size.                        I
                                    purposed placing this collector
on the conductor itself of the machine (like Winter's ring), or on
the metallic portion between the conductor and the points.
   M. Kuhlo, the assiduous and skilful philosophical-instrument
maker of this place, to whom I addressed myself to carry out
my idea, has now executed the collector in this way—namely, by
inserting into each other several glass tubes hermetically sealed
at one end, the diameter of the widest tube being about 2 inches.
   With the exception of the widest, which serves simply as an
insulating cover,                all
                         the tubes, varying     number from three   in                    to
five, are coated externally with tinfoil applied with paste; the
                                            lie
edges        of
         their open ends           the same plane; and
                                            in             those ends           at
 allthese tinfoil   coatings  are united  together  and brought  into
metallic connexion with the conductor            the machine, the arof
rangement being such that the collector can           adapted thereto      be
or  removed       pleasure.
                       at
   The effect produced         astonishing. The collector accom
                                            is
plishes even more than Winter’s ring does when placed, instead
thereof, upon     machine furnished with such
                           a                        ring.
         simple                                                          be a
   This         and   inexpensive collector can    easily adapted                         to
any frictional electrical machine;     that with every    so
                                                       such machine
we may obtain                     an

of free electricity e, and               each      molecule           of chlorine the quantity
of free electricity e.
  This free electricity arises from the different degrees of attrac
tion which sodium, chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen, being simul
taneously in mutual proximity in space, exert upon the two
electric fluids.  As in the case of the excitation of free electri
city by the contact of different metals, so in this case also the
free electricity of each constituent may depend upon the tem
perature of the bodies in contact, and may alter with the con
dition of the solvent.   The magnitude and signs of the masses of
electricity e and e' remain to be determined, but may in general
be either both equal or different.

An Elementary Treatise on Curve-Tracing.      By Percival, FRost,
  M.A., formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, Mathema
  tical Lecturer of King's College. London: Macmillan and Co.
   1872 (8vo, pp. 208).
rTHIS      work is almost exclusively devoted to the tracing of curves
       whose equations are of the form f(ry)=0, where denotes a                          f
rational algebraical function.   The author is perfectly aware of the
limited aim of his book, and in fact says somewhat naively:-" The
student might expect in a treatise upon this subject to find methods
of drawing Polar Curves, Rolling Curves, Loci of Equations in Trili
near Coordinates, and Intrinsic Equations; he might also expect to
find interesting Geometrical Loci discussed. These, and many other
things immediately connected with the tracing of curves, have been
deliberately omitted for reasons which I consider good” (p. v).
These omissions are determined by the object for which the book is
written, viz. to furnish preliminary exercises in elementary mathe
matics—especially in Algebra as far as the Binomial Theorem, the
fundamental parts of the theory of Equations, and the general me
thods of Algebraical Geometry—with a view to assisting the student
to acquire that mastery over these subjects which should be attained
before he enters on the higher branches of mathematics, or on their
application to Physical questions.
   Of course the points in the theory of curves which are commonly
given as applications of the Differential Calculus to Geometry occur
here—such as drawing tangents and asymptotes, determining points
of inflection, cusps, multiple points, radii of curvature, &c.; but as
the equations of the curves are simple algebraical functions, these
points can be discussed by successive approximations without refer
ence to the methods of the Differential Calculus.        Thus, let the
equation to the curve be written in the form
                         ul-H u, +u, +       . . .   =0,   . . . .   . . .   .   . .   . .   . . .   . ..   (1)
where   u, u, u,   ... are functions        of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd                       ...      order       re
spectively; now, when     a   and y    are both small, the first approximate
value of (1) is
                                    ul-0,
which gives the tangent to the curve at the origin.                               The second ap
proximation,
                                 u, +u, =0,
gives, generally, a curve of the second order approximating to the
curve and having the same curvature at the origin as the given curve.
It can further be shown that there are generally an infinite number
of conics which have the property of coinciding with the curve up
to the third order near the origin, and from amongst these the circle
of curvature can be easily selected.
   If we suppose the equation         (1)
                                      take particular forms, such
                                            to                                                              as

                           w, w, +u, +  ... =0,
                              v,”--u, + ... =0,
                       v,”--w,”+u, + ... =0,
a similar process of reasoning shows that near the origin the curve in
these cases has two branches with either distinct or coincident tan
gents, or has a conjugate point at the origin. It is scarcely neces
sary to observe that the student who has approached the subject in
this manner will find that the corresponding parts of Treatises on the
Differential Calculus offer no difficulty, and give in fact little more
than rather obvious generalizations of points that have already en
gaged his attention.
    The chief contents of the Treatise are these    :-In  addition to pre
liminary explanations, there is a full discussion of the forms of curves
near the origin, and of the forms which they tend to take at an in
finite distance, a subject which includes the discussion of asymptotes
both rectilinear and curvilinear.     There is also an account of various
 means (such as division into compartments) by which curves
whose equations cannot be solved for one of the variables may be
attempted “before they are given up in despair.”          The properties
of the “analytical triangle" are given at some length, as well as
 several illustrations of its ordinary use in ascertaining the form of
curves whose equations are of a high degree.          A novel use of the
triangle is also suggested and illustrated by Mr. Frost, viz. as an aid
in inferring the equation from the form of a traced curve. The work
 is illustrated by seventeen plates, which show the forms of a very
 large number (about two hundred) of curves whose equations are
 discussed in the text.      Although the book is intended for those
 whose mathematical acquirements are limited, yet we presume it is
addressed to students of more than average capacity.          To such it
will offer no serious difficulty; they will work through it in a short
time, and in doing so will find much that is instructive, and many
pleasant exercises of their ingenuity.     To others, we fear, the study
will prove a serious undertaking.
Arithmetic    in Theory   and Practice.    By  J.  Brook SMITH, M.A.,
    LL.B.      London: Macmillan and Co. (Crown 8vo, pp. 426.)
    The aim of the author of the above work is to explain fully the
principles on which the rules of Arithmetic are based, and to do this
by numbers only without the aid of more general symbols. In car
 rying out this view, he states most of the principles of the science in
 the form of propositions, of which he gives formal proof. The aim
 and execution of the work are both excellent; but it may be noted
 that when a general statement has to be proved by reasoning on a
 particular case, the force of the proof is apt not to be felt by the
 student unless it is quite manifest that the reasoning which applies
 to one case will equally apply to all; and accordingly in several
 cases Mr. Brook Smith's proofs would have gained in clearness, if
 not in cogency, from the use of general symbols.          Both as speci

mens of the book and as instances of what we mean, we will cite
two propositions.
      “If
       we interchange multiplicand and multiplier, the product remains
the same.
   “Thus 7 multiplied by 5 is the same as                                            l l              l l l                         l   1
5 multiplied by 7.    For write down 7 units                                         l l              l l l                     l       l
in a horizontal line, and repeat this line 5                                          l        l      l         l          l        l    I

7 repeated 5 times or 7 multiplied 5 times.                                           I        l      l         l          l        l   1
But in each vertical line there are 5 units,
and there are 7 such lines; therefore the number of units written
down is 5 repeated 7 times, or 5 multiplied by 7; that                 multi                                         is,   7
plied        by                 multiplied      7.”                        by               (P.

                 5    is                  is as   5       14.)
   Here the reasoning       obviously conclusive; what         proved      the                        is                       in

     I
     suspected a very minute stellar nucleus just within the eastern
extremity of the brighter condensed part, and to a small extent
north of the comet's axis.
   Nov. 8. The description given yesterday is applicable to the comet
tonight.    The brighter part appears more defined and in stronger
contrast to the fainter outlying nebulosity.        The nucleus is now
visible with certainty.   On the western preceding side of the comet,
the side towards the sun, the cometary light becomes gradually fainter
and more extended until it is lost to view.
   On this evening the light of the comet was examined by the
spectroscope. . The larger part of the light was resolved by the
        into a bright band in the green part of the spectrum.       The

   In the spectroscope the three bands are distinctly seem. The
position in the spectrum of the least refrangible band corresponds
with the first band of the carbon spectrum; it commences from the
red, with a wave-length of about 5632".
   Attempts were made with a double-image prism, a Nicol's prism,
and a Nicol's prism combined with a Savart's system of plates to de
tect polarized light in the comet, but without success.
   Nov. 14. The form of the comet remains nearly the same. The
outlying nebulosity is now chiefly on the south of the axis of the
comet.    The nucleus appears to be precisely at the extreme eastern
limit of the brighter, more condensed part of the comet.
   The same spectrum was seen, but fog coming on interrupted the
observations.
   On this evening an attempt was made again to detect polarized
light. A double-image prism was placed between the eyepiece and
the eye. The prism was brought into four different positions 90°
apart.    At each position of the prism an attempt was made to esti
mate the relative brightness of the two images. The power of the
prism was just sufficient to give two images of the comet without
their overlapping. The difference in brightness of the images was
exceedingly small;     I could not be certain that any appreciable differ
ence really existed.    However, I attempted in each case to select one
of the two images as the brighter one. Afterwards              determined I
the position of the prism at the four different estimations, and                   I
then found that three of the estimations were in accordance with a
portion of the comet's light being polarized in a plane passing
through the sun, and one in opposition to that supposition.             he    I
sitate to attach any positive value to these observations; but they
may perhaps be taken as showing that no considerable part of the
comet's light is polarized.
   The foregoing observations appear to show that the spectrum of
this comet is identical with that of Comet         1868,  II.

of fluorine), does not liberate uncombined fluorine, but produces
fluoride of iodine and iodide of silver, a double salt, composed of
iodide of silver and fluoride of platinum, being produced at the same
time by corrosion of the platinum vessels, if the temperature ap
proaches a red heat.
     The fluoride of iodine produced is a highly volatile and colourless
liquid, does not corrode mercury or red-hot platinum, corrodes glass
at 60° Fahr., and crystals of silicon at a red heat, also platinum in
contact with argentic fluoride in a state of fusion; it instantly turns
a deal splint black, fumes powerfully in the air, and is decomposed
 with violence by water into hydrofluoric and iodic acids, in accord
 ance with the following equation :-IF,4-3H,0=5HF-H HIO,.                             It
 dissolves iodine, and is absorbed by that substance; it is also ab
 sorbed either by argentic fluoride or iodide when those substances
 are cooled in              its
                        vapour, and may            expelled from thembe             red

 effected were considerably corroded (but less                     than when bro          so
 mine     or chlorine were employed); and many expensive vessels were
 rendered useless                 by

 of the silver-salt.    A solution of bromine or iodine in tetrachloride of
  carbon was     quickly   decolorized by agitation with small particles of
  argentic fluoride.
      Crystals of boron did not decompose fluoride of silver at a low
  red heat, nor chemically change at 60°Fahr, an aqueous solution of
  the salt containing either free hydrofluoric or nitric acids.
     Vitrified boracic acid violently decomposed fluoride of silver in a
  state of fusion, emitting copious white acid fumes; but it had no
  chemical effect upon an aqueous solution of the salt at 60°Fahr.
     By placing crystals of silicon upon argentic fluoride in a state of
  fusion, they become at once red-hot, undergoing rapid combustion,
  and evolving fluoride of silicon.        A lump of fused silicon slowly de
  composed an aqueous solution of fluoride of silver, setting free me
  tallic silver in crystals.     Crystals of silver behaved similarly, but
  much more rapidly, and evolved abundance of gas if the solution
  contained free hydrofluoric acid ; on adding nitric acid to this mix
  ture, bubbles of spontaneously inflammable silicide of hydrogen gas
  were evolved and ignited.
     Pure and dry precipitated silica added to fluoride of silver, at a
 temperature of low redness, evolved much heat, with violent action,
 and set free metallic silver.
     No chemical change took place on passing fluoride of silicon over
 red-hot fluoride of silver.
     Argentic fluoride in a state of fusion is rapidly decomposed by
 sulphur with evolution of heat; fluoride of sulphur is at the same
 time produced, and argentic sulphide formed. To ascertain whether
 fluoride of sulphur is a gas or a volatile liquid, an apparatus called
 a “gas-collector” was devised and employed, and a full description
 of  its  construction       given.
                            is          By using this apparatus, substances

passing the vapour of the latter substance over the silver-salt at

    “On some recent Researches in Solar Physics, and a law regula
ting the time of duration of the Sun-spot Period.” By Warren De
La Rue, D.C.L., F.R.S., Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., and Benjamin
Loewy, F.R.A.S.
    1. In the short account of some recent investigations by Professor
Wolf and M. Fritz on sun-spot phenomena, which has been published
lately in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society’ (1871, vol. xix.
p. 392), it was pointed out that some of Wolf's conclusions were
not quite borne out by the results which we have given in our last
paper on Solar Physics in the Philosophical Transactions for 1870,
pp. 389–496.      A closer inquiry into the cause of this discrepancy
has led us to what appears a definite law, connecting numerically
 the two branches of the periodic sun-spot curve, viz. the time du
 ring which there is a regular diminution of spot-production, and the
time during which there is a constant increase.
    It will be well, for the sake of clearness, to allude here again, as
briefly as possible, to Professor Wolf's results before stating those
at which we have arrived.
    2. Professor Wolf had previously devoted the greater part of his
laborious researches to a precise determination of the mean length of
 the whole sun-spot period, but latterly he has justly recognized the
importance of obtaining some knowledge of the average character of
 the periodic increase and decrease.      Hence he has, as far as he has
been able to do so by existing series of observations, and his peculiar
 and ingenious method of rendering observations made at different
 times and by different observers comparable with each other, endea
 voured to investigate more closely the nature of the periodic sun
 spot curve by tabulating and graphically representing the monthly
 means taken during two and a half years before and after the
 minimum, and applying this method to five distinct minimum
  epochs, which he has fixed for the following years:–
                                 1823-2
                                 1833-8

  3. In a Table he gives the mean numbers expressing the solar
activity, arranged in various columns, and arrives at the following
results:—
   (1) It is shown now, with greater precision than was previously
possible, that the curve of sun-spots ascends with greater rapidity
than it descends.    This fact is shown in the subjoined diagram,
which it may be of interest to compare with the curves given pre
viously by ourselves in the above-mentioned place. The zero-point
in this diagram corresponds to the minimum of each period; the
abscissae give the time before and after     viz. two and  it,
                                                           half years,          a
or  thirty months; the ordinates express the amount          spot-pro           of
duction   in numbers      of   an
                            arbitrary scale.    The two finely dotted
curves are intended      to
                       show the actual character     portion   two    of
                                                                       a             of
periods only, viz. those which had their minima         1823-2 and         in
1867:2; the strongly dotted curve, however, gives the mean                            of   all
periods (five) over which the investigation extends.

or the   average  duration   of an   ascent     is 37 years, that of a descent
7.4 years.
    (3) The character of     a single period may essentially differ from
                                                                   retarded

                               retarded
scent corresponds to a                           ascent. Thus the minimum
                           { accelerated
of 1844-0 behaved very normally, but that of 1856-2, and still more
that of 1823-2, shown in the above diagram, presents a retarded
ascent and descent; on the other hand, in the minimum of 1833:8,
and still more in that of 1867-2, also shown in the diagram, both
ascent and descent are accelerated.
    4. Finally, Professor Wolf arranged in the manner shown in the
following Table the successive minima and maxima, in order to arrive
at some generalization which might enable him to foretell the general
character and length of a future period. Taking the absolute differ
ences in time of every two successive maxima, and the mean differ
ences of every two alternating minima, he shows that the greatest
acceleration of both maximum and minimum happens together. This
result strengthens our own conclusions, to be immediately stated,
by new evidence, as it is derived from observations antecedent to the
time over which our researches extend.

    From this Professor Wolf predicts for the present period

                                                                            hº a ver
 not be overlooked, in judging of the agreement or discrepancy of
 these two independently obtained sets, that our facts have been de
 rived from the actual measurement and subsequent calculation of the
 spotted area from day to day since 1833 recorded by Schwabe,
 Carrington, and the Kew solar photograms, which measurements
 are expressed as millionths of the sun's visible hemisphere, while the
 conclusions of M. Wolf are founded on certain “relative numbers,”
 which give the amount of observed spots on an arbitrary scale, chiefly
 designed to make observations made at different times and by various

      The agreement of these ratios with each other, and the small                                                        dif
   ferences from the mean of the single ratios, justify us in the mean
   time, until a greater number of periods are before us, to state the
   connexion between the two branches of the periodic curve from one
   minimum to another in the following more precise terms:—
          If T be the
                  time of duration of sun-spot increase from a minimum
   to a  marimum,    then 2:15 x T (with a probable error of less than
   +0.05) will be the duration of the sun-spot decrease until the neart
   minimum.
      This law, together with the fact which we have previously esta
   blished, that a longer period shows generally a depressed curve,
   while a shorter is characterized by great peaks, points strongly to
   the conclusion that the energy of the ultimate causes of sun-spot
   production, whether these causes be intrasolar or extrasolar, is for
   every period constant.

from which the numbers in col. II. of the                              following Tables were           cal
culated.
   The method adopted in reducing the                                  observations      was     this:—
Each single set of readings was arranged    in a vertical column, and
the whole series placed side by side with  corresponding numbers in
the same horizontal line; the means of     the horizontal lines were
formed into a similar column, and divided  into groups, each consist
ing of four consecutive numbers, and the means of these groups
form the numbers in col. I. of the Tables.
     Col.    contains the differences of the temperatures of the junc
            II.
tions at intervals of four minutes, corresponding to the mean deflec
tions in col. I.
    Col. III. contains the common logarithms of the numbers in col. II.
    Col. IV. contains the differences of the successive numbers in col.
III.  divided by 4.
    Col. W. is formed from col. IV., by multiplying by the Napierian
logarithm of 10, and is the rate at which the difference of tem
perature varies per minute.
    Col. VI. shows the quantity of heat emitted from the ball in
gramme-water units per square centimetre per second per degree of
difference of temperatures, and is formed by multiplying the numbers
in col. V. by 009385*, a constant depending on the surface of the
 ball and     its
               capacity for heat.
   The numbers found         cols. VI. and VII. were plotted
                                     in                               squared               on

mental labour in calculating, we cannot be surprised on finding that
such contrivances, however perfect, should be suspiciously regarded,
and that their adoption should be somewhat slow.
   The abacus, which is supposed to be the invention of Pythagoras,
is probably the earliest recorded contrivance for calculating ; and,
with a trifling modification, the Romans are found to have adopted
it.   The schwan-pan         the Chinese may probably claim

     The inventions of Mr. Babbage may be regarded rather as stu
pendous exercises of ingenuity than of ordinary practical utility.
     The Swiss machine of Schultz, which is regarded as a completed
idea of Mr. Babbage's original plan, has the disadvantages of great
costliness and requiring skilled mechanical manipulation.
     The arithmometer of M. Thomas de Colmar, with the exception
of being extensively used by actuaries, is comparatively unknown,
although            its
                  first appearance dates nearly forty years back.

So far as I now know, the swiftest motion that has been given to a
disk was that in Foucault's apparatus for showing the motion of the
earth, which he estimated at from 150 to 200 revolutions per second.
Such a velocity would be recorded by from two to three undulations
of a C fork, making 512 vibrations per second. If it would not be
best to smoke the disk, a piece of white paper can be pasted upon it
and smoked without burning; and it answers every purpose. To the
certainty and ease of this method may be added another advantage,
that the slightest touch needed for this cannot sensibly retard the
motion of the disk, as any mechanical fixture attached for such a
purpose must do. —Silliman's American Journal for April 1872.
PRELIMINARY NOTE ON A REMARKABLE FACT OBSERVED ON THE
  CONTACT OF CERTAIN LIQUIDS OF VERY DIFFERENT SUPERFI
  CIAL TENSIONS. BY G. WAN DER MENSBRUGGHE.
    Whenever a liquid of strong superficial tension, containing gases in
 solution, is brought into contact with a liquid offeeble tension, there is
 a more or less pronounced disengagement of the gases dissolved in the
former liquid.
    This principle, which I publish now to secure date, intending,
 however, to verify it in detail in a special memoir, can be demon
 strated by a great number of experiments.        Provisionally I will only
 mention a few.                                                                                    -
    I. When a drop of alcohol or ether is introduced into distilled
 water half filling a phial of 3 or 4 centims. diameter and the liquid
 agitated, a brisk effervescence ensues.      This experiment was long
 since described by M. Duprez”, but without explanation.          It is im
 possible to attribute the effervescence to air introduced by the agita
 tion, since neither alcohol or ether alone nor water alone gives in
  this respect any marked result.
    The experiment succeeds equally well with benzole, sulphide of
 carbon, creosote,      oilturpentine, olive, lavender, linseed,
                              of                                       colza          or

ing traces of any fatty substance whatever, to see a distinct produc
tion of minute gas-bubbles.
   If the phial containing the distilled water is not perfectly cleared
of every fatty or etherial matter, numerous gas-bubbles soon form at
the parts of the inner surface to which that matter is attached.
   II. A drop of oil spreading on the surface of distilled water pro
duces a disengagement of little gas-bubbles readily observed with a
microscope; this disengagement I believe to be the true cause of the
formation of what Mr. Tomlinson terms cohesion-figures—that is to
say, of the division of the spread film into an infinity of parts con
stituting at first a sort of network, and decomposing, little by little.
into lenticles of less and less dimensions, until, the gaseous disen
gagement ceasing, the minute lenticles remain indefinitely.                         With

evidently due        innumerable minute gas-bubbles disengaged beneath

 This inference agrees with                                   conclusion drawn the Astronomer        by
 Royal from discussions                                      the Greenwich Magnetical Observa

                             Theory        of Magnetism.                           405
tions made in 1848–1857, and in 1858–1863. In the volume for
 1867, p. ccxiv, he says, “We are justified in stating that there
is no certain evidence for Annual Inequality.”   The same result
is arrived at with respect to the Horizontal Force.   The annual
inequalities deduced from the theory in ‘The Principles of Phy
sics’ (pp. 657–660) were obtained by employing the argument
which is shown above to be untenable.
    It is true, however, that General Sir E. Sabine has deduced
very small annual inequalities of Dip, Total Force, and Declina
tion by discussions of observations taken at Kew, Toronto, Ho
barton, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope (see Phil. Trans.
for 1863, p. 307).      But it is possible that these may be due to
a  cause,  distinct from the earth’s motions, which is adverted to
in art. 36 of the communication on magnetic force in the Philo
sophical Magazine for February 1861, and will be more fully
treated of in the sequel of the present communication.
    7. It remains, therefore, to determine by what means the
streams to which the theory ascribes the magnetism of a steel
magnet are generated, the magnet being either a straight bar or
in the form of a horseshoe.      This question                   I
                                                  shall endeavour to
answer by taking account of the theories of atomic repulsion, and
molecular attraction proposed in the Numbers of the Philoso
phical Magazine for March and November 1859 and February
1860, and in ‘The Principles of Physics’ (pp. 459–464).           For
this purpose the following general hydrodynamical theorem,
which, as far as   I  am aware, has not hitherto been recognized,
 will be made use of:—Whenever the lines of motion in a given
fluid element are normals to a continuous surface, so that the
element is changing form by reason of the motion, the function
ude +vdy-H was is an exact differential.      In proof of this theo
rem it seems sufficient to   say that the  change  of form of a given
element   in consequence of convergency or divergency of the
lines of motion is a distinctive property of a fluid, whereby                           its
motion    isseparated from that        solid, and that the integra

overcoming   in any sensible degree the inertia of the circumja
cent fluid; while the impulses in the direction of the increase of
density have the effect of causing a stream to flow out of the parts
near the denser end in courses which, by reason of the inertia of
the fluid beyond, are at first made divergent, and eventually are
turned completely backward: these return-currents are then op
posed by the inertia of the fluid beyond the other end of the
magnet, and are made to converge towards that end in such
manner as to fulfil by the easiest courses the necessary condition
of motion in circuits. According to this view the courses are
determined by a law of least action. (See a mathematical theory
of this kind of motion in the Philosophical Magazine for July
1869.)
   12. Like considerations are applicable if the magnet has a
form different from that of a straight bar; for instance, if it has
the form of a horseshoe.       In this case, as the two ends are
brought near each other, the mean course of least resistance is
along the axis of the magnet, and the stream passes out of one
end immediately into the other.         Also the tendency of the
stream to escape from the curved part of the magnet by reason
of centrifugal force is still opposed by the inertia of the external
fluid.  In order to make the insulation of the current more
complete, that part is usually covered with sealing-wax, this
substance not having the property of easily conducting aetherial
streams.
    The same hydrodynamical principles account for the flow of a
galvanic current through conducting substances of very irregular
forms. In consequence of the resistance to emergence arising
 from the inertia of the surrounding aether, the currents are con
 fined within the boundaries of the conductors just as a stream
 of water is confined within channels, such as rigid pipes, or ves
 sels of any form through which it is compelled to flow.      Only,
 in the case of the galvanic  current,  the condition of a complete
 circuit is required to be fulfilled in order that the flowing may
take place.
    13. It might be urged as an objection to the foregoing rea
soning, that if an unlimited mass of elastic fluid, such as the
 aether is conceived to be, were to receive, within certain limits of
 distance from a centre, impulses directed from the centre and
equal in  all directions, the effect of these impulses would not    be
neutralized     byreaction from the inertia     the surrounding fluid.

dynamical    principles  whichI   proposed  long   since, and have re
peatedly insisted upon, although they have not hitherto received
general recognition.   I     have pointed out that when     an  elastic
fluid receives impulses equally    in     all
                                            directions from a  centre,

either at a given distance during a limited interval of time, or at
a given instant through a limited space, the subsequent motion
cannot be a solitary wave of condensation or of rarefaction; for
in such case the condensation would vary inversely as the square
of the distance from the centre, whereas the mathematical solu
tion of the problem shows that it varies simply as the inverse of
the distance.   To meet this difficulty I now adhere to the argu
ments       I adduced in an article in the Philosophical Magazine for
January 1859, and in paragraph 10 of an article in the Philoso
phical Magazine for June 1862, although subsequently I adopted
a different view.       According to those arguments the law of the
simple inverse of the distance holds good only in case the dis
turbance gives rise both to condensation and rarefaction and the
resulting motion is consequently vibratory. It must therefore
be admitted that, whether the original impulses are vibratory or
not, alternations of condensation and rarefaction are actually
produced; and it seems evident that this effect must be attri
buted to the obstacle opposed to the impulsive action by the
inertia of the surrounding mass of fluid. This explanation                                                     is,

certain effects of motions of the air—for instance, the sounds of
recognizable pitch resulting from the mutual collision of aerial
streams, or from the diversion given to such streams by encoun
tering solid obstacles, are explainable on the same principles.
    15.  I take occasion here to remark that the generation and
propagation at the surface of water of a series of circular waves
in forms which appear to be independent of the mode of dis
                                                   I
turbance, or shape of the disturbing body, are, think, referable
to dynamical reasons analogous to those adduced above. Also
the series of small waves which are seen to precede a cylindrical
rod when it is held vertically and moved horizontally through
water in which it is partly dipped, may be similarly accounted
for.    (These “ripples,” together with the broader waves which
follow the rod under the same circumstances, are described and
 discussed by Professor W. Thomson in an article in the Philo
 sophical Magazine for November 1871.) Supposing the fluid
to be one of perfect fluidity, the foregoing argument, which is
based on that supposition, leads to the conclusion that the gene
ration of the ripples may be ascribed to the obstacle opposed to
the motion of the rod by the inert mass of fluid in front, and
that the waves behind are broader than those before by reason
of the reluctance with which the mass behind, on account of its
inertia, follows the rod.
    16. The motions which have been thus far considered are all
such that each element of the fluid is at each instant changing
its form, and the lines of motion are normals to continuous sur
faces, so that uda + vily--wdz is always and everywhere an exact
 differential. This may be true even supposing the motion to be
in directions perpendicular to a given plane, because, as I have
indicated above, the rectilinear motion may be composite, in which
case the change of form of the fluid elements takes place with
respect to each of the component motions. There are, however,
cases of the motion of a fluid in which each element maintains
always the same form, either because the whole mass moves or
rotates as if it were solid, or consists of an unlimited number of
parts which individually so move. Such motions are distinguished
by the analytical circumstance that for them uda + way + waz is
integrable by a factor.     To prove this is the object of the fol
lowing argument, in which, for the sake of brevity, the fluid is
supposed to be incompressible.
    17. For proving a proposition of this kind it is necessary to
employ the general equations of hydrodynamics, in order that
the reasoning may depend on the fundamental principles which
these equations express.      I shall therefore begin by drawing
an inference from that which     I call the equation of continuity,
namely:—

These results give the means of defining exactly the character
of the motion. According to the principle of easy divisibility,
we may conceive the fluid to be divided into an unlimited num
ber of infinitely thin cylindrical shells having the axis of 2 for
their common axis; and if F(r) be the rotatory velocity of a
given shell at the distance r from the axis, then will f(r), or
tºº, be the         velocity of the same shell parallel to the axis.                                       Con
sequently the motion of any given point of the shell will be in a
spiral. The form and position of the spiral may be inferred
from the above equation of the surfaces of displacement when
the values of the constants b and c are given.    The spiral is
left-handed or right-handed according to the sign of b.
   25. We have still to determine the dynamical conditions of
this motion. From what has been proved, the components of
the velocity have the following values:

ment of the atoms or molecules of the conducting substance.
On these points it will now be proper to make some remarks.
  Galvanic currents may be conceived to be generated in the
same manner as magnetic, so far as regards the condition of a
gradation of atomic density, the gradation being in their case
produced and maintained by chemical action in such manner as
to exist permanently in the neighbourhood of the surfaces of
contact of the substances between which the action takes place.
The currents thus generated must, from what has already been
argued, fulfil the condition of flowing in a complete circuit in
order that they may be permanent; for which reason it is neces
sary to connect the poles of a galvanic battery by some material
 (ascopper wire) capable,        respect both        form and quality,
                                                     in                             to                                         of
conducting galvanic currents. But from the foregoing mathe
matical argument       may                            be
                                  inferred that currents         conducted                               so
can  proceed   only    spiral       in it
                              courses.      Now,    supposing   the course
to     be this kind,
            of          appears from experiment that the turn                                                                  of

                           Theory    of Magnetism.               419
ence   of the horizontal terrestrial current with a vertical galvanic
current produces an action on the rheophore tending westward
or eastward according as the vertical current is ascending or de
scending.   Now on the hypotheses that the earth’s current is
southward, and the galvanic current in the direction from the
zinc terminal to the copper terminal, these facts are explainable
only on the supposition that the spiral motion is deatrorsum, that
term being taken in the scrise defined in art. 27.      For under
these circumstances the magnetic current and the circular part
of an ascending current are opposed to each other on the east
side of the wire and concur on the west side, and consequently,
by the hydrodynamics of steady motion, the result is an excess
of pressure westward; and similarly, the magnetic current and
the circular part of a descending galvanic current are opposed on
the west side of the wire and concur on the east side, and the
consequent action is eastward.      These inferences agree with the
experimental facts; and accordingly this argument is decisive as
to the direction of the spiral motion on the above hypotheses
respecting the directions of the currents.
    33. Supposing, in accordance with this conclusion, that the
spiral motion is always dextrorsum, we may proceed next to ac
count for the results of Oersted’s experiment on the same hypo
theses.    The horizontal component of the earth’s current flowing
southward, it will follow that the end into which the proper
streams of a magnet flow in converging courses is that which,
when the magnet is suspended horizontally, points northward;
for it is under these conditions that the terrestrial current gives
that end a northward direction, as may be thus shown. Con
ceive the north end to deviate from the magnetic meridian
through a certain angle westward, and let the earth’s current
and the above-mentioned        converging streams be both resolved
perpendicularly to the axis of the needle.         Then the resolved
parts will be in opposite directions on the west side of the north
end, and in the same direction on the east side, and thus the
north end will be driven eastward.       Similarly, since the needle's
streams are divergent from the south end, this end will be driven
westward.      Just the opposite effects would take place if the de
viation of the north end were castward.        Accordingly the needle
 is in a position of stable equilibrium when it points northward
 and the marked end is in the magnetic meridian.           This theory
 accounts for the directive action of the earth's   magnetism.
    34. Now     let a galvanic current        be
                                            caused     pass from south
                                                        to
to   north  along   aconducting-wire   placed  over the needle in  the
  magnetic meridian,       as   in

planations Ihave proposed respecting certain phenomenaof Terres
trial Magnetism. At the end of the article“On Atmospheric Tides”
in the Number of the Philosophical Magazine for January 1872,
I   have intimated my abandonment of the hypothesis that the
lunar-diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism is attributable
to gradations of density of the atmosphere produced by the moon’s
gravitational attraction.       Having in that article succeeded in sol
ving with sufficient generality the problem of the disturbance of
                                          I
the atmosphere by the moon, found that neither the law nor the
amount of the gradation of density due to the moon’s attraction
could account for the facts of the lunar-diurnal variation.              Being
thus compelled to seek for another explanation,                         I
                                                             reconsidered the
views advanced in      my  first  essay   towards a    theory   of magnetism
published in the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for
 January and February 1861, and have come to the conclusion that
 the gyratory motions of the aether there attributed to the rotations
 of the bodies of the sun, moon, and planets about axes are strictly
 deduced from the physical principles on which the theory is
 founded, and must accordingly be regarded as necessary conse
 quences of the hypotheses of the theory. In fact                       do not              I
                I
 think that could say on this part of the subject any thing dif
 ferent from what is said in arts. 27–30 contained in the February
  Number, which, after giving this reference, consider it unneces  I
 cessary to reproduce here.

   43. Accordingly the moon, since it completes relatively to the
aether at rest arevolution about its axis in a month, will gene
rate gyrations, the effect of which might possibly extend to the
earth, and be perceived as a very small variation of terrestrial
magnetism. But as these gyrations are in the direction of the
moon’s revolution about her axis, it will be found on trial that
the disturbances of the magnetic needle which they produce are
not in accordance with the observed law of the lunar-diurnal
variation of magnetism.     When, however, the effect of the dis
turbance of the                       orbital motion is considered,
                            aether by the moon’s
it will be seen that as the impressed  motion is tangential to the
orbit and contrary in direction to that of the moon’s motion, the
generated circulating motion that reaches the earth will be from
the right hand to the left of a spectator on the earth looking
towards the moon, and therefore in the direction opposite to that
of gyrations resulting from the moon’s rotation about her axis.
Also their effect, it may be presumed, would be much greater
than that of these gyrations. Now the circulating streams pro
duced as above stated by the moon’s orbital motion would dis
turb the magnetic needle in a manner conformable with the law
of the lunar-diurnal variation ascertained by observation.        For
when the magnet is on the meridian and under the moon, these
streams, flowing eastward, would oppose the needle's entering
streams at           its
               north end      the east side, and the issuing streams
                                             on
at   its
      south end                 on
                      the west side,       that                     so
                                                     both actions the             by
western declination would be increased.         The variation of the
declination     any other position

 night-time; and this anticipation is confirmed by observation.
 But besides the magnetic variations due to changes of the tem
 perature and density of the atmosphere, we may suppose that
 effects are produced by solar gyrations analogous to those attri
 buted above to lunar gyrations. This cause might modify the
 epoch of day-maximum (which, as observation shows, does not
 occur at the hottest time of the day), and might also account for
 what has been called the nocturnal episode.    As to the reality of
 the solar gyrations,  I consider that we have ocular evidence in
 the phenomenon of the zodiacal light; for, according to the ar
 gument maintained in arts. 13 and 14, the rays which render
 the zodiacal light visible might originate in a collision between
 the gyratory motion and vibrations of different orders propagated
 from the sun, without      being necessary     its
                                               suppose that matter              to

 light extends beyond the radius      the earth's orbit               of                               (see      an

                              I
ing earth-currents which have expressed in a note in p. 653 of
my work on the ‘Principles of Physics.”       Since the note was
written     I
            have learnt from the Greenwich Observations that
magnets and the galvanometers employed as indicators of earth
currents are simultaneously affected only by large magnetic dis
turbances, and that generally no correspondences exist between
small magnetic variations and the indications of the galvanome
ters.   It does not appear, therefore, that earth-currents and
terrestrial magnetism have any special relation to each other,
the effect of the large magnetic disturbances on the earth-current
being only an instance of the ordinary mutual action between a
galvanic current and a magnetic current.
   Having completed this review of the hydrodynamical theory
of magnetism,      Ithink I may say that it is now supported by
arguments which should command the attention of physicists.
Considering the number and variety of the explanations of phe
nomena it gives, which in fact might have been much ex
tended, I do not see how the inference that the facts of mag
netism are referable to hydrodynamical laws can be resisted.

                LII.   On the Moon seen by the naked Eye.
                        By SAMUEL SHARPE, Esq.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
I
      GENTLEMEN,
     SHOULD like   to be allowed to lay the following conjectures
     before your readers.    The opinions may not be true, and
may not be new ; but if new they seem worth consideration.
  1st. As to the moon’s atmosphere.
  On looking at the new moon, when about two days old, with
the naked eye on a clear evening, we see, first, the thin crescent,
being that portion of the moon which enjoys sunshine; then the
larger portion, nearly circular, dimly lightened up by earthshine.
But the edge of the moon which is furthest from the bright
crescent is also slightly illuminated.     Now this portion of the
moon seems to be in the    twilight, illuminated by the sun's rays
reflected from     its
                  own  possible  atmosphere.   Though astronomers
have not detected such        an
                            atmosphere      by   an

Dissected  (Structural) Formulae,” in which he attempts to prove
that “the conceptions involved in the atomic hypothesis are
both unnecessary and insufficient.” The following remarks are
intended to show that whenever the author has the choice of
two ideas, he invariably selects the one in accordance with the
atomic theory, thus himself refuting the assertion that it is un
necessary.    The answer to the argument of insufficiency is that
the theory is a growing one, not one which has reached        limit;                                    its

430               Mr. R. W. Atkinson’s Examination of the
numbers.     Hence it follows that in adopting two volumes as the
unit of volume for compound vapours, which depends upon this
assumption, he also makes use of atomic ideas; and upon this,
again, he founds his definition of “combining numbers.”
   Dr. Wright refers to the law of multiple proportions as one
of the facts of chemistry. Experiment, however, does not lead
to numbers which are multiples of his “combining numbers.”
Thus, referring again to Roscoe's researches on the tungsten
compounds, there are four chlorides described; and analysis
shows that          for
                100 parts    the metal they contain the following

   Would it not seem that the numbers in the fourth column
are too variable to serve as a foundation for the determination of
“combining numbers?” It is true that Dr. Wright would ex
cept oxygen and chlorine from this list on account of difference
of physical condition; but what about the other numbers, which
vary from 1:76 to 12.74%     Examples are not needed to show the
fallacy of relying upon this fact alone for the determination of
atomic weights;               its
                     use consists    deciding between equivalent

   The relation in this case can be inferred thus: the series which
multiplies the factor in P consists of a finite portion including
the first i+1 terms; after this point the terms vanish, owing to
the presence of the factor n–2i–1 in the numerator, until the
same factor makes               its

440         Mr. R. Moon                   on the mode         in which Stringed Instruments
   We can conceive the condensed wave extending itself horizon
tally beyond the limits of the cylinder of which we have spoken,
and then descending outside the cylinder below the level of the
sounding-board; but we shall have contemporaneously a corre
sponding horizontal extension of the rarefied wave, which must
have the same faculty of extending itself upwards that the con
densed wave has of extending downwards.
  What will ensue upon the meeting of these two opposite                                                     dis
turbances?
    One consequence of their meeting clearly will be that the
 density in the plane of the sounding-board will be that of equi
 librium; so that in every direction in this plane we shall have
an entire absence of that alteration of density which, according to
the received theory of sound, is the sole agent in the creation
and transmission of aerial vibrations*,            Hence, on the principles
of that theory, the tones of the instrument might be expected to
                            it all
be inaudible at         points       the plane       the sounding-board— of

IN nical Theory
          to    “Contribution to the
                of Heat”    Mr. Tait t has
                                        +,               the matter     given
a turn which to me is agreeable.      For he therein contests not
the priority of my investigations, but their correctness; so that
it is now no longer a question of historic and personal explana
tions, but of scientific elucidations, which, on account of the
importance of the subject to which they relate, may perhaps not
be without a more general interest.                            I
                                            will therefore take no
notice of the somewhat irritated tone of the reply, and only take
into consideration the matter it contains.            -
   As already mentioned in my previous article, the axiom em
ployed by me for the demonstration of Carnot's theorem modified,
viz. that heat cannot pass by itself from a colder into a hotter body,
was immediately acknowledged as correct by Sir W. Thomson,
and since then has likewise been made use of by many other
authors for the same demonstration. Mr. Tait, on the contrary,
now declares it to be fallacious.
   Of the two phenomena adduced by him for the refutation of
the proposition,       I
                     will first discuss that of which he says that it
gives an “excellent instance of the fallacy of the so-called
awiom *—namely, the phenomenon that a thermoelectric battery
worked with ice and boiling water is capable of raising a fine wire

   In one of my memoirs Š, I have                applied the mecha
nical theory of heat to thermoelectrical phenomena.            therein               I
showed that a thermoelectric         element (and so, of course, a
thermoelectrical    battery) may be compared to a steam-engine,
the heated    junction   corresponding to the boiler, and the cold
junction to the condenser.        At the hot junction heat is with
 drawn from a heat-reservoir, the temperature of which we will
 name t1; and at the cold junction heat is given up to another
 heat-reservoir, the temperature of which may be called            But                   to.

                                            is
 received; and hence the quantity          heat given up
                                                      of      the unit             in

cyclical processes, there are two sorts      changes which may            of
serve for compensation, namely:-first, the passage      heat from                                     of
                colder body; and, secondly, the consumption

work into heat.
    If now from this point       view               of

believe they already make manifest that the introduction of this
idea was dictated by the nature of the subject.
   In conclusion,                     I
                    will take the liberty to state again expressly
the  points to which Mr. Tait objects, in order to prevent any
subsequent shifting of the position.    Mr. Tait maintains:—
   (1) That the theorem, that heat cannot by itself pass from a
colder into a hotter body, is fallacious; and
   (2) That the introduction of the notions of internal work and
of disgregation was detrimental to science.
   The decision on these two points, so far as they are at     still                                              all
doubtful,     thinkI  may confidently leave
                                     I            the future; and                      to
thereby this controversy also will finally and fully decide itself.

only give in proof of this the facts which Lamont describes in
his often-cited work (p. 277) in the following words:—
   “Kreil has given many cases where magnetic disturbances coin
cided with earthquakes; hence he thinks a connexion between the
two phenomena probable.                    I
                                have observed myself an extremely
curious case in this respect.    On the 18th of April 1842, at 10
minutes   past 9 o'clock in the morning,  I saw by chance that the
needle of the declination-instrument received a sudden jerk, so
that the scale was pushed out of the field of view of the telescope.
The oscillations continued for some time; at last the ordinary
tranquillity was restored.
                                     I
    “After some days received the news from Colla, in Parma,
that he had observed violent oscillations of the needle; and
comparison showed that the movement had begun at the same
moment in Parma as in Munich.           A short time afterwards
 the report of a French engineer was published on a vio
lent earthquake which he had observed in Greece; and now it
 was found that the earthquake had taken place in the same
 minute in which the oscillations of the needle had been observed
 in Parma and Munich. This, together with the many cases col
 lected by Kreil and Colla, leaves scarcely any doubt as to the
 presence of a closer connexion; but it is undecided whether one
 phenomenon is the consequence of the other, or whether they
 come both from the same source.”
    The same connexion between earthquakes and magnetic dis
turbances was observed by Lamont at the earthquake which took
place in Greece in December 1861.           He communicates his ob
servations to Poggendorff’s Annalen (vol. cxv. p. 176) in the
following words:—
    “As the connexion of the magnetism of the earth with earth
quakes still belongs to the insufficiently ascertained relations, it
                                               I
will not appear irrelevant if communicate a fact bearing upon
this question.     On the 26th of December, 1861, at 8 o’clock A.M.,
when        I
            took down the position of the magnetical instruments
 (six of which are put up in the magnetical observatory, viz. two
for declination, two for intensity, and two for dip), I observed
 in   all the instruments         uncommon restlessness, consisting
                                          an

 violence.    Some days later the news was received         earthquake     of   an
 which, exactly coincident with the above observation, had caused

an earth-current, which in the above case was so far confirmed,

earth-currents showed at that time unusual activity.”

450        M. F. Zöllner on the Origin of the Earth's Magnetism,
  Let us recall to our minds the kind of effects which could be
produced  in the earth by such an induction. They are two
fold,     viz.:-
   1. Mechanical effects, by changes                  in the velocity of the glow
ing streams in the earth.
   2. Magnetical or electrical effects, necessarily connected by our
theory with these mechanical changes.
   As to the first of these two influences, it is clear that, if the
origin of terrestrial magnetism is really to be sought in the glow
ing streams and the electrical currents necessarily produced by
them, any increase or decrease in the magnetism by induction
must produce an increase or decrease
                                  -
                                            in the velocity of these
glowing streams.
   It has already been shown above how the magnitude of the
disturbing influences must vary with the magnitude of velocity
of these streams, and how, therefore, at the time of the greatest
magnetic induction a maximum of earthquakes, of magnetic dis
turbances, and of aurorae boreales must take place, which latter
are produced by electrical induction in the rarefied regions of
our atmosphere.
   Theoretically, changes in the temperature of the earth must
accompany these phenomena which manifest themselves on the
earth’s surface.    For, as we have already remarked (p. 349),
the increase or decrease in the vis viva of the streams can, ac
cording to the principles of the conservation of energy, only
take place if an equivalent amount of vis viva disappears in an
other part of the system.    Any large and not wholly solidified
heavenly body presents us, besides                     its
                                         translatory and rotatory
motion,         its
             store         of
                      energy    two forms:–
                                      in
     1.    In
           the form          of
                       heat, which    continually diminishing by
                                                 is
radiation.

                        mechanical motion     the currents     its

liquid and gaseous constituents.
  If            of
            these two forms
          one                 energy      of
                                        increased         is                   or   diminished
without exterior communication       viva,      of

pense      of
        the other.
     If,                   by
                   magnetical induction the velocity
           therefore,                                  motion                   of             is
increased,    must

  Such     physical cause, which, according to our theory, must
               a
necessarily  change periodically the magnetic condition of the
sun, is really present;                     I
                          mean the periodically changing quantity
of sun-spots.
  In   my discussion of the law of rotation of the sun and that
of the large planets*, I have shown theoretically that the presence
of sun-spots on the sun's surface must generate essential but
regular modifications of the law of rotation. These modifica
tions have been proved to exist by the observations of Spörer;
so that        I
           have succeeded in giving for the modified law a theo
retical formula which represents more accurately the observed
states than the empirical formula of Spörer.
   The essential character of the law of rotation changed at the
time of sun-spot maximum, and the causes which produce the
alterations, were explained by me (l.c. p. 82) in the following
words:–
   “At the time of the sun-spot maximum the polar currents are
considerably retarded in consequence of the increased friction;
these currents will therefore arrive at the equator with a much
smaller velocity than they do at the time of a sun-spot minimum.
Hence at the times of sun-spot maxima the accelerating effect
of the deeper strata of the sun's surface must be much larger
than at the time of a minimum; and for this reason the observed
velocity of rotation at the equator must be greatest at the time
of a maximum—just as is shown by Spörer’s observations.”
   P. 85. “As we have seen,      the observations         all
                                                     Spörer can                     of              be
much better represented                          by
                                the above theoretical formula than
by  his own   empirical  formula.    Excluding the observations for
the immediate     neighbourhood       the equator, the sum      of the                         of
least squares      errors for Spörer's formula

44-8,     or
         little more than half      the value for Spörer's formula.

   “The derived    theory    the law     rotation, even near the time
                                                of                   of
of   a maximum        sun-spots, has therefore been confirmed
                                 of                                                                 by
Spörer’s observations; and the above formula will therefore

                                                    16.
   Inorder to allow the reader to use his own judgment as to
how far the phenomena flowing theoretically from a periodic
change in the sun's magnetism agree with the facts observed on
the earth's surface,                 I
                       shall take the liberty to communicate
simply the characteristic passages of the original papers.
   The presence of a periodical decrease and increase in the
magnitude of the daily variations of the magnetic needle was
stated by Lamont already in 1845*.         In the year 1851 the
same philosopher published a papert in which he deduced a time
of 10 years for the duration of this period. At the same time
Sabinei was engaged in a research and comparison of the dis
turbances of declination in Toronto and Hobarton for the five
years 1843–1848, and remarked that during this period the
magnitude and frequency of the disturbances increased from year
to Wear.
      Snie arrived    also at the assumption of a period in the mag
nitude of these disturbances, and, passing to the consideration
of a possible cause (l.c. p. 121), says:—
    “As the sun must be recognized as at least the primary source
of      all
       magnetic variations which conform                      local hours,                   of
                                                                         of to

it seems not unreasonable that          the case    other variations also,

magnetism; and the former gentleman has since succeeded, with
great zeal and trouble, in establishing this relation as an un
doubted       fact.
   In proof of this assertion I cite some passages from a paper
of Wolf, “On the Eleven-years period of the Sun-spots and
Magnetical Wariations”*:—
   “When           I
                 showed, in the year 1852, that there exists, a
period of 11 years in the frequency of sun-spots which could be
followed backward as far as the discovery of sun-spots, had,                                         I
besides the series of Hofrath Schwabe, which already then ex
tended over twenty-six years, nothing at my disposal but a
certain number of short series of observations and separate state
ments; the proof therefore only layin the two facts, that Schwabe's
series showed such a period, and that the assumption              of a
period extending over 11 years was not contradicted by any
of the statements found.          Now it is otherwise.        The dis
covery of observations made by Staudacher, Flangergues, Tevel,
Adams, &c. renders it possible to me to express by relative
numbers the mean frequency of sun-spots for a series of 112
years as found from 20,000 observations.          I give these numbers
in full, adding, as              far
                              space permits, the mean yearly varia
                                       as

                      in

     It
     has been shown (§ 15) that the position of the sun’s axis
with respect to the plane of the ecliptic causes theoretically a
stronger magnetic induction near the two days of the year during
which the earth is most exposed to the inductive action of one of
the sun's poles, leaving out of consideration the influence which
the inclination of the earth's axis must have on this induction.
It is therefore supposed that on these two days the radius vector
of the earth        is,   as
                      the time    the equinoxes, perpendicular

   Here also, therefore, the maxima are in the same two months.
We must, however, bear in mind that, in consequence of the
great changes of the radius vector of the earth in these months,
the secondary inductive actions between sun and earth must
also have then a maximum, so that only by this, without regard
to any influence of the position of the sun’s axis, the magnetic
induction would be increased in these two months.
   So, for instance, in the year 1870 the greatest velocity with
which the earth was going away from the sun was between the
24th and 26th of March, 498'l metres a second. The maximum
value for        its
              approach, between the 1st and 3rd       October, was                             of
502.4 metres      second.

ever, only considered those causes of changes in the streams of
the solar surface which are produced by the periodical number
of sun-spots.    Let us now see whether we can find other pro
cesses on the sun, of a more accidental and local nature, which,
similar to earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, could mechanically
produce sudden changes in the velocity of the glowing streams.
Just as the purely mechanical causes produce a disturbance in the
whole magnetic force of the earth, they must have, if sufficiently
intense, the same effect on the sun, and produce there changes
which in their turn may be accompanied by                                 all   the phenomena

he  looked   the photographical records made there

          and the Magnetic Relations  of the Heavenly Bodies.       459
turbance, which, as far as he could judge, had taken place simul
taneously with the phenomenon observed in the sun's photo
sphere.       This, I think, is the first example of a connexion
between the physical changes in the photosphere and the mag
netic storms or disturbances indicated by me in the year 1852.”
     Since the application of the spectroscope with a wide slit to
the observation of the solar surface, and chiefly of the edges of
the sun's disk, we are able to convince ourselves directly of the
immense power of the eruptions; so that at the sight of these
phenomena the probability of a strong reaction on the liquid
surface and its currents is increased almost to conviction.
     Through a friendly communication from Professor C. A. Young,
 Dartmouth College, America, who is in possession of excellent
 spectroscopic instruments which he himself has much improved
by ingenious arrangements, I am in a position to illustrate here
 such an eruption by drawings and numerical measurements.
 The eruption referred to belongs probably to the most intense
 and powerful which have been registered during the short time
 of spectroscopic observations of the sun. The short description
 of the phenomenon with the drawings of the observer, as com
 municated by Professor Young to the “Boston Journal of Che
mistry,’ were sent to me while this paper was being printed.
      [As the description is given in the January Number of the
 Phil. Mag., it is not necessary to reproduce it here. Wide supra,
 pp. 76–79.]                              -
     It is to be seen from this      description   how great reactions
 take place on the solar surface, and how probable, according
 to my theory, the supposition is that such sudden appearances
 must generate magnetical changes in the sun which must re
 flect themselves, if sufficiently intense, in the magnetic condition
  of the earth *.
      If I  am allowed   to compare the character of the phenomena
 just described with terrestrial appearances, I may remind the
  reader of air- and water-spouts, where for a long time quiet
  ness and stability seem to reign, which suddenly collapse, be
  traying by mighty movements the former condition of whirl
  like movements in the inner masses. Indeed the five stems in
 fig.   1  recalled to my mind such phenomena.
                                    18.
     These facts will be sufficient for the present to show at least
  the probability of the existence of a connexion between the mag
  netic condition of the earth and sudden changes on the solar sur

     Inthis memoir the hourly observations            Toronto are divided        of
into several periods, and the lunar influence           deduced from each          is
of  these periods.      All the individual periods lead consistently
to  the following results:—
     1.The moon manifests its influence            the variation of all the in
magnetic elements;                          its

462        M. F. Zöllner             on the Origin         of the Earth's Magnetism,
minima (analogous to flux and reflux); the numbers deduced for
the different years show a remarkable consistency.      On the other
hand, Sabine proves that the movements at Kew correspond
exactly to those at Hobarton, with the exception that in the two
opposite hemispheres they are in the inverse direction; that is
to say, the north end of needle in the northern hemisphere moves
as the south end does in the southern hemisphere.         The differ
ence in the magnitude of the movement is easily explained if we
consider the difference in horizontal intensity at the two places.
In Kew this intensity is 37, and in Hobarton 4-5 (absolute
English units). Sabine does not make any supposition in order
to explain the difference in sign, but only remarks that “we may
assume either a direct influence, i. e. an attraction of the needle
by the moon, or an indirect influence, i. e. a magnetization of
the earth's nucleus by the moon: ” these are the words of La
mont referring to the contents of another paper by Sabine.
    The circumstance which is urged as not explained, that the
form of the magnetic influence is different in the two hemispheres,
is, according     my theory,
                       to          shown above,   physical necessity.

        and the Magnetic Relations of the Heavenly Bodies.            463
same time new laws of the solar-diurnal change have been esta
blished, which are deemed to be incompatible with the supposi
tion of a thermic agency.    There has been, accordingly, a ten
dency of late to recur to the hypothesis that the sun and moon
are themselves endued with magnetism, whether inherent or              in
duced ; and it is therefore of some importance to determine the
effects which such bodies would produce at the earth's surface,
and to compare them with those actually observed.
  “I   have endeavoured, in what follows, to solve this question on
the  assumption  that the supposed magnetism of these luminaries
is inherent.    The result will show the insufficiency of the hypo
thesis to explain the phenomena—and will therefore bring us one
step nearer to their explanation, by the removal of one of their
supposed causes.”
   The results of the analytical research which follows are summed
up by the author in the following words:—
   “From the foregoing we learn —
   “l.  That the effect of a distant magnetic body on each of the
three    elements   of the earth’s magnetic force consists of two
parts, one of which is constant throughout the day, while the
other varies with the hour-angle of the luminary.
   “2. Each of these parts varies inversely as the cube of the
distance of the magnetic body.
   “3. The variable part will give rise to a diurnal inequality,
having one maximum and one minimum in the day, and subject
to the condition
                         As + Arro- 0.
   “The third of these  laws does not hold, with respect either to
the solar or to the lunar-diurnal variation. Thus, in the solar
diurnal variation of the declination, the changes of position of
the magnet throughout the night are comparatively small, and
do not correspond, with change of sign only (as required by the
foregoing law), to those which take place at the homonymous
hours of the day.
   “The phenomena of the lunar-diurnal variation are even more
opposed to the foregoing law, the variation having two maxima
and two minima of nearly equal magnitude in the twenty-four
lunar hours, and      its
                     values    homonymous hours having for the
                                 at
most  part the same sign.   Hence the phenomena     the diurnal of
variation are not caused         by
                              the direct magnetic action    the       of
sun and moon.”

   In the discussion     this paper*, Lamont agrees perfectly
                            of
with these results, and concludes his account with the following
words:—
   “From this Mr. Lloyd          draws    justly the conclusion that the

daily variations of the earth’s magnetism cannot be accounted
for by a direct magnetic influence of sun and moon.”
      Ibelieve        I
                can show still clearer by the following the in
sufficiency of the supposition of a direct magnetic influence of
sun and moon as the only cause of the action of these bodies.
   By whatever cause a heavenly body, as for instance the
sun, acquires magnetic polarity, we must think it probable,
according to the phenomena presented to us by earthly bodies,
that the potentials of the two opposite and separated magne
tisms are equally               If the sun possessed two magnetic

                                        course round the sun would

induction            of
                  the two poles would destroy each other.             At
these two days        the year the daily variation would disappear

                                direct magnetic induction. We have
here  supposed   that the two  magnetic    poles coincide with the geo
graphical poles.      But              if,   as

         south pole.    By this consideration, therefore, we obtain
 an empirical criterion for deciding the question whether the sun
exerts    appreciable magnetic induction upon the earth, and
               an
whether the daily variations are only produced           this induc                         by

  The two Plates which accompany the paper, and cannot here
be reproduced, show graphically the periodicity mentioned. To
the values of a dotted line constructed by  means of the mean
monthly values of declination Hornstein added the periodical
oscillation, and joined the points so found by a red line.     He
remarks as follows with reference to this line :—
   “In this way the red line was drawn, which (with unimportant
exceptions at the end of 1869) is in harmony with the real course
of the declination as far back as the beginning of 1869, or twenty
full rotations of the sun before the middle of 1870. This is a
confirmation of the supposition that through many rotations the
sun was in a state of quietness, in consequence of which, in spite
of great revolutions, the same part exerted always about the same
influence.”

468       M. F. Zöllner                on the        Origin of the Earth's Magnetism.
   Suppose we had a magnet at the mean distance of the earth
from the sun, the length of which was equal to the earth's diame
ter.   In the most favourable condition a mass able to be mag
netized on the sun's surface could only be Trºgir nearer to one
end of the needle than to the other.       The variation of this frac
tion  in consequence   of the sun's rotation could not be perceptible,
even without    regard  to the fact that  any  local magnetic pheno
menon on the sun must be        accompanied      by both magnetisms,
which would destroy each other in consequence of the small dif
ference in distance at which they are from the earth.
    The conditions will be found to be quite different if we con
 sider the sun itself to be a large magnet which, as it does not
 coincide with the axis of rotation, is subjected to a mutation, just
as the magnetic axis of the earth, in consequence of the rotation
 of the heavenly body. Supposing,               instance, the magnetic    for
 poles     the sun had heliographic latitudes
          of                                         70°, similar    that        of                      to

    “It is remarkable that in this place, where the unequal                                                in
fluence of land and water disappears, as the whole surround
ing parts form a nearly continuous cover of ice, the variation
exactly coincides with the course of the sun.  This would be an
important argument for the derivation of the magnetism from
the sun's rays.”
   The results of Lenzº point to a similar relation of a permanent
distribution of temperature on the surface of the earth to the
inner movement in the glowing liquid mass. The paper of Lenz
bearing on this question was published under the title of                                             “In
vestigation of an Irregular Distribution of the Earth’s Magnetism
in the northern portion of the Gulf of Finland.”

   In a report, Lamont says concerning the results of this re
search
   “The paper of Lenz, announced in the Berliner Berichten, 1860,
p. 654, on the local disturbances at the chtrance of the Gulf of
Finland, has now appeared, and contains exact information about
the instruments and methods of reduction, the immediate results
of observations, and the values calculated therefrom for the three
rectangular magnetic components.        The result is that we have
to consider the island of Jussar-oe a great natural magnet,
whose north pole is to the north-west and south pole to the
south-east.    By this hypothesis, however, the phenomena are
only explained in their general character; and if we go into
details, we shall find that the magnetism is irregularly distributed
over the island              itself; and the abnormal
                                                   distribution is not

versal force near the end. In going round the magnet there are six
maxima and six minima of force.
   The law of attraction of the core of a galvanic coil is not very dif
ferent from that of a magnet.
   The force produced by the core within the coil is very much
greater than that produced by the coil alone.            In some positions
of the small compass it is about forty times as great, and in some
about 170 times as great.
   The law of force at different parts of the coil differs greatly from
that at corresponding parts of the magnet or core.          In the coil it                                                is,

    Protobromide of iodine is a solid which may be obtained crystal
lized by sublimation.            At the ordinary temperature it emits a
vapour a slight thickness of which is of a copper-red colour, while
80 centims. thickness has a currant-red tint.              The absorption
spectrum of this vapour, of the same kind as those of iodine and
bromine, consists of very fine lines situated in the red, the yellow,
and the orange.          It differs from the effect observed when the light
is   passed   through      successive layers of the vapours of iodine and
bromine.
     Volatile organic matters can give, like the other vapours, ab
 sorption-spectra. Thus dry alizarine, heated with care, emits vapours
 which produce, in the middle region of the spectrum, systems of
 sensibly equidistant lines.—Comptes Rendus de l'Acad, des Sciences,

     DEMAGNETIZATION            OF   ELECTROMAGNETS.       BY ROBERT     W.
                    WILLSON,     JUNIOR CLASS, HARV. COLL.
     Wiedemann has         shown (Pogg. Ann. vol. c. p. 235, Ann.    de Min.
 (3) vol.   1. p.    189) that the intensity of the current necessary to
 demagnetize a steel magnet is much less than that of the current
 by which the bar was originally magnetized.
     It has occurred to me to experiment with a view to ascertaining
 how far this principle can be applied to electromagnets.
     The apparatus used consisted of a cylindrical bar of soft iron
  8 centims. in length and 1 centim. in diameter, slightly rounded at
  the end.     The armature was a piece of soft iron of the same diameter
  and 2 centims. in length.
     Around this core were placed two concentric helices, wound in
  opposite directions, through each of which could be passed the cur
  rent of a single Grove's cell.
     The method of experimenting was as follows.               A current was
  first passed through the inner helix, which, for convenience, I shall
  call A, and the weight supported by the bar was noted. This cur
  rent being broken, the outer helix, B, was introduced into the cir
  cuit, and the corresponding weight noted. The current through B
  being then broken, and that through A closed, after a short time the
   current was again passed through B and the weight noted. The
  following Table shows the results:—
                         Wt. supported by
                     A.                    D.         A diminished by B.

sary to produce the amount of heat radiated by the sun into space
is so remarkably small, that ages must elapse before the effect of this
contraction can become visible to us at our comparatively great dis
tance from the sun.
   In order to show that this is the case, let one foot and one second
be taken as the units of space and time, and suppose that each unit
of volume of the sun's mass contracts by the same amount in the
same time, so that if z, be the linear contraction of the sun's radius
ro in one second, and if z be the contraction of any other length

series of intermittent pulsations, acting throughout the whole of the
mass and tending to diminish the volume. Let g, be the force of
gravity at the surface of the sun, and let g be the force of gravity at

second of time.
   Now it has been found by observation that the heat emitted by the
sun to the earth is sufficient to melt a sheet of ice whose thickness
is 0.01093 inch when exposed perpendicularly to the solar rays for
one minute (Sir John Herschel, ‘Meteorology'),             due allowance
having been made for the heat absorbed by the atmosphere; and
therefore in one second a sheet of ice whose thickness is 0.0000152
foot will thus be melted; so that if a be the mean distance of the
earth from the sun expressed in feet, a spherical shell of ice, whose
radius is a and thickness 0-0000152 foot, will be the volume of ice
in cubic feet melted every second by the whole of the radiant solar
heat.    But one pound of ice has a volume equal to (0.2584)*

                             (0-2584)”
in pounds thus melted.
   Again, in order to melt one pound of ice, 79°25 thermal units are
required; and thus the whole solar heat evolved in one second of
time is equal to                                thermal units.
   Now, by equating the heat generated to the heat evolved in one
second, we get

and the contraction 2, is therefore only 0:000004079 foot in one
second, or 129 feet per annum; and, as we have already said, ages
must elapse before the effect of this contraction can become visible
to us, whether we compare direct measures of the solar disk or ob
served periods of axial rotation.
   The contraction, therefore, is so small that as much allowance can
be made for the assumptions introduced above as may be thought
necessary, without altering our general conclusion in the slightest
degree—namely, that the source of the solar heat and light is con
nected with the mechanical theory of heat by means of the contrac
tion of the composing mass.
   The application of this theory to other bodies is almost without
limit; the earth has contracted, and has stored up a corresponding
amount of heat in the non-conducting rocks and soils; the stars, by
their intrinsic brilliancy, indicate the operation of the force of gra
vity upon contracting matter; the nebulae afford examples of the
commencement of this operation; and periodical variations in light
now become perturbations, the effect of disturbing masses in motion,
producing endless changes subject to the great principle known as
the conservation of energy.—Monthly Notices of the Royal Astrono
mical Society, April 12, 1872.

bright yellow light, the base being a non-luminous blue flame. At
the least noise this flame roars, sinking down to the surface of the

    The tube chiefly determines the pitch of the note, shorter or longer
ones producing, of course, higher or lower tones respectively.     I have
most frequently used either a glass tube twelve inches long and one
and a quarter inch in diameter, or a brass one of the same dimen
sions.   Out of several rough pieces of common gas-pipe no one
failed to give a more or less agreeable sound. Among these gas
pipes was one as short as seven inches, with a diameter of one inch,
while another was two feet long and one and a quarter inch in dia
meter.    A third gas-pipe, fifteen inches long and three quarters
of an inch in diameter, gave, when set for a continuous sound, quite a
low and mellow tone. If the jet be moved slightly aside, so that
the flame just grazes the side of the tube, a note somewhat lower
than the fundamental one of the tube is produced.    This sound is
stopped by external noises, but it goes on again when left undis
turbed.   All these experiments can be made under the ordinary
pressure of street gas, three fourths of an inch of water being
sufficient.—Silliman's American Journal for May 1872.

  If   the coils had      resistance

If    variations in the solar radiation connected with the time of

tible by the sun's rotation in the thermometric observations if
they are combined for a sufficiently long period, so that the
yearly and daily periods may be considered to be eliminated from
the means.    In the third volume of the Bulletins of the Ph.-
math. Class of the Academy of Petersburg, Nervander has shown
that the coefficient depending upon the rotation of the sun, as
determined   by the observations    in Paris from 1816–1839,
amounts to 0°302 C. The difference in temperature, therefore,
observed when the coldest and hottest meridians are opposed to
the earth amounts to 0°-604 C.       In the same paper this quan
tity is determined by the observations made in Innsbruck
from 1777 to 1828; the number arrived at agrees perfectly
with the results of Paris, and is 0°-60 C. The objection has
been made that observations of two places only cannot prove the
existence of inequalities directly depending on the rotation of the
sun; but the probability of it would be considerably increased
if,  under very different climatic conditions,              periodicity     a                       of
 nearly the same magnitude should              deduced.      be

   “It is remarkable that already Nervander (Bulletins, vol. iii.
p. 14) suspected the existence of at least two minima and two
maxima.     If we must content ourselves to have proved the exist
ence of a variation, and, as it seems, a variation without equal
decrease and increase, while the coefficient of the inequality
cannot    be determined accurately from the observations at our
disposal—still, if the sun belongs to the variable stars, the ex
istence of two greatest and two smallest values corresponds to
the phenomena of light observed on 6 Lyrae”*.
    It is evident that the hope to determine accurately the position
of the poles of cold of the sun (which, according to my theory,
must coincide with the magnetic poles) can much more easily be
realized by actinometric than by thermometric observations of the
temperature of the air.      These observations can be made simply
by comparing two thermometers put very near together, one of
which has             its

in my paper " On the Periodicity and Heliographic Distribution
of Sun-spots " (Dec. 12, 1870).          I will only mention here the
results communicated by Father Secchi to the Paris Academy
on July 24 and September 4, 187l.
    Father Secchi says in his first communication*                  L'étude              :-*
des protubérances nous a dévoilé des courants très-violents, qui
dominent au-dessus de la chromosphère.             J'ai fait une attention
particulière à la direction de la courbure des jets les plus élevées,
et j'ai trouvé que, en général, de l'équateur aux latitudes
moyennes, la direction dominante est tournée vers les pôles."
    In a second papert Secchi mentions a great number of protu
berances.     He gives to those agreeing with the law of rotation
the   sign  +,  to those in opposition to it the sign
                             referring
                                                                   He says            -.

  of Wolf, and found that, if he reversed the latter curve, it coin
  cided so exactly with that of the mean yearly temperature, that
  he expresses the opinion that “the same cause which leads to
  an excess of mean annual temperature leads equally to a dissipa
  tion of solar spots.”
      In a letter to Sabine he says expressly:     “I  may mention that
•  I  had not the slightest expectation, on first laying down the
  curves, of any sensible agreement resulting, but that       I   now con
  sider the  agreement   too close to be a matter of chance.      I should,
  however, rather lean to the opinion that the connexion between
  the variation of mean temperature and the appearance of solar
  spots is indirect rather than direct, that each results from some
  general change of solar energy.”
      Piazzi Smyth had already made a communication to the Royal
   Society in April 7, 1870, in which he got the same result by
  other observations.      He discussed and reduced the observations
  made in the years 1837 to 1869 with the four large earth-ther
  mometers which had been sunk into the rocks of Calton Hill in
  Edinburgh by Principal Forbes, in consequence of a decision of
  the British Association.      Amongst other periodical variations in
   the  temperature  of the earth,  Piazzi Smyth found a period of 11:1
   years, or the sun-spot period.      Some circumstances discussed by
   Smyth in detail lead him also to the result that the sun-spots
   cannot be the true cause of the variation of temperature in the
  earth.
      I think  it very probable, after these results, that if thermome
   ters could be sunk still deeper into the earth the influences
   would be much more decided, as the retarding influence of the
   incomplete conduction of the earth's crust would be less.              It
   depends upon the degree in which these retarding influences
   may be annihilated whether the yearly period of magnetic dis
   turbances and auroras will be found in these observations.
                                      23.
       Although in § 9 I have deduced theoretically the necessary
   connexion between mechanical and magnetical changes on the
   surface of the earth, we must yet inquire whether the frequency
   of mechanical reactions of the glowing liquid nucleus of the earth
   shows also periodical changes which coincide with the changes
   of those causes which can produce the mechanical changes.

   So far as these changes are generated by exterior causes,
we have only to consider the sun and moon.       It has been shown
that these bodies may exert a double influence on the mechanical
reaction of the liquid nucleus against the solid crust of the earth,
WIZ.   :—
     A direct one, by generating a pressure- or tidal wave.
     1.
  2. An indirect one, by magnetical induction.
The direct influence will appear most strongly with the moon,
the indirect one with the sun.
   The great incompleteness in which our instruments for exact
measurement for sudden changes in the level of the ground are
at present, reduces the mechanical reactions able to be observed
to oscillations of the ground strong enough to make themselves
perceptible  to our senses in the form of earthquakes.
   It is therefore to be asked whether we can find any connexion
between the frequency of these phenomena and the path of the
moon which would correspond to the influence discussed theo
retically above. The influence of the moon on the moveable parts
of the earth must be greatest when                        its
                                          distance from the earth

servatory, one wall of which was broken through for this pur
pose; through this opening the mirror of the pendulum, shut
up in a separate box with a plane glass plate, was observed.

the readings of the values of the elongations.

498            M. F. Zöllner          on the         Origin of the Earth's Magnetism,
was found that small movements in the horizontal intensity of the
terrestrial magnetism coincided with simultaneous small changes
of the current in the line running from east to west.
   When magnetic instruments and galvanometers of greater
sensitiveness were employed, a complete analogy was found to
earist between the current in the wire running from east to west
 and the intensity, and then between the current of the wire running
from north to south and the dip. Moreover it was found, by com
parison of the movements in the wires which were stretched
 along the astronomical and magnetical meridians, that the move
 ment of the earth-current takes place chiefly parallel with the
equator.
   Already, before these observations of Lamont's, Walker* had
occupied himself with similar researches, which, however, chiefly
referred to the great and extraordinary movements of the earth
current, and were therefore made on the telegraph-lines. He
found that the earth-current was directed from north-east to
south-west, or vice versá, and in a line inclined at an angle of
413° to the astronomical meridian.
    It is remarkable, however, that in telegraph-lines lying in the
same direction the earth-current is not always equally intense;
some lines are even found in which the earth-current never
shows great intensity.
                                      -
    Very extensive researches on the earth-current have been
made by Matteuccit and Secchit.
    Matteucci laid two wires covered with gutta percha, each 6
kilometres long, one in the magnetic meridian, the other in a
direction at right angles to      At the ends ditches

500      M. F. Zöllner   on the Origin of the Earth's Magnetism,
 varying from 600 to 36,000 metres, and a difference in depth of
 83 to 642 metres. They always gave concordant results; but the
 longer wire and larger difference in height gave a stronger current.
     As regards the quality of these currents, Matteucci discusses
 expressly the question whether they are to be regarded as branch
 currents.     He answers the question in the negative, as the con
 ductivity of the earth must be assumed to be infinitely great
 in comparison with that of the wires.
     According to my opinion, nothing else remains than to con
 sider the layer of earth between the zinc plates electrically active,
 similarly to a voltaic pile. The fact that the intensity of the ob
 served currents increased with the interposed layer of earth would
 be in harmony with this assumption.
     The direction of the current within the earth would,of course,
 be the opposite of that in the wires, so that the surface of the
 earth would be surrounded by currents flowing from east to west
 and from north to south.
     With regard to the diaphragmic currents of Quincke, it would
 be interesting to see whether the moisture constantly descending
 in the earth under great pressure would not be sufficient to ge
 nerate these currents.       Such a movement of the moisture in
 the   porous layers  of earth would also take place from the colder
 and damp regions to the hotter and dry regions, and give rise
 to electric  currents directed in the same direction. The free
 tension    of the thus excited electricity could, if sufficiently
 strong, make itself perceptible in the electricity of the air.
     In this respect Secchi’s above-mentioned researches offer
 still more complete material for the decision of the question here
stated.
    Two telegraph-lines were constructed, one running from north
 to south, the other directed from east to west.      On both hourly
observations were made from 6 o'clock in the morning to mid
night, from June 1 to 16, 1863.
    The following are the results of these observations:—
    1. The line running from east to west shows much stro ger
variations than the north-south line.
    2. The maxima of one line are coincident with the minima of
the other; this is true for the secondary as well as for the pri
mary turning-points.       The chief turning-points are at 7–8" A.M.
 (minimum of north-south and maximum of the east-west line)
and 11–12" at noon (maximum of north-south and minimum of
the east-west line).
    3. During the night the currents are stronger and remain
pretty constant.
    Father Scochi draws from these experiments the conclusion
that it is sufficient to observe only one line, and limits his further

          and the Magnetic Relations               of the      Heavenly Bodies.                         501
observations to the north-south line, for which the position of the
galvanometer was recorded ten times daily during a whole year.
   The monthly means of this series of observations were then
compared with the simultaneous readings of the bifilar instru
ment, and with those of the atmospheric electricity. The result
was, that the turning-points of all three classes of phenomena cor
responded to each other.
   These facts of observation will be sufficient to show their close
connexion, first, with my physical theory of the origin of the
earth's magnetism, and, secondly, with the experiments to be de
scribed presently.
   I took a galvanometer   made by Sauerwald for the observa
tion of thermo-currents with a reflecting-mirror, and inserted the
ends of the copper wire into a gutta-percha tube, into which                                                 I
introduced a current of water from the water-pipes.     The water,
after having passed through the tube, was made to flow into a
vessel partly filled with water and not insulated.   The galvano
meter  always  showed a deflection of several  degrees,  indicating
a current in the direction of the flowing water.
                                                      I
    The wider apart from each other immersed the ends of the cop
per wire in the water, the greater was the deflection, so that the
whole streaming mass must have acted in         parts similarly  all   its                                  to
                                                                                                            a
voltaic battery                                                                               secondary
                          if                                                          to
                               the observed deflection was not due                    a
current.
   After my expectations had been fulfilled                                    in   this manner              by
the above rough experiments,                    I    changed           the mode               of   experi
mentation.
  The following   description  isa                 of     such   an    experiment, with                     nu
merical results.
 I  used   glass tube 500 millims. long and

                                                      at   a                        of
from each other.     The holes were closed air-tight        cork,                        by   a              by
means      which two thin copper plates were introduced into the
              of
                                                                       to by

T-shaped glass tubes, so that the flowing water could not touch

  The direction of the electric current was always the same as
that of the current of water.
     In order to attain an approximate value for the electromo
 tive force,        I
                introduced into the quiet water a current of one of
 Grove’s cells;            I
                      observed a deflection of 60°.      Hence the elec
 tromotive force    produced   by  the flow of a current of water 1220
 millims. long was about the fourth part of that of a Grove’s cell.

 the currents observed by Quincke.                             If,

506      Dr. C. R. A. Wright's Reply to “An Examination
proposition of this kind   relating to the nature of matter; and
when it is stated that    the atomic hypothesis is unnecessary,
what is meant is that in  chemical investigation, where the object
is to discover new facts,   properties, substances, or reactions, to
connect such discoveries with previous ones, to furnish the
foundation for prediction by means of induction, to systematize
and correlate the results obtained, &c., neither of these two ideas
is in any way involved.
   It does not, however, follow that because one does not see the
necessity of admitting Dalton's hypothesis, one is therefore de
barred from employing the generalization        and convention of
which he was the distinguished originator, nor that one is guilty
of inconsistency in so doing; but it does follow, if any one
makes the statement that the atomic theory is involved in
Dalton's generalization and that this generalization has no ex
istence apart from the atomic theory, that he is employing the
term atomic theory in a sense different from that in which I have
used the phrase atomic hypothesis.
   When the developments that have been made on Dalton's
original conceptions are closely examined, it is noticeable that
an entire change of idea in many respects has taken place, so
that the term atom is now employed to mean something very
different from what it meant when Dalton first introduced the
word into chemistry.     One of the objections urged in my paper
against the use of the language of the atomic hypothesis is that
this language is practically ambiguous, owing to the gradual
alteration that has taken place in the meaning of the terms, an
alteration carried so far by Dr. Williamson as to lead to the
distinct denial of the necessity of admitting the very proposition
expressing Dalton’s acceptation of the term atom, viz. that
matter is made up of small indivisible portions.      For the sake
of clearness, therefore, it does not seem desirable that the terms
involved in this admittedly unnecessary hypothesis should be
retained and used in senses often opposed to those in which
they were at first employed.      It may be urged that no other
single word exists capable of expressing the different ideas con
veyed by the term atom as now employed; and grammatically
speaking, there appears to be no reason why the word atom
should not indicate   a minimum ratio or indivisible proportion as
much as an indivisible fragment of matter; still it does not seem
philosophical to use terms which not only are easily susceptible
of double meanings, but which must necessarily entail ambi-.
guity; and in point of fact there is no actual necessity to use
such terms, inasmuch as     all
                             the ideas involved can    be
                                                    conveyed
in other and more definite language.
  It  being thus shown that what Mr. Atkinson actually dis

               of the recent attack on the Atomic Theory.”                                                     507
cusses and refers to in his paper is something entirely different
from the ideas embodied and principles laid down in what he
professes to criticise, the reply to each of his remarks becomes
very simple.
   Thus, first,          Mr. Atkinson        that either the experi
                                                considers
mental numbers obtained in the       quantitative   analysis of a series
of bodies  composed    of the same elements in different propor
tions (as,  for instance, the tungstem chlorides) must be em
ployed, or else the atomic theory       “unconsciously,is,      doubt,”                         no
assumed.           It
                hence appears   that Mr. Atkinson has missed the
essence      the paper

508                Dr. C. R. A. Wright's Reply to “An Examination
        Mr. Atkinson says that the definition given of a combining
number does not always lead to the number in use, instancing
ferric and aluminic chlorides as cases in point. It is almost
superfluous to point out that when the combining number is
defined as the minimum number of grams of an element con
tained in two volumes of the homogeneous vapour of any of its
compounds, the examination of only one vapour is not sufficient
to point out a minimum; thus, if benzene only were examined,
the combining number of carbon would be found to be 72; if
several compounds cannot be examined, then the combining
number deduced from only one or two is liable to be diminished
by arguments drawn from chemical analogy &c. In the case
of aluminium, Mr. Atkinson is rather unfortunate in his ex
ample; for the experiments of Buckton and Odling tend to show
that the formulae of aluminic methide and ethide are respec
tively Al Me” and AlBt”, and hence that the combining num
ber is 27-5 instead of 55 as deduced from the chloride alone.

sition, inasmuch as the motion which appears or disappears
during a reaction can only be considered to be derived from, or
imparted to, the atoms themselves; i.e. intramolecular motion of
variable amount must exist.      Since, then, the atoms must have
a limited amount of motion (vibratory, rotatory, &c.) among
themselves, what are the differences in the rate or kind of mo
tion corresponding to the chemical differences between (for ex
ample) the three kinds of hydrogen existing in ethylic alcohol
in the groups CH*, CH*, and OH ! Before the atomic hypothesis
can be said to eaplain isomerism, some connexion must be made
 out between these different rates or kinds of intramolecular mo
 tion and the chemical and other properties of the isomerides;
for isomerides differ not only in mechanical properties, such as
 specific gravity, melting-point, &c., and in chemical reactions,
 but also in the amount of heat given out on combustion of equal
 weights of the substances respectively; i. e. each isomeride repre
 sents a different amount of potential energy; and the same holds
 in the case of allotropic modifications, e.g. the carbon and phos
 phorus allotropes.    The mere hypothesis of the earistence of atoms
 is insufficient to  explain these observed facts; whilst, even if
 supplemented    by a number of further hypotheses as to the rate
 and character of intramolecular motions in given instances, a
satisfactory explanation of chemical phenomena by these means
does not seem probable.     Thus, granting that the substitution
of a chlorine atom for a  hydrogen  atom in one molecule is ac
companied by a given change in the motion, either of that atom
alone, or in the motion of the other atoms in the molecule as
well, it does not appear that it will be possible to predict what
will be the changes of motion that take place when the substi
tution of the chlorine atom for the hydrogen atom occurs in an
other molecule, or even in a different portion of the same mole
cule. For instance, granting that the substitution of chlorine for
hydrogen is attended by a given change of motion, the inverse
substitution must be accompanied by the opposite change.
Now, when a molecule of hydrogen is acted on by a molecule of
chlorine, in one molecule an atom of hydrogen is replaced by
one of chlorine, and in the other an atom of chlorine is replaced
by one of hydrogen. These complementary changes, therefore,
should cause, on the whole, no difference as to the ultimate
amount of motion in the two original and the two resulting mo
lecules; but as a matter of fact there is such a difference ob
served  (i.  potential energy becomes actual) when hydrogen and
               e.
chlorine act        on
                 one another    accordance with the equation

i.e.  one represents a primary, the other a secondary alcohol.
What are the differences in the changes of motion that ensue on
the replacement of a hydrogen atom by a chlorine atom, according
 as this atom is one of the terminal or of the penultimate group            f
 and why is not one of the more central groups affected ? So far
 from the atomic hypothesis giving an explanation of chemical
phenomena relating to isomerism, the explanation of the vast ma
jority of facts by this means has never yet been even dreamed of.
    It might be fairly urged against the symbolic system that it
does not at present include in the meanings of the symbols the
amount of energy converted from the potential to the actual
state, or vice versä, in any given reaction; but this is a point
out of the cognizance of my paper, which only treated of those
things that are represented by these symbols.
  It  is sometimes stated that the existence of atoms (or at least
of molecules) is demonstrated by the consideration of the me
chanical properties of gases and other physical facts: but is
there not a petitio principii here ? Granting the existence of mo
lecules, certain observed properties of gases may be explained,
just as the generalization of multiple proportions is explained by
this supposition; but that is no proof of the existence of mole
cules.   Granting their existence, from certain physical conside
rations their size may be approximately calculated; but that is
no proof of their existence, any more than the circumstance that
certain electric phenomena are explainable by, and certain results
deducible from, the hypothesis of the existence of an imponde
rable fluid is a proof of the existence of such a fluid.
   When it is urged in favour of the retention of such terms as
atom, &c., that the advances in chemistry during the last forty
years are due to the atomic theory, another fallacy is introduced.

                       Liquids.    By G. QUINcke.

INpassing  through them consists of two parts. The one consists
of the particles of electricity which are given from one molecule
to the adjacent one, which pass through the liquid with what is
called metallic conductivity; the other consists of the particles
of electricity which are carried forward in the liquid by material
molecules*.     Now the first part, as compared with the second, is
extraordinarily small—so much                                 so,

thus, in spite of this difference in the mode of conduction, the
electrolytes must be subject to the same laws of the distribution
of the current as the metals.         Hence both Ohm’s law and
Kirchhoff's propositions on derived currents must hold, and the
potential of free electricity in the case of a linear conductor must
be constant within the same section.
   Ohm’s law has been so much tested for electrolyzable liquids
with an undivided circuit that it can be taken as sufficiently
proved.
  Yet in one particular    case the laws of divided circuits seem
to experience an exception.    Poggendorff” found that the resist
ance of a very thin platinum wire stretched in the axis of a ver
tical glass cylinder of 3% inches diameter was unaltered when
this cylinder was filled to a height of 63 inches with dilute sul
phuric acid.    There was no trace of a lateral extension, or of a
division of the current between the metal and the liquid.
   Jacobi subsequentlyt made similar experiments with German
silver or platinum wires which were stretched on a wooden
trough 20 inches long by 34 broad and 4 high, lined with ma
rine glue. In one case, when the trough was filled with sulphate
of copper, a very slight diminution of the resistance of the Ger
man-silver wire was observed by the aid of Wheatstone's bridge;
in another experiment with German-silver wire and platinum
wire a diminution of the resistance could not be detected by the
same method; on the other hand, at the end of the German-silver
wire towards the negative pole of the circuit there was a depo
sition of copper, while at the other end the wire was attacked
and even eaten through.     The deposition of copper and the cor
rosion were strongest at the ends.     The platinum wire showed
only a trace of a copper precipitate at the end turned towards
the negative pole.
   It has therefore been supposed, and Wiedemann has also ex
pressed the ideaf, that this apparent irregularity in the division
of the current between wire and liquid has          origin  its pola           in   a
rization     the limit
            at             of
                        metal and   liquid, produced      the electro     by
chemical decomposition       the liquid, and that, when this pola
                                of
rization    iswanting, part      the electric current actually does
                                     of
flow through the liquid.
   The following experiments have confirmed this supposition.
  A   glass trough, 442 millims.in length, 60.6 millims.     breadth,          in
and 62.5 millims.in height, was constructed     plate glass cemented

stretched, passing through the sealing-wax cement of the smaller
sides of the trough to mercury-cups which were attached to the
outside of the trough.    By means of a Wheatstone's bridge the
resistance of this platinum wire was compared with the resistance
of a German-silver wire of almost the same dimensions and at a
constant  temperature.   A very homogeneous brass wire 1000
millims. in length and 0.32 millim. in diameter served as mea
suring-wire.   The current of a Grove’s battery of seven pairs was
passed through the divided circuit as long as was necessary for
observing a deflection on the reflecting galvanometer; and the
disturbing influence of thermocurrents was avoided by alter
nating observations with opposite direction of the principal cur
rent of the battery.
   With this apparatus the resistance P of the platinum wire
could be compared with that of the German-silver wire, known
in mercury units, with accuracy to about one 5000th part.
   The resistance was found to be
                     P=16-207 m. u., or P= 16:204 m. u.
at 14°4 C., according as the glass trough was full of air, or was
filled with dilute sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1-16 to a
height of 49 millims. These numbers may be regarded as equal,
taking into account the difficulty of maintaining at the same
temperature the wire and the dilute sulphuric acid.
    In another series of experiments the resistance of the plati
num wire was determined in air, then after the trough had been
filled to a height of 47.3 millims. with dilute sulphuric acid of
the specific gravity 1-109, and finally after the dilute sulphuric
acid had been removed from the trough by means of a siphon.
   These three determinations          at 15°-6   C. gave
      P=16:280 m. u.,             16-278 m. u., and    16.278 m. u.
We    seethus that the resistance of platinum wire remains un
changed whether there is air or dilute sulphuric acid in the glass
trough. The same result was obtained when the resistance was
determined on first closing the current after the sulphuric acid
had been poured in.

vanometer,   a current was observed the direction of which in
the  liquid was from the ignited platinum wire C to the end A,
or from the end B to the ignited platinum wire C. The ends
A and B of the long platinum wire behaved thus towards the
freshly ignited wire C like platinum wires the surfaces of which
are covered with oxygen and hydrogen.
   If the long platinum wire of the glass trough was replaced by
a copper wire of the same length and 0.08 millim. in diameter,
and instead of the dilute sulphuric acid a concentrated solution
of pure sulphate of copper was used, the polarization at the boun
dary of the metal and the liquid was infinitely small; and now,
when the solution of sulphate of copper was poured in, there was
a diminution in the resistance of the copper wire. The resist
ance K of the copper wire was again compared, as described
above, with the almost equal resistance of a German-silver wire,
and was found to be, at 15°-5 C.,
                K=2783        m. u., or 2.728 m. u.,
according as the glass trough was filled with air, or to the height
of 50 millims. with a sulphate-of-copper solution.
   After the current of a Grove’s battery of six elements had been
passed for about an hour through the copperwire while surrounded
by solution of sulphate of copper, the end A, where the current
entered, close to the inside of the glass trough was eaten away,
while the end B, where the current emerged, was coated with
freshly precipitated copper.   In the middle the copper wire was
of the original thickness;  towards the end A it was thinner, and
towards B thicker.     The decrease or increase was greater the
nearer the part of the wire was to the end A or B, and the dia
meter of the wire at B was now 0-104 millim.
   It follows from these experiments that an electrical current
divides between metallic and liquid (electrolyzable) conductors,
as Kirchhoff's laws require, and that in many cases the polari
zation produced by electrolysis causes only an apparent excep
tion from this rule.

alone is the process applicable to drinking-water, but Dr. Angus
Smith has used it in a most elaborate investigation of the atmo
sphere, and Dr. Ransome in investigating the breath in different
diseases; and               I
                  have in view a very wide and general use of it
in physiological chemistry.
   The “ammonia process” consists in oxidizing organic sub
stances in a strongly alkaline solution, and measuring the am
monia yielded by oxidation under such conditions.
   The oxidizing agent hitherto employed by us in working the
process has been permanganate of potash, which is very conve
nient and manageable, and has the great advantage of not at
tacking the ammonia which is produced.        An investigation of
the action of other  oxidizing  agents  in alkaline solution would
repay the trouble of making       and may possibly it,  undertaken            be
at  some future time.                  *

of any magnet or electromagnet,          a change takes place in the mag
netic field, electromotive forces are called into play; and if the

discovered by Faraday.

is in the form of a thin stratum or sheet, bounded by parallel planes,
and of indefinite extent. A system of magnets or electromagnets is
supposed to exist on the positive side of this sheet, and to vary in any

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Foraminifera        of the Family Rotalinae (Carpenter)
found in the Cretaceous Formations, with Notes on their Tertiary
and Recent Representatives.”          By Prof. T. Rupert Jones, F.G.S.,
and W. K. Parker, Esq., F.R.S.
    The authors enumerated the Rotalinae which have been found in
the Cretaceous rocks of Europe, and showed by tabular synopses the
range of the species and notable varieties in the different formations
of the Cretaceous system. For the comparison of the Tertiary Ro
talinae with those of the Cretaceous period the following Tertiary
formations were selected:—The Kessenberg beds in the Northern
Alps, the Paris Tertiaries, the London Clay, the Tertiary beds of
the Vienna Basin, and the English and Antwerp Crags. The authors
also enumerated the recent Foraminifera of the Atlantic Ocean.
    The authors stated that of Planorbulina several species and im
portant varieties of the compact conical form occur throughout the
 Cretaceous series, and that those of the Nautiloid group are still more
 abundant. The plano-convex forms are represented throughout the
 series by P. (Truncatulina) lobatula; but the flat concentric growths
had not yet come in.        Planorbulina extends down to the Lias and
 Trias. Pulvinulina repanda is feebly represented in the uppermost
 Chalk; but forms of the “Menardii” group abound throughout the
 series. Species of the “elegans" group are peculiarly characteristic
 of the Gault; and some of the “Schreibersii’’ group are scattered
 throughout.     These two groups extend far back in the Secondary
 period.     The typical Rotalia Beccarii is not a Cretaceous form; but
 the nearly allied R. umbilicata is common.         Tinoporus and Patellina
 occur at several  stages;    Calcarina  only  in the Upper Chalk.
    The above-mentioned      types  are for the most part still living; but
 the “auricula”     group   of Pulvinulina is wanting in the Cretaceous
 series, as also are Spirillina and Cymbalopora, except that the latter
 occurs in the Maestricht Chalk.          Discorbina and Calcarina make
 their first  appearance  in the  uppermost   Chalk.   The chief distinction
 between the Cretaceous and the existing Rotalinae was said to con
 sist in the progressively increasing number of modifications.           The
 authors concluded by disputing the propriety of regarding the
  Atlantic ooze as homologous with the Chalk.
     2. “On the Infra-lias in Yorkshire.”          By the Rev.  J. F. Blake,
  M.A., F.G.S.
     The Infra-lias, i. e. the zones of Ammonites planorbis and Am. an
  gulatus, have been recorded hitherto only from Redcar, to the beds
  at which place the author referred; but the chief object of the
  paper was to describe some sections at Cliff, near Market Weighton,
  where these and lower beds are well exposed, and have yielded a

numerous suite of fossils.        He considered, however, that these beds
did not belong to the typical Yorkshire area, but were the thin end
of the series which stretches across England. He supposed there had
been a barrier in Carboniferous times, which had separated the coal
fields of Yorkshire and Durham, prevented the continuity of the
Permian beds, and curved round the secondary rocks to the north
of   it, form the real Yorkshire basin, while these beds
           to                                                        Cliff were                    at

case of rock-salt, n is the index corresponding to the rays employed.
It appeared to me to require to be taken as equal to 1:49.         In the
case of glass, the value of n which satisfies experiment is n=l:7;
but here measurements of the index are not possible, because glass
even of the thickness of 4 millim. obstructs the passage of the rays em

the extreme obscure rays are incomparably more refracted than the
red rays, which are nevertheless           much more refrangible than the

k is a constant depending on the nature of the rays and on that of
the mirror.    The constant n, always defined by the relation
sini– n sin r, retains the value deduced from the experiments                                                      in
which the plane of polarization is parallel with that of incidence.
  The final formula is the following:—

Ihave verified this formula between the incidences of 20° and 75°.

  The detailed researches of which the spectra of the planets have
been the subject since the introduction of the spectroscope in astro

spectra are not at                  all

ANOMALOUS        PRODUCTION OF OZONE.                 BY HENRY H. CRoft,
    PROFEssoR of cHEMISTRY, UNIVERSITY college, Toronto.
   About six years ago, when evaporating some syrupy iodic acid,
prepared according to Millon's process, over sulphuric acid,                                           I
noticed that when the acid began to crystallize the air in the jar
(covering the drying-dish) had a strong smell of ozone or active
oxygen.     A couple of years afterward, on again making iodic acid,
this observation recurred to my mind, and I carefully tested the air
in the jar during the evaporation; no trace of ozone could be de
tected until the acid began to crystallize, when the smell of ozone
became immediately perceptible, and                        all
                                                 the usual tests for that body.
 succeeded   perfectly.
    During the last month have had occasion

of   iodine into iodic acid; and exactly the same result has been
 observed.
    The acid usually solidifies         opaque verrucose masses; but
