I. Further        Examination of the Deposit of Fossil Bones at
    North Cliff" in the County of York. By the Rev. WILLIAM V.
    VERNON, F.R.S. F.G.S. Pres. Y.P.S.*
  A
,*"*,
       T   a former meeting of the Society,         I gave an accountf of
         the discovery of some remarkable fossil bones in a marl-
pit near North Cliff; and at the" same time mentioned the I
desire of the Council to complete the investigation of so in
teresting a subject, by undertaking a more accurate examina
tion of the bed in which they were found.
     The pit having been partly filled up before it attracted the
attention of any scientific observer, and not having been sunk
to the bottom of the deposit,           I  was then only able to furnish
such information on some material points as I could collect
from the report of the farmer by whom the marl was worked,
and from the borings which I had caused to be made through
it. But by the wish of the Council, and with the permission of
a member' of this Society^, to whom the care of the property
belongs, I have since directed the sinking of another pit near
the former, and have personally superintended the operation.
 Six or seven hundred loads of marl were removed ; the deposit
 was penetrated to its lowest bed ; the depth at which the se
 veral bones were found was measured, and the nature and the
 location of all the contents of the pit were carefully observed.
 I have represented in the following table the chief details of

    The principal objects of research appeared to me to be these :
First, to ascertain whether the organic remains were distri
buted in any order of succession ; whether, for instance, the re
mains of extinct species, such as Elephas primigenius is pre
sumed to be, lay below those which correspond with existing
types, and below the shells which Mr. Phillips has lately iden
tified with recent native specimens.           Secondly, to determine
whether the deposit contained any decisive evidence that it
had been originally formed by a sediment from tranquil waters,
and subsequently penetrated by the irruption of a diluvial tor
rent.
    To the first of these inquiries the answer furnished by the
table is beyond expectation distinct.            The discovery of the
head of an ancient variety of the bison is in this respect a for
tunate occurrence. When I compared it with the description
given in the " Ossemens Fossiles" of the cranium of the aurochs
or bison, and perceived in it the strongly marked characters
which distinguish this from every other species of ox*, the ob
tuse angle which is formed by the frontal and occipital bones
at the junction of their planes, the curvature of this crest and
the distance at which it is placed behind the horns, — I was
much gratified to find that one of the desiderata of geology
was here for the first time supplied.
    The following quotation from Cuvier will explain the in
terest which attached to the finding such a specimen in such
a situation : he is speaking of the bones of the ox found at
Kirkdale, and in other ancient deposits.

facile de determiner une espece d'apres les os des extre'mites,
lorsque I'on n'a pas son crane."     The most skilful of compa
rative anatomists was not able to distinguish the species of
this genus with certainty but by the peculiarities of the cra
nium, and no cranium had yet been discovered with the bones
 of the extinct elephant, rhinoceros, and lion.
    The consequences alluded to in the foregoing passage fol
low from the consideration of the different climates which the
different species of the ox inhabit in their natural state : the
buffalo is naturally an inhabitant only of the tropics ; the ox
or urus and the aurochs or bison are, and always have been, as
far as the history of animals extends, natives of a cold or tem
perate climate. If therefore it is the bison, the remains of
which are found with those of the extinct species of elephant,
it is to be presumed that the latter animal also was a native of
such a climate, and by consequence that the temperatureof
these latitudes has undergone little alteration since the re
mains in question were inhumed.
   To this conclusion I think myself intitled to come, from the
discovery in the present instance of a bison's head beneath
the remains of the elephant and rhinoceros ; and I consider
such a conclusion confirmed in the highest degree by the si
tuation where it is shown by the table, that those land- and
fresh-water shells were found which have been so fully identi
fied with species and varieties now existing in this country.
These shells, twelve in number, to which Mr. Phillips has
since added another (.P. sp/ro?-fe), proved to be embedded with
the bones to the very bottom of the black marl ; but in the
upper gray marl not a trace of them was to be seen : so far are
they from being of recent deposition, that they are not even
mixed with but distinctly covered by unequivocal relics of
diluvian action.
    But I am anticipating the second point to which I stated that
my inquiries were directed; namely, the question whether any
part of this deposit had been formed by a sediment from tran
quil waters.
    Now as far as this examination went, it proved that for the
first seventeen feet from the stratified red marl upwards, not
a pebble had been deposited which might not have been
brought by the tides of the Humber, or the influx of streams
from the near adjoining hills.     The black marl exhibited all
                                                              the

the    characters of a tranquil sediment ; scarcely a stone was
found in it which might not have been carried by the gentlest
current; the whole mass was impregnated with minutely divided
animal and vegetable matter, and gave out a fetid odour ; so
loose was its texture, though it might be pressed into a clay
tenacious enough for brick-making, that it worked very lightly,
and crumbled, as it was thrown out, into mould : the ten-
derest shells were perfectly preserved ; the bones showed no
signs of having been rolled ; their edges had lost none of their
sharpness ; their angles were in no degree smoothened. Out of
a hundred bones, and fragments of bones, I could find but two
which were rubbed, and these were worn and polished at the
points of the extremities alone.
    The fragments had been brought into the state in which
they were found by various causes ; some had been apparently
fractured before they were floated in, others had been broken
in their place by unequal pressure; some had split asunder by
a longitudinal cleavage, others had fallen to pieces by chemi
cal decomposition : the latter effect had taken place chiefly in
the upper and wetter marl.
    Nothing like an entire skeleton was found ; but in some in
stances bones lay together which articulated with one another :
thus the humerus, radius and ulna of the wolf were not far
separated ; and the coronaryphajangial bones of the horse were
found in regular order; the second a little below the first, and
the third a little below the second.          The magnitude* of these
phalangial bones is remarkable when compared with those of
the ancient British horse; I have seen some which were taken
out of a barrow in the East Riding of Yorkshire, by the Ilev.
 Mr. Stillingfleet, and I think they are not more than half the
size.
    Upon the whole, all the appearances hitherto described may
 be very well accounted for by the common operation of a river
like the Humber, in forming alluvial tracts. We may con
 ceive the lowest alternations of the marl to have been deposited
by successive tides ; we may conceive a mere to have been by
 degrees banked up, in which some molluscous kinds lived, and
 into which others were washed from the surrounding marshes,
 together with the remains of the animals which frequented
 them, some of which may have perished by violence and some
 by natural decay; and lastly, we may conceive the same ground,
 by some demolition of its embankments, to have been after-

    which the former vegetable products have failed, and the de
    posit of land- and fresh-water shells has ceased.
                          I
      At all events think it appears that so far no violent and
    overwhelming torrent has been concerned in the formation of
     these beds.
        But above the black marl and about the level of high water
    in the H umber, at this level the first marks begin to be ob
    served of a more powerful action.      From this point to the sur
    face large stones are embedded in the deposit transported
    from distant rocks, from the western hills of Yorkshire and
    the mountains of Cumberland.         These stones correspond so
    entirely with those of all our great beds of diluvial gravel, that
    if a heap of the former were laid by a heap of the latter, the
    two heaps could not be distinguished from each other. They
    may be supposed perhaps to have been washed out of those
    beds ; but surely they have not been washed out of them by
    the Humber ; for if so, why are they not rather deposited in
'
    the lower parts of the marl, than at a point to which none but
    the finer particles suspended by a flood could be supposed to
    reach. The Humber does not now deposit such stones.
        This last remark is equally applicable to the bed of gravel
    and sand which lies above the marl. There is no argillaceous
    matter mixed with it or over it.     It is otherwise in the lower
    part of   this deposit there, as might be expected from the
                           :
    inundations of so muddy a river, the flints are mingled and
    covered with marl.       So that whether we make a comparison
    with the warp-land deposited by the Humber in the present
    state of things, or with the deposit of marl formed in the an
    cient state of things, we find nothing in this sand and gravel
    analogous either to those alluvial sediments, or to the usual
    alluvium of similar rivers.
        I have been greatly confirmed in the view which          I

    taken of this subject, by inspecting a recent alluvial deposit
    near the mouth of the Tees. Here one of those subterranean
    forests which have been so often observed on our coast near
    the confluence of the rivers with the sea, has been intersected
    by a cut which is designed to connect two reaches of the Tees,
    and to shorten the navigation from Newport to Stockton. The
    following is a section of this deposit.

                   same fetid odour as the black marl at Cliff".

           resembling that found at Cliff.

   The trees are*, oak, birch, and hazel ; they have fallen in
various directions : the roots, from which the trunks have been
broken, in some instances are standing upright, but want, as
 I was informed, the tap root. No marks of tools have been
observed upon any of the trees ; the opinion of the superin-
tendant of the work       is,
                           that they had been drifted or rather
had sunk into their present situation from an adjoining rise,
which he thinks was the ancient bank of the Tees.          There
can be no doubt that the argillaceous bed above them has
been formed        by
                   the river, which would even now cover the
surface at high tides   if   were not banked out.

        I                        deposit which may be compared

in some respects to that of Cliff; and here also found abunI
dance of diluvian pebbles, distinguished only from those above
described by the circumstance that the mountain limestone
contains the Madrepores which are found in that rock in the
county of Durham. But the material difference between the
two cases     this that the diluvian stones are here embedded
              is   ;
in the red rock marl, which          the substratum whereon this

which   is here extremely hard and solid, to the depth of at
least four feet, to which depth        saw
                                         I    worked.  So that at

                                    and we have here no diluvian
stones in the upper clay.

of Cleveland,      had an opportunity of observing under the

 8     Rev.  W. V. Vernon       on the Fossil Bones  of North Cliff:
 should accurate and multiplied observations be extensively
 made upon the depth of sediment which rivers have deposited
 above the diluvium, and upon the depth of sediment which the
 same rivers are still accumulating, — some approximation at
least may be arrived at towards the solution of this question ;
 and it is even possible that similar observations on antedilu
 vian alluvia may be attended with interesting results in confirm
 ing the testimony of history as to the ffira of creation itself.
     In the mean time it is already become one of the best esta
blished inferences in geology, that since the formation of the
 animals which now subsist upon the earth a general and over
 whelming inundation has occurred. In the wreck of that great
 catastrophe no new genus has been discovered. The fossil
species which it has entombed do not differ more from the ex
isting species than the existing species from one another. The
antediluvian Bison, Reindeer, Glutton, Wolf, and Fox cannot
be distinguished by any specific difference from the recent
animals, nor, as far as yet appears, can the Horse or Stag; and
the distinction of one species of Sear is allowed to be doubt
ful.
     The indigenous European quadrupeds wanting to this list
are not very numerous; and of these it is highly probable that
more will be found when the repositories of antediluvian bones
shall have been fully searched.           Fifteen species of molluscous
animals have now been compared with their recent analogues,
and, as might be expected of more stationary animals, the spe
cific identity has been found to be still more absolute. Against
this positive evidence that the whole belong to one epoch, in
terrupted only by a transient convulsion, there is nothing to set
but the disappearance of some of the antediluvian species ; and
this is surely no unnatural consequence of the catastrophe
which is admitted to have occurred.
    I  am, therefore, very far from agreeing in the opinion that
" the body of evidence seems to render a new creation pre
sumable*," subsequent to the diluvian epoch ; and I am equally
far from thinking that there is any evidence at all against the
creation of "Man and the Monkeys" having preceded the ge-
ological deluge. The only inference which can be drawn from
the absence of the bones of monkeys is that which has been
long since indicated by Cuvier, that the antediluvian animals
of Europe were not the same as the animal population of the
torrid zone; and with respect to human bones, it must be re
membered that it is only lately, by the industry of living natura
lists, that these deposits have been examined with any attention

even in Europe ; but that in Asia, the cradle of the human
race, they have never been at all explored.  From the absence
of human bones in the antediluvian deposits of Europe, the
only consequence which can justly be inferred      that the re               is,
gions of the earth which we inhabit were not peopled before
the Deluge and this consideration furnishes a strong presump
                  ;
tion that no long interval elapsed between that event and the
creation.
   So that the present state of our knowledge upon this subject
presents us with two geological probabilities  first, that there      :
has been since the creation of the present order of animated
beings a general deluge, which destroyed a great multitude of
those animals and extinguished several species and secondly,              ;
that this deluge followed the creation at no very considerable
interval of time, and before mankind had overspread the earth.
These are links between natural and civil history which                                   it   is
of the highest interest to trace and the confirmation and ex

  HI.    On the General Existence of Iodine in Spring Water.
                    By R. HENDERSON, M.D.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
"jy/TY attention has of late been directed to the statements of
•*•••*•
         Prof. Daubeny, respecting the existence of bromine and
iodine in many of the mineral waters.        I beg leave to observe
                                                               that

                      of Iodine in Spring     Water.                      1 1
that I have found traces of iodine not only in warm and saline
springs, but also in every common spring in which there are
traces of the chlorides of calcium and sodium.                 It appears
that Mr. Murray had, previous to Prof. Daubeny's communi
cation, ascertained the existence of iodine in the Gloucester
and Cheltenham springs ; also in the saline waters at Ingestre
and at Bex.      Iodine appears to exist in the warm springs of
Keddleston, Matlock, Buxton, wells near Bristol and Bath ;
the quantity is so small as not to be appreciable, and requires
the evaporation of many gallons before the slightest change
is induced by the amylaceous test.            Sir H. Davy attributed
the colouring principle in sea-water partly to the presence of
iodine; as the chloride of sodium is so generally diffused and
iodine appears to be an accompanying principle, and therefore
probably may be traced in every spring. The strongly charged
saline springs of Cheshire contain it in much larger proportion
than the warm springs above mentioned; and in all the well-wa
     I
ters have examined, by the evaporation of fifty or sixty gallons
to a few ounces, a faint peach-blossom colour is produced by
the test.    I  evaporated fifty-four gallons of the condensed
water of a steam-engine in the neighbourhood where I re
side, and which may be considered as nearly equal to distil
led water in purity ; — no traces appeared, and therefore, inde
pendent of the vessels employed in the evaporation, iodine, as
to its state of combination, I have not been enabled to detect.
The quantity existing in every mineral water is too minute to
produce any effects on the constitution, and therefore, the as
certainment of its existence may be considered more as inter
esting to the chemical inquirer than of any practical utility *.
Thus silex and alumina have been stated as existing in some
warm springs.       Unless there is an uncombined alkali in the
waters, I have never discovered either the one or the other.               I
believe the error has arisen from very finely divided silex, or
alumina, when diffused in water, requiring many days for its
deposition ; and hence, previous to the analysis of any mineral
water, it should be preserved in a quiescent state many days,
in order to admit of the deposition of every particle of matter in
a state of mechanical suspension. And I perfectly accord with
the observations of the late Dr. Murray of Edinburgh, that
the salts ought to be considered as existing in the waters in
their natural state, in that state of combination in which their
   * The continued or frequent exhibition, however, (to use a medical
phrase) of waters containing even such minute proportions of iodine, may,
we conceive, at length produce appreciable and perhaps important effects
upon the system ; and in this point of view the subject of Dr. Henderson's
paper may become practically useful. — EDIT.

solubility is the greatest ; and that in the process of evapora
tion, the dried salt is not presented to us in that state of ar
rangement in which it previously existed in the fluid mass; and
thus in many instances what we conclude to be the chloride
of sodium is the chloride of calcium.
    In the year 1825, Mons. Peschier of Geneva published
some interesting researches on titanium : he has discovered it
as existing in considerable proportions in mica, talc, chlorite,
steatite, asbestus, marl, and eisspath.  The results induced me
to examine the Mona       marble of Anglesea.   Although I have
detected titanium [?], as soon as my series of experiments are
concluded, I shall have great pleasure in transmitting them to
the public through the medium of your valuable Journal.

IV.   Proposal   of another   Number as a Test      of the    Chronometers
             on       Trial at Greenwich.     By   J. L. T.
           observations of Caleb Mainspring in the last Number
      of the Philosophical Magazine, on the trial number hitherto
applied for awarding the prizes for the best chronometers, have
induced me to propose another number to be substituted for
it ; the application of which, although certainly more laborious
than that of the former one, would be by no means very diffi
cult, especially after a little practice.  C. M.'s remarks prove
that the present trial number is not an absolute test of the
quality of a chronometer ; it         is,
                                    indeed, clear from the deriva
tion of the number, that almost every day's differences might
undergo slight alterations, the accumulated sums of which
would be considerable, without altering that number.           The
object which the Admiralty must have in view,           to find out
                                                             is
those chronometers which will most exactly retain the rates
derived from     a certain, longer or shorter, interval, during an
uncertain subsequent period.     The usual and most important
application of chronometers for determining the longitude at
sea, by means of a rate, previously determined in port or on
shore, does not admit of any regard to the alterations, how
ever regular to all appearance, of that rate which in other ap
plications of chronometers might be admitted and taken into
account.    The Admiralty can, therefore, not look to any other
differences but the first, and should award the prizes to those
chronometers only, which present the greatest uniformity in
the first differences of their daily differences from the mean
                                                                      time

                a Test    of the Chronometers at Greenwich.         IS
time   of the   same     place. It is submitted whether the following
quantity derived for each chronometer from the daily com
parison with mean time will be a good criterion of this uni
formity.       Let the first differences of the daily differences of
each chronometer from Greenwich mean time (in fact, the
numbers printed in the Greenwich reports for each day) be
 d1, «?', d'", &c., and let the mean of all for the whole period
embraced by the trial be d; and then let the sum of the squares
of the differences of the number for each day, and the mean
of all, be calculated viz. (d1— d)* (d" — df (dm— «?)9 &c.
                            ;                  +            +              +
It  appears to me that this number would be fit to judge by of
the quality of a chronometer, and every alteration in any one
number would produce             achange in it. Without contending
that the reciprocal of this number would express the exact
weight of the different results obtained by these chronometers
during subsequent period,
         a                           may be affirmed that the order of
                                          it
the chronometers, with regard to quality, would be the reverse
of the order of those quantities as to magnitude. As the ob
ject of these remarks           only to submit a proposal to the ex
                                is
amination of those who are competent and willing to judge of
 its propriety,   I  shall only add an example of the manner in
 which this trial number of chronometer
                                      a              to be calculated.
                                                       is
 The calculation would in most cases require little accuracy, as
 the numbers will vary greatly for the different chronometers;
 and only in cases where they would, for the best ones, be nearly
 the same, would        be necessary, by a more accurate repetition
                       it
 of the calculation,   to decide the uncertainty left in the previous
 approximate calculations.

 •*•
      vegetable kingdom characters sufficient to enable us, not
 only to distinguish them from each other, but to form them
 into their proper families and combinations, cannot be doubted.
 Nor will it be denied that the arrangement of a system of ve
getables, founded upon true natural distinctions, would be in
 the highest degree gratifying.       It is not therefore surprising
 that so many attempts have been made to accomplish this most
 desirable object; but attractive and splendid as it may be, and
 certainly as it is known to exist, it is not likely to be ever fully
 disclosed to our view. — " The majesty of nature" glances be
fore our sight, but as often as we attempt to retain her, she
 eludes our efforts. — Her vegetable productions are so nu
merous, their characteristics often so difficult to ascertain, they
are related to each other by so many ties, that it is in vain to ex
pect that we shall ever be able clearly to define them, and ac
curately to seize upon the true distinctions ; so as to combine
the whole in the precise order in which they were primarily
disposed by her hand.         In the mean time, the necessities of
human life, no less than the objects of science, require that
some mode should be adopted which should enable us to di
stinguish plants from each other, and to designate them by their
appropriate names, although we may not be able precisely to
ascertain their natural connections and relative situations :
and for this purpose it became indispensably necessary to have
recourse to art ; not to overthrow or oppose nature, but to
assist us where she deserted us, to guide our steps till we could
again recover her track, and to furnish us with a lamp till we
•were again illuminated by the beams of day.
    Happily for the world, the formation of such a system was
undertaken by the illustrious Swede whose name it bears; and
certain it   is,
               that    could not have fallen into abler hands. —

 first demonstrated it in unambiguous and decisive terms, and
 who applied this great discovery to the formation of an ar-
jangement of plants, which comprehends and defines every in
 dividual of the vegetable world. In executing this great task,
 he has placed the science of botany upon a firm and immove-
 able foundation; and if he has at any time erred in the appli
 cation of his own principles, it has been rather from an uncon
 querable reluctance to interfere, more than was necessary, with
 the dispositions of nature, than from the pride of erecting a
 system which should contravene her works.
     That the system thus formed is an artificial, and not a na
 tural one, must be admitted ; and that it was always so con
 sidered by Linnaeus, is evident from all his works.         Yet this
 characteristic is not to be taken without some limitations. And
 in the first place it may be observed, that by the mode of ar
 rangement which he has adopted, the major part of all known
 vegetables are formed into their groat natural combinations in
 such a manner as scarcely to be susceptible of further elucida
 tion. — Again, the genera of Linnaeus are uniformly natural ;
 or at least display such trivial exceptions as to oppose no ob
jection of any moment; and this purity in his genera may be
 considered as of the utmost importance to the character, not
 only of his own, but of any system.        It is therefore only with
 respect to the place which each genus occupies in his system,
 that any solid objection can be made; and if this be so si
 tuated as to be readily discovered, even although it may not
 in every instance be found amongst its nearest congeners, it is
 a defect which may be remedied by an accurate reference, and
 which as it is occasioned, so it must be excused, by the uni
 versality and facility of the system.      It would perhaps be too
 much to say that such an arrangement could not have been
 effected with less violation of natural affinities; but certain it is
 that with these affinities he was well acquainted, and the preser
 vation of them was constantly in his view; insomuch that, not
 withstanding its acknowledged defects, it may, by a due atten
 tion to its exceptions, be studied as a natural system with consi
 derable advantage ; whilst, at the same time, it affords an uni
versal key through every department of the vegetable world.
    The approbation with which the arrangement of Linnaeus
was received on its promulgation, and the subsequent adop
 tion of it into general use, may be considered as the most un
                                                            equivocal

                    Arrangements    of Plants.                    17
equivocal testimonies of its excellence. It is true, exceptions
have been taken against particular parts, and alterations sug
gested in departments of minor importance, even by the very
editors of his works.     To have expected perfection in the first
outline of a science, the materials of which are continually in
creasing, would be unreasonable ; and these alterations, in
stead of derogating from, do homage to the system which they
correct.     The period however is now arrived which is to try
its stability. — A rival has of late risen up, and has already be
come truly formidable. — Under the patronage and by the in
fluence of a neighbouring nation, this rival now comes for
ward, and demands universal homage.          Its advocates are not
only numerous, but    learned;  not only acute, but earnest. — That
their influence is daily increasing cannot be doubted ; and the
crisis is now arrived when their opinions must be either sub
mitted to, or resisted.
    Notwithstanding the favourable reception given to the sex
ual arrangement of plants, it is well known to have made but
little progress through the southern nations of Europe ; and
the French in particular refused implicitly to admit the novel
 doctrines of the Swede. In Botany, Tournefort continued to
 be their guide.    In Zoology, Buffon directed their steps ; and
 their example induced the Italians, and in some degree the
 Germans, to follow the same track.         From various circum
 stances, and particularly from the great accession of indivi
 duals of the vegetable kingdom to which the arrangement of
 Tournefort is wholly incompetent, his authority has declined ;
 but Linnaeus has not always gained the followers that Tourne
 fort has lost. Other leaders have risen up, and proposed ar
 rangements and nomenclatures of plants wholly different from
 those of Linnaeus ; and in particular, the successive efforts of
 the distinguished family of Jussieu have raised a standard to
 which many of the most eminent botanists of the present day
 think it an honour to resort.
    The system of the Jussieus, as originally proposed by Ber
 nard, and afterwards illustrated and amplified by Antoine
 Laurent de Jussieu, has higher pretensions than that of Lin-
 naeus, and professes not only to unite together in their natural
 orders such plants as are related to each other, but to form a
 complete arrangement, in which every known plant may be
 found in its proper situation, and every unknown plant may
 when discovered take its place among its congeners. A sy
 stem, in short, which unites all the advantages of a natural
 arrangement with the elucidation of a technical one ; and
 comprises within itself all that is requisite to botanical sci-

ence*.     If such a system could be established, it is evident
that  it must   render that of Linnaeus of no value ; or, rather,
must exhibit it as calculated only to mislead the student, and
amuse him with words, instead of communicating to him sub
stantial knowledge.
    In the execution of his task the younger Jussieu had pecu
liar advantages.     Since the time of Linnaeus the accessions to
the science nave been immense ; not only from the introduc
tion of new genera and species, which to him were wholly un
known, but from the greater attention which has been paid to
 the examination of the individuals of the vegetable kingdom ;
 the modes of their existence, ceconomy, and reproduction,
 and various other particulars connected with botanical studies.
 To enumerate merely the writers on these subjects whose
 works are entitled to approbation, would be to form a consi
 derable catalogue. That the mass of information thus ob
 tained has thrown great light on the physiology of plants, can
 not be doubted ; and no undertaking could be more com
 mendable, or more worthy of the talents of the illustrious
 scholar who engaged in          than that of endeavouring to apply
                                            it,
 such knowledge to general use, and showing the affinities and
 connections which nature has established between the indivi
duals of her vegetable kingdom.            The great utility of such
 a work     obvious
                is     its  foundations
                                   ;      are  deeply laid in the prin
 ciples of nature    and   in  order
                               ;     to  make       proficiency in such
                                                                    a
 study,       necessary to examine far beyond the exterior phae-
              it    is
 nomena which are requisite for an artificial arrangement.
 Hence the science acquires new dignity            and, instead of be
                                                                   ;
 ing conversant merely        with  exterior  "forms  and nominal di
 stinctions, becomes acquainted with the laws and operations of
 nature in one of the most important of her functions; that by
 which she elicits from unorganized matter the means of sup
 port for animal life.
    Of the ability with which Jussieu has executed his task, and
the impulse which he has given to these pursuits, every bota
 nical student    well informed nor
                          is                    possible to recommend
                                                   ;     is   it
 his writings, and those of several of his countrymen who have
 adoptetl, and perhaps improved upon his system, too earnestly
 to their attention, as elucidating the natural characters and
 relative connections of considerable portion of the vegetable

fullest extent, the expediency and utility of studying the na
tural arrangements of plants, but we are now required to adopt
this new system as a general arrangement and nomenclature,
in the stead of that of Linnaeus; to discard his labours, as of
 an inferior and a succedaneous kind; and to hail the moment
 when the great event, which he is said to have himself consi
 dered as the destruction of his own system, has actually taken
place.
      It is true the triumph of the new system has not yet been
 announced, even by its warmest promoters, in distinct and
 unambiguous terms ; but the very arrangement of a Genera
Plantarum, like that of Jussieu, offers it to universal use ; and
 the manner in which it is spoken of, both by him and his fol
 lowers, sufficiently demonstrates that this is its ultimate ob
ject, to the total exclusion of that of Linnaeus. In the very in
 troduction to his work, Jussieu has himself sufficiently dis
 closed his views, by the objections which he has brought against
 the system of his illustrious predecessor; the tendency of which
 is not merely to show that it is imperfect when considered as
 a natural arrangement, but that even as an artificial one it is
 not entitled to a preference. In arranging these objections
 Jussieu has observed, " 1. That the distinctions of the Lin-
  naean system are sometimes founded on the minuter organs
  of vegetables, requiring the use of glasses and instruments.
  2. That the method is arbitrary ; the distinctions of his classes
  being derived from some one part only; and that from a de
 ficiency of real characters he is compelled to adopt such as are
  inconstant, which he uses frequently and promiscuously, to
  the exclusion of those which are substantial. 3. That in deter
  mining by the number of stamina, not only genera nearly related
  to each other are frequently divided, but that even species are
   separated*." To these he adds many other objections of minor
  importance, and afterwards asserts, that " if a preference is to
  be given to that method which is the most easy, and the most
  agreeable to the order of nature, that of Tournefort is the most
  perfect ; that the arrangement of the Llnnaean system is some
  times perplexed, its designations difficult, and its connections
  of plants not related still more frequent; that it is indebted

and certainty of its characters, the number of individuals ar
ranged under each order, and the improved nomenclature by
generic and specific names*."        To this, however, he adds,
" that all such systems are arbitrarily constructed, that they
exhibit a factitious science, terminating not in the knowledge,
but merely in the defining and naming of plants; and that, in
short, they can only be considered as a prelude to the science
of botany* affording a succedaneous arrangement of plants,
until, by repeated labours, they can be reduced into a proper
and natural series ."            f
     From these and other observations to be found in the wri
tings of Jussieu, it is not difficult to perceive that the system
there proposed was intended to replace that of Linnaeus;
which from that time was presumed to be no longer necessary
to the student; and these pretensions have been enforced by
subsequent writers, who have adopted the arrangements of
Jussieu.    In his Discourse on the Study of Botany, prefixed
to  his " Tableau  du Regne Vegetal" M. Ventenat has not only
collected the authorities of several preceding botanists in dero
gation of the system of Linnaeus, but has even made use of the
authority of Linnaeus against himself.     In this, indeed, he has
in some degree followed the example of Jussieu, who has
availed himself of several passages from the writings of Lin
naeus to prove his acknowledgement of the superiority of a
natural method              J;
                      but this concession has been carried by
both these writers to an extent which Linnaeus certainly never
intended, and which it will not in any candid construction
bear. If we admit the interpretation put upon the writings of
 Linnaeus, he has himself acknowledged the futility and pro
 claimed the downfall of his own system, and has consequently
 released his followers from engaging in its defence.

its critics.   Some have said with Royenus,

whilst others have not hesitated to assert with Alston, that the
sexual system is full of difficulties, and that it is the least na
tural of all those that have been invented for the classification
of plants.
    " At this period," continues M. Ventenat, " when experi
ence has enabled us to appreciate the value of the sexual sy
stem, and envy and adulation are alike removed, we may
assert, without fear of being suspected of partiality, that Lin
naeus has himself acknowledged the inconveniencies attending
the sexual system.     This man of genius did not suffer himself
to be seduced by the delusions of self-love ; and he has frankly
acknowledged that his principles had sometimes compelled
him to deviate from the track of nature. — Let us not however
attach to the sexual method greater importance than was given
to it by its author.    Those who have read his works ouglit to
know that artificial methods were only considered by him as
introductory to the natural method. — In fact, the celebrated
naturalist of Upsal was all his life a zealous defender of na
tural combinations, as may be proved, in the first place, by
different axioms interspersed in his works.      2. In the Eulogia

in justification of these sentiments f, he adds, " It is remark
 able that this great man, after having in his public lectures
 demonstrated    plants according to the sexual system, in his
 private conferences with his most distinguished pupils deve
 loped the principles by which he had been guided in the esta
 blishment of his natural orders, and by his learned disserta

 vegetable productions^."

dered it as the highest department of the science, there can be
no difficulty in acceding to them ; but if they be intended to
show that he was of opinion that any arrangement of plants
on a natural system was to be preferred to, and might super
sede the use of, his own artificial arrangement, (and if this
was not the object in view, the introduction of the concessions
of Linnaeus is of no avail,) it may justly be observed that these
authors have either mistaken or not fairly represented the
meaning of Linnseus. — That natural affinities are to be studied,
and that this department of the science cannot be too diligently
cultivated, was his decided conviction. He has even frequently
contemplated the possibility of an arrangement which should
include in their natural orders the whole vegetable kingdom ;
but in alluding to such an event, it was always as a mere pos
sibility, of the completion of which he had scarcely a distant
hope: still less would he have been inclined to admit that
any such arrangement, even if it could be formed, could su
persede that which he had with so much assiduity demon
strated, and to which he invariably adhered to the close of his
life.    To collect together detached sentiments from his wri
tings for the purpose of proving that he preferred a natural
method to his own, as a general arrangement, is to pervert his
opinions, to render him the adversary of his own labours, and the
suicide of his own fame.       To the firm and inflexible convic
 tion of the practical superiority of his own method, all the
passages cited by these writers are strictly reconcileable; but
if any doubt remained on this subject, it would readily be dis
 sipated by a reference to his works.     Even in the brief intro
 duction to his own fragments of natural orders, he has placed
 it in so clear and perspicuous a light, that it is impossible to
 mistake it.   " Natural orders," says he, " cannot constitute a
 method without a key. In distinguishing plants, the artificial
 method is alone of any avail ; a natural method being scarcely,
 or rather not at all, possible. Natural orders are useful in
 acquainting us with the nature of plants, but an artificial me
 thod is requisite to their discrimination*." And to this he has
 added, in language that must for ever remove all ambiguity
 on this head, " Those persons who, instead of a natural me
 thod, have arranged plants in fragments of such a method,
 and reject an artificial one, seem to me to resemble those who,
 having a convenient and well roofed house, overturn            in     it,

    That Linnaeus has in many parts of his works highly com
mended those who have distinguished themselves in investi
gating the natural relations of plants, is certain ; but to sup
pose that by this he meant to approve of those who pretended to
have formed a natural arrangement, is to attribute to him an
opinion which he has disavowed in the most pointed terms.
" A real botanist," says he, " will investigate the natural order
of plants when it can be discovered ;" but, " he will not boast of
having discovered a system perfectly conformable to the laws
of naturef."         And among his diagnostics of pretended bo
tanists he particularly includes that of " presuming that they
are acquainted with a natural method J."

   I shall therefore now state to you the result of my limited in
   vestigation.
      To the ardour of M. Adolphe Brongniart, in the re
   searches he has so successfully made in collecting materials
  for the physical history of the formations which compose the
  crust of our planet, every geologist must feel interested ; as
  well as to Cuvier, Sternberg, Boue, Brown, D'Urville, and
  others, for their able and unremitting exertions in this dark
  field of early existence.     It has been reserved for this eminent
  young naturalist to present to the public a classification so na
  tural, and generally so clear, as greatly to facilitate the labours
 of those who interest themselves in such pursuits, and greatly
  to aid them in recording such particulars as may accidentally
 come under their immediate notice*.
     Impressed with the importance of this subject, I first of all
 availed myself of the kindness of Mr. Dolphin, head-agent to
  Messrs. Hall and Co., who solicited me to explore a vein called
 Jefleries Rake, in the Derwent mines, near Blanchland, in
 the county of Durham.           Having travelled up the adit about
 three quarters of a mile, we began to descend by the assistance
 of ladders. At the depth of about fifty-five fathoms below
 the surface, in a bed of sandstone nearly forty fathoms thick,
 we were gratified by a sight of some magnificent specimens of
 an ancient Flora, belonging to M. A. Brongniart's first pe
 riod of vegetable creation. The two varieties appear to be
 long to his third class,
                               " the Vascular Cryptogamia."               The
 first were<S/z£mar*'a(Lycopodiaceae);       the   second     were fine spe
 cimens, of great circumference, of Sigillaria (Filices). Two of
 these last-named specimens, which were situated in the space
 cleared out to get at the lead ore, stand erect, and their roots
 are firmly embedded in a thin stratum of bituminous shale,
 much carbonized.        1 should think the height of one of these
 prodigious fern stumps may be about five feet, and its dia
 meter probably exceeds two. The other, which has been
 kindly presented to me, may be seen in my museum, No. 14,
 Great King-street.        It has, I understand, been the opinion of
some gentlemen who have visited these ancient relics, that
they have been washed into, and deposited in their present
situation by some aqueous revolution.
     To this conclusion I must object, for two reasons.                First,
because the roots are firmly embedded          in  the shale, as     if  they
had remained undisturbed in their original earthy envelope;
and Secondly, because you may discover in each cheek of the
vein, other trunks of these members of this ancient Flora, in
the solid rock, the position and the appearance of which are
                                                                        more

     during the Deposit    of the Transition   and Coal series.     25
 more consistent with the supposition that they grew on the
 spot where they were found. The confused heaping, fractur
 ing and violence, which characterize diluvial action, axe not
 seen here.
    In proceeding towards the east,      I  received much valuable
information from my intelligent friends Mr. Buddie, an emi
nent coal viewer upon the rivers Tyne and Wear, and Mr.
 Hutton of Newcastle, whose anxiety in pursuit of this branch
of the science is so well known. In the great Newcastle coal
field, the fossil plants are generally in horizontal position, or
parallel with the strata, in the greatest possible confusion;
much broken, and the parts far separated.            Indeed, the con
fusion is the most serious difficulty the observer has to contend
with.    It is difficult, however, to trace the operation of a cur
rent of water sweeping off the weaker vegetables, and depo
siting them where we now find them so beautifully preserved.
 Notwithstanding this, there are to be found in considerable
abundance, in various positions, large and strong trunks of
plants which appear to remain in their natural position, and
which have been able to withstand the force of such torrent, if
it can be proved that any such did exist. These vertical
        I
plants have generally found to be the Sigillariec. The Sagi-
narice, the Stigmarice, and Calamites (speaking generally), on
the contrary, do not appear to have been sufficiently strong to
have resisted any revolutionary influence.          Below the main
seam (which according to Mr. Forster's section of the strata
is 150 yards below the surface), in a sandstone there are num
bers of fossil plants standing erect, with their roots in a small
seam of coal lying below.          These stems, as you will per
ceive by the following diagram, are truncated, and lost in this
seam, leaving room to believe they may have formed part of
this combustible mass or bed.
                            Ui;;h Main Seam.
   Again, in some of the seams, when the coal is worked away
by the miners, the roof often falls.       This is to a considerable
degree owing    to   the number   of vegetable impressions breaking
the coherence of the stratum and bringing    "
                                                   these fossils along
   N.S. Vol. 7. No. 37. Jan. 1830.                E               with

26  Mr. Withani   on the Vegetation of the First Period of the World,
with it. It must be observed that in almost every instance
they are surrounded by a coating of very fine coal, of about
half or three-quarters of an inch thick, having a polished sur
face, with very little attachment to the surrounding matter.
This,   I doubt not, is the cause of the fall ; the fossil dropping
out sometimes as much as three feet in length, leaving a
hole in the roof almost perfectly circular.          Often it falls in
these large pieces ; but sometimes the nature of the shale of
 which its substance is composed, causes it to fall in portions
 of different thickness. It is to these falling pieces that the
 miner's expressive term Kettle Bottoms applies.
    These fossil plants run from two to eight feet in circum
 ference.   The occurrence of numerous impressions which you
 may   observe  in the specimens of parts of different plants in
 the shale, forming the substance of these fossils, is to me, I must
 confess, very difhcult of explanation. Some years ago a friend
 of mine found a kettle bottom at old Kenton colliery, eighteen
 inches in diameter, coated with fine coal, the substance of
 which was entirely mineral carbon or charcoal, with a mixture
 of earthy matter and pyrites. A portion of this specimen is
 in the collection of the Geological Society.        It is much to be
 regretted that hitherto none of these interesting fossils have
 been followed into the strata.     We do not know how far they
 extend, or to what height they are standing.
    Again, in the coal districts of Scotland, amongst the troubles
 which affect the roofs of coal, there is one, of a very singular
 form, known by the name of Pot Bottom or Cauldron Bot
 tom, and are from the size of one foot to five feet in diameter.
 One of these is represented in the annexed diagram.
            A. Roof of coal, argil with     sand.
            B. Pot or cauldron bottom.
            C. Bituminous coal.
            D. Pavement of coal. Fire clay.
                                                                    In

     during the Deposit      of the Transition      and Coal series.      27
    In working the bed of coal, the miner generally knows that
 he is approaching        one of these by the coal becoming twisted
  and more difficult to work, and this continues till this trouble
  in the roof is passed.        The general form is similar to that re
  presented    in  the figure, when of course the mouth of the pot
  is always inverted, the sides of it are generally lined with coal
  from one-eighth of an inch to an inch in thickness, and the
  pot or cavity is filled up with stone of the argillaceous kind,
 or fire-clay, having generally less mixture of sand in it than
  is in the roof-stone around.         The under surface of the stone
 which fills the pot is irregular and waving, not smooth like
 the roof adjoining.
     Although the coal which lines the pot is connected with the
 main bed of coal, it is of a texture altogether different, having
 a bright appearance like jet, and it breaks into very minute cu
 bical pieces ; sometimes it has no bitumen in                  and
                                                              it,   is of the
 nature of glance coal. The sides of the pot are generally as
 smooth as glass, with small furrows or grooves in a vertical
 direction, so that there    is   very little tenacity between the sides
 of the pot and the stone which fills          it   up this circumstance
                                                     :
 renders these troubles very dangerous, particularly when they
 are of a large size, as they fall without giving any warning.
 The peculiar singularity attending this trouble,              isthe twisted
 texture and alteration which are found in the              bed  of coal im
 mediately under and adjoining         it,   without any mixture of the
 stone in it   which fills up the pot.
     There      sometimes no lining of coal, and         it  generally hap
           a is
        that            of             which    fills
 pens            piece      the stone,                up   the  pot, adheres
to the upper part of the cavity, so that              the   trouble may go
 further up into the strata than          is  imagined.        This trouble
 requires to be minutely investigated, and the pavement upon
which the coal rests should be examined under the trouble,
to ascertain      if
                   it   is in any way altered in its structure, as        is
 the case with the coal.
 I     am indebted to my much respected friend Mr. Bald, civil-
 engineer, for this latter information and     ;    I     am happy to say
that it
     is      his intention, at an early period, to devote his atten
tion to these singularly curious objects.
     Were further proof of the vegetable origin of coal wanting,
the fact of finding impressions of the Saginarice in the solid
coal,"the thin layers of incoherent carbonaceous matter, having
much of the silky aspect of charcoal, alternating with layers
of good bituminous coal, and bearing the form of the Catamites
most perfect, should go far to establish the vegetable origin
of these combustible beds.
                                  E   2                             Having

28   Mr.Witham ontheVegetationoftheFirstPeriodoftheWorld,
     Having now troubled you with the few facts                  I   have   been
able to collect in the coal districts further south, to which
I have added some remarks on the troubles of the Scotch ba
sins, —  I shall add some short observations on the neighbour
hood of this city. Here again, I have been fortunate in ob
taining many specimens of vascular cryptogamic plants, whose
natural substances have been transubstantiated into the sedi
mentary deposits in which they were entombed, with the ex
ception of their bark or outer coating, which is always much
carbonized.      The prevailing plants of this district, like those
of the Newcastle field, appear to be the Stgillarice, the Sagi-
narice, with a number of Catamites.
    I beg leave here to mention, that in the neighbourhood of
Burnt Island in Fifeshire, one of these vegetable fossils, the
Stigmaria of Brongniart, the Lepidodendron of Stern berg, with
 strong impressions of its leaves, occurs in a limestone.       This
is a circumstance by no means of common occurrence.             This
limestone is devoid of any testaceous or coralline remains, and
in appearance and composition, by analysis, varies little from
the limestone of the Portland oolite.      A deposit of limestone
also occurs at Hatton, near East Calder, containing terrestrial
 vegetable impressions.
    I now take the opportunity of introducing an account of
 that fossil member of early vegetation, discovered in the year
 1826, in the quarry of Craigleith. — The length of time which
 has been allowed to elapse without attempting to obtain the
 necessary information respecting this singular plant, — add to
 that, the peculiarity of its structure and composition, — has in
 duced me to take much pains upon this point.           I therefore
 laid a well cut transverse and also longitudinal section of this
 fossil tree before Mr. Hincks, botanical curator to the Phi
 losophical Society of York.     His opinion     that    is,a mono-
                                                                 it   is
 cotyledonous plant; as a pithy substance fills up the interstices
 between the vessels, and that there has been no bark or con
 centric arrangement of layers.       He also observes       striking a
 resemblance    to certainly monocotyledonous stems, which he
 has before examined.       " On the whole," Mr. Hincks says,
 " having made the examination of this curious specimen sub
 mitted to me, with the greatest care,       can scarcely admit of
                                                   I
a   doubt upon the subject*."
     Since writing this paper
     *
                              have received
                                   I         kind communication from
                                                    a
Mom. A. Brongniart, through Mr. Philips of York, to the following effect.
" Please to inform Mr. Witham that have received his
                                           I           specimen of the
Craigleith   fossil plant.   It   has much surprised and interested me.     Having
                                                                             The

     during the Deposit        of the Transition and Coal    series.      29
   The internal structure, its singular colour when contrasted
with the block of sandstone in which it was found, induced
me to request my friend Mr. Nicol to analyse it.      The fol
lowing was the result :
               60 per cent of carbonate of lime.
               18 per cent of oxide of iron.
               10 per cent of alumine.
                9 per cent of carbonaceous matter.
The height of this gigantic plant was thirty-six feet; three
feet diameter at its base, and lying in nearly horizontal posi
tion corresponding with the dip.         No branches were found.
This therefore, with a few others I could here mention, and
which I trust will ere long be submitted to your considera
tion, form but trifling exceptions to the general distribution
of early vegetation.
    Thus in these great coal-fields (exclusive of the many varie
ties of plants found in the bituminous shale, which I am happy
to say will shortly be submitted to the public, in a work in-
titled " The Fossil Flora of Great Britain," by Mr. Lindley,
 Professor of Botany in the London University, and my friend
Mr. Hutton of Newcastle) we find theopinionof M.A. Brong-
niart most completely verified; namely, that the vascular cry-
ptogamic plants had a vast numerical proportion ; and in fact,
of 260 species discovered in this terrain or period, 220 belong
to this class.      " Should however," adds M. A. Brongniart,
" more precise observations or new discoveries make known
in the old formation, some plants of more than one of the
classes which we have admitted, or even some species of
one of the classes which have appeared to us to be wanting at
this epoch, still the essential relation of these classes to each
other would be but slightly modified.          Thus it might be
proved, that certain, yet little known genera of the coal for
mation, are true dicotyledonous plants. Yet it would not be
the less certain, that the vascular cryptogamic plants were
 by much the most numerous vegetables, during the first period
 of vegetation." The same remarks he makes respecting the
 lias, and other formations.        Thus whatever new discoveries
 may   be made    in  the vegetables of this period, from the first
 deposit  of the  transition rocks to the top of the coal-field, yet
 the essential characters can be but slightly modified, and this
 period will always remain perfectly distinct.
     The more gentlemen will therefore interest themselves in
had so little time for examination, I cannot now give a final,   but only a
conditional opinion.   Itis,that I  believeit to be a section    of  mono-
                                                                      a
cotyledoDous plant."

 SO                on the Vegetation   of the First Periodqfthe
 promoting     the examination    of these ancient relics, the more
  likely are they   to perceive  the time fast approaching, when
  we shall be able with greater certainty to ascertain each de
  posit by the peculiarity of its vegetable fossils.
     The essential character therefore of this first period of ve
 getation is proved to be the predominance of vascular crypto-
 gamic plants; and we have here a most striking example of
 the great development which the species in question had at
 tained in this first period of vegetable creation, when the two
 principal agents, heat and moisture, had evidently exerted an
 extraordinary influence.
     Geologists have entertained, and do entertain, very different
 notions respecting the origin of coal.
     It appears very probable, from the singular development of
 the vegetation of the first period, that these different combus
 tible beds may have been deposited as a kind of peat of greater
 or less extent, formed from the remainder of vegetables, and
 on which other vegetables still grew. This opinion        is,
                                                            Ishould
 think, greatly confirmed by the description just given of the
 Newcastle coal-field.     It  appears also the more probable, as
it   iswell known that many plants of the families composing
 this early vegetation, grow abundantly in localities of this kind.
 The Equisetum (Horsetail), the Osmunda regalis (Royal
 Moonwort), and the Lycopodium (Club Moss), are all indi
genous in our peat soils. Again, we can scarcely doubt, that
 at this remote epoch our atmosphere had a very different
composition from what     it  now has, and that its difference ex
erted a powerful influence upon the formation of those bodies
of vegetable combustion. The comparison of the successive
development of vegetables and animals          not one of the least
                                              is
remarkable parts of the study of these fossil organized bodies.
 This      beautifully expressed by M. A. Brongniart
          is                                                He dis
plays by a philosophical reasoning the effects produced by a
supposed cause.        He states with great perspicuity, why land
animals did not exist at one period; why cold-blooded animals
became more numerous at another period and lastly, he gives
                                                 ;
cogent reasons for the appearance of animals of        amore com
plicated structure, the mammiferae and birds, in the fourth
period.
    M. A. Brongniart's reasonings upon this subject are so well
epitomized by Professor Jameson, in the PhilosophicalJournal
for March 1829, that   I    should think     improper at present
                                            it
to enter into more minute details.
    The study of this occult science truly opens a hidden field
of animated beings and things, whose early call into existence
                                                             proves

Tables  for  the conversion into each other     of Space and Time,   31
proves the omnipotence of the design.             It brings into view a
•world little looked into or thought of, owing to the obscurity
with which it was surrounded.          It develops the early, the sub
lime, the successive works of the great Creator, which before
were all supposed to be drowned and scattered about by the
mighty burstings of a universal deluge. In other words, the
contemplation of these stupendous operations is the true phi
losophy of the science of geology.           If therefore the attention
lately paid   to the study of  fossil  conchology has been so highly
instrumental in clearing up the many doubts respecting the
different sedimentary formations; if the works of Baron Cuvier
and others, founded on the early observations of Werner, have
aflbrded us so many interesting proofs of successive creations,
from those of the early inhabitants of the deep up to the more
complicated structure of the quadruped ; — may we not expect
equal pleasure and instruction from an application to the
 study of these ancient vegetable remains, which when once
properly examined, will facilitate our knowledge of the forms,
 characters and qualities peculiar to each epoch, and of the
 degree of temperature and humidity which must have existed
 during each successive period.

Nov. 30,       1829. — This day being the Anniversary, the following Ad
  dress 'was delivered by the President, Davies Gilbert, Esq. M.P. Sfc.
         a former occasion I had the honour to observe, that however
 ON   gratifying, or even festive, might be the general character of
theseannual assemblages of men engaged in the active pursuit, or in
the patronage of science ; yet we could not hope entirely to escape
from the usual admixture of pain with pleasure, and of good with
evil, incident to all human affairs ; that we must expect to hear, with
feelings of deep regret, the names of various persons announced to
us as departed from this life ; of persons endeared to us by private
friendships growing out of similar occupations and pursuits, or made
objects of our regard and esteem by their splendid careers in the
fields of science, by the credit they had acquired for themselves, for
this Society, for their country, by their enlargement of human know
ledge, and by the consequent benefits they had bestowed on mankind.
    Such must undoubtedly be our feelings at such review of the
preceding year : but in no previous interval of twelve months has
the Society collectively, or have its individual members, experienced
losses so severe, or so much in every respect to be deplored, as may
be selected from the list this instant read.

S't                         Royal Society.
    The names of Wollaston and of Young and of Davy must occur
to every one.
    I should have shrunk, under any circumstances, from the un
equal task of endeavouring to explain, to illustrate, or to appreciate
the works of individuals so preeminent ; fortunately for me, the
duty is not required.     Each of these distinguished persons has al
ready obtained a biographer who will not fail to employ his utmost
exertions in discussing topics which I could but slightly touch.     A
recital of the titles merely of their various works would occupy a
large portion of the time usually employed on these occasions.
                             WOLLASTON.
    Dr. William Hyde Wollaston, having passed through the regular
gradations of English education, and obtained a Fellowship at Cam
bridge, devoted some few of his earliest years to the ordinary
practice of medicine.      But confident in his own abilities, buoyant
on the hereditary talents of his family, and urged by that ardent
desire for investigating physical truths, for interrogating Nature,
and recording her responses, which those alone who have felt are
duly qualified to appreciate, Dr. Wollaston withdrew himself from
medical practice and from the country; repaired to London, and
there employed the whole powers of his mind in those pursuits which
have since raised him to the eminence he has so justly obtained.
    His first communication to the Society arose out of the profes
sion he had left — An Examination of Gouty Concretions and of
Calculi. In this analysis, with the acumen that distinguished him
through life, Dr. Wollaston detected essential discriminations of
species which had been previously confounded, and the importance
of the research may well be exp'ressed in his own words: —
    " If in any case a chemical knowledge of the effects of diseases
will assist us in the cure of them, in none does it seem more likely
to be of service than in the removal of the several concretions that
are found in various parts of the body."
    Medical investigations were, however, soon abandoned for the
great departments of Metallurgy, Electro-Chemistry, Optics,
 Crystallography, Astronomy.
    In the first, two new metals, Palladium and Rhodium, were dis
covered among the ores of platinum, about the time that platinum
itself was rendered malleable in large masses, and thereby adapted to
 the uses and wants of the philosophical world. The two metals, with
 all the processes requisite for their extraction, and all their known
 properties of combination, solution, precipitation, &c., as matters
 of scientific discovery, were forthwith communicated to our Trans
 actions; but the manipulations used in consolidating platinum, not
 involving any general principle, he deemed, and rightly deemed, a
 species of private property, imposing no other duty on the possessor
 than to furnish an ample and steady supply adequate to the de
mand. This he most satisfactorily afforded ; and finally he made
 known <o the public, through our Society, the art of manufacturing
 this metal ; thereby giving to science that which might have been
fairly retained as a family inheritance.
                                                                   The

                             Royal Society.                         35
   The science of Crystallography dates a new aera from his inven
tion of the Reflective Goniometer.     That delicate instrument, by
discriminating angles previously compounded one with another, has
proved that a vast variety of substances have primitive forms or
cleavages peculiar to themselves, and consequently exhibit external
angles descriptive of the individual or of the class.
   Besides inventing the goniometer, Dr. Wollaston has bestowed
on the science of Optics, various improvements of telescopes and
microscopes, and a deep investigation into the arrangement and into
the functions of the optic nerves.
   We have also the Camera Lucida, founded on the ingenious
principle of allowing two pencils of rays, distinct and independent
from each other, to enter the pupil of an eye at the same time. By
this contrivance the most complicated forms may be delineated
with perfect accuracy; and we owe to the same ingenuity the ap
plication of concavo-convex lenses to the most extensively benefi
cial of all optical contrivances, thereby enlarging the field of view
and rendering vision more distinct.
   We are indebted, moreover, to the same powerful mind for in
teresting astronomical speculations, extending beyond the limits
of the solar system ; for several mechanical inventions ; and for
assistance afforded to our manufacturers in their chemical pro
cesses.
   These talents and these exertions have enrolled the name of
Wollaston on the lists of all the most learned Societies of Europe.
   Much more remains to be noticed; but I must here close. The
editor of a volume can alone do justice to this extraordinary man.
                               YOUNG.
   Dr. Thomas Young came into the world with all the advantages
of early ability cultivated by academical education and improved
by foreign travel, and with a confidence in his own talents growing
out of an expectation of excellence entertained in common by all
his friends ; an expectation more than realized in the progress of
his future life.
   Mathematics in the most abstruse recesses of modern improve
ments ; astronomy, theoretical and practical ; experimental       and
 mechanical philosophy; chemistry; natural history; ancient and
modern languages ; philology ; in addition to the regular practice
of medicine; were carried to such an extent that each might have
 been supposed to have exclusively occupied the full powers of his
mind.
   One thus highly endowed by the gifts of Nature and stored with
the multifarious fruits of labour and of assiduous application, might
well be imagined to have satisfied himself with the possession of abs
tract or general knowledge, disposed rather to speculate on systems
than to descend into the region of individual facts.      On the con
trary, Dr. Young, as if time could be extended at his will, has pe
culiarly distinguished himself by labour in detail.
    We have from him A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy,
                                 F2                                and

and the Mechanical Arts, in two volumes quarto ; a work replete
with the most minute and multifarious details, and with references
to all known writings on the different subjects.
    We have from him Elementary Illustrations of the Celestial Me
chanics of Laplace, displaying such powers of rendering simple and
familiar the obscurities of a work in all other respects equal to the
highest expectations of the present age, that one cannot but deeply
regret the sudden discontinuance of what promised so much utility
to the rising generation, by smoothing difficulties, and thus leading
on young minds to the attainment of what the Greeks KO.T
                                                                e^o^v
denominated Learning.
    Dr. Young did not neglect to illustrate various subjects con
nected with his more immediate profession. Among several others,
A Treatise on Consumption has obtained a considerable degree of
reputation.     But the most difficult investigations gave him, in all
probability,   the  greatest delight.    The corpuscular and vibratory
theories of light ; the motions and oscillations of fluids, with the
theory of the tides ; the nature and powers of capillary attraction;
 were objects of his peculiar and successful attention.     Magnetism
 as connected with electricity ; the magnetism and figure of the
earth ; the whole theory of chances, with the probable duration of
 human life; the difficult task of determining, with an accuracy
 sufficient for scientific purposes, the exact interval between the
 line of suspension and the centre of oscillation, of bodies not as
sumed to possess any strict geometrical forms or unvarying densi
 ties; the different temperatures of the Diatonic scale, are among
 the various subjects illustrated by his care: while the duties of
 Secretary to the Board of Longitude, involving a minute and con
 stant superintendence of the Nautical Almanac, throughout all the
 stages of its construction,    and final publication, were sufficient,
 during many years, to have absorbed a large portion of the time of
 any ordinary man.       But, at the very moment when these duties
 had become, from different causes,         most burdensome on his
 mind, a new object for pursuit was found and eagerly followed
 through fields heretofore unexplored.      The military occupation of
 Egyi'1 D7 an European power in the concluding years of the last
 century, together with the investigations made during that time
 into the stupendous and interesting remains of antiquity still pre
 served in that far-famed country, did not fail of exciting an ardent
 curiosity throughout the civilized world, respecting the figures and
 characters engraved on the most durable materials, but of which
 nothing had been known since the revival of letters, beyond a tradi
 tional account, derived from ancient writers, of their being Hiero
 glyphics.    The discovery, however, of some Polyglot inscriptions
 having been supposed likely to afford a key, several men of great
 learning and in different countriesjoined eagerly inthecareer of decy-
 phenng them ; among whom Dr. Young is supposed to have maintain
 ed the precedence which he first gained. One very curious and im
 portant fact has been established beyond the reach of doubt or con
 troversy.    When foreign nations, the Persians, the Greeks and the
                                                              Romans,

Romans, gained possession of the country and learnt the use of
these symbolical characters, they endeavoured in succession to ex
press the particular sounds of their own languages in proper names,
by using the hieroglyphic as an acrostic of the word with which it
had been previously associated in the original designation of things.
The same process is said to be now actually in progress with the
symbolic characters of China*, making a certain limited number of
characters Acrostic and Phonic: and thus has been developed the
only rational manner in which the greatest of all human inventions,
the formation of an alphabet, could have been achieved. As a pre
cious yet melancholy gift, we may shortly expect a posthumous
work on the Egyptian or Coptic language, in part dictated by the
dying breath of this most distinguished person, of whom it may
therefore be truly said, that from the tomb he illuminated mankind.
   I must here conclude my inadequate and superficial sketch,
drawing, however, if one may be permitted to do so, an inference
from one so preeminent; that, although expatiating through the
    * " Though it is likely that all
                                     hieroglyphical languages were originally
founded on the principles of imitation, yet in the gradual progress towards
arbitrary forms and sounds, it is probable that every society deviated from
the originals in a different manner from the others ; and thus for every in
dependent society, there arose a separate hieroglyphic language. As soon
as a communication       took place between any two of them, each would
hear names and sounds not common to both.              Each reciprocally would
mark down such names, in the sounds of its own characters, bearing, as
hieroglyphics, a different sense.    In that instance, consequently, those cha
racters cease to be hieroglyphics, and were merely marks of sound.                If
the foreign sounds could not be expressed but by the use of a part of two
hieroglyphics, in the manner mentioned to be used sometimes in Chinese
dictionaries, the two marks joined together, became in fact a syllable.      If a
frequent intercourse should take place between communities speaking dif
ferent languages, the necessity of using hieroglyphics merely as marks of
 sound, would frequently recur.        The practice would lead imperceptibly
 to the discovery that, with a few hieroglyphics, every sound of the foreign
 language might be expressed ; and the hieroglyphics, which answered best
 this purpose, either as to exactness of sound or simplicity of form, would
 be selected for this particular use ; and, serving as so many letters, would
 form, in fact, together what is called an alphabet.      This natural progres
 sion has actually taken place in Canton, where, on account of the vast
 concourse of persons, using the English language, who resort to     it,   voca
                                                                           a
 bulary has been published of English words in Chinese characters, expres
 sive merely of sound, for the use of the native merchants concerned               in
 foreign trade; and who, by such means, learn the sound of English words.
 To each character  is  annexed    a mark, to denote that it    not intended to
                                                               is
 convey the idea, but merely the foreign sound attached to it. The habit
 of applying the sound, instead of the meaning of hieroglyphics, to foreign
 words, leu to the application of them likewise as sounds, to assist the me
 mory in the pronunciation of other hieroglyphics in the same language,
 but not in common use   ;   and the repeated application of them for those
 purposes may be at length supposed to have effaced their original use." —

                                   DAVY.
    I am now led by the succession of melancholy events to that
portion of my duty on the present occasion, which is by far the
 most painful to myself.
    With Wollaston and with Young I have been intimately ac
 quainted for many years; but Davy I have known from his child
 hood. I knew his parents, his family, and his relations. I witnessed
his commencement in science, and by recommending him, at that
decisive moment, to the patronage of Dr. Beddoes, I may have had
the good fortune to fix and to smooth the splendid course which
has carried him to that pinnacle of Fame, which his abilities, his
energies, and inventive faculties, entitled him to attain.
    It may not be uninteresting here to notice the first experiment
that gave me a strong feeling of his merit, and which I believe has
never been laid before the public.
    Davy, then about seventeen, had formed an opinion adverse to
caloric, or to the materiality of heat, and he attempted an experi-
mentum crucis in the following manner : — Having procured a piece
of mechanism set in motion by a spring, he added two horizontal
plates of brass, the upper one carrying a small metallic cup, to be
filled with ice, revolved in contact with the lower.        The whole ma
chine, resting on a plate of ice, was covered by a glass receiver,
and the air exhausted.        It was then allowed to move, when the
ice in the small cup was soon observed to melt ; and the conclusion
was drawn that this effect could proceed from vibratory motion
alone, since the whole apparatus was insulated from all accession
of material heat by the frozen mass below, and by the vacuum
around it.
    This experiment does not, unquestionably, decide the important
matter in dispute with respect to our ethereal or transcendental
fluid ; but few young men remote from the society of persons con
versant with science, will I believe any where present themselves,
who are capable of devising any thing so ingenious.
    Davy continued his researches on the nature of heat after his
removal to Dr. Beddoes at Clifton in the autumn of 1798, and
published them in a provincial collection of tracts.           This paper
                                                                   caught

caught the attention of Count Rumford, arid became the medium
of his invitation to the Royal Institution.
   At Clifton, Davy's thoughts were directed to a multiplicity of
subjects, many having reference to the main object of Dr. Bed-
does's pursuit at that time, — the application of factitious airs or
gases to the purposes of medicine.     In his system of therapeutics,
as in the subsequent theories of electro-chemistry,       oxygen, the
supporter of combustion, held one extremity of the scale as a sti
mulus, while inflammable gases occupied the other extremity, as
sedatives ; various combinations were tried.    Carbonated hydrogen
was thought to be narcotic.        Azote or nitrogen, in its simple
state appeared to be noxious only from the absence of oxygen ;
combined with that active principle, in what has since been named
a Deutoxide, it produced instantaneous suffocation.         The prot
oxide had indeed been made, and to a certain degree examined ;
but it was reserved for Davy to ascertain its exact proportions,
previously to the establishment of the atomic theory, and to mul
tiply experiments on the medical qualities of an air supposed to
increase present action without inducing subsequent debility, and
to act rather by augmenting the power of receiving excitement,
the excitability, than in the usual mode of stimulus.       The inge
 nuity of the chemist who investigated Gaseous Oxide remains upon
record, but the panacea has long since vanished into empty space.
    Here Davy exercised himself, moreover, in one of the most
 beautiful departments of analytical chemistry, and to which the
destructive operations of our predecessors were directly opposed —
the ascertaining proximate elements of organic substances.         He
mainly in these researches separated and distinguished the prin
 ciple forming an insoluble compound with gelatine, from the gallic
 acid, to which it is nearly allied.   He ascertained its identity in
various vegetable bodies, and improved its application to the pur
poses of manufacture.       But the discoveries that will enroll his
 name among those few destined to go down to the latest posterity,
 were made in London and at the Royal Institution : —
    The metallizing the alkalies and the earths, which has opened
 entirely new views into the material world, with reference to the
 construction of the earth, of volcanic actions, and of the most
 curious meteorological phenomena.
    The ascertaining that galvanic action augments, reduces, or in
 verts all chemical affinities, so as to carry alkalies through acids,
 and with a power of magic to transfer the constituent parts of a
 compound body to the opposite poles of a galvanic pile.          This
 union of electricity with chemistry must for ever rank among the
 most splendid of theoretical discoveries.     It has disclosed views
 entirely  new  of the most  important energies of nature ; and when
 the action of electro-chemistry shall have become, like extended
 quantity, subject to rigorous calculation, and when the powers
 of corpuscular attraction shall be thus placed within our reach, the
 whole must be referred to the acumen of that mind which first de
                                                                tected

tected the principle, leaving to others the comparatively         easy
 task of subsequent addition.
    The true nature of that substance previously named oxymuri-
atic acid, with the discovery of a new supporter of combustion ne
gative in comparison with all other substances except oxygen on
 the galvanic scale. This discovery, like those already noticed, has
impressed a new form on chemical science, and especially it has
corrected some too hasty generalizations in the theories and in the
 nomenclature of that most distinguished chemist who enlightened
 the world through the medium of a new language.
    To these may be added, on account of its practical utility and
 the ingenuity of its construction, although on -a scale not in any
degree commensurate to .those of discoveries affecting general prin
ciples or extensive science, — the invention of what has been termed
the safety lamp, for guarding against the explosion, in coal mines,
of inflammable air. The fact had previously been observed, that
flame would not pass through narrow tubes. I have letters from
Davy which explain the progress of his thoughts.        His first idea
was to admit air at the lower surface of the lamp through tubes
sufficiently long, and slender in diameter to exclude flame ; and to
allow the escape of air through similar tubes at the top ; surround
ing the sides with glass, talc, or horn, in the usual way. But since
internal combustion and explosion cannot be avoided, it is obvious
 that such coatings must be liable at least to the danger of being
scorched or burst. I have a second or a third letter with the fol
lowing query : — Since the length of a tube adequate for resisting
flame appears to diminish in some higher ratio than its section, may
not the interstices of wire gauze be considered as tubes, and the
thickness of the gauze itself as their lengths? — And if so, will not
wire gauze, made sufficiently fine, stop the progress of flame and be
free from the dangers attached to other transparent substances, from
internal explosion ? I need not add that this plan has succeeded.
    The protection of copper sheathing on vessels, I have had oc
casion to notice in a former year ; and 1 shall only repeat, that it
forms a most legitimate deduction from the laws of electro-che
mistry ; and that whenever practical difficulties shall be overcome,
a doubt can scarcely be entertained of its ultimate success.
    Such is the imperfect sketch that I have presumed to give of
Sir Humphry Davy, omitting much of importance in his high cha
racter of an inventive philosopher, by which he has added to the
credit, to the honour, and to the fame, of this most distinguished
Society, by which he has diffused a lustre on the province which
gave him birth and on the entire nation to which he belonged.
   Some short account of so extraordinary a man in his early years,
may however be expected from the only member of the Society
who has witnessed them.
   In infancy his mind ran upon romance. He had probably read
or heard some tales of chivalry. His ardent wish was to issue forth
armed cap-a-pie and to clear the world of giants and monsters. At
                                                               school,

   school, in Penzance, he advanced to eastern tales and legend*, so
   that many contemporaries remember standing round him with de
   light, whilst he repeated, varied or invented fiction for their amuse
   ment.   The gradation from this habit to measured poetry was
  natural and easy.      The grand objects of nature laid hold on his
  imagination   ; and we have from his pen, at an age not much further
   advanced, a poem on St. Michael's Guarded Mount, equal, if not
  superior, to any of the numerous tributes paid to that magnificent
  promontory, equally interesting to the antiquary, to the geologist,
  and to the admirers of scenery at once rugged and sublime. Paint
  ing, about the same time, became also a favourite amusement ;
  and specimens, indicative of no common genius, may now be seen
  at the Royal Institution, where they illustrated his admirable,
  and admired Lectures.
      These attempts at painting become doubly and trebly interesting
  on another account.     Some of his contemporaries have expressed
  to me their belief, that experiments instituted for the purpose of
  preparing colours, first directed Davy to the pursuit of chemistry.
  Notwithstanding these various avocations, his advancement in school
 learning at Truro, under Dr. Cardew, in whose praise as a master
 too much cannot be expressed, was equal to that of his most able
 companions ; and Davy returned to the house of his benefactor at
 Penzance, with sufficient acquirements, and with sufficient means
 derived from his father, for executing his favourite plan of studying
 at Edinburgh, and there procuring a Medical degree. The execution
 was, however, delayed by the advice and authority of Mr. Tonkin,
 who recommended a preparatory medical education at Penzance.
 It was finally abandoned, I believe, at the Royal Institution.
     In a work composed on the bed of sickness, and when all rational
 hope of a permanent recovery had ceased, the original genius of his
 youth again burst forth ; a spirit which had bestowed on his Lec
 tures an eloquence and an interest to be derived from no other
 sources.     No one can read Salmonia without having feelings ex
 cited similar to those of the writer ; no one, reading it,  could form
 any other opinion than that of its author having devoted the whole
 of his time to the exclusive cultivation of natural history and of
elegant literature.
     The poetic bent of Davy's mind seems never to have left him.
 To that circumstanceI     would ascribe the distinguishing featuresin
his character, and in his discoveries — vivid imagination sketching
                                    :   a
out new tracts in regions unexplored, for the judgement to select
those leading to the recesses of abstract truth.
     Having characterized Davy by poetic genius,   I     would venture
to ascribe minute accuracy, even in the merest trifles, as the dis
tinction of Wollaston, and almost universal acquirements as the
characteristic of Young. While in soundness of judgement com
bined with general ability of the highest class, no discriminations
can be found.

other names will unfortunately be found of individuals highly en
titled to our respect and regard.
    Among these     I would mention Dr. Edward Ash.
    Dr. Ash has not,    I believe, honoured our Transactions with any
communication ; but his acquirements in science are well known,
and every contemporary at Oxford will attest the elevated reputa
tion he obtained in the University for the classic literature culti
vated in that seat of learning.     In after life he adorned the profes.
sion from which this Society has derived a large portion of its
splendour and renown.
     Lord Buchan, a man of genius and of letters, to whom the world
is indebted for a Life of Napier, with an account of his most splen
did invention, the canon of logarithms, without which neither the
Tables, nor the reductions of modern Astronomy, could be exe
cuted, nor many of the formulae in the higher geometry be brought
Into practical use. For nearly ten years Lord Buchan has re
mained the senior Fellow of this Society, ever since the decease of
 the late king, who for some years bore in a double sense, the re
 lation of father to the Royal Society.
     Lord Oriel, late Mr. Foster, Speaker of the Irish House of Com
 mons, was distinguished for his attention to the agriculture, to the
 trade, and to the manufactures of the nation, more especially of
 that part with which he was most intimately connected; and during
 a life so long continued, that he alone, of all the gentlemen of the
 United Kingdom who were members of the last parliament of
 George the Second, lived to take a seat in the parliament of the
 present king.
     Mr. Smithson has added eight communications to our Transac
tions.    He was distinguished by the intimate friendship of Mr. Ca
 vendish, and rivalled our most expert chemists in elegant analyses :
 but the latter part of his life has been passed abroad.
     Sir Christopher Hawkins was not merely the patron, but the ac
 tive promoter of science and knowledge in Cornwall, his native
 county, where so ample a field is laid open for investigation ; and
 he has given to the world an ingenious treatise On the Trade of the
 Ancients with Britain for Tin, its then only export.
     Dr.Wavell has been distinguished by the discovery of a very pe
 culiar mineral, — a sub-phosphate of alumina, — to which his name
 has been affixed.
     The Rev. Robert Mares, a gentleman eminent for general profi
 ciency in literature, and whom we have all known and esteemed.
     And lastly, I would mention Mr. Tavel, highly distinguished as
 a tutor in the University, and the particular college, most eminent
 for physical sciences ; and we have to lament his loss at a period of
 life when the attainments of early youth are most likely to be ren
 dered beneficial to the world.

    M. Vauquelin was born, I apprehend, about the year 1763 :
 thirty year8 afterwards he became associated with M. Fourcroy,
and he has since ascended through all the honours of science be
stowed in France, and in 1823 his name was inscribed on the Fo
reign List of the Royal Society.       His communications to different
Societies have been numerous, and we have a separate work on the
difficult art of assaying metals with reference to their commercial
importance.      M. Vauquelin undoubtedly ranked high among the
band of natural philosophers who have given in the last fifty years
an impulse to science never before experienced, and never expected
to occur.
    On delivering the Medals : —
                            MR. CHABLES BELL.
    To no department of science     has the Royal Society been indebted
in nearly so great a degree for eminently distinguished members or
for important communications, as to that of Medicine.
    OuSsts d-ysuip.erpyTts eurtnu was the inscription affixed to the aca
demy of Plato. — "Let no one without ability, acquirements and
                        "
industry, enter here       might be inscribed on a School of Medicine.
 But the man of ability, of acquirement and of industry, once within-
the walls, finds himself surrounded by so many objects for inquiry,
important in themselves and calculated to raise the feelings, on every
side, that his exertions are excited and his energies called into
action, till all the powers of his mind acquire the habit of applying
themselves with full and undivided efforts to whatever subject is
presented to their grasp.
    The object to which Mr. Bell has successfully applied the ener
gies of his powerful mind is one preeminently conspicuous in his
 own profession and in its utility to mankind.       Of all the branches
 of human knowledge, anatomy has experienced the greatest diffi
 culties in struggling against passions, prejudices, and superstition.
 Throughout the Mahometan world I believe the science is un
 known.      Astronomy,     chemistry, general knowledge have been
 persecuted in dark ages ; but here, and in these times, in the
 country which gave birth to Harvey three hundred years ago, dif
 ficulties are still opposed against the acquirement of this most
 practical and useful science; so that, unless some remedy is applied,
 experience must be hereafter acquired by operations on the living
 subject, instead of on those in which vitality and the sense of pain
 are no longer to be found.
     From these and from other causes the progress of anatomy has
 been peculiarly slow.      The skeleton, indeed, obtruded itself into
 notice by so many ways, that osteology grew into a science by
 efforts of its own. To this, after a considerable interval, was added
 a knowledge of the muscles, of the digestive and secretory organs,
 with that branch of the absorbents then named the lacteals.         The
 circulation of the blood, as we all know, was discovered by the
 great Harvey, whose portrait adorns this room.            The nature of
 respiration could not be developed till modern chemistry had as
  certained the nature and the composition of elastic fluids ; and the
                                    G 2                            genera

 general system of lymphatics, diffused over the whole body and end
 ing in the subclavinn vein, has been reserved almost for our own
  time. There still remained a system the most important of all, the
 medium connecting the sentient, the self-moving principle, with
 the external frame ; the principle that imparts the vital energies to
  common matter destined to lose them all when that communication
 is withdrawn.      The mere existence of nerves has indeed been long
 known, but, till latter times, in a manner so imperfect that tendons
 were blended with them, and the error has not yet entirely disap
 peared from the phrases of common speech. At last the nerves were
 delineated on plates and described in words; their origins found in
 the brain, the medulla oblongata, and the spinal cord ; their
 courses traced through conglobate glands, and, after blending with
 each other in a thousand different ways, they were found to con
 stitute a net-work surrounding and penetrating the whole animated
 frame.    Conjectures were formed as to different functions being
 imputable to different nerves, as to the use of ganglions, and as to
 the probable cause of assimilated actions and of distant sympathies
 residing in those nervous intersections.
     We are indebted to Mr. Bell for much more than realizing all that
 could previously be considered but as mere hypothesis.             We learn
 from his most profound researches, That nerves subservient to the
 mere functions of life may be traced, even in the human frame ex
 hibiting a simplicity of construction little different from those of
 the lowest animals. That, as the scale of being advances, nerves
 are superadded differing in their origin, in the purposes for which
 they serve, and of a complexity proportionate to the variety of
 functions they have to perform, associating the actions and feelings
 of parts otherwise unconnected, as is peculiarly observable in the
 nerves affecting respiration and in those of the face ; thus adapting
 the whole frame to the performance of those complicated duties for
 which it is designed.      We further learn — That all the nerves con
 nected with voluntary muscles, and not these alone, have a double
 origin arising from distinct roots, and from distinct columns of the
 spinal marrow; that each part continues separate from the other
 throughout the whole of their course, and of their ramifications,
 one part conveying the influence of the will, the other part trans
 mitting sensation in an opposite direction ; thus establishing a
 circle of actions. — But I am conscious of my inability to convey any
adequate idea of those most important researches, the subject of
five communications printed in our Transactions for 1821, 1822,
 1823, 1826, and for the present year.
    To these 1 refer not medical gentlemen, for they, I am sure,
have already made them the subject of their most serious attention ;
but I refer every man of a liberal mind to whom science and know
ledge are delightful in themselves *.

   Your second Medal has been adjudged to M. Mitscherlich.
    No attempts of naturalists have been more unremitting or more
ardently pursued than those for connecting the external characters
of all bodies with their internal qualities, which really constitute
their natural families, their true classes, genera, and species.
   The labours of Linnaeus, so successful in the organized king
doms, and so much the contrary in respect to minerals, may be cited
as an example.     Since the great discovery by Mr. Dalton of De
finite Proportions, by far the most important, I have always thought,
since the laws were demonstrated which bind together the universe,
the hope of obtaining such characters has been raised higher than-
before; while crystals measured by the goniometer of Dr. Wol las-
ton promised to rival, in the quality of scientific indices, the fructi
fication of plants, which they had always emulated by their beauty.
But these hopes were not at once realized ; anomalies appeared,
and no lengthened clue could be found till M. Mitscherlich ascer
tained, — That the chemical elements of bodies may be arranged
into classes or groups giving isomorphite crystallization ; so that
when compounds are formed by the unions of these substances with
equal atomic proportions, crystals are produced identical in their
primitive and in their secondary or modified forms.       Hence it fol.
lows, that the mixture, in any proportions, of compound bodies
having this quality, will present crystals of the form common to
each in its unmixed state ; as is said to take place in all the va
rieties of magnesian limestone, however the relative proportion
between the two carbonates may change.          The investigation has
been extended to other bodies found dimorphous under various
circumstances, explaining further apparent anomalies in the atomic
theory : but the subject is at once too novel and too intricate for
further discussion here.
   M. Mitscherlich has had the additional good fortune to detect a
very irregular and unexpected property of crystallized bodies, in
reference to heat.      Their expansions in different directions, are
found to vary after different laws in respect to temperature; there
by modifying their action, in giving polarity to the rays of light.
 So extraordinary have the laws of expansion been found in Iceland
spar, that while in common with all other substances it expands in
bulk by the accession of heat, and its linear dimension is extended in
one direction,    the sign of expansion is actually changed in the di
rection perpendicular to the former, and it contracts.
   Perhaps 1 may be permitted to read the Report of a Committee
appointed by your Council of last year.
                                                November 26, 1828.
   "Your Committee have taken into consideration the subject re
ferred to them ; and, bearing in mind the important object for
which it has been so referred, they desire that they may not be un
derstood as pronouncing sentence on any disputed point, or as as
suming any weight to be due to their judgement beyond what the
circumstances under which they meet may authorize, when they
state it as their opinion that the doctrine of the equivalent forms of

chemical elements, as announced by Professor Mitscherlich, in his
Memoirs communicated to the Royal Academy of Berlin in the year
181 9, and to the Royal Academy of Stockholm in 1821, and modified
and extended in his subsequent writings, is one of high importance
in crystallography, and has received from M. Mitscherlich himself,
and from a variety of other crystallographic          and chemical re
searches and analyses by others up to the present time, such sub
sequent elucidation and confirmation as now to form a very consi
derable branch of science, and one in which further progress is
confidently to be expected, and indeed is continually making ; and
that, however opinions may differ as to the extent to which his ori
 ginal views are borne out, and whatever degree of obscurity may
yet be regarded as hanging about some parts of the doctrine itself,
or its general applicability, it has already furnished the means
of grouping together avast number of facts under general laws, and
afforded reasonable solutions of a great many difficulties both in
chemistry and mineralogy.
    " Your Committee are further of opinion, that the facts discovered
by Professor Mitscherlich, of the difference of expansibility, by heat,
of crystallized bodies in different directions, is a highly important
step in pyrometry, and is sufficiently established by himself, by de
cisive experiments, to leave no doubt of its reality ; while the cor
 responding changes in the optical properties of diaphanous cry
stals, produced by the same cause, appear to them important ac
cessions to our knowledge of the properties of light and the relation
between it and crystallized matter.
    " Finally, your Committee have no hesitation in stating it as their
opinion, that, should the Council of the Royal Society think proper,
now or at any subsequent period, to mark their estimation of these
 services rendered to science by a Medal, such reward would be fully
justified by their intrinsic merit and value."
    For these discoveries your Medal has been awarded to M. Mits
 cherlich, with the full confidence that the approbation of the Royal
Society of England thus expressed, cannot fail of animating a man
of science in a distant country to renewed and vigorous exertion in
the prosecution of a work that has procured for him such a high
distinction.

Latin, m squamaria. Having caused the flowering stems of a young
plant to be trenched round, detaching from the ash-tree underwhich
it grew the contiguous portions of root, the whole mass was insulated
and separated ; and then, by cautious agitation in a neighbouring
stream, the soil was washed away, and the roots and fibres of the
ash, together with the subterranean stems of the Lathraa, com
pletely matted together, were left exposed ; and showed, that though
its base does not penetrate the stock as in Orobanche, yet it is truly
parasitical, all its forked fibres having minute tubercles by which they
attach themselves to the roots of the tree.
    It is remarkable, that instead of rising towards the surface, the
embryo stem takes a downward direction, till it romes to the roots
of the tree, when it spreads among them and fixe* its tubers on them,
 the flowering branches being the only parts that appear above the
surface.
    To show the nature of the parasitical connection, Mr. Bowman then
 gives a full and minute description of the tubers and their connecting
fibres, which had hitherto escaped notice, illustrated with highly mag
 nified figures.   The tubers seem to be succulent homogeneous sub
 stances, sending down from their surface a tap into the alburnum
 of the roots of the tree, to which the parasite has become attached,
 but never into the woody fibre.
     In treating of the toolh-shaped scale?, from which the plant has been
 by some called Dentaria squamaria, and Toothwort, Mr. Bowman
 mentions that, their real character being mistaken, they had been con
 sidered as roots, till Sir J. E. Smith latterly referred them to their true
 character, of a subterranean herbage.       The absence of green colour
 in most plants that are parasitic on roots, Mr. Bowman ascribes not
                                                                             •'
 merely to their borrowed nutriment, but more especially to their hav-
 ing no true leaves ; all plants destitute of leaves furnished with pores
 not being subject to the action of the atmosphere and of light.        The
 Lathrcea, however, though furnished with true leaves, has the pale
  hue of the other parasites ; and this Mr. Bowman ascribes to the
 functions of the leaves being performed in the total absence of light,
  and to their being destitute of pores.— The paper concludes with a
  minute description of the curious structure of the subterranean leaves,
  which appear to be furnished with cells lined with innumerable minute
 glandular papillae, which Mr. Bowman supposes to perform the office
 of cuticular absorbents. So that whereas ordinary leaves with a po
  rous cuticle, when acted on by air and light, receive carbonic acid gas,
  and throwing oft the oxygen, retain the hydrogen and carbon ; in the
  case of the Lathrcca, whose leaves are buried, the air-valves, instead of
  being in the cuticle, where they would have been obstructed by the
  •urrounding earth, are placed within the convoluted cells, which he
  has discovered within the substance of the leaf.

      A Paper was read, " On the Tertiary Deposits of the Vale of Go-
  sau in the Salzburg Alps ; by the Rev. Adam Sedgwick, Pres. G.S.
  F.R.S. &c., and Roderick Inipey Murchison, Esq. Sec. G.S. F.R.S.
  &c."
      The authors present this as the first of a series of memoirs in which
  they hope to throw some light on the structure of the tertiary forma
  tions in Salzburg and Bavaria, and their varied relations to the
  secondary rocks of the Austrian Alps.
      These deposits, the highest members of which descend into the
 flat regions near the banks of the Danube, become, in their lower
 groups, more elevated and more highly inclined ; and, as they ap
 proach their southern or Alpine barrier, are sometimes vertical :
 whilst in the valley of Gosau and far within that barrier, formations
 with the same organic remains are found at much higher elevations,
 inclosed in Alpine limestone, on which they rest unconformably, and
 in a nearly horizontal position.     This deposit of Gosau the authors
conceive to have been formed in one of the arms of an ancient sea
which, like the present salt-water lochs of Scotland, must have pe
netrated deeply into the then existing valleys of the Alps ; whilst its
actual position incontestably proves that it must have been prodi
giously upheaved at some time posterior to the epoch'of its formation.
     In ascending the drainage of the Traun to the district under
review, patches of these tertiary formations are described as occurring
in various small transverse valleys between Gmunden and Ischel ;
but these are comparatively at low elevations, and all traces of them
are lost in the higher regions between Ischel and the Lake of Hall-
stadt, which is about 1700 feet above the level of the sea.            The
valley of Gosau is described as situated more than five miles to the
west of that lake and about 900 feet above its level. The formations
which the authors consider Tertiary, occupy the flanks of this valley,
and are chiefly exhibited in two hilly ranges, the Horn on the west,
and the Ressenberg on the east.        The beds of these hills are nearly
                                                               horizontal,

horizontal, have an estimated thickness of not less than 2600 feet,
and are shut in on all sides by Alpine limestone, forming on the
south a great serrated barrier, the highest pinnacles of which are
more than 1 0,000 feet above the level of the sea.
   The following abstract of detailed sections derived from the Horn
and the Ressenberg, exhibits the strata in descending order.
    1st. Red and green slaty, micaceous sandstone several hundred feet
thick (cap of the Horn).
   2nd. Green, micaceous, gritty sandstone extensively quarried as
whetstone, succeeded by yellowish, sandy marls (Ressenberg) .
   3rd. A vast, shelly series consisting of blue marls alternating with
strong beds of compact limestone and calcareous grit, the upper
beds of which are marked by obscure traces of vegetables ; and the
middle and inferior strata, by a prodigious quantity of well pre
served organic remains, out of which the authors collected upwards
of eighty species of bivalve and univalve shells, and fifteen species
of corals.                  —

Tlial.)
    4th. The above shelly series graduates downwards into beds of a
more conglomerate form which pass into a red sandstone and marl
containing gypsum ; and a coarse conglomerate, forming the base
of the whole system, rests upon, and abuts against, the alpine or
saliferous limestone. (Locality : — Russbach.)
   Amongst the shells occurring in the group No. 3, are
    Bivalves: — Crassatella 2 species, Corbula 1, Pectunculus 3, Car-
dium 3, Plicatula 2, Gryphaea 2,Trigonia 2, Pecten 1, Solen 1, Ana-

    Corals: — Turbinolia 1, Caryophyllia 3, Fungia 2, Cyclolites ? 2,
 Astrea 5, Madrepora 2.
   The above organic remains have been examined by M. Deshayes
 and Mr. J. Sowerby, neither of whom detected a single species
 identical with any known fossil of the secondary rocks, whilst they
 consider the greater number of the genera to be eminently charac
 teristic of the tertiary period. — The authors have further remarked
 a strong resemblance      between these fossils and certain unpublished
 species  of the Vicentino,  and Mr. Sowerby has identified a few species
with well-known tertiary shells. It is, therefore, concluded both from
 negative and positive zoological evidence, as well as from the uncon-
 formable position of the beds, that the whole deposit of Gosau must
 be considered tertiary, or, in other words, younger than the chalk.
At the same time, the great proportion of new species contained
therein, and the absence" of those identifications with recent shells

which mark the fossils of the younger tertiary groups, prove that it
must be ranked with the most ancient deposits of that series.
    In the basins which have been best examined, there is an entire
break between the secondary and tertiary groups. But the great
mechanical agents which in these localities have elevated and ground
down the secondary rocks, before the commencement of the tertiary,
may not have acted universally. There is therefore reason to expect
in distant localities new groups of rocks by which this break may be
filled up ; and by help of which it will perhaps be found that the
newest secondary rocks and the oldest tertiary, graduate finally into
each other.

    The reading of the paper by the Rev. Adam Sedgwick, Pres. G.S.
 F.R.S. &c., and Roderick Impey Murchison, Esq. Sec. G.S. F.R.S.,
&c. begun at the last meeting, was concluded.
    The authors, having in a former communication described the great
relations of the tertiary formations on the north flank of the Alps to
the older part of the chain, proceed in this paper to confirm their
 conclusions by a series of detailed transverse sections, commencing
 with the hills near the foot of the Traunsee, and ending \vith the
lofty hills of molasse and conglomerate near the Lake of Bregenz.
     1. Section at the foot of the Traunsee. — The tertiary formations here
 commence on the north side of the Traunstein ; and the lower beds
 are described as being chiefly argillaceous, of a great thickness, and
 in a highly inclined position. They contain some of the Gosau fos
 sils, and in their prolongation form the base of a hill ]800 feet high,
 composed of alternating beds of sandstone and of sandy marl. This
 whole system is surmounted by great alternating masses of conglo
 merate, sandstone, and marl, forming a succession of parallel ridges
 in the country north of Gmunden ; and still further towards the north,
 and in a higher part of the series, are beds of lignite.
    2. Section of Salzburg. — Great parallel ridges of conglomerate
 and sandstone extend at the foot of the higher Alps, from the denu
 dation of the Traun to that of the Salza. The conglomerates rest
ing immediately on the older limestone, re-appear on the left bank of
                                                                        the

the river, and form a mural precipice on the S.W. side of the city of
Salzburg.      They are described in detail, and are shown to have ori
ginated in the mechanical degradation of the neighbouring chain ; and
having a high inclination which carries them under the micaceous
sandstones of the northern plains, are, on that account, referred to
the lower part of the tertiary system.
   3. Section from Unteraberg to the plains N.E. of Reichenhall. — The
authors here give a short account of the great secondary system of
Alpine limestone; and the Untersberg beds, which contain innumer
able Hippurites, are shown to belong to the highest part of that series.
Over the Untersberg beds, the section exhibits the following sue-
cession.
   a. A great deposit of marl and marlstone, generally of a gray, but
in some places of a red colour j containing a few fossils resembling
those of the chalk formation.
    6. Sundy, micaceous marls alternating with conglomerates and mi
caceous, calc-grit, with Nummulite.s. Subordinate to this system are
red and variegated marls, with gypsum.
   c. A system of beds composed       of blue, micaceous slate-clay and
greenish, micaceous sandstone.
   d. A great succession of alternating masses of blueish, micaceous
marl, slate-clay, sandstone, and conglomerate.       Some of these upper
marls contain beds of gypsum and fossils, resembling the suite of
Gosau.       The whole of the preceding series is succeeded towards the
north by the tertiary, slaty, green sandstone of the plains.
    As all the deposits above described are conformable to each other,
there is a difficulty in drawing the precise line of demarcation be
tween the secondary and tertiary formations : the authors (though
not without some hesitation) place the nummulite-rock, which is
associated with the lower gypseous marls, at the base of the tertiary
 group.
    4. Section from the Stauffenberg, through the Kachektein and the
 Kressenberg, towards the plains of Bavaria. — In this section the Stauf
 fenberg and the Kachelslein belong to the outer zone of secondary
 Alpine limestone, which in this region is enormously dislocated, so
 that the subordinate beds are not only contorted and pitched up at
 high angles, but generally plunge in towards the axis of the chain. The
 Kressenberg rises to the height of 500 or 600 feet on the north side of
 the Kachelstein, and forms a gradual slope towards the northern
 plains.    Its subordinate beds dip at high angles of elevation towards
 the south, those which are nearest the secondary ridges being inclined
 at 80°.     This position gives the system of the Kressenberg the ap
 pearance of dipping under the secondary rocks, an appearance which
 the authors consider entirely deceptive, and for which they account by
 the intervention of a great fault. They consider the beds of the Kres
 senberg hills as tertiary ; because, though inclined in the same general
 direction with the secondary mountains, they are not conformable to
 them ; because they contain no Ammonites, Belemnites, or other se
 condary fossils ; and, lastly, because they contain very many organic
 remains which characterise tertiary formations. The authors here
                                    H 2                              refer

refer to the list of fossils derived by Count Munster from this locality,
and they entirely coincide with the opinions which he has published
respecting them.       This tertiary system is almost entirely composed of
sand and sandstone which, here and there, contain many particles of
green earth, in some places resembling tertiary molasse, and in
others not to be distinguished from secondary, green sand. Subordi
nate to this system are eleven beds of granular hydrate of iron (vary
ing from five to seven feet in thickness), which are extensively
worked.
     After the details of the preceding section, the great derangements
 of the neighbouring Alpine chain are briefly noticed. It is shown that
 there is a double axis of elevation, one of which passes through the
 great calcareous zone ; and along the line of the Inn produces a
 southern dip in the saliferous series, which seems to carry them under
 the older rocks but which on the contrary form the true central axis.
      5. Tertiary deposits in the Valley of the Inn. — These were proba
 bly once of considerable extent, occupying a basin about twenty
 miles in length, but not more than three or four miles in its greatest
 breadth.      They are now chiefly seen near Haring, where a bed of
 coal thirty-four feet in thickness is extensively worked by means of
 long horizontal levels, which traverse a great succession of strata.
 These beds are described in great detail, and are principally com
 posed of fetid marls in various states of induration.        The coal and
 overlying beds contain many land and fluviatile shells, and have at
 first sight the appearance of a great lacustrine formation.       Some of
  the beds above the coal, contain innumerable impressions of well-
 preserved dicotyledonous and other plants, many of which are in
  the course of examination by M. Adolphe Brongniart.            There are,
  however, several marine shells in the strata, which show that the
  sea ascended up this part of the valley of the Inn during the period
 of the Haring deposit. From the general character of these marine
  shells, some of which have been identified with those of the London
  clay, the authors are disposed to refer the whole deposit to an early
  part of the tertiary period.
      6. Sections of the tertiary formations of Bavaria. — The authors
  first remark, that the line of demarcation between the secondary
  and tertiary groups, is generally well defined ; but they also derive
  from this region several proofs that the tertiary seas ascended up
  the old valleys of the Alps a long way to the south of the average
  direction of this line.    In proof of thii they refer to some deposits
  in the valley of the Isar.     They then describe in detail the sections
  between Ftissen and Schongau, in which an enormous succession of
  beds is laid bare on the banks of the Lech.
       They afterwards describe the section of Nesselwang, in which the
  lowest strata of the tertiary series are of great thickness, and are
  raised against the side of the Alps in a vertical position.         They
  remark that the tertiary system has here a coarser structure than in
  most parts of the range ; that beds of conglomerate abound in the
  lower part of it ; and that the beds of rnolasse and marl are en
   tirely sub'ordinate to them. Lastly, the authors remark no less
                                                                       than

                             Geological Society.                               S3
than three or four distinct zones of coal or lignite, separated from
each other by sedimentary deposits of enormous thickness ; as some
of these zones occur in the lower, and some ia the higher parts of
the tertiary group, they infer that the existence of lignite     of itself,
                                                               is,
no general test of the age of    atertiary deposit.
   7. Section through the hills at the east end of the Lake of Con-
stance. — After making some remarks upon the great elevation of the
tertiary formations      the south-western extremity of Bavaria, the
                        in
authors proceed to describe the transverse section exhibited by the
hills above Bregenz. They commence with a description of the
unmmulite-rocks of Haslach, which are associated with, and form                a
prolongation of, the secondary system of the StaufFen and the Salz
burg chain.     They also refer the nummulitc-rocks and marl-slate
above Oberdorf to the same system, and compare them with the
unmmulite-irohstone     of Sonthofen.     In consequence of the de
 rangement of the strata, and the accumulations of transported
materials, the first commencement of the tertiary beds        is obscure;
but they rise into hills of the elevation of about 2500 feet above
the Lake of Constance, and mark the prolongation of the secon
dary series, on the northern extremity of      a  ridge called Rexberg,
ten or twelve miles S. E. of Bregenz.          The lower part of the
tertiary system,   iscomposed of green, micaceous sandstone, to
which certain beds of conglomerate are subordinate, and              itde is
scribed as perfectly identical with the great deposit of adjoining mo-
lasse which forms the base of the tertiary formations of Switzerland.
This sandstone occupies the successive ridges which extend from the
neighbourhood of Oberdorf to Bregenz.           And, as in the greater
part of this long range the beds are highly inclined and have an
undeviating dip towards the north, their united thickness must be
enormously great. — The authors afterwards describe, with many
details, the great complex deposit of conglomerates alternating
with greenish sandstone and variously coloured marls which consti
tute the upper tertiary group, and compose the whole mass of the
mountain ridge extending northwards from Bregenz.             This whole
section is considered of importance, partly from the great scale upon
which the formation     isdeveloped, and still more from its forming           a
connecting   link between    the tertiary deposits or molasse of Swit
zerland and those which are exhibited in the several sections de
scribed in this paper.
   Finally, the authors give     a short summary of the conclusions
which seem to follow from the facts stated     inthe memoir.
   1. The tertiary formations of Austria and Bavaria appear to
have been formed in an ancient mediterranean sea, the limits of
which may be in         considerable measure ascertained
                        a                                     ;  and the
great mechanical deposits above         described   seem  to  have  origi
nated in the gradual degradation of the Alpine chain, partly by the
action of the sea on the flanks, and partly by the erosion of the
torrents descending from the mountains, and carrying great masses
of transported materials below the level of the waters.
   2. In some instances the tertiary beds are unconformable to the
                                                                   Alpine
                                         %

Si                        Geological Society.
Alpine limestone; in other instances they are conformable.          And
there are beds which, both from their fossils and from their struc
ture, seem to exhibit a connecting link between the secondary and
tertiary formations.
    3. The system above described contains three or four distinct
zones of coal or lignite, with many thousand feet of conglomerate,
sandstone and marl between each ; beginning in the lower, and end
ing in the upper parts of the series.
    4. These younger deposits have the same general relations to the
older chain, as the subalpine tertiary formations of the north of Italy ;
from which it seems to follow that the northern and western basins
of the Danube, and the tertiary basin of the subalpine and sub-
apennine regions, must have been left dry at the same period. The
conclusion is further confirmed by the suite of fossils in the adjoin
 ing molasse of Switzerland.
    5. All the transverse sections prove the recent longitudinal eleva
tion of the neighbouring chain. The tertiary beds form an inclined
plane, down which the Alpine waters stream into the Danube in
nearly undeviating lines, greatly contrasted with the sinuous chan
nels through which the waters escape into the plains from the older
 rocks.
    6. The authors endeavour to confirm the preceding conclusion by
 the facts exhibited in the drainage of the south of Bavaria. They
state that the whole system of drainage, is in a state of continual
change and of progress, and that the rivers have not yet worked
for themselves any thing like permanent channels.
    7. The authors lastly account for some of the greater denudations,
by debacles which must have taken place during the elevation of the
Alps, and by the bursting of a succession of lakes since that period.
In confirmation of which, they state that there is not a single valley
among the newer formations of southern Bavaria, in which may
not be seen many parallel terraces (like the parallel roads of Scot
land) indicating the residence of nearly stagnant water at several
 successive levels.
    A paper On the discovery of the bones of the Iguanodon, and
 other large reptiles, in the Isle of Wight and Isle of Purbeck ; by
 the Rev. William Buckland, D.D. V.P.G.S. F.R.S. &c. &c., was
 then read.
     Hitherto the Iguanodon has been found only within the limits of
 the Weald of Sussex, where it was first discovered bj Mr. Mantell,
 in the iron sandstone formation of Tilgate Forest.       Dr. Buckland
 has recently ascertained the existence of this animal in two other
  localities of the same formation : one near Sandown Fort on the
 south coast of the Isle of Wight ; the other in Swanwich Bay, at
 the eastern extremity of the Isle of Purbeck. In all these places
 its matrix is the same, ferruginous sandstone, to which the name of
 Wealden or Hastings sandstone, has been applied by recent ob
 servers in geology, being intermediate between the lowest beds of
 the green sand formation and the upper beds of the Purbeck lime
 stone, and its fossil shells exhibiting such an admixture of marine
                                                                remains

remains with those of freshwater, as seems to indicate the former
existence of a great estuary in the district wherein they have been
deposited.
   From the size of the bones of the Iguanodon, described by Mr.
Mantel! and Mr. Murchison*, it has been ascertained that this her
bivorous reptile was of extraordinary magnitude; but a single bone
of its foot has been lately found near Sandown Fort, which shows
that its proportions probably exceeded those of the most gigantic
quadruped yet discovered.        The bone alluded to seems to be the
external metacarpal bone of the right foot; it is twice as large as
the corresponding bone of a large elephant ; its length is six inches,
its breadth at the upper extremity five inches, and its weight six
pounds.    A gigantic pelvis was also found in the same iron-sand at
Sandown Fort.      Among the bones discovered in the Isle of Purbeck
by the Rev. J. C. Bartlett, the most remarkable are large verte
brae, and toe bones of the Iguanodon, in size and form resembling
those engraved by Mr. Mantell from Tilgate Forest ; there are also
various bones of other species of reptiles ; a fragment of a femur,
resembling that of the Megalosaurus ; bones of large and small
Crocodiles, and of more than one species of Plesiosaurus.          All
these animals have been found by Mr. Mantell, similarly associated
in the Hastings sandstone of Tilgate Forest.     Dr. Fitton has ascer
tained the shells in this iron-sand at Swanwich and Sandown Fort to
be identical with those of the same formation in the Wealdf ; and
the addition of so many reptiles to the list of their common organic
 remains, affords still further evidence of the identity of the strata
 in which they occur.

                          a dilute solution of gold, gallic acid gives a
following
blue greenish colour, which appears brown by reflected light, and the
gold is perfectly reduced. Tannin merely reduces the gold to a lower
state of oxidation, and the liquor becomes purple.         Gallic acid a
faint yellowish tint in the solutions of titanium. Tannin precipitates
orange-red flocculi. Tannin precipitates tartarized antimony white,
but gallic acid occasions only slight turbidness after a considerable
time. Gallic acid renders the caustic alkalies brown ; the colour
which it produces with the carbonated alkalies is at first yellow,
with a brownish tint, but it becomes soon of a deep green. Tannin
is precipitated by the pure and carbonated alkalies, and the liquor
becomes brown, without changing to green.            The salts of mor
phia, strychnia, quina and cinchonia, are not precipitated by
gallic acid, but they are by tannin.       In its combination with the
alkalies, tannin seems to undergo a change, which approximates it
to gallic acid. The scum of coffee owes its property of turning the
white of egg green, with the influence of the air, to the gallic acid
which it contains ; and the white of egg appears to produce this
effect 'by the carbonate of soda which enters into its composition.
M. Pfaff did not find any gallic acid in the plants which contain
emetin and veratria.— Schweigger's dnnats, Journal de Pharmacie,

PRECIPITATE         OF SILVER RESEMBLING THE PURPLE POWDER
                             OF CASSIUS.
   M. Frick states that if a dilute solution of tin in nitric acid, pre
pared without heat, be mixed with a dilute solution of nitrate of
silver, the solution after some minutes becomes yellow, afterwards
brown, and eventually of a deep purple colour; if dilute sulphuric
acid be added to     it,deep purple precipitate will be obtained, but

       ON SOME PROPERTIES OF SILVER: BY M. WESLAR.
    This author     states, that chloride of silver which     is coloured by
light, is  not, as has been generally admitted, a mixture of reduced
silver and undecomposed chloride, but           new compound containing
                                                a
less chlorine than the common chloride of silver.        M. Weslar calls    it
subchloride :     one circumstance, among others, favourable to this
opinion is, that the chloride of silver coloured by light           not acted
                                                                   is
upon   by  nitric  acid.   Ammonia and    a  solution  of   muriate    of soda
convert this subchloride into metallic silver and chloride.           Subchlo
ride of silver cannot be obtained free from chloride          by exposing the
latter to light :   it may  be  procured   byallowing   silver  to  remain in
a  solution of muriate of copper or iron.           Itowing
                                                         is   to  the  produc

tion of this subchloride that silver which contains copper is black
ened by solution of muriate of ammonia.
    If silver be put into a strong solution of common salt, the metal
is attacked : after long contact the solution appears to be weakly
alkaline, and by evaporation yields crystals formed of chloride of
sodium and chloride of silver.
   It is well known that a hot solution of sulphate of iron dissolves
silver, and that the metal is precipitated as the solution cools.        M.
Weslar has found that the silver is not totally precipitated ; and con
sequently that it is soluble at common temperatures in a solution of
sulphate of iron, and more so as the sulphate is more acid.          Dilute
sulphuric acid does not act upon silver at common temperatures. In
order that action may ensue, it is only necessary to add a drop of
solution of sulphate of iron. To explain these facts, it must be sup.
posed that the oxygen of the air is conveyed to the silver by the
medium of the solution of iron j the iron of which at the moment that
it yields oxygen to the silver, retakes it from the surrounding air.
   The solution of chloride of silver in common salt is not decomposed
by potash. This fact may be explained by the great affinity of the
chlorine for the silver and the potassium for oxygen : it is undoubtedly
owing to the same affinities, that the complete decomposition of
chloride of sodium by oxide of silver is effected. — Ibid.
                 PREPARATION       OF HYDRIODIC       -ETHER.
    M. Serullas      proposes the    following process for obtaining this
compound :
    Put into a tubulated retort,
                        Iodine                  40 parts.
                        Alcohol               1 00
                         Phosphorus    ....      2^
   The latter is to be added in small fragments, and the retort is to be
shaken ; the distillation is to be continued nearly to dryness ; then
stopping it add 25 to 30 parts of alcohol, continue the distillation,
and cease at the same point as before.
    Water being added to the product, the ather is immediately sepa
rated and sinks ; it is to be washed in the usual way, and redistilled
from some fragments of chloride of calcium.— Ibid.
                       RUSSIAN    GOLD AND PLATINA.
    The    Bibliotheque    Universelle for July last contains an extract
from a Prussian      Journal,  from which it appears that the richest beds
of platiniferous sand occur in the district of Tahil in the Uralian
mountains.        Last summer fresh beds were discovered in the western
branch of the Uralian mountains.          Banks of platiniferous sand, from
2i to 5 feet thick occur especially in the hollows, and they are co-
Tered with a bed of turf varying from a few inches to five feet in
thickness ; these banks are composed of common sand, and a grayish-
green argillaceous sand.        The last banks discovered near Tahil con
tained from 1 to 3 pounds of metal in about 3700 pounds of sund.

     This territory is also very rich in gold.   According to the docu
  ments supplied by Professor Fuchs, from the commencement of the
  summer of 1823 to the month of August in the same year, 7792
  workmen were employed in the gold washings of the Uralian moun
  tains, and they procured 1460 pounds of pure gold from 225,000
  times its weight of auriferous sand ; the number of workmen was
  then increased to 11,500, and these in August and September ob
  tained 1 274 pounds of gold from about 320,000 times its weight of
  sand. To sum up, from the 1st of May to the 1st of October, 2824
  pounds and some ounces of gold were procured from about 270,000
  times its weight of sand, to which are to be added 27 pounds and
 some ounces, obtained before the 1st of June 1824.
     Le Globe of the 21st of October last, states that MM Humboldt,
  Rose and Ehremberg, under the sanction of the Russian Government,
 had set out to inspect these mines, and also the gold mines of Boro-
 sowk, the malachite mines of Gumeselesski and Tagil.sk. It is stated
  that the washings of the gold and platina mines yield annually 6000
 kilogrammes, or about 12,000 English pounds of gold ; and M. Hum
 boldt was astonished to find masses of gold in these auriferous
 sands, weighing from 2 to 3 and even from 18 to 20 pounds each :
 they occur a few inches under the grass. From the 59th to the 60th
 degree of latitude, fossil elephants' teeth occur enveloped in this al
 luvial soil ; this circumstance is regarded as a proof that the forma
 tion of these auriferous sands is very recent.
     M. Humboldt observes that it is very remarkable, that in the
 middle and northern parts of the Uralian mountains, the platina is
 found in abundance only on the western and European slope, whilst
 the rich gold washings are on the Asiatic sides of the Bartiraya.
            NEW PROCESS FOR PREPARING FORMIC ACID.
    To procure formic     acid, M. Woehler recommends that a mixture
 of starch and peroxide of manganese should be put into a retort,
sulphuric poured upon it and subjected to distillation : much carbonic
acid is evolved, and an acid liquor passes over at the same time,
the smell of which is very penetrating, and it irritates the eyes
strongly ; this is formic acid, rendered impure by a volatile matter,
to which its strong smell is owing.      When this liquor is saturated
with an oxide, the smell ceases and the solution has a yellow tint.
It is only necessary to distil the formiates thus obtained, with sul
phuric acid, to obtain pure formic acid, and without any smell but
that which it naturally has. The salts which even the impure acid
forms with barytes, lime and lead, have precisely the same crystalline
form as the same salts prepared with the native acid : the salt of
lead was analysed ; its ncid was found to contain the same consti
tuents as common formic acid. — Hensman's Repertoire, May 1829.
                 CHROMATE OF ZINC AS A PIGMENT.
    M. Lampadius directs that chromate of zinc should be prepared by
adding a solution of chromate of potash to one of sulphate or muriate
of zinc. There is not at first any precipitation, but on adding more
                                                             chromate,

chromate, a deep yellow coloured precipitate is formed.           A yellow
liquid remains, which being decomposed by solution of potash, also
gives an abundant precipitate, but of a paler colour : these colour*
may be employed either in oil or with varnish. — Ibid.
          GREEN LAKE PREPARED FROM RED CABBAGE.
    M. Lampadius states, when a hot infusion of red cabbage is treated
with a solution of acetate, or still better, subacetate of lead, a very
fine deep grass green lake is obtained.      Muriate of antimony with a
similar infusion gives a rose red precipitate.       Infusion of cabbage
may be employed to dye cotton and linen of these colours, after hav
ing used acetate of lead and muriate of antimony as a mordant. —

DECOMPOSITION         OF SUI.PHURET OF CARBON BY ELECTRICITY.
    M. Becquerel   puts some sulphuret of carbon into a tube, under a
 solution of nitrate of copper of less specific gravity ; a plate of copper
 is then placed in both liquids : these substances form a pile.
    The carburet of sulphur is decomposed,        as well as a portion of
 the nitrate of copper ; many crystals of protoxide of copper are
 formed on the copper plate, and carbon in very small brilliant lamina-,
 and of a metallic appearance, is deposited on the sides of the tube. —

     DETECTION    OF   ADULTERATION IN CHROMATE            OF POTASH.
    M. Zuber states that this salt is frequently adulterated with muriate
 or sulphate of potash j and he proposes the following method of de
 tecting them : Add a large excess of tartaric acid to the chromate of
 potash to be tried, the chromate will be decomposed, and acquire in
 about ten minutes a deep amethyst colour.       It will now, if pure, form
 no precipitate with nitrate of barytes or silver, by which means the
 presence of muriate or sulphate of potash may be ascertained. — Ibid.
  REMARKS ON ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS FROM WHICH MR.
      RITCHIE HAS INFERRED THE INADEQUACY OF THE CHEMI
      CAL THEORY OF GALVANISM.
     In Mr. W. Ritchie's   " Experimental   Examination     of the electric
  and chemical Theories of Galvanism," lately published in the second
 part of the Philosophical Transactions for the present year, it is stated
 towards the conclusion of the paper, (Phil. Trans. 1829, p. 365,) that
  " the following experiment is not only at variance with the theory of
  Dr. Wollaston, [which " assumes that positive electricity is set at li
 berty by the combination of oxygen with one of the metals" in a gal
  vanic arrangement,] but seems also hostile to some of the generally
 received notions of chemists."
     For this experiment a cylinder of copper is employed, (of which a
 figure is given in the Transactions,) about an inch in diameter, and
 two inches long, having a small copper tube soldered in one end,
                                                                      whilst

whilst the other end is left open. Within this is placed a small cy
linder of zinc, having a copper wire soldered to the lower end. "The
wire, being covered with a thread and passed through the tube, is
 firmly cemented with electric cement, metallic contact being carefully
 avoided.     Another end having a strong brass tube with an internal
 screw is now soldered in the top of the copper cylinder. The inte
 rior surface of the cylinder of zinc is covered with electric cement to
prevent the acid acting upon it. The whole is now nearly filled with
water, and a little sulphuric acid is introduced into the zinc cylinder
by means of a very slender glass funnel. The whole is now com
pletely filled with water ; and a solid screw dipped in electric cement,
and screwed into the top of the brass tube, whilst it is heated, renders
the whole completely air-tight. The acid is now to be mixed with the
water by frequently inverting and shaking the cylinder.           If the cop
per   and  zinc cylinders  be connected   with  the  galvanometer,    the bat
tery will continue to act for a day or two with the same energy as if
the whole had been left exposed to the air.         As there is no room for
the disengagement of hydrogen, the oxygen of the water cannot
combine with the z,inc to convert it into an oxide ; nevertheless che
mical action goes on, and the zinc is dissolved in the acid.             From
this experiment it is obvious that the oxidation of the zinc and the
combination of nascent hydrogen with the electric fluid, as Dr. Bos-
tock supposes, has nothing to do with the production or transfer of
the electricity which appears at the surface of the zinc.           The metal
is still, however, dissolved or reduced from a solid to a fluid state ;
and as its capacity for caloric has undergone a change, may not its
capacity for the electric fluid have also undergone a certain change ?
 Hence it is possible that the true theory of galvanism may be more
intimately connected with that of latent heat than has yet been
supposed.      Since the zinc is dissolved without the assistance of oxy
gen   from  the water, it appears that the atoms of the acid have com
bined with the pure brilliant atoms of the metal, without the neces
sity of the metal being first converted to an oxide."
    It will probably be considered by philosophers, however, that be
fore conclusions of such importance as those which Mr. Ritchie has
arrived at, can be drawn from any experiment, that experiment
must be performed in an unexceptionable manner; with every atten
tion to the condition and quantities of the substances made use of,
to the phenomena manifested during its progress, and to the results
in the production of which the action terminates. Whether such at
tention was bestowed upon the experiment in question, does not
appear from the preceding account, as given in the Philosophical
Transactions ; but we are bound to believe that the author would not
have impugned the theories on galvanism of Dr. Wollaxton and Dr.
Bostock, nor any of " the generally received notions of chemists,"
except upon what he deemed satisfactory grounds.
    Mr. Ritchie's first inference is, that " as there    is no room for the
disengagement of hydrogen, the oxygen of the water cannot combine
with the zinc to convert  it  into an oxide," while " nevertheless che
mical action goes on, and the zinc      isdissolved in   the acid."
                                                                      Now,

    Now, with respect to there being no room for the disengagement
of hydrogen, it remains for Mr. Ritchie to prove either that, under
such circumstances, hydrogen requires
                                           " any room" for its evolution,
or that it does not make room for itself during the experiment.
It does not appear that he employed any means for ascertaining whe
ther hydrogen was in reality evolved, or not ; but that having filled the
cylinder with water and sulphuric acid, he concluded that it could not
possibly be given out. But the only obstacles to its disengagement
would be the difficult compressibility of the water, and the compara
tive inaptitude of that fluid to dissolve the hydrogen.            From the
lately    discovered facts, however,  respecting   the compressibility, even
to liquefaction, of many of the gases, there are strong grounds for
concluding, that, under such great pressure as the disengagement of
hydrogen by the mutual action of the zinc, water, and sulphuric acid,
 in a close vessel, must itself produce, aided by some degree of solvent
 power in the water, the gas would become condensed in the water,
 while its oxygen combined with the zinc.
     Supposing that muriatic acid and sulphuret of iron were to be in
 closed in an air-tight vessel so as to fill it, it is certain, from Mr. Fa
 raday's experiments on the liquefaction of the gases*, that on opening
 the vessel, if the requisite proportions had been employed, we should
  find that the sulphuret had been dissolved, and a solution of iron
 formed. And supposing that an opake vessel had been employed,
  through which the operation of the agents could not be observed, sup
 posing also that no further information had been communicated respect
  ing the experiment than Mr. Ritchie has given upon his, we might
  reason, that since there was "no room for the disengagement of hy
  drogen," therefore the sulphur and the iron must have dissolved in the
  muriatic acid, without oxidation or other previous change of condition j
  whereas the truth would be, that the hydrogen equivalent to the oxy
  gen combined with the iron, would have become united with the sul
  phur, and remained in the solution in the form of liquid sulphuretted
  hydrogen until the pressure was removed by the opening of the vessel,
  when it would assume the gaseous state.
      It seems expedient, therefore, that Mr. Ritchie should ascertain, in
  repeating the experiment, whether the hydrogen is not in reality dis
  solved in the solution of zinc found in the cylinder after the experi
   ment. But possibly the hydrogen, or a portion of       it,  under pressure
   and electric influence, may have entered into combination with the
   copper, or with some of the constituents of the brass or of the cement.
  These bodies, therefore, also seems proper to examine with the view
                           it
  of determining this question.
      The statement that the dissolved zinc cannot be combined with
   oxygen in the solution, rests entirely on the assumption that the        hy
   drogen of the water cannot be disengaged.         But no account     given
                                                                       is
   of the properties possessed by, or of the effects of reagents upon, this
   remarkable solution of zinc  ;  for aught that appears   in   Mr. Ritchie's
  statement, the metal may exist    init in the form of oxide and
                                                                ;   if so, the
   equivalent of hydrogen must have been liberated, and would be found

 in one of the states just mentioned ; and in this case the experiment
as forming a ground of opposition to any of the theories mentioned,
becomes altogether nugatory.
    Mr. R.'s representation, "that the atoms of the acid have combined
with the pure brilliant atoms of the metal, without the necessity of
the metal being first converted to an oxide," is at variance with all
our knowledge respecting the action upon the metals of solvents con
taining oxygen.
    It is true that some instances are on record of the simple solution
of bodies in sulphuric acid, without their oxidation, and that one of
these bodies, tellurium, is a metal for the oxide of which the acid has
considerable affinity, combining with it to form a crystallizable salt.
But in all those cases in which simple bodies are concerned, the acid
must be employed in a concentrated state, in order that the effect
may be produced ; while water, very gradually added, as when the
solutions attract it from the atmosphere, causes the oxidation of the
substances dissolved; or if added quickly, it precipitates them in an
uncombined state*.        It would appear therefore that no result of this
nature can take place in Mr. Ritchie's experiment, since the acid he
employs becomes diluted as soon as the experiment commences. But
if by possibility the case should be as he represents, a proper exami
nation of the solution of zinc obtained will enable him to determine
the fact.
    If it should ultimately appear   that the water is not decomposed in
Mr. Ritchie's experiment while yet      the zinc is dissolved, the solution
can take place only, in all probability, by the sulphuric acid giving up
to the zinc a portion of its oxygen ; and becoming reduced to one of the
other combinations of sulphur and oxygen ; while the oxide of zinc so
produced will exist in the solution in the form either of hyposulphate,
sulphite, or hyposulphite of zinc. And whether such is the case or
not, can readily be determined by examining the solution.
    It would appear, therefore, that before this experiment can be re
ceived as conclusive evidence on the point for the determination of
which it was instituted by the author, it must be shown that no hy
drogen is extricated during the experiment, or enters into combina
tion with the water or any other substance present ; that the zinc is
not in the state of oxide in the solution ; and consequently, that no
portion of the water, either of that introduced into the cylinder or
of that chemically united with the acid employed, undergoes decompo
sition. To render it perfectly satisfactory, ascertained quantities of zinc,
water, and acid, should be employed; it should be ascertained whether
any, and, if any, how much, of the zinc remains unacted upon, and
also whether the entire quantity of water as well as that of acid is re-
obtained, either as such, or as combined in any manner with the zinc,
after the experiment ; * and further, whether hydrogen gas does not
escape either during the experiment or on opening the. copper cylin
der in order to ascertain the solution of the zinc.
    The above minute examination of Mr. Ritchie's experiment has
been entered into, and every possible view taken of the results stated

of the experiment, with the precautions suggested in these remarks,

 EXPERIMENTS       ON  LIGHT AND SHADOW MADE BY MEANS OF
                    THE PRISM.    BY DR. J. READE.
    Exp. \. — Having placed a piece of white paper close to one of
the planes of an equilateral prism, on looking through it at the
clouds the black angles of the prism reflecting their shadows were
very apparent, as represented in the following figure :
    A B, a sheet of white paper held close to and touching the plane
of the prism a c. a be three opake and
dark angles forming black shadows, which                             ^
passing through the plane fall on the pa
per A B. If we now hold a lighted can
dle behind the prism, these black shadows
are immediately changed to blue at top,
orange at the bottom, demonstrating in
the most conclusive manner, that it is the
black shadows of the prismatic angles
which give the colours of the spectrum,
and not any decomposition of the solar
ray. If when the sun is shining we bring
the prism with its attached paper into the rays, and then turn the
instrument on its axis so as to bring the plane ac to an angle of
45°, with the paper A B, as thus represented, a reflected and not
a refracted spectrum is formed.     The black shadows from the an.
gles a and c are passed through the
prism and rarefied by the reflected
light from the plane he into orange
at the bottom, blue at the top. On
looking at the inside of the plane
b c, we see the window reflected
as soon as the coloured spectrum
is formed ; and, as I believe Mr.
Brougham first remarked, if a pin
or any other slender body be held in the spectrum, light-coloured
shadows are seen.     Now as every separate light forms its own sha
dow, we need no stronger proof that light is -reflected from the
plane b c ; and as the Tight is reflected upwards, the spectrum
ascends on the opposite
                  1 *     wall.

OCCULT ATION OF ALDEBARAN, ON OCTOBER 15TH, 1829, OB
                        SERVED BY DK. BURNEY.
     In the evening of October 15th, about 9 ' 6m mean time, an occul-
 tation of Aldebaran by the moon was observed here ; as the moon
 approached, Aldebaran became less ruddy, and when in contact it
 showed very little colour.     After a perfect contact of the star with
 the moon's northern limb, at an angle of about 69 degrees from her
 vertex, it was six seconds of time clinging, to appearance, to her en
 lightened limb before it disappeared.
  ON    THE COPPEK-COLOURED          LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE
         DARK PART OF THE MOON'S DISC. BY DR. BUIINEY.
     In the evenings of October 30th and 31st, 1829,the non-illuminated
  part of the moon's disc, when near the horizon, reflected a dull
  copper colour;   a circumstance that often happens while the sun, or
  rather the earth, is passing through the southern signs of the eclip
  tic, but seldom if ever while passing through the northern signs.
  By considering the relative positions of the sun and moon with that
  of the earth, and the small angle subtended by the latter during the
  first four days of the moon's age, when the phenomenon is ex
  hibited to the best advantage, the dull copper colour seen on the
  moon's opaque body in clear weather, particularly when near the
  horizon after sunset, appears to be effected by means of the solar
  rays reflected to the regions of the moon, from the extensive
  water in the Ethiopic Ocean and the Great South Sea, according as
  the earth advances in its annual motion round the sun : as it is well
  known the reflected solar rays from water are extremely bright, and
  as they proceed through a clear atmosphere in the direction of the
   moon, it is probable that they produce a faint light upon the dark
  part of her disc. In the opposite season of the year, when the sun's
  declination is north, there is more heat in this latitude, and conse
   quently more vapours in the atmosphere, which intercept the in
   cident and reflected solar rays, and do away their effect ; nor is the
   moon's angular position in the heavens so convenient to receive them
   as in autumn and winter.
      Cold in southern latitudes as far as 56 or 57 degrees, is said by
   late voyagers to be a mere chimera, and that snow is scarcely ever
   seen on the ground in these parallels, although reverse to nature in
   comparison of the low temperature and rigour of the winter in the
   same parallels in the northern hemisphere ; therefore, snow on the
   ground in South America, or the Cape of Good Hope, or New Hol
   land in any part of the year, cannot be the means of conveying the
   sun's reflected rays to the regions of the moon ; nor is the snow in
   North America so situated during our winter, as to cause light from
                                                                      the

 the earth to be reflected from the dark part of the moon's disc, as
 has been supposed by some modern philosophers.
    The reflected light from the unilluminated part of the moon in
 her first quarter, as before mentioned, is sufficient to establish the
 fact of the existence of an attenuated lunar atmosphere, which, ac
 cording to the ingenious calculations of the celebrated M. Schroeter
 of Lilienthal, cannot be much less than a mile and a half in height
 If the moon were a mere cinder, as some would have her to be, and
 without any atmosphere, is it possible that the light she receives
 from the earth could be reflected to it from the dark part of her
 disc?
                     LAW OF PATENT INVENTIONS.
 Extractsjrom    the Minutes of Evidence taken before a Select Committee
    of the House  of Commons, appointed to inquire into the present State
    of the Law and Practice relative to the granting of Patents and
    Inventions. Session of 1829.
    The Committee state in a report of a few lines (dated 12th June
 1829), that they found the subject so intricate and important, that
 it occasioned the necessity of examining witnesses at great length ;
 wherefore they were only prepared to report the minutes of the
 evidence taken before them, together with several document*: but
 they recommended to the house, that the inquiry should be resumed
 early in the next session.
    These minutes of evidence occupy 160 folio pages, and the do
cuments mentioned by the committee are contained in an Appen
dix of nearly 100 pages more. We have found it impracticable to
 condense into the few pages we can devote to this subject sufficiently
copious extracts to convey to our readers the particular sentiments
 of each witness ; hence we have preferred the evidence of those
 gentlemen who appear to have given the most important informa
 tion to the committee. Amongst these are Davies Gilbert, Esq. M.P.
 President of the Roynl Society, Arthur Howe Holdsworth, Esq.
 M. P., both members of the committee ; Mr. John Taylor, Mine
 Agent, Mr. Brunei, Mr. Farey, and Mr Clegg, Engineers ; Arthur
 Aikin, Esq. Secretary to the Society of Arts, and others.
    The evidence given by Mr. Farey is the most extensive ; and as
he furnished nearly all the documents contained in the Appendix,
 we shall for the present make extracts from his evidence and papers,
proposing to continue the subject in a future Number.
    Mr. John Farey, Engineer, called in and examined, 1 1th May.
    Have you had considerable experience in the practice of taking
out letters patent? — Yes, in assisting inventors professionally, to
enable them to bring forward new inventions, and make them prac
tically useful ; in advising them how to secure their inventions by
patent; in preparing titles and specifications for patents for new in
ventions; and assisting inventors to support their patent rights at
law when disputed.
    Can you state the expense of taking out a patent? — 1 can state
the sum totals; for England, I think it will be found to amount to
 120/. ; for Scotland, perhaps 100/. ; and for Ireland, I think more
                                  K 2                               than

than l'25l.; and there is a small increase if the patent Tor England
includes the Colonies.     Those sums include an average of ingross-
ing and stamps for the specifications.
     Does the charge vary with the length of the specification ? —
With the length and with the difficulty , but the charges that de
pend most upon its difficulty are not included in the above sums,
because professional charges for advice and assistance in bringing
the invention to bear, and specifying it, vary in every degree.
     What time does it take to obtain a patent? — It is said to be six
weeks; but they are certainly now two months upon the average,
 and that is frequently extended to a much longer period.
    During the time between making the application, and sealing the
 patent, has the applicant any security for his invention? — No secu
 rity whatever ; there is even an increased necessity for secrecy be
yond that which existed before his application; because his applica
 tion has called attention to his procedure, and declared what is the
 object of his pursuit. It is a common practice with manufacturers,
 who begin an invention solely for their own use, without any
 thought of a patent, when they have obtained such a prospect of
 advantageous results as to see that a patent would be desirable,
 they destroy all the models, and every vestige of them, and even
 •end away the workmen who made them on some distant embassy,
 to avoid any chance of the secret being called forth by the compe
 tition that exists among rival traders as soon as one makes an appli
 cation for a patent. It frequently happens that patents are delayed
 very long in their progress through the offices, so as to occasion a
 very great grievance.
     What constitutes such a publication during the interval between
 the application for the patent, and the scaling, as to vitiate the pa
 tent ? — That has never been decided with precision.      It is supposed
that an invention being communicated by the patentee to any person
 whose assistance is necessary to carrying on the invention towards
perfecting  it, would not be considered as       publication.
                                                   a               If those
 persons were to communicate      it at second hand,    Iapprehend that
such breaches of trust would be considered as publications but has
                                                              ;            it
 never come before      court in such way as to give the positive opi
                          a            a
 nions of the court on the subject. Whenever an invention, or new          a
article produced by an invention, has passed from one person to an
 other by sale, before the date of       patent, the patent cannot be
                                           a
 maintained.
     Then the objects of keeping an invention secret after       it  deter
                                                                      is
 mined to take      patent are, lest the invention should be pirated
                      a                                                         ;
 and lest there should be such an act of publication as to vitiate the
 patent? — And also the risk of calling up an opposition to the grant
 of the patent because the instant that man, by any means, an
                  ;                            a
 nounces to his competitors in trade that he      engaged upon a new
                                                   is
 invention, they are all upon the watch to find out what     it  is.
     Do you not word the title obscurely, in order to avoid directing
 public attention to the subject? — Yes, but there          is
                                                            a   danger in
being   too obscure, because then      court
                                       a     of justice may afterwards
                                                                       hold

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                               69
hold that it is an invalid patent, for want of coincidence between
its title and the specification.    To prepare a title to a patent, it
roust not be made so clear as to call the attention of rivals, and
enable them to discover the subject, nor so obscure as to incur the
danger that a court of justice may afterwards rule, that it is an im
perfect definition or title of the invention described in the specifi
cation.
    Do you see any remedy for that inconvenience? — The remedy is
obvious : to make the right of the patentee secure from the time he
makes his application ; on condition of his then lodging a paper of
the heads of his invention — a statement of the principle on which
he founds his invention ; also the final specification and description
of the means of executing the invention, should be engrossed in
 the patent itself, so that the title of the patent, instead of being
 the only means of reference between the two documents, should
become a mere indorsement, and a matter of no importance: the
latter is done in France.
     Ifa person having made an invention of the same nature as that
for which a patent is sought, and 'has carried it on secretly, is it
 supposed that the previous secret exercise of the invention will
vitiate the patent? — It is decided that the secret exercise of an in
vention would not vitiate the patent ; but it is assumed that the
 person so carrying it on secretly, would inevitably reveal the secret
 the moment that he knew that a patent was applied for, and a dis
 closure of the secret by him, in the interim between the date of the
 application and the date of the patent, would vitiate the patent;
 that is the reason for leaving the patent open to destruction by a
 publication of the invention, between the date of application and the
 date of the patent ; viz. that those persons who have been previously
 secretly practising the same invention, may have an opportunity of
 publishing        it,
                  so as to destroy the patent.     But publications from
 the fear of an expected patent rarely take place because, when             ;
a   person applies for    patent, he does not declare himself so clearly
                              a
 by the title, that the person could be certain that         identical with it   is
 the previous secret practice.

                                                 it
 because the same secrecy that would enable him to have hitherto
 concealed his process, would also prevent any legal proofs of his
 having infringed the patent           ;exceedingly difficult to obtain
                                           it   is
 sufficient proof of infringement.     Many patents are infringed for
 years together,   without    being possible to obtain any redress, from
                                  it

 period than he (the inventor) was ready with his application, then
 by lodging a caveat, he would have notice and detect the treachery,
 before it was too late.    A patent cannot pass through the office
 where a caveat has been lodged, without notice being first given to
 the person who lodges the caveat.
     Supposing he opposes the patent, what steps does he then take? —
 He may cause the Attorney General to summon the parties, and
 after examining the respective inventions, he will decide whether
 they are so dissimilar that the patent is to pass, or not.
     Suppose there are two applications for a patent, and that the
 Attorney General informs the parties that the inventions are the
 same, and awards the patent to the first applicant, is it not in the
 power of the rejected applicant, on receiving that information, to
 effect such a publication as will destroy the patent right ? — It is in
 his power ; but I never knew an instance where the Attorney Gene
 ral did declare that there was such a similarity and equality of
 rights to a secret invention, as to induce him to refuse grunting a
patent ; he has sometimes advised thu parties to join 1heir interests
in one patent, when he felt difficulty in deciding, and has informed
them that by contending at law, their patents, if he allowed them
both to pass, would probably destroy each other.
    Is the Attorney General the sole judge between two patent ap
plicants? — He is ; he summons the parties before him ; they bring
their drawings and models, engineers, witnesses, attorneys or agents,
to explain ; and sometimes, if it is requested, he will go and visit
the machinery.       Each party has a separate private hearing.
    Does not the sort of decision he is called upon to pronounce, re
quire considerable knowledge of mechanics? — It requires a very
deep knowledge, to form a decision between the merits of the re
spective inventions, particularly as the inventions at the period
when they must necessarily be exhibited to the Attorney General,
are seldom organized in that state of perfection which will enable
him to judge by results only.
    Is it not an inconvenience that a question between two concur
rent applicants should be decided by a person, perhaps, not very
competent to decide such a question? — It is not felt an inconve
nience, from the circumstance that the Attorney General almost
always sees sufficient ground of new invention, to grant the patent,
or both, if two are applied for ; therefore the oppositions become
of no effect.     Patents are at all times subject to be annulled by
a court of justice, if not found to be pood in every respect, and
the Attorney General recommends the King to grant the patent al
most uniformly; if there are two applications for patents for similar
inventions, he allows both patents to pass. When there would be a
chance on very close inquiry, by competent judges, of finding col
lision, it is usual to advise the parties to join in a patent, but no
thing more.
    When the patentee comes before the Attorney General, he
has to give a general description of the nature of the invention ? —
In case of opposition, but not without ; it is a great evil that
                                                                    the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,              71
the applicant is no way fixed to what he does intend to specify.
There have been some speculators who the instant that they
find out that a person of talent is occupied with an invention,
apply for a patent, with a title sufficiently general to cover the
invention ; and having thus got the start of the inventor, if
they can get at the invention before the time of specifying, they
have a good chance of making it their own ; for even if the real
inventor makes opposition, the Attorney General can rarely be
convinced of the identity of the same invention, when differently
explained by two parties, with different models or drawings, and
when one party has an interest in disguising the similarity; or that
party may purposely describe quite a different invention to the At
 torney General, who keeps no record ; hence, after having either
 from ignorance of the real invention, or from design, made a ficti
 tious explanation to the Attorney General, he may get the real in
 vention by treachery, and put it into his specification.
     What remedy would you propose for that ? — To fix every appli
 cant, as is done in France and America, by some specification in
 the first instance, containing a definition of the principle and object
 of the invention, leaving the patentee afterwards to prepare a more
 complete specification when he had organized, and proved the means
 by which the invention is to be carried into effect ; that final speci
 fication should be examined, and ought only to include such mat
 ters as are, in the opinion of competent examiners, a fair extension
 of Ms original idea, as expressed in the first deposit. As it is now,
 the patentee is not obliged in any way to declare what his invention
 is, till he puts bis specification to the patent previously granted to
 him, and in the meantime he may change his plan within all the la
 titude that the generality of the title will permit.
     Would you advise that a person applying for a patent should
 have his specification ready at the time of his first application ? —
  Not his complete specification ; that is done in other countries, but
 would be impracticable here ; because the spirit of rivalry and com
 petition is so strong, that an invention cannot be put to the test of
 experiment, or brought to bear in secrecy, so as to enable an in
 ventor to defer his application until he is prepared to specify pro
 perly : that may be done in foreign countries, where secrecy can be
 more readily preserved, but not here. The specification, with all
  the details of description necessary for instructing the public how
 to practise the invention, cannot be made till the invention has
 been actually practised.       I recommend that the inventor should
 state all the particulars necessary to define the principle, and ex
 plain the outline of his invention ; so that when the complete or
 real specification is afterwards made out, it can be decided by com
 petent judges, whether it is a fair development of the ideas origi
 nally recorded in the provisional definition.
     You would compel him, on applying for his patent, to lodge a
 statement of the principles to be afterwards developed in the speci
 fication, and you would require that when the time has arrived for
 the inrolment of the specification, and consequently granting the
                                                                 patent,

 patent, he should give the details, to be transcribed into the patent
 itself? — Yes; the knowledge of       those details does not always exist
 at the time most proper for applying for the patent, and therefore
 it is impossible that they should be described, nor will they come
 into existence, until the thing has been put into practice ; as it is
 now, the two months which elapse between the time of applying
 for the patent, and the time when the patent is granted, are lost,
 as to any such creation of the means of putting the invention into
 practice.
    Would there not be a difficulty in securing to any one, a property
 in what was not distinctly defined ? — For a permanency it would be
 an excessive difficulty ; but for the short term of two or three months,
 it would not be any inconvenience to give a right, that is completely
 defined by the outline of a specification. Every patent now granted,
 is in force for two, four, six, and some for eighteen months, before
 there is any definition whatever, of the right it confers ; for no re
 cord at all is now given in the first instance, nor is any writing
 usually preserved, in case it is explained to the Attorney General,
 upon hearing of opposition.
    You would require this greater precision in the meaning of
 the first application, not for the benefit of the applicant, but for
 the benefit of other inventors? — For the benefit of all inventorg
 who are occupied at the same time, on (he same subject ; it is an
 intolerable nuisance to persons who are engaged in speculations,
 that they are perpetually in danger of having their inventions or
 improvements stolen from them, and put into the specifications of
 some existing patents, not yet specified, but which have titles that
will cover their inventions.
    Are the inventors whose ideas have been so appropriated by pre
vious patentees, called upon to prove the negative, that the patentee
 did not invent what he specifies ? — Yes ; or they must prove that
 they had the invention in use before the date of the patent ; be
 cause the invention became the property of the patentee from that
date, although he is not called upon to declare what it was for a
long time after.
    Is there any limiting law to the time which is allowed for the spe
cification after the issue of the patent ? — None by law ; by custom
it is two months for a patent for England ; for England and Scot
land, four months ; and for England, Scotland and Ireland, six
months ; of late years, on declaring in the first instance that they
mean to proceed with patents for England, Scotland, and Ireland,
they obtain six months at once in the English patent. It is quite
discretionary in the Crown how long time should be allowed, and on
special showing, longer terms are occasionally granted.
    Do you see any inconvenience in allowing a long time for the spe
cification ? — It is essential to getting sufficient specifications made of
important inventions, to allow a long time ; and on the other hand,
it is an excessive grievance to persons engaged in like pursuits, un
less some provisionary definition of the legal right that is conferred
by the patent, were to be made public.
                                                                      Does

      Does not it often happen, that after a person has taken out a pa
tent for an invention, he makes some material improvement in the
invention which at present requires another patent? — It is a very
common case for the same invention to require two, three, and four
successive patents ; and it is a very great hardship, it operates pre
judicially to the public as well as to the inventor.           In France, as
improvements arise, successive specifications of those improvements
 can be added (at very little expense) to the original specification.
      Would not that be very advantageous ? — Very advantageous in
 deed ; here there is no remedy for a defective specification.         A pa
 tentee is compelled to specify his invention within the given period ;
 and if he is not then prepared to specify his invention, with all its
 details of execution, in a perfect manner, his patent right must take
 the chance of his imperfect specification. If he afterwards practises
 the invention in a better manner than that which he specified, in
 stead of its being held that he is deserving of public approbation,
 for having pursued his course of invention further than at first, the
 courts of law assume that he has committed a fraud, by concealing
 something which he ought to have put into the specification.              He
 can only refute that imputation by proving in evidence, that the
 specification does contain sufficient instructions to enable the public
  to exercise the invention with real advantage. It is impossible for
  him to prove the negative, that he did not know the improvement
  at the time of specifying.        When a man invents and takes out a
  patent for a machine, he must use his utmost exertion to get it made,
  and put to work, before the time when the specification is due, in
  order to make a trial of    it,   and regulate his specification thereby      :
  perhaps some part fails, or requires to be re-made, and prevents his
  making any trial; but the time being come, he must make his spe
  cification as well as he and his advisers can guess, though he has
  gone through nearly all the trouble and expense of trial. a              Afew
  days after having inrolled, he may find out, upon experiment, some
   important improvement in the means of carrying his invention into
   effect, which either had not occurred to him before, or         if  he had
   thought of  it,   he could not have safely put  it  into the specification,
   becauseit     was a mere speculative idea.     If he had put in that spe
   culative idea, and    ithad turned out on subsequent trial to be wrong,
 it    would be said in   a  court of law thatit    was done to mislead the
   public    from the real  invention, which he  reserved  for his own private
   practice.
        In that case the inconvenience arises from want of time — Yes  ?        ;
   and the expense of those hurried proceedings, to get              sufficient
                                                                is a
    trial of new machines to enable us to specify properly          excessive,
    being frequently obliged to keep people working night and day.             I
    have sat up all night many times myself, for such work, and have
    undergone such fatigue, that    I   could not be any way sure of what
I      was doing.    Even when a    successful trial has been accomplished,
    there remains so little time afterwards, that the specification must
    be composed in such haste as to run the greatest risk of some in
    accuracy or error.

     Supposing a specification to be so accurately drawn as to be suffi
 cient to inform the public how to use the invention, and subse
 quently to that, the inventor discovered some improvement in his
 invention, his patent is not forfeited by his using that improve
 ment ? — No, not by law ; but he must prove that his original inven
 tion would answer the purpose proposed, and be a useful and bene
 ficial practice, and the fact of his departing from it, is presumptive
 against him ; therefore, when the right comes to be tried in a court
 of law, the inquiry does not turn upon the real patent machinery
 that is in actual use, doing business and public good, but it is often
 necessary to make old-fashioned and obsolete machines that were
 described in the specification when no better known, but which have
 been superseded by better ones, and are of no use except to satisfy
 a court that what was specified will really do; and if by such evidence
 the court can be persuaded that they will do, then, however infe
 rior they may be to the more recent editions of the invention
  (which are never examined), the patent escapes from being set aside
 for want of sufficient description.     If the opposite parties can per
 suade the court that the machines described will not answer, then
 the patent is set aside, without any inquiry into the real merits of
 the invention in its modern form, which is in daily use, and is the
 real subject of the action.
     Is it not quite fair that the patentee should be bound to give such
 a specification ? — Unquestionably ; but when an inventor's patent is
 set aside because he has not fully described his invention, it ought to
 be on the ground that the secret has been withheld, so that the
 public are really not in possession of it, and have consequently not
 derived the benefit of such possession.      Instead of making ridicu
 lous inquiries whether an obsolete specification is so defective as
 to destroy the patent, it should be amended by a new one, corre
 sponding with the improved state of the practice. On the other hand,
 if the public are really in possession of the invention, and deriving
 benefit from its exercise, the patent ought not to be set aside, be
 cause they did not become possessed of it by means of the old spe
 cification. That remedy for a bad specification is merely penal, and
 the public have no advantage from it whatever ; they do not get any
 more complete specification by annulling the patent. If the paten
tee were to be compelled to bring a better specification, there
would be a real advantage ; and if he refused to do so, then the pre
sent penalty of forfeiture would be very properly applied.
    Do you think that the public would have any security against
those imperfect specifications, by the appointment of a commission
to examine the specification before it wasinrolled? — It would be
very easy to have specifications examined and verified either by a
competent commission, or by suitable referees. The courts of jus
tice now trust to the examination and opinion of others, but they
do so in an improper manner, because it is by parties, brought by
interested individuals, and when it is too late to amend any defects.

to perfect the specification, would he not run great risk of divulging
his invention, although he had entered the principal heads ? — Those
heads should be kept secret, but public notice of the application
should be given ; one object of my proposition is, that if an acci
dental disclosure of the whole secret did take place, the inventor
should not suffer any material injury from it.
    Will you instance, in the case of Mr. Watt's improvement in the
steam engine, the proposals which you suggest for the improvement
of the process in obtaining a patent ? — I think that the deed which
Mr. Watt inrolled for his specification, ought to have been lodged
at the time of making the first application for his patent ; and he
should have been allowed at least two years for making engines and
the experiments necessary for specifying the means by which those
principles should be carried into execution ; within those two years
he should have made such a specification as would have really in
structed competent workmen how to practise the invention.
    Could Mr. Watt have made that statement of heads of invention,
without previous experiments? — Yes, at the time he drew up those
heads (which I say are not specific enough to be a specification,)
he really had made no engine, and only a private experiment by
himself, with a very incomplete model.
    Would those heads have secured him against any rivalry? — They
did so in fact most completely ; his paper was most admirably well
drawn, and very definite; but those who wanted to practise the in
vention could not do it upon that specification.      It told them plain
enough what they were forbidden to do, during the term of his
patent, but did not explain how they might do        it,after the expira
tion of that term.
    Then he gave in for complete specification, that which, accord
                        a
ing to your ideas, ought to have been given in in the first instance —
                                                                     ?
 Exactly so and he never did make any complete specification such
               ;
as
 I    think ought to be given in the second instance        ;  the conse
quences    of that omission  have been   important in  his case,  for long
 after the expiration of his patent, which was prolonged and kept
 in force in the whole for more than thirty years, those who wanted
 to make steam engines, had to go and steal     a  knowledge of his    in
 vention from his factory, or from examining engines made by him,
 with as much difficulty as if  he had never had     apatent.     Reading
 the specification did not answer the purpose at all.

               OBITUARY. — M. NIELS HENRIK ABEL.
    The mathematical sciences have sustained a great loss in the prema
ture death of M. Abel, whose brilliant discoveries, whan quite young,
raised the highest expectations of the fruits of his mnturer years.
 Although his labours are but partially known in this country, we hope
 that a short account of his life will not be unacceptable to our readers.
 Niels Henrik Abel was born on the 25th of August 1 802, at Frindoe, in
 the province of Christiansand, on the western coast of Norway, where
 his father was a clergyman.    He showed at first no marks of genius ;
 but at the age of 16, being then at the public school of Christiania, his
extraordinary talent for mathematics at once began to develop itself,
 and he rapidly studied Euler's Introduction to Analysis, his Differen
 tial and Integral Calculus, the works of Lacroix, Francceur, Poisson,
 Gauss, and especially those of La Grange. He next entered the Univer
 sity of the same city. Having lost his father, and being without for
 tune, he availed himself of the assistance usually granted there to the
 poorer students ; and, besides, had afterwards an allowance conferred
 on him by the Government.       In 1820 he published his first paper, in-
 titled " A general method of finding functions of a variable quantity,
 a property of these functions being expressed by an equation between
 two variable quantities."     Some time after he imagined he had suc
 ceeded in finding the general solution of equations of the fifth degree.
  Having perceived his error, he resolved not to desist until he had
 either accomplished that solution, or demonstrated     the impossibility
 of the general solution of equations of a higher degree than the
  fourth. In the latter task he succeeded : his paper was printed in
  1824, at Christiania, in the French language. At the recommenda-
   ion of some Professors of Christiania, he now obtained from the
  Government an allowance for two years, in order to prosecute his
  studies abroad.   Having spent the allotted time principally at Berlin
  and Paris, he returned to Christiania.     During his absence from his
  country he published some excellent papers, among which those on
  Elliptic Functions, which have been honoured with the highest praise
  by the distinguished veteran Le Gendre, the discoverer of this branch
  of analysis. It is well known that at the same time, and unknown
  to him, another young mathematician, Professor Jacobi of Kb'nigs-
  berg, who has just published an elaborate work, infilled
                                                                 " Funda-
  menta Nova Theoriae Functionum Ellipticarum : Regiomonti, 1829,"
  began to cultivate with the greatest success the same abstruse part
  of mathematical analysis. After his return to Christiania) M. Abel
  had at first no regular appointment ; and only a short time before
                                                                        his

his death he began to receive a fixed salary. Unfortunately, his assi
duous labours, nnd the anxiety of mind caused by the uncertainty of
his prospects,     had undermined his delicate           health ; and his short
career was suddenly terminated on the Cth of April 1829, in a vil
lage near Arendahl, where he was on a visit to some of his relations.
A very acceptable offer, made to him by the Prussian Government, of
a Professorship in the University of Berlin, reached Christian ia a lew
days after his death.

and fine ; the latter part was cloudy and humid, with some light rain, fre
quent strong gales of wind, and comparatively cold for the season.

ing the first time this autumn. There was a difference of 17 degrees be
tween the maximum temperature of the 12th and 25tht and a difference of
22 degrees between the minimum temperature of the 12th and 16th !
    A great depression of the mercury in the barometer took place on the
21st and 22nd, with a fresh wind from the S.E., succeeded by a S.W. wind.
On the 23rd a very heavy gale set in from the N.E., and occasioned much
damage among the ships and vessels in the Downs, and along the eastern
shore of the British Channel on the 24th : it brought on snow here, which
continued to fall throughout the night and most of the following day, when
there was no variation of temperature at the ground from the freezing
point, and the depth was three inches. This was unusually early for the
appearance of snow in the immediate vicinity of the sen, as we seldom see
nny lie on the ground here before Christmas in the coldest winters.                            The
bending aspect of the trees and shrubs, which were heavily clad with a
snowy garment, contrasted with the long transparent icicles that were pen
dent from the roofs of the houses, had a magnificent, yet novel appearance
in November: a rising temperature, with wind and rain in the night, dis
solved nearly all the snow on the level ground by the morning of the 26th.
     More favourable weather for getting the seed into the ground last month
and the early part of this, could not have been desired ; and even that depth
of snow, from its containing and absorbing so much oxygen, has served as
the best compost to the neighbouring lands, and softened the ground sur
prisingly.
    The mean temperature of the external air this month is three degrees
and three quarters lower than the mean of November for many years past.
     The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
 observations this month, are, two meteors, one rainbow, and nine gales of
 wind, or days on which they have prevailed ; namely, two from the North,
 three from the North-east, two from the East, one from the South-west,
 and one from the West.

XI.    Notes on the Geographical Distribution of Organic Re
   mains contained in the Oolitic Series of the Great London
   and Paris Basin, and in the same Series of the South of
   France. By HENRY T. DE LA BECHE, F.R.S. $c*
  A  T  the present time, when rocks, so dissimilar in their miner-
-^*-
      alogical character and thickness, are referred to the same
geological epochs, from the nature of their organic remains,
it becomes important to ascertain, as far as our information
will permit, to what extent the opinions usually entertained on
this head are well founded ; and if they should appear to be
only partially correct, to determine to what distances, fossils,
supposed characteristic, may be available. Many serious diffi
culties attend an examination of this nature.       1st, Very able
observers    of rocks may    not  be good zoologists, or may not
have had the fossils obtained by them from particular strata,
determined by those that are. 2ndly,We want synonyms for
the same shells to which different names have been assigned
by different authors. Srdly, We do not possess complete lists,
even of the fossils found at various known places. And 4thly, We
cannot state that any given fossil discovered in one rock may
not occur in another because not yet found in it.           We are
 however in general furnished with lists of those fossils which
 occur most abundantly at any given place ; and the organic
 remains, supposed characteristic, are most frequently detailed,
 from the very general desire, now existing among geologists,
 to adopt this mode of identifying strata, so that, notwith
 standing the difficulties above enumerated, we may, by com
 paring the lists of those on whose accuracy we can depend,
 arrive at some useful conclusions respecting the geographical
 distribution of organic remains in a given group of rocks.

 82      Mr.De laBeche         on the Geographical Distribution   of Organic
         M. Elie     de Beaumont         has already remarked on the con
  stancy of the geological facts observable in the oolitic belt
  of the great geological basin which contains London and
  Paris*; — and M. Dufrenoyf has shown that in the South of
  France appearances are not very materially different There
 fore we may conclude that, though there may be many sub
 ordinate differences, there is a general resemblance in the
 mass of the oolite series in England and a large part of France,
 leading to the supposition that the rocks of which it is com
 posed were formed under similar general circumstances.
     It would appear that the three systems into which Mr.
 Conybearef has divided the oolite series of England, will be
 available in the parts of France comprehended within this
 sketch ; therefore, in treating of the organic remains, we shall
 first consider the lower oolitic system, then the middle, and
 afterwards the upper.
     As data whence to draw conclusions respecting the geo
graphical distribution of the organic remains in the rocks
under consideration,             I
                            shall avail myself, for the North of
 England, of the very excellent work of Mr. Phillips §. For the
South of England I shall be compelled to use scattered in
formation, as we have not any very detailed and published
description of the organic remains contained in the oolite of
this part of our island      For Normandy shall have recourse
                                ||.                     I

France, to the memoir of M. Boblaye **. And for the South
of the same country, to the observations of M. Dufre'noyf                f.
    In order that the reader may judge of the general character
of the oolite series of which the fossils will be noticed in the
sequel,    have brought together the views of the geologists
           I
above named respecting the different portions of which they
have particularly treated.

 84  Mr.De la Beche          on the Geographical Distribution       of Organic
 General View        of the OoliticSeries in   Somersetshire and Wiltshire.
     It would be quite out of place to present a general view of
 this part of our island, as the labours of Smith and Conybeare
 are well known, and as the rocks in question constitute the
 type of the oolitic series generally, if we except the Portland
 beds.
     It may be remarked that the Bath oolite does not occur on
 the coast of Dorsetshire. A series of clays with limestone, re
 sembling forest marble and cornbrash largely developed, there
 separate the inferior oolite from the Oxford clay.
     The coral rag, as is often the case, is also wanting on the
 same coast ; that is to say, the beds containing such an abun
 dance of corals, whence the name, do not occur, though an
 equivalent to the Oxford oolite does.

joining;    between    Fecamp to St. Vaast:" inserted in the 1st volume of the
 Geological Transactions, New Series, and written from observations made in
the spring of 1821, deceived by the mineralogical resemblance of this lime
stone, as developed at Hennequeville cliff, to some of the Portland stone,
I  attributed the Calcaire de Blangy to that rock : but 1 now perfectly agree
with the French geologists, that the Honfleur and Havre clay is equivalent
to the Kimmeridge.        Subsequent examinations have shown me that this is
very probable ; consequently it was an error to refer the limestones in ques
tion to the Portland stone.
    The following section, by M.de Caumont, of Hennequeville cliff, shows
the superposition of the Kimmeridge ( Honfleur) clay, the Calcaire de Blangy,
 and the coral rag.

if the Portland beds be withdrawn and the marl and marl-
stone there noticed be considered equivalent to the Kim-
meridge clay, except indeed that M. de Caumont considers
the Port-en- Bessin marls as representing the Caen stone.

   " 2. The sandy limestones, the micaceous marls, the ferru
ginous limestones of Florenville, Orval, Carignan, Dreux, &c.
perfectly represent that great sandy and ferruginous zone so
well described by the English geologists, under the names of
sand, marly sandstone, and inferior oolite. TheGryphaea cym-
bium and Plicatula spinosa are its most characteristic fossils.
   " 3. The fullers' earth is easily recognised in the blue
marls of Lamouilly, Vaux, &c. It is also in their lower part
that the fullers' earth of the Ardennes is found.

extensive quarries of Chauvaney, Brouesnes, Luzy, Ballon, &c.
   " 5. The white marls of La Jardinette near Stenay, of Luzy,
&c. offer the most perfect analogy with the Bradford clay of the
English geologists; the fossils are the same; we more parti
cularly mention the following : Turritella, Ostrea acuminata,
Terebratula digona, T. coarctata, Cydarites ornatus, &c.

some uncertainty.           If
                        the forest marble is not recognisable with
certainty in the coarse lumachella which covers the marls, in
the compact madrepore limestones, and sandy limestones of
Stenay ; and       if,
                   moreover, the beds which, from their fossils
and mineralogical composition, have appeared to me equiva
lent to the Stonesfield slate, do occupy a somewhat different
position, and will not permit us to sustain the analogy —                       ;

not the same with cornbrash.         Its fossils (Avicula echinata,
Terebratula subrotunda), and its mineralogical characters, are
found in the coarse limestones of Stenay, Beaumont, &c.

   "   If
        we proceed from Flogny to Ancy-le- Franc, we observe
the following rocks rise successively from beneath the green-
sand and chalk.
   "   1. Compact limestone which corresponds in its position
 with the Portland stone of English geologists.
     " 2. A system of marly limestone and gray marl charac
 terized by the Gryphaea virgula (Kimmeridge clay).
     " 3. A very thick series of compact limestones with a con-
 choidal fracture, of limestones with an earthy and cretaceous
 fracture, and oolite (Oxford oolite, coral rag).
     " 4. Beds of a gray marly limestone with an earthy fracture,
 (calcareous grit, Oxford clay).
     " From beneath these last rise the limestones, often oolitic,
 which form the plains and plateaux on the South of Ancy-le-
 Franc, limestones which are precisely the same with those of
 the Chammes d'Avenay, and the Vallee de 1'Ouche, near the
 Pont d'Ouche.
     " If the facts above mentioned are correctly stated, and if
 the long cliff or escarpment (the course of which through the
 north-eastern provinces and centre of France was noticed
 fifty years since by Guettard,) really contain the Oxford clay
and coral rag among the beds of which it is composed, we
 may see the Bath oolite and Calcaire a polypiers in the oolite
limestone, the beds of which rise on all sides from beneath
those of the cliff.    The yellowish- white and marly limestone
of Burgundy would then represent the Fullers' earth of the
 English, and the Bane bleu of Caen ; the entrochite limestone
would be the inferior oolite ; and the second marly stage, which
rests immediately on the gryphite limestone, would correspond
with the thick marls which in England cover the lias. We
should then see that the constancy of the geological facts, no
ticed in Great Britain, Normandy, in the Bas Boulonnais, and
in the Ardennes, is preserved in Burgundy, as might be ex
pected a    priori *."

  " In   the secondary basin of the S. W. of France, separated
from that of Paris by the mountains of Auvergne, Limousin,
and La Vendee, the oolite series may be- divided into three
distinct groups, corresponding with the three systems of the
same formations in England.     The separation of these groups

88   Mr. De la Beche   on theGeographical Distribution   of Organic
is, however, not nearly so well pronounced ; the beds corre
sponding with the Oxford and Kimmeridge clays are but
rarely observed in this part of France, and appear to be re
placed by marly limestone : this is most commonly the case
between the middle and superior systems.
    " The numerous subdivisions noticed by the English geolo
gists are but very imperfectly seen in the secondary basin under
consideration ; there are nevertheless some sufficiently constant.
    " The lower is the only part of the oolite which appears on
the eastern extremity of the basin ; it forms a considerable
mass on the N. of the department of the HeVault, which ad
vances into the sea near Montpellier and Cette.
    " The oolite formations are greatly developed on the W. of
the basin ; from Cahors to the ocean they form a chain with a
mean breadth of twelve leagues : they are more than twenty-
five between the mountains of Limousin and La Vendee.
    " Between the two extreme points we have named, the three
systems of the oolite may nearly always be seen ; the inferior
frequently resting on the marls and limestone which we have
referred to the lias.
     " In some localities (Milhau, near Villefranche, &c.) the
 inferior system presents micaceous marls containing Gryphffia
 cymbium, belemnites, &c. which may be compared to the sand
 of the inferior oolite : we also find sublamellar limestones,
 compact limestones containing beds of oolitic iron, and beds
 of a white oolite, furnishing excellent building-stone ; the lat
 ter beds, well developed only at Mauriac, in the Aveyron, re
 present the great or Bath oolite. They are associated with
 polypifers as at Caen.    In other parts of the basin, principally
 in the east, this system is composed of compact limestones of
 a yellowish-gray colour, containing an abundance of silex,
 (environs of Nontron, Poitiers, &c.) and beds of slightly oolitic
 limestone. The beds of compact earthy limestone containing
 many ammonites and terebratulae appear to form the upper
 part of this system : by comparing these fossils with those
 found in the cornbrash in England, we are led to assimilate the
 rocks.    The lower system is the thickest ; it forms by itself
 more   than  three quarters of the whole depth ; it occupies more
 than twelve leagues of the fifteen or sixteen which this forma
 tion covers between the Sables d'Olonne and Rochefort.
     " The middle oolite system is in a great measure composed
 of marly limestone beds : yet in many places (Marthon, forest of
  La Braconne, Pointe de Duche, Pointe d'Angoulin, &c.) con
  siderable masses of polypifers are associated in it with thick
  beds of irregular and earthy oolite. The prodigious abundance
  of polypifers, the nature of the oolite, and the occurrence of
                                                              many

        Remains in the Oolite Series    of England and France.       89
many fossils, lend us to assimilate these beds with those named
 Coral Rag by the English, and the oolite which accompanies
 them to the Oxford oolite.        These are the only two subdivi
sions which can be made in the middle group, and even these
so pass into each other that, at the Pointe d'Angoulin and
 Marthon, numerous polypifers are found in the midst of the
oolite beds.     Beds of very marly limestone cover this system.
 We already find some of the Gryphaaa virgula, the presence
of which with us (France), characterises the clay separating
this system from the upper.         This group of the oolite covers
a space about two leagues and a half broad between La Ro-
chelle and Rochefort ; it is more considerable between Poitiers
and Angouleme, and between the last town and Confolens."
    " The upper system is the most uniform in this basin ; it is
often reduced to a few marly beds, containing a prodigious
quantity of the Gryphsea virgula, attached to one another, and
nearly forming by themselves a bed of lumachella.             In some
localities this is covered by compact marly limestone forming
very thick beds (Cahors), in which this little gryphite, so cha
racteristic in France, is found here and there disseminated.
From the environs of Angouleme to the ocean, beds of oolite
are observed nearly constantly to cover these marls containing
the Gryphaea virgula ; they reappear in other places (Pointe
du Rocher), and are immediately in contact with the green-
sand.     By comparing this system with that which exists in
England, we may assimilate the oolite of which we have spoken
with the Portland stone, while the lower beds of marl, con
taining the Gryphrea virgula, correspond with the Kimmeridge
clay*."
    The reader being now in possession of what may be termed
the mineralogical character of the oolitic series at the various
places   above noticed,    I shall proceed to examine the organic
character of the same series derived from the same authorities,
commencing with the inferior system.

       Remains in the Oolite Series   of England and France.   95
    Unfortunately M. Boblaye has not furnished us with a list
of the ammonites in the district noticed by him, otherwise we
might probably have seen that some of those discovered else
where, were also found in the North of France. Ammonites
concavus and A. elegans are marked as questionable in the
 North of England, but they are slated to occur in the lias of
 Normandy.       The Dapedium politum is found in the South of
 England and     in Normandy.
    Of the organic remains above enumerated, the Grypbaea
incurva Sow. (G. arcuata Lam.) appears the most character
istic fossil. — Belemnites are also abundant. Unfortunately the
synonyms of the fossils are not well understood ; so that the
species cannot be determined with precision. Ammonites Wal-
cotii, Spirifer Walcotii, Pecten equivalvis, Plagiostoma gigan-
tea, Avicula inaequivalvis, Modiola scalprum, have also a wide
range. Ammonites Turneri and Terebratula tetraedra occur
in localities widely separated from each other.
    Ammonites Bucklandi is extensively found, though, by the
accompanying lists, it is only noticed in the North and South
of England and in Normandy.
    Of the 90 species of fossil shells enumerated by Mr. Phillips
in the lias of Yorkshire, 26 occur in the same rock in the
other localities ; of these 15 are discovered at Lyme Regis,
9 in Normandy (belemnites         not being specified), 2 in the
North of France (neither ammonites nor belemnites being
specified), and 8 in the South of France.
   Of the 36 species mentioned as found at Lyme Regis, 19
have been observed in the other places; of these 15 occur in
Yorkshire, 8 in Normandy, 2 in the North of France, and 7
in the South of France.
   Of the 25 species enumerated in Calvados, 12 are disco
vered in the other localities ; of these 9 occur in Yorkshire,
8 at Lyme Regis, 2 in the North of France, and 5 in the
South of France.
    OF the 5 species noticed by M. Boblaye in the North of
France, who unfortunately does not mention the species of
either ammonites or belemnites, 3 are found in the other lo
calities ; and of these 2 occur in Yorkshire, Lyme Regis, and
Normandy, and 3 in the South of France.
   Of the 26 species noticed in the South of France, 1 3 are
found in the other localities ; and of these 8 occur in York
shire, 7 at Lyme Regis, 5 in Normandy, and 3 in the North
of France.

XII.     Account of a new Paddle-Wlieel, in which the Motion is

*•*,
      of its parts in detail is given in the accompanying drawing.
(Plate I.) Fig. 1. is the end-view of the frame and paddles. A
is a cast-iron centre-piece or bosh, which receives thewrought-

                      bearing the connecting rods          &c. as also         9,
shown at T in fig. 3.       H shows the angle made by any one
of the paddles when the wheel            in that position; and when
                                                       is
it  arrives at the dotted lines F, just entering the water,                                  it
makes an obtuse angle with its axis (see G), so that the pad
dle acts with a propelling power the instant           enters the wa      it
ter, without any loss of power whatever and when                arrives
                                                                  ;                  F
at E,   ithas the greatest power, and its lever and rod          make                    9
an angle best adapted to resist the pressure of the water at E.
When      E arrives at the dotted lines D,      leaves the water in a

satisfaction to the parties making the trial, shortening the voy
age by two hours, and causing a great saving of coal.             The
plan is simple, and a wheel constructed upon it would have
verv little friction.    The paddles may be renewed in a few
minutes, as they are screwed and dowelled on, so that a broken
paddle may be removed, or one of a different size fixed on,
with- the greatest ease ; and the inclination, or dip and rise of
the paddles can be changed in five minutes, by a set-screw on
the fixed or eccentric crank.
   A working model of this paddle-wheel, on the scale of an
inch to a foot, was completed by me in January last (1829) ;
it was shown to various gentlemen engaged in steam-naviga
tion and the manufacture of machinery ; and in the beginning
of August last, it was placed in the hands of Mr. — Morris,
parchment-manufacturer, of Long-Lane, Bermondsey, who
kindly endeavoured to introduce it to the notice of some parties
high in office.     It remained with him for about three months,
and was deposited for exhibition in the National Repository
of Arts, King's Mews, on the 12th of November last
    On the 14th instant, I removed it from the gallery, for the
purpose of showing it to Mr. Richard Taylor, to whom a
drawing and description of it had been previously submitted
for publication in the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of
 Philosophy ; and it now remains in my possession, and may
be inspected by any person who may wish to examine it.
    Should any gentleman engaged in the construction or ap
plication of machinery to steam-navigation be desirous of try
ing paddle-wheels on this principle,        I shall be happy to con
struct a model, in which the principle will be simplified, and
the expense of construction of the wheel materially reduced.

 XIII.    On Artificial and Natural 'Arrangements of Plants : and
   particularly on the Systems of Linnceus and Jussieu. By
    WILLIAM ROSCOE, Esq. F.L.S.
                         [Continued from page 23.]
 TNSTEAD          of dwelling further on the endeavours of the
     French botanists to invalidate the labours of Linnaeus by
resorting, as Ventenat has done, to the well-known censures of
 Hal lor and others, I shall in the sequel of this paper endeavour
 to ascertain the relative merits of the two systems which now
    N. S. Vol. 7. No. 38. Feb. 18SO.               O        principally

98               Mr. Roscoe   on   Artificial and Natural
principally offer themselves to our acceptance ; in which shall I
attempt to show,
   I. That the method of Jussieu is not in fact a natural, but
      an artificial one.
   II. That, as an artificial method, the system of Jussieu is
      inferior to that of Linnaeus.
     III. That the artificial and natural methods of arrange
      ment are, and must always remain, essentially different
       from each other, as well in the means employed as in the
      objects to be attained.
   I. Could we suppose it possible for a person to be born with
some superior instinct, which enabled him to decide at first
sight on the character of a plant, and the genus and order to
which it belonged, we might perhaps be induced to assent to
his decisions, and allow him arbitrarily to establish his system.
But, even with this conviction on our minds, circumstances
might arise to shake our belief in his infallibility ; and        like
                                                                    if,
Bernard de Jussieu, he should, in one short order of only
eight genera, unite together the Bromclia and the Hydrocfiaris,
the Musa and the Galanthus, we should perhaps feel inclined
to ask upon what similarity in the flower, root, or seed, he
had founded his opinion. — Nor would            be sufficient for the
                                               it
ends of science,     ifthe decisions of this superior being were
always free from error.       For this purpose, we must not only
know, but must be enabled to communicate our knowledge to
others and how this could be done, without our giving some
        ;
specific reasons for our convictions, and for the assent to them
which we claim,     it   not easy to conceive.
                         is
   These difficulties were perceived by the younger Jussieu               ;
who, instead of giving us          amere list of genera, arbitrarily
arranged in orders, characterized from some one of the prin
cipal genera in each order, has condescended to explain the
grounds of his opinions by an arrangement or system, founded
on the visible and tangible parts of the plants themselves.
From this moment          was evident that no supernatural intel
                         it
ligence had dictated the arrangement; which, notwithstanding
its more imposing title, was to be judged of, like all other
arrangements, only by its superior ingenuity, accuracy, and
utility.    Itmight indeed be more skilfully executed than the
system of Linnaeus       ;but still   appealed to the same organs
                                       it
of sense, and submitted to be judged by the same rules.
   In one view of the subject, all modern systems may indeed
be denominated natural, as they are all deduced from some
part, property, or peculiarity, of the 'plants themselves       those
                                                                :

                                                                  nolj

nol, from the calyx ; that of Linnaeus, chiefly from the num
ber, proportion, and situation of the stamina; and that of
Jussieu, from the mode of germination, and situation of the
stamina; but principally, like that of Tournefort, from the
number and disposition of the petals.        It is true, that some of
these methods may be greatly preferable to others ; but it is
equally true, that there is scarcely one of them that does not
possess some advantages which the others do not afford, and
which have induced their respective authors to give them the
preference. Some of them may even approach nearer to a
natural system than the rest; or, in other words, may occa
sion less separation among plants which have a real affinity :
others may pay less regard to this object, and may in some
 degree sacrifice it for the purpose of giving a more correct,
 extensive, and intelligible nomenclature; but the distinctions
 on which they are founded are equally natural; although it
 may not be possible for any method that is confessedly founded
 upon the sensible phaenomena of the vegetable kingdom, what
 ever its pretensions may be, to unite together the families of
 plants in the strict natural orders and relative situations, or
 occasionally to avoid separating those which the general con
 victions of our senses assure us ought to be united.
     If however it be still asserted that the system of Jussieu is
 to be preferred, as exhibiting a more exact conformity to the
 affinities of nature than that of Linnaeus, may we be allowed
 to ask upon what this superiority is founded, and in what par
 ticular part of the system it consists?         Are the affinities of
 plants more likely primarily to    result from   the petals, or from
 the stamina ? from the part which shelters the immediate or
 gans of reproduction, or from those organs themselves, con
 nected as they are with the very nature and fructification of
 the plant? Supposing a doubt to arise whether a plant ought
 to be arranged with such as agreed with it in the corolla, or
 in the stamina, how would a skilful naturalist be inclined
 to decide ? or which would he consider as the most powerful
 affinity ? In whatever manner the orders of the two Jussieus
 may have been formed, they exhibit, at least, as many incon
 gruities to the general observer, as the classes and orders of
  Linnaeus.    What would such an observer, unacquainted with
 the secret chain employed by these authors, say to the union
 in the same class of the Palmce with the Junci ? the Musce with
 the Hydrocharides ? the Protece with the Atriplices ? the Jas-
 mineec with the Scrophularice ? the Rhododendra with the Cam-
 panidaccce ? or, in short, to the many tribes apparently wholly
 discordant from each other, in conformation, in habit, in qua
 lities, which occur in almost every class ? Can the system of
                                  O 2                         Linnaeus

100            Mr. Roscoe        on Artificial and Natural
Linnaeus exhibit any associations more revolting to his con
ceptions, or which would tend more decisively to convince
him that, whatever may he their pretensions, these systems
are in fact equally artificial, and that their assumed natural
affinities are nothing more than a partial resemblance, founded
on some peculiarity of habit or conformation, which may serve
to decide its situation in a nomenclature, but has often little
or no relation to the real and essential nature of the plant?
    II. If such be the fact, our inquiry will now take a different
shape. It is no longer a question as to the superiority of one sy
stem over another, but a question of degrees as to the superior
execution of a similar method. Let us then, whether we choose
to denominate them both natural or both artificial, briefly com
pare the rival arrangements of Linnaeus and Jussieu.
    The most important difference between these two methods
consists in a preliminary distinction made by Jussieu, by which
he divides the vegetable kingdom into three departments,
to each of which he applies a separate mode of arrangement,
whereas Linnaeus applies his method indiscriminately to the
whole.      By the plan of Jussieu we are in the first place to
ascertain whether the plant which we examine rises from the
seed without a cotyledon, with one cotyledon, or with two co
tyledons * ; and having determined this point, we then pro
ceed by other rules to distinguish the individuals in each de
partment. By that of Linnaeus we take the plant without any
regard to its mode of germination, and from the parts of fruc
tification immediately determine its character, and assign it to
its proper genus.          That the mode in which plants arise from
the seedf, or, more strictly speaking, that the seed itself, of
which the cotyledons are formed, affords a true natural distinc
tion, cannot be doubted ; but in estimating the advantages of
this distinction, we must also estimate its disadvantages, and
form our decision upon the whole result.              The object attained
                                                                           by
   * This distinction it may be observed was made by Linnaeus himself, as
the foundation of his Segnum VegetabUe; with the necessary and indeed
indispensable addition of the Polycotylcdones.
                " Tribus vcgetabihum tres vulgo numerantur.

    t In his Phiiosophia Botaraca, Linnxus has carried this method much
 further than Jussieu has done ; having divided the Monocotyledones into

by Jussieu is the separating from the great mass of vegetables,
two portions ; one of which, the acotyledones, comprehends
the cryptogamous plants of Linnaeus, and forms the first class
of Jussieu : the other, the monocotyledones, includes the gra
mineous and liliaceous plants, and forms the second, third,
and fourth of his classes.         These distinctions may be admitted
to be well founded * ; but what are the advantages they af
ford over those of Linnaeus? who has also referred the Cryp
togamous Plants to a distinct class by a peculiarity equally
natural, the inconspicuity of their flowers, and with a few ex
ceptions, not perhaps difficult to have been avoided, has ar
ranged the gramineous and liliaceous plants in orders as na
tural as those of Jussieu.
     In this respect, then, the two systems are nearly upon an
equality ; and to say the truth, it was almost impossible for
any naturalist, upon a subject where the grounds of distinction
 were so numerous and so manifest, to adopt a different con
clusion.      But if nothing be gained in this instance by Jussieu,
 can we also say that nothing is lost?               Is it no disadvantage,
 on discovering an unknown plant, to be under the necessity,
 before we proceed to its further investigation, of ascertaining
in what manner it commenced its growth, and whether it rose
 from the seed with one or with two cotyledons, or without any
 cotyledon whatever?           To whom are we to apply for this in
 formation ? Or are we to be turned round to ascertain the
 primary distinction by the sensible appearance, and instead of
 saying that the plant rose from one cotyledon and is there
 fore a grass, that it is a grass and therefore rose from one co
 tyledon '( At all events, it imposes a difficulty on the student

 102              Mr. Roscoe      on  Artificial and Natural
 without affording an adequate advantage, and throws a doubt
over the great mass of individuals of the vegetable kingdom,
to be removed only by inquiring into the mode of their early
growth, in order to separate from the rest some detached
plants which are equally as well separated by other distinc
 tions quite as natural and more permanent, and which it is
indeed impossible should be confounded with them.
    This peculiarity in the method of Jussieu being considered,
the two systems, as far as they regard the great mass of the
vegetable kingdom, may now be placed in more direct com
parison.         Linnaeus has founded his primitive distinctions on
 the number and proportions of the stamina; not omitting the
 diversities arising from their situation. Jussieu, disregarding
in his primary distinctions the number of the stamina, has re
 course merely to their situation, which he distinguishes into
three different manners, as being placed upon, around, or be
low the germen, under the appellations of Epigyna, Perigyna,
and Upogyna *. This distinction is applied however only to
his apetalous and polypetalous plants, the monopetalous plants
 being distinguished not immediately by the stamina, but by
the situation qf the corolla.            This necessarily compels him to
commence his definitions by the corolla, and accordingly he
first divides his dicotyledonous plants into apetalous, mono
petalous, and polypetalous.              Of these the apetalous are to be
again      subdivided       by the  stamina,     which are considered with
respect,      not   to  the   number,     but  the situation ; and as in the
absence of the corolla the stamina are inserted directly into
the style or germen, this is denominated the absolutely imme
diate insertion of the stamina, constituting the fifth, sixth, and
seventh, of his classes.           The monopetalie, distinguished into
separate      tribes   by  the  corolla,  which is for the most part sta-
miniferous,       and   is therefore   said  to exhibit the mediate inser
tion of the stamina, form the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh,
classes ; and the polypetala, characterized again by the situa
tion of the stamina, the insertion of which is here called sim
ply immediate,' as it accidentally varies at times into the mediate
insertion, or in other words is found sometimes on the germen
and at others on the corolla f, form the twelfth, thirteenth and

   * With respect to these distinctions, the most important in the arrange
ment of Jussieu, the reader (fttmt "Affnt tcru) may consult Mr. Salisbury's
" Observations on the Perigynous         Insertion of the Stamina of Plants;"
where he has undertaken to show that such perigynous insertion is entirely
factitious, and that there is no instance whatever, in the whole vegeta
ble kingdom, of stamina being inserted in the calyx. — V. Trans. Linn. Soc.

other head.
    Independent, therefore, of the distinctions arising from the
cotyledons, which, however well founded, have been shown to
be of little practical utility, the system of Jussieu is the system
of Tournefort ; in which Jussieu has, it seems, discovered ad
vantages resulting from the incidental connection between the
stamina and the corolla, of which Tournefort himself was not
aware *. It must also be observed that the primary distinc
tions of Linnaeus extend at once through the twenty-four
classes, whilst those of Jussieu, arising from the cotyledons,
extend only to three ; the secondary, founded on the corolla,
form only three more ; and the subdivisions of these by the
stamina and antherce, including the anomalous class ofDiclines
irregulares, form in the whole only fifteen classes, thus obtain
ing much less in point of distinction by four separate processes
than Linnaeus has obtained by one.
     The consequence of this         is,
                                     that there are on an average a
 much greater number of plants in each of the classes of Jussieu
 than in those of Linnaeus. In order to designate these classes,
 Linnaeus has recourse solely to the stamina, from the number,
proportion, and situation of which he has formed all his di
 stinctions, which he has comprised in one single expressive
 word, fully indicative of the grounds upon which the class                   is
 founded.    Jussieu, on the contrary, in order to arrive at the
 distinctions of his classes, has taken a more circuitous path, and
 instead of referring to single part, and defining
                            a                            by   single
                                                               it        a
 word, has recourse to various peculiarities, as well in the mode
 of germination as in the fructification.      Thus the compound
 flowers, forming a natural order, are designated          Linnaeus by
 by the term Syngenesia; whilst Jussieu denominates them
corolla supprimitur, ut in apetalis  ;     vel est timplex, in mediatim forlvitd
mutabilis, dum corolla existens non gerit stamina, et tainen ferre interdum
potest, ut in  plerisque polypetalis," &c. — Jiui. Gen. PI. p. 79.

   But had Jussieu preserved     a    strictly natural method, he would have
adopted the distinctions on the cotyledons, as suggested by Linnaeus. In
deserting these he has evidently fallen into an artificial one, having no con
nection whatever with the foundation on which his system       is  built.

Plantce dicotyledones, monopetalte, corolla epigyna, anthera:
connatoc.     To say nothing of the inconveniencies introduced
into the science by the substitution of a long definition for an
appropriate appellation, the consequence of this diversity in the
two systems is in other respects important.             The separation
of  the  vegetable kingdom      into classes  is only one  step towards
an arrangement.         The subordinate divisions of orders and
genera require other distinctions. It becomes necessary, there
fore, not to expend, as it were, in the formation of the classes
those peculiarities which may be applied with so much effect,
and which are indeed indispensable in the subordinate arrange
ments.      Of this Linnaeus was fully aware ; and he has ac
cordingly reserved for this purpose, not only certain particu
larities in the situation of the stamina, but the whole advan
tages arising from the corolla, calyx, and nectarium ; and,
what is of still greater moment, the distinctions dependent on
the number and form of the style and stigma.            Jussieu, on the
 contrary, has prematurely deprived himself of many of these
 distinctive characters, although from the greater magnitude of
 his classes he has greater occasion for them.             Those which
 arise from the number of the petals, as well as the situation
 of the stamina, he has applied to the formation of his classes,
 and in some instances, as in his tenth and eleventh classes, has
 even resorted to the antherae for these leading distinctions.
 The consequences of this will more fully appear by a brief
 comparison of these arrangements in their subordinate divi
 sions.

 XIV.     Reply to CALEB MAINSPRING'S            Observations  on Prize
              Chronometers.      By A    CORRESPONDENT.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
       your Magazine     for December last, there is    a paper, signed
 IN"Caleb     Mainspring," on the subject of Prize Chronometers.
    As that paper contains some allusions to the Admiralty and
 the late Board of Longitude,          I  must beg leave explicitly to
 state,  before proceeding    further,  that  I am totally unconnected
 with either.     It is not  necessary   to  suppose the Admiralty to
 know any thing about science, but it is certain that the late
 Board of Longitude contained a number of the most eminently
 scientific men in the British dominions : but with neither of
 these points have I any thing to do.
    My object is to expose the absurdity of the person's argu
                                                                  ments

             Reply to Caleb Mainspring's      Observations.        .105
  ments who has assumed the name of Caleb Mainspring. I
  am afraid this writer is either some disappointed chronometer-
  maker, who has failed in his attempts to gain a Greenwich
  prize, or else he is in " good sober truth
                                                 " the
                                                        mighty oracle
  of such a club as that   which   he himself  describes, held at the
  " Tippling Philosopher in Liquorpond-street."          If this latter
  is the case, as is most probable, he should be content to con
  fine his nonsense within the walls of his club-room, where
  alone it will be received as gospel : in the present case 1 am
  afraid he has got himself into as bad a scrape as Paddy
  O'Rourke the Irish schoolmaster, who, not content with bear
  ing away the palm from the King's excise-officer in a dispu
  tation on the cubic contents of a whiskey-still (which he had
  computed to the third decimal place), actually engaged in a
  contest with the parish priest of Kildrogan, which ended in
  poor Paddy being excommunicated.
     But to come to the point : I hereby aver that the watch
  No. 2, in the paper referred to, is a much more perfect instru
  ment for the purposes of navigation than was ever yet con
  structed by any maker ; and that No. 1, or the chronometer
  as it is termed, only possesses that common degree of merit
  which is to be expected from such works at the present day.
     With respect to the general merits of the rule given by the
  late Board of Longitude      I  have nothing to say, as our tip
  pling philosopher has deferred giving us the Original docu
  ment till some future time ; but it is certain that in the case of
 these two watches, that rule would award the prize to an in
 strument which has arrived nearer perfection than any one
 which has yet been made, in preference to one of ordinary
 merit only.
     To prove this, let us examine the rates of the two watches,
 as given for sixty days : No. 2 has a constant mean rate, but is
 liable to a variation, the maximum of which is 3*'8 ; No. 1 has
 an accelerating rate, and is also liable to a variation in that
 acceleration of l"-2. Now the gentleman from Liquorpond-
 street informs us, that these sixty days are fair specimens of what
 will take place, and that the two watches may be depended
 upon to go in this manner for twelve months.            Now let us
suppose the two watches sent to sea on the first of the sixty
days for a voyage of six months, it is evident that at the end
of that time, or at the end of any indefinite time, the watch
No. 2 will never be in error more than the daily variation 3"'8,
or less than one mile of longitude.       It is to be hoped that by
whatever rule the merits of watches are to be tried, our tip
pling philosopher will never wish for a better one than this for
its proper purpose.      •
     On the contrary No. 1, which has a constantly accelerating
N. S. Vol. 7. No. 38. Feb. 18SO.                      P          rate.

106    Mr. Haworth's Twelfth Decade of New Succulent Plants.
rate, must have been sent on the first of the sixty days to the
vessel which it was to direct, with a less rate than 5", at which
it was then going. We will, however, take it at 5" ; then with
precisely the same daily increase, &c. in its rate, which is
given it for the sixty days, it will at the end of six months be
2' 50"'* in error, or upwards of forty miles of longitude. What
can our tippling philosopher say to this ?            If he nas no better
time-piece than this to direct his motions, he will in about six
years be going to Liquorpond-street half an hour too late, at
the risk of being fined a gallon of treble X.
    In the rates for the sixty days as given, No. 1 would be in
error at the sixtieth day 56"-8, or more than fourteen miles in
longitude, without taking any notice of the variation in the rate;
whereas No. 2, as before stated, would not have one mile error.
     Should there be any opportunity of getting a new rate for
these watches, the result will not be much more satisfactory.
Let ustakethe chances from their going for the sixty days, and
if we take new rates for every 15, 20, and 30 days, the
watch No. 2 still maintains the superiority.
Rate for each 15 days.       Rate for each 20 days.    Rate for each 30 days.
  No. 1.       No 2.            No. 1.      No. 2.         No. 1.     No. 2.

  6-853         6.76
    In  fact, No. 2 is invaluable, and No.         1 of no use except for
short voyages.         I  have only to add that our Liquorpond-
street friend ought to give us the " original document ;" the
subject is an interesting one : and although he says this docu
ment is " much too sublime for our vulgar ears," yet as it ap
pears to be perfectly correct in its application in the present
instance (the only one I believe ever brought against it), it is
certainly to be presumed innocent until proved guilty.

        Succulent Plants,      which consists of ten new species of
DeCandolle's new and remarkable Natural Order of CACTE.E,
whose botanical characters are given in the third volume of

    hoped, will be found welcome to your botanical    readers both at
                                  I
    home and abroad ; for am happy to add, that every plant you
    have published from me, with due reference to your valuable
    Miscellany, (as quickly as time allows it,) enters and takes its
    appropriate place in those great records of botanical science,
                               Continent,) the vast works of Decan-
    (now publishing on the
    dolle and Schultes ;— the former in Natural Orders, and above
     mentioned; and the latter in Linnaean Classes, and called
     Caroli a Linne, Systema Vegetabilium, Editio Nova.
         Perhaps no Linnaean genus of plants of similar magnitude
     has received so many additions to          it,
                                              through the unceasing
     labours of modern research, (and which, in every direction,
    is   extensively proceeding,) as his famous Genus CACTUS.       In
     his own last edition of the celebrated Species Plantarum,  vol.         i.
     p. 166, published in 1764, he enumerates, from every then
     existing source, only twenty-three species of Cactus, divided
     into four sections   ;and many even of those species he had
     never seen, having taken them up from the representations
     or accounts of others. And even the last edition of our classic
     Hortus Kewensis has but twenty-four.
         But we may now behold, even in a state of successful cul
      tivation, not fewer than ten times as many.
         It is  in consequence of this exuberant harvest, that the

          has long since been our Hieracium aurantiacum, from
          its having a grime-coloured calyx.

              Obs. Adanson's ancient generic name      of Hariota,
         must however be restored to this group ;     or at least to
         the cylindric, smooth, unangled, pendulous part of it ;
         as soon as it can be determined whether the species
          allied to my Rhipsalis mesembiyanthoides do not form
          of themselves a distinct subgenus from Adanson's
          genus Hariota ; which they probably do.     I have never
          seen Adanson's book, or should, quite as      a matter of
          course, have adopted his earlier genus Hariota.         It
          is probable that both these names may be retained.
    Obs.   In Bwman's edition of    the excellent and faithful out
line figures of Plumier's    PI. Americ. two gigantic Cerei are re
                                                          presented

      Mr. Haworth's Twelfth Decade of new         Succulent Plants.    1 1 3
   presented on tab. 195. These two fine plants (as appears by
   a very careful examination of all the letter-press), DeCan-
  dolle, through oversight, somewhat confuses by the name of
   C. Jimbriatus in the third volume of his excellent Prodromus,
      464, (and cites Lam. Diet. i. 539, which I do not possess,)
 E.ut makes no proper mention of the gigantic thorns of one of
  these remarkable plants.          Wherefore it will be a great service
  to our science to re-describe both from Plumier's figures, as
  follows, after observing that some of the synonyms appear to
  be erroneous.

         singulo spinarum fascicule, ut in C.? gibboso Nob. in
         I. c, semper gerit.      Hi duo fortasse sectionem novam
         constituunt, et gibbiferum nomen propono.
             Obs. This plant is doubtless an Echinocactus, and
         to prevent confusion (as above-mentioned) ought to
         occupy the name of nobilis, although by some modern
         authors it has been changed. Such worse than useless
         alterations ever breed confusion.           They blur the
         beauty of our flowery science, and clog its progress
         to perfection, in a needless way. No name how
         ever great, no authority however bold, nor any argu
         ment however ingenious, ought at this enlightened
         period to be encouraged, by adopting such wilful,
         useless, and unnecessary change.

" La Mort    1'a surpris" (Fabricius)

"V17"E believe that the Extract alluded to by Cuvier has
  * * never been
                          published in our language, and that very
few British lepidopterists know any thing of Fabricius's Sy
stema Glossatorum, except by name.                    The original work has
never appeared, and we are not aware that any other account
of it has been given to theworld than that by M. llliger, at least
Latreille, in 1811, knew of no other; for he says, " n'ayant
connu cette nouvelle classification," (viz. glossatorvm, " le der
nier travail" de Fabricius) que par 1'extrait qu'en a public
M. llliger," &c. (Recueil d'Obs. de Zool. Humb. et Bonpl. i.
p. 237.) We hope, therefore, that the following abridged trans
lation of the article above-mentioned may be acceptable to our
readers. llliger has preserved the specific names of the-Ew-
tomologia Systematica, which he says, in the later work (the
SystemaGlossatomm,)          are frequently changed for others, chiefly
derived from those of the plants on which the caterpillars feed ;
and he also expresses a doubt as to the stability of some of the
following genera, many of which are founded on very minute
distinctions, principally the hairiness of the palpi.

    cond joint hairy.        Antcnnce setaceous, multiarticulate.

 ¥ N the Companion to the British Almanac for 1830,                     I have
-*
     published      a disquisition   on   the  tides, in which   I  have    en
deavoured to show the connection between the theory of the
tides and the facts as they are observed in the Thames at Lon
don.      M. Bouvard compared the observations made at Brest
with the results of Laplace's theory; but no other comparison
of the kind has ever been instituted ; which is highly remark
able in the instance of a phenomenon which is of daily occur
rence and striking regularity, and where a vast mechanical
power is perpetually exerted before our eyes. The tide-tables
which have hitherto been published in this country, have been
calculated by methods which are studiously kept secret The
first attempt, however, which has been made to reconcile theory
with observation has produced tide-tables which will,              I  believe,
be found as accurate as any of those calculated by empirical
rules long tried, and probably often corrected.

      Mr. Lubbock     on the Tides   in the Port of London.              125
  I  believe many persons suppose that no theory of the tides
can be expected to apply to places separated from the main
ocean by long and narrowing channels, as is the case in the
port of London. This notion will, I think, be removed, if it
be considered that the condition which justifies the application
of the theory to a river, is not that the tides should there be
the same in time or in height as they are in the ocean, but
that they should be as regular in the former as in the latter
case ; and that we may here reckon upon this degree of regu
larity at least.   Such a situation is in fact, what Laplace con
siders in the    case of Brest as a remarkably happy circum
stance for the application of theory.
                                            " La situation de ce
port (Brest) est tres favorable a ce genre d'observations : il
communique avec la mer par un canal fort vaste, au fond du-
quel ce port a etc construit. Les irregnlarites du mouvement
de la mer parviennent ainsi dans ce port tres afiaiblies : a peu
pres comme les oscillations que le mouvement irregulier d'un
vaisseau produit dans le barometre sont attenues par un e'tran-
glement fait au tube de cet instrument." — Memoircs dc I'ln-
stitut, 1818: p. 1.
    As long as the bed of the river continues the same, the tide
will be regularly transmitted to any point of     it,  modified only
by  an  alteration of the  constant quantities in the formula  which
the theory gives. This will be the case, even   if    we suppose the
tide which we have here, to be compounded of two tides which
arrive by different courses and after different intervals, as
might very easily be shown to follow from the nature of the
expression by which the height of the water at a given time                 is
represented. The theory of the tides of Laplace in the second
volume of the Mecanique Celeste,      is one of the most splendid
instances of his unrivalled skill in the application of mathe
matics to questions in physical science    ;   and there can be no
doubt that his theory will give the circumstances of the tides at
the port of London. Laplace no where hints at any restriction
which would exclude such case, and accordingly

                                                               It   is
ever somewhat remarkable that the table which        is given in that
work has not undergone any alteration since the time of Ber-
nouilli, who first gave    it,  or has ever, as far as  I  am aware,

nine thousand observations of those made at the London Docks
in the course of twenty-five years.
   It is found that the times of high-water calculated from the
table given in the Annuaire, would differ widely from the ob
served time; but by applying the formula from which this
table was deduced with alterations in the constant quantities,
according to Laplace's theory, the mean of the observed times
•agrees with the time calculated, with an exactness    which
amounts almost to identity, as will be seen by the following

   As this coincidence has been misunderstood,                           I    may remark
that the calculated times were made to correspond with the
mean of the observed times in two places only,- namely, in those
which correspond to the moon's southing at two and five hours:
their near agreement throughout, proves that the form of the
expression from which the calculated times were deduced,
is correct.  Their coincidence in the first of these points
amounts to inferring from the observations the values of the
constants X and     their coincidence in the second amounts to

   The observations seem to indicate mass of the moon greater
                                                   a
than that which has been deduced from the phenomena of
precession and nutation; but to determine so delicate       point,                 a
the observations must be discussed and examined with greater
care, and the effect of the inequality of variation in the moon's
parallax considered.
 I  regret that I was misinformed with respect to the manner
in which the time was obtained.     was not taken from Ro-

 quence whatever.
    It may perhaps interest some of your readers whose notice
 has been drawn to this subject, to see n comparison between
 the calculation and the fact, as far as the time has yet gone.
 M. Dessiou's calculations begin with the 1st of January :
 thirteen days of that month only have now elapsed ; and the
 shortness of the time is of itself a serious obstacle to any ex
act agreement of theory and observation ; for such an agree
ment is to be looked for only in mean results deduced from
many comparisons.         The accidental causes which influence
particular tides are so many and so obscure, and the mode of
observation so inexact, that    I do not conceive that either these
tide-tables, or any other, can be free from deviations from the
noted time, which may often amount to a quarter of an hour.
It appears by the following register and calculations, that, as
far as the observations have yet been made, the mean time of
high-water at the London Docks has differed by less than four
minutes from the tables in the British Almanac.
    I am well aware that the practical application of this subject
requires considerable caution, and that the observations which
it would be desirable to make, are by no means so simple
as might at first be imagined.      The difficulty arising from the
insensible change   of the height  of the tidejust at the maximum,
which produces what is called the hanging of the tide, is of an
obvious nature.     It may not perhaps be so obvious that the
rise and fall before and after the maximum are by no means
symmetrical ; but this    I understand from Captain Eastfield is
the case, under   whose    superintendence a most valuable series
of observations has been undertaken at the East India Docks,
but which are not likely to be continued for any great length
of time.    In a country like ours, where both from scientific
and   commercial  considerations the subject of the tides is so well
worth attention, it is not too much to hope for the assistance
of Government in procuring at least one series of accurate
observations continued for many years.
    When the mode of observing the time of high-water has been
rendered as accurate as it ought to be and migiit easily be
made, and when a series of observations have been made on
such an improved plan, we may endeavour to introduce greater
exactness into our tables; but at present the agreement is
more than sufficient for practical purposes, and the mean error
is within the limits of the errors of the observations.

XVIII.       On a new Salt obtained                  by the   partial Decomposi
   tion  of  Perchloride          of Mercury.           By R. PHILLIPS, F.R.S.
           action of chlorides and water, as a theoretical subject,
       has perhaps occupied more than a requisite degree of at
tention : it has however again lately excited my notice, and the
experiments suggested by it have led to the formation of a mer
curial salt which has not, I believe, hitherto been described.
   Although when some chlorides, — those, for example, of an
timony and bismuth, — are mixed with water, we have demon
stration of the production of muriatic acid and a metallic oxide
by their mutual decomposition ; yet the supposition of similar
action is sometimes attended with considerable difficulty, and
especially when the base of the chloride has but slight affinity
for oxygen, as in the instances of gold and mercury.                          "
   N.S. Vol. 7. No. 38. Feb. 1830.                               S                   With

   130   Mr. Phillips   on a new Salt obtained by the partial
      With   respect  to perchloride   of mercury, if it does not
  become    bipermuriate by     solution  in and decomposition of
  water, it appears to me that the    excess of chlorine should de
  stroy vegetable colours : but this is so far from being the case,
  that litmus paper is reddened by the solution precisely as it is
  by any acidulous salt. It occurred to me also, that if the salt
  remains a perchloride in solution, we might probably even in
  that state, by abstracting half the chlorine, reduce it to proto-
  chlorideor calomel, as in the dry way, by the addition of mer
   cury.
     It is however well known that potash, soda, and lime-water
  precipitate peroxide of mercury from a solution of corrosive
  sublimate ; but as the action of the carbonated is in many cases
  different from that of the caustic alkalies, and as they decom
  pose some bisults without converting their bases into carbo
  nates, I added carbonate of lime to a solution of corrosive
  sublimate, and heated the mixture : to my surprise a dark-
  coloured precipitate was soon formed, and I supposed, at first,
  not only that an atom of chlorine had been separated, but
  that the carbonate of lime had occasioned the deposition of
 protoxide of mercury, by extending its action to the proto-
 chloride formed, — an effect which it is not perhaps generally
 known that it is capable of producing to a certain extent. On
 examination I found that the action which had occurred was
 very different from what I had imagined ; the precipitate was
 crystalline, extremely heavy, and of so dark a colour that the
 larger crystals appeared nearly black.      It was very sparingly
 soluble even in boiling water, and scarcely at all in cold, so
 that the hot solution deposited crystals on cooling. It was readily
 dissolved by acids, and the solution in acetic acid yielded per
 oxide of mercury by potash, and chloride of silver by the ni
 trate.
     To  ascertain  whether the whole of a given portion of cor
 rosive sublimate could be decomposed by carbonate of lime,
 I boiled equal weights of these substances in water for a con
 siderable time : on adding potash to the solution, an abundant
precipitate of peroxide of mercury was obtained, showing that
a portion of the mercurial salt remained undecomposed, al
though the carbonate contained lime enough to saturate nearly
three times as much muriatic acid as the chlorine of the
sublimate could yield. It appears therefore that counteraction
takes place as long as the muriate of lime formed remains in
solution, and complete action is prevented, just as the pre
sence of the resulting sulphate of potash hinders the total de
composition of sulphate of barytes when it is boiled in a solu
tion of carbonate of potash.     I found also that the solution by
                                                       evaporation

             Decomposition    of Perchloride of Mercury.          131
evaporation yielded a crystalline deliquescent salt, composed
of the muriates of lime and mercury, but in what proportions
I  have not yet determined by experiment, though from the
nature of the dark-coloured salt formed, it would be easy to
deduce them.
    In order to examine the nature of the salt precipitated by
carbonate of lime, and first to ascertain whether it contained
any water, a portion which had been moderately dried was
put into a glass tube and heated in a salt-water bath. No
moisture was observed ; the salt suffered no change of appear
ance or loss of weight. It therefore contains no water of cry
stallization. At higher temperatures it yields water and cor
rosive sublimate, and afterwards mercury and calomel.
    The quantity of chloride of silver which the salt would
yield, was determined by dissolving 100 grains in acetic acid;
solution of nitrate of silver being added, gave a precipitate
which weighed 27'5 grains; and on repeating the experiment
28 grains were obtained, giving a mean of 27'75 of chloride of
silver, equivalent to 7 grains of muriatic acid.
    One hundred grains of the salt were boiled in a solution
of potash; the peroxide of mercury precipitated when dried
weighed 93-5 grains. Allowing for the errors of experiment,
 the salt then appears to be composed of
                Muriatic acid                          7*
                Peroxide   of mercury                93*5.
                                                    100-5
    If we   consider this salt as a dipermuriate of mercury, it will
 consist of
     One atom of muriatic acid                   37 or        7'8
     Two atoms of peroxide of mercury ... 432 or             92-2

    It will  be observed that the oxygen in the peroxide of mer
 cury amounts to 4 atoms, while the muriatic acid contains
 only 1 atom of hydrogen ; and as these are not in the propor
 tions required to form water, it is I think quite evident that
 the salt in question is an anhydrous muriate, and not a chlo
 ride.    I  am confirmed in this opinion by a remark of Dr.
 Thomson's on muriate of gold, which         I  have seen only since
 I  had arrived at a similar conclusion with respect to the salt
 in question. In the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin
 burgh, vol. xi. p. 28, Dr. Thomson mentions a muriate of
 gold composed of
          Two atoms of muriatic acid                    9'25

 1 32     Mr. Phillips  on a new Salt obtained by the   partial
    He   observes also that Berzelius has lately maintained that
 muriatic acid is incapable of combining with metallic oxides ;
 consequently, that no muriates exist, but merely chlorides, or
 compounds of chlorine and the metal, united to a certain quan
 tity of water.
    " But considerable difficulty," Dr. Thomson observes, " will
 be experienced in applying this reasoning to the muriate of
 gold.    If this salt be a chloride, it is obvious from the experi
 ments stated that it is composed of
             Two atoms of chlorine                        9
             One atom of gold                            25
                                                        ~SV'
     With  respect   to the permuriate    of tin noticed in the same
 paper, Dr.Thomson remarks, not only that the oxygen and hy
 drogen which it contains, could not form water, but he adds,
 " Nor supposing the salt to be a chloride, could any reason be
 assigned why the tin is thrown down by an alkali in the state
 of peroxide rather than protoxide." So also with respect to the
 dipermuriate of mercury now described ; we cannot imagine it
 to be a chloride, for it contains three more atoms of oxygen
 than are required to constitute water with the hydrogen: and on
 the same account we cannot explain why potash, supposing
 even that it yields oxygen and becomes a chloride, should
precipitate peroxide instead of protoxide of mercury. As then
the dipermuriate of mercury could not be formed either by
the decomposition of water, occasioned by the intermediate
action of the alkali, or by the transfer of its oxygen, as when
protochloride of mercury is decomposed by potash, — I con-
elude that corrosive sublimate in solution exists as a biper-
muriate of mercury, becoming so immediately by the decom
position of two atoms of water.       From a solution of bipermu-
riate thus ready existing, we may conceive any subsalts to be
formed by the action of an alkali ; but, for the reasons already
given, the alkali cannot, it appears to me, occasion either the
decomposition of water, or supply the oxygen requisite to the
formation of the peroxide.
    In concluding, I shall mention a few circumstances respect
ing die preparation of the new compound. It is well known,
that when only a moderate quantity of lime-water, or of solu
tion of potash, is added to one of corrosive sublimate, that a
reddish- brown precipitate is at first occasioned, which subse
quently assumes a yellow colour by an excess of the precipi
tant employed.
    I attempted to form the dipermuriate by decomposing a so
lution of corrosive sublimate both with carbonate of soda and
with lime-water, employing such proportions of each as would
                                                              detach

             Decomposition   of Perchloride of Mercury.        1SS
detach the required quantity of muriatic acid : the precipitates
obtained in both cases were reddish-brown, not at all crystal
line, much less dense than the dipermuriate, and contained
scarcely 6'5 per cent of muriatic acid. From all these circum
stances    I  have no doubt that both products were mixtures of
dipermuriate and peroxide of mercury.
   The colour, density and crystalline appearance of the diper
muriate of mercury depend on the moae in which it is pre
pared. When hard carbonate of lime, such as Iceland spar,
is put into a solution of corrosive sublimate, months are re
quired to obtain even a few crystals of the salt ; these are
nearly black, and adhere strongly to the carbonate : powdered
marble acts more readily, and without the application of heat.
By this method I have produced the most regular crystals,
and they may be separated by elutriation from all admixture
of the undissolved carbonate : some which I procured were
sufficiently large to exhibit distinct rhombic planes.       Preci
pitated carbonate      of lime   acts more rapidly than powdered
marble, but still the effect is slowly produced unless the mix
ture be heated: it is difficult, however, to procure the diper
muriate without some admixture of carbonate of lime; and its
colour is much lighter, and the crystals are smaller than those
obtained by slower action.
   By the following process I obtained the dipermuriate per
fectly ,free from all admixture : — Dissolve 1 atom = 272 grains
of perchloride of mercury in water, heat the solution ; and add
to it 648 grains = 3 atoms of peroxide of mercury, obtained
either by decomposing the pernitrate with heat, or corrosive
sublimate with potash;       I  prefer the latter on account of its
state of minute division.     When the mixture is boiled, a dark
precipitate soon begins to form, and eventually nearly the
whole is converted into the dipermuriate ; a small portion of
corrosive sublimate, yielding about 6 grains of peroxide of
mercury, remains unaecomposed, and of course an equiva
lent quantity of peroxide is diffused through the dipermuriate
formed; this is easily separated by boiling the precipitate
 with about 100 grains of muriatic acid diluted with water.
    The dipermuriate thus procured is perfectly black, dense,
crystalline, and frequently very brilliant.      The salt may also
be procured possessing similar appearance, by heating per
 oxide of mercury in a quantity of muriatic acid, less than that
 required for converting it into corrosive sublimate.
    While the foregoing paper was printing, I observed that
 in M. Gay-Lussac's Lectures (vol. i. lecture 17), he mentions
 die formation of subchloride of mercury, by mixing the per
                                                          chloride

XIX.    Suggestion of a New Method of Trial for the Chronome
          ters at Greenwich. By    CORRESPONDENT.

    To the Editors   ofthe Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
 11TAVING perused in your valuable Journal the remarks
•*-•*•
       of Caleb Mainspring on the System of Prize Chronome
ters at Greenwich, and having also noticed the Proposal of
another trial number suggested by J. L. T. as published in
the last Number of your Journal,         am induced as
                                           I              chrono
                                                          a
meter-maker to address this letter to you upon the subject         ;
hoping that my observations may prove useful to those who
have any interest in the matter.     The Admiralty, by awarding
premiums for chronometers, has proved how much might be
effected by the encouragement of science, as will be seen by
comparing the rates of the chronometers for the first year's
trial with those of the subsequent ones.       But when the Ad
miralty, in their wisdom, offered premiums for the best chro
nometers after one year's trial at the Royal Observatory, they
of course did not intend that the inferior chronometer should
hold the place of its superior but such, however,
                                      ;                   the case
                                                          is
by the present system of deciding the prizes, as the remarks
of Caleb Mainspring clearly show. The perfection of chro       a
nometer, in my opinion, consists in maintaining its rate with
uniformity, and not irregularity    and the more steadily a chro
                                      ;
nometer goes, the greater the proof of its being perfect in the
                                 is
different parts of its construction    and consider that
                                          :    I             chro
                                                               a
nometer which varies but little from its rate, but which goes
at an irregular pace,      not equal with one that varies
                          is                                  Httle
                                                               a
more, but which goes more regularly. By the present method of
deciding the prizes, the chronometer may be the reverseofwhat
I  have stated, as will be seen           by
                                      the example given by Caleb
Mainspring, published       your Journal for December last But
                            in
now, whilstI    find fault with the present system,      consider
                                                          I
myself called upon to suggest another, such as would remedy
the evil complained of; and therefore propose that the varia
                                               I
tion from the mean monthly rate be not doubled, as        now the
                                                          is
case, but that  it may be left single, and added to the mean
extreme variation, which would give the true error of the chro

nometer: and in adopting this method, the limits might be re
duced to 4 seconds for the first premium, -l\ for the second,
and 5J for the third.   Why the error from the rate has al
ways been doubled, I am at a loss to conceive. And now I ask,
what would have been the result of the trial as exemplified
by Caleb Mainspring, in which he makes his own common
watch to beat his master's chronometer?       According to my
proposal it would have been as follows :
                   My Master's Chronometer.           u
          Greatest mean monthly rate                  6*70
          Least      ditto                            5-26
                                Difference            1-44
          Greatest extreme variation"}
                  in April  = 1"-20 VMean=            1-20
                  in May    = 1 -20     J
                                  Trial number        2'64
                    My   own Common Watch.            n
          Greatest mean monthly rate                  6'80
          Least      ditto                            6*80
                               Difference     0*00
          Greatest extreme variation }
                   in April = 3"'80 \ Mean = 3'80
                   in May = 3 -80        J
                                 Trial number 3'80
And so would have been the reverse of what he made it by
the present method of ascertaining the trial number.      haveI
now suggested what I consider to be the best mode of deciding
the quality of a chronometer.    With respect to the proposal
of J. L. T., it appeared to me that it would not be so practi
cable, nor perhaps so good a test, as the one     I
                                                have made ; as,
on examining his system, an idea entered my mind, that             if,
instead of taking the mean rate of the whole time of the trial
asa   standard rate for deducting each day's difference, the
mean rate of the first month was taken as that given rate, the
result would not be      bad test.
                         a          But after trying the result
upon two chronometers that had equally varied from their
rates, and had also gone with the same regularity,           I found
that the result of the trial would be in favour of that chrono
meter which went nearest to the first month's rate during the
first part of the trial, though   it varied at the latter end :   but
 by taking the  mean    of  the whole  time  as the given   rate,  the
result was  in  favour   of  that which  varied from  its rate at  the
commencement of the trial, but which made no greater error
afterwards.     As consider those two chronometers equal in
                   I
                                                              quality,

quality, do not approve of the system ; and moreover, I think
              I
dial a chronometer which makes a great extreme variation in
any month's rate, would not be so much affected by it.         do                 I
not see the necessity of squaring the differences   as proposed
by  J. L. T., but I think it would be very laborious ; as for ex
act calculations the mean rate must be given to the hundredth
part of       a second.
   Having now suggested my system for deciding the quality
of a chronometer, I leave it to the investigation of those who
are willing and competent to decide upon its merits. Trusting
my observations may prove useful, I remain

On the Theory           of the Small Vibratory Motions of Elastic Fluids, by
     J.   CHALLIS,       M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, and of the Cam
  bridge Philosophical Society*.
         following is the introduction to Mr. Challis's memoir, from
THE   which the reader will obtain a correct view of the importance
of the investigation which it contains. — " Any one that has given
much attention to the mathematical theory of sound, will be aware
that notwithstanding the labours of the most eminent mathematicians,
great obscurity is still attached to it. Much of this obscurity, I have
been led to think, is owing to the manner in which discontinuous
unctions have been introduced into the subject ; and as geometers
of late have been more engaged in the use of them than in scruti
nizing the evidence on which they rest, I will endeavour to state, as
briefly as possible, the nature of this evidence. It depends, I believe,
almost entirely on the authority of Lagrange, and on his two dis
sertations contained in the first and second volumes of the Miscel-
laneaTaurinensia.     His first Researches, however admirable in other
respects, cannot be adduced in reference to the point before us, be
cause that part of them which bears upon            it,

proof which can by no means be admitted. In fact, mainly depends

if the exponential expressions be put for the cosines, and the series
be summed to infinity, this result      obtained. But the objection is,

mitted that two arcs, however great, which differ by a quantity 8,
have the same cosines independently of the value of 0. The Fallacy
of the reason assigned for neglecting 1, will be apparent, by putting
the sum of the series under this other form,

ciple the same as the first, and are not liable to    similar objection.

In these he has elaborately, yet strictly shown, as far as have been      I
able to follow the reasoning, that the motions he       in search of, are
                                                               is
not subject to any law of continuity — that the motions, for instance,
                                               ;
ata  given instant, in column of fluid stretching between two given
                         a'
points, cannot be given generally by any known line or function.
He supposes, therefore, that they will be given, by new set of           a
functions, neither algebraical, transcendental, nor mechanical, but
discontinuous per se, and by this property of discontinuity distin
guished from every other. This definition has been admitted by all
subsequent writers. But        deserves to be considered
                                  it                         what sense, in
and to what extent an investigation of this nature can demonstrate
any property of functions. The science of quantity           perfect sci
                                                                    is a
ence;  it  needs not the aid of any other, and exists prior to its ap
plications to questions of nature, and independently of them. When
in the applications, any form or property of functions         arrived at is
by  the  operations that arc  performed,     will always
                                                     it   be possible to
arrive at the same, by abstracting from the physical question, and
performing the same operations by pure analytical reasoning.          For
in the applications, we are, in general, concerned about time, space,
force, and matter, — ideas of totally dissimilar kind, but possessing
                                       a
this in common, that we can conceive of them as consisting of parts,
and in virtue of this common quality, after establishing         unit for      a
each, we are able to express their observed relations numerically,
or by lines or letters the representatives of numbers.        All subse
quent reasoning     then conducted according to the rules of analysis,
                    is
and cannot possess     greater generality in regard to the modes of
                         a
expressing quantity,   than  the operations conducted by those rules
admit of. If an attempt be made to prove the existence of discon
tinuous functions by pure analysis,      will be impossible to succeed,
                                               it
because, as Lagrange says, " the principles of the Differential and
Integral Calculus, depend on the consideration of variable alge
braical functions, and    does not appear, that we can give more ex
                             it
tent to the conclusions drawn from these principles, than the nature

of these functions allows of. But no person doubts that in alge
braic functions, all the different values are connected together by the
law of continuity." (Misc. Taur. torn. i. p 21.) Accordingly.no
discontinuous function can be exhibited to view.           The inference to
be drawn with certainty from Lagrange's reasoning is, that if a num
ber of particles, constituting a line of fluid, are in motion, the line
which bounds the ordinates erected at every point, proportional to
the velocities at a given instant, is not necessarily regular.         It may
 consist of portions of continuous     curve?,  connected    together  at their
 extremities, and be expressed analytically by a function, which pos
 sesses no distinctive property of discontinuity,         but changes form
 abruptly   and   in a manner   always given    by the  data  of the problem
 to be solved.      But if he had limited himself to this inference, and
 not supposed the existence of a new order of functions, he could
 not have determined the velocity of sound, and must have confessed
 that the analytical theory had not succeeded in solving that problem.
 For the demonstration he gives of       it, rests altogether on the exist
 ence of discontinuous functions, such as they are above defined: and
 herein     differs entirely from Newton's solution of the same problem,
             it
 which requires no new property of curves or functions, but deduces
 the velocity directly from the constitution of the medium — me       :   a
 thod, which certainly at first sight appears the more natural.             As,
 however, we are sure that the velocity of the propagation of sound,
 must be      deduction from the principles on which the analytical
              a                                                               in
 vestigation       founded,
                  is         if  no other mode of making the deduction
 can be thought of, we must be content to take up with discon
 tinuous functions. No person can object to them who does not sup
 ply an equivalent, provided always they be considered                the pre
                                                                     in
 sent state of analytic science, not as demonstrated to exist, but as
 hypothetical, and like all hypotheses, established only by the extent
 and success of their applications.        It was necessary to premise so
 much    as this about   discontinuous   functions,   in order to give    area
 son why any one, who treats of the vibrations of an elastic medium,
 has    right,
         a         he can, to leave these functions out of consideration
                  if                                                            ;
 and that the best possible argument for their non-existence              is,to
 show how to do without them.
    In the dissertation that follows, have reasoned as all functions
                                      I                      if
 were per se continuous'; and setting out with this principle, have
 discussed the integrals containing arbitrary functions, prior to any
 supposition about the mode in which the fluid was put in motion                ;
 considering that as the investigation which led to these integrals
 was conducted without reference to any such supposition, and as
 they are consequently applicable to every point in motion, all infer
 ences drawn from such discussion, must also apply to every point
in motion.       This method of treating the subject, dispenses with
 that of D'Alembert and Lagrange, who consider the differential
equation of the motion, to be equivalent to an infinite number
of equations of the same kind as itself, each of which applies to
a   single point.      The first inference drawn from this manner of
reasoning on the motions in space of one dimension             is, that every
                                                                          point

 point is moving in such a manner, as result* either from a motion of
 propagation in a single direction, or two simultaneous motions of
 propagation in opposite directions. The velocity of the propagation
is determined, and is, for air, the quantity commonly obtained by
 theory for the velocity of sound. Again, it is shown that the forms
 of the functions are not entirely arbitrary, but limited by the nature
 of the question to a certain species, the primary form of which cor
 responds to the curve that occurs in Newton's reasoning, and by
 writers on the theory of vibrating chords called the Taylorean Curve.
 As any number of these curves will simultaneously satisfy the par
tial differential equations, it is inferred that the vibrations they in
dicate, may co-exist.     If any portions of these curves, or of the
curves resulting from the combination of any number of them, be
joined together at their extremities, and so form an irregular line,
every two consecutive ordinates of which differ by an insensible
quantity, as this line will satisfy the same differential equations, it
indicates a possible motion, which is consequently of that bizarre
and irregular kind, which Lagrange first demonstrated to be the
general character of the vibrations. The particular form, however,
of this line is given, when the particular mode of the disturbance
which caused the motion is given. I have endeavoured to exhibit at
clearly as possible, the mechanical reasons of this kind of motion.
    In the next place, the bearing of the theory on the musical
sounds produced in tubes, is briefly considered, and particular at
 tention is paid to the mode in which the air vibrates in a tube open
at both ends, because on this point, the view I have taken, leads to
an inference which is at variance with the received theory.
    The equation which gives the motion in space of two dimensions
is integrated approximately, and the approximation is shown to be
such, that the integral will apply with accuracy to almost all cases
 that can occur.     Euler's integral of the equation that applies to
 the motion in space of three dimensions, which has ever since his
 time been considered to be particular, is here shown to be the
proper general solution, and adequate to solve all the cases of small
 motions.    This view of it is justified by its application to some
 problems of interest, particularly to oblique reflections, and the
 problem of resonances.       In conclusion, 1 have stated as a result
 of the whole preceding investigation, the manner in which analysis
 points out the laws of any phenomena, the theoretical inquiry into
 which conducts to the solution of a partial differential equation.

Matthias    Attwood,   Esq., M.P., of Gracechurch-street, London, and
Muswell-hill, Middlesex ; James Hall, Esq. of Southampton-street,

Essex-court, Temple, — were elected Fellows of this Society.
    M. J. J. D'Omalius D'Halloy, &c. &c. Governor of the Province of
 Namur, in the kingdom of the Netherlands, was elected a Foreign
 Member of this Society.
    A paper was read entitled " Observations on part of the low-
 countries and the north of France, principally near Maestricht
 and Aix-Ia-Chapelle;" by William Henry Fitton, M.D. F.G.S.&c.—
 The general structure of the country on the confines of the Nether
 lands and France has been described, several years ago, by M.
  D'Omalius D'Halloy ; and various memoirs, since published by
 other persons, confirm his statements. The basis of the whole
 tract consists of the coal-measures, with subjacent shale, grit,
  mountain-limestone,       reddish sandstone and conglomerate, and
 finally transition-slate.    Above this series of highly inclined beds,
  other strata, unconformable and nearly horizontal, repose ; which,
 in the Boullonois, include the upper part of the oolitic groups ;
 but, in advancing eastward, descend no lower than the green-sands.
  The country therefore is analogous to the vicinity of Bristol and
 Bath ; but the overlying formations there go down to the lower
 oolite, lias, and new red sandstone.
    The object of the author's inquiries was, to determine what beds
 are found, in the tract which he examined, above the coal ; and how
 far they agree with their equivalents in England. He describes in
 succession the several strata : the list including, 'in a descending
 order, — 1. Beds above the chalk; — to which are referred, — 2. The
 stone and calcareous sands of Maestricht. — 3. White chalk, passing
 into the Green-sand formation, — which comprehends. — 4. Fire
 stone, with — 5. Green and ferruginous sands. — 6. Obscure traces
 of clays beneath the sands. The whole being unconformable and
 superior to — 7. The coal measures, &c. &c. — The paper is accom
panied by lists of the fossils, examined and named by Mr. Sowerby ;
 and by a sketch of a general map, with sections on a large-scale.
    1. Beds above the chalk. — The Crag, of Suffolk, Kc. is stated, on
 the authority of Mr. Warburton, to have been observed on the
 French coast between Calais and Cape Blanc-Nez ; near Antwerp ;
 in the neighbourhood of Tongres; and at other places in the Nether
 lands.    The fossils also of Klein-Spawen between Tongres and
 Maestricht, include, along with several shells of thecalcaire-grossier,
some of those found in our crag.
    The sands which immediately precede the chalk, along the road
from London to Dover, precisely resemble those in the same situa
 tion, on the line from Calais through St Omer, Cassel, and Lille,
Ac.: the prominent hill of Cassel, however, is not topped with clay,
but seems to consist entirely of sand, including very numerous fossils,
contained principally in loose concretional beds of stone.         These
                                                                  fossils,

                           Geological Society.                          141
fossils, many of which are the same with those of similar sands near
Brussels, agree, in general, with those of the London-clay ; and
thence it would appear, that the separation of that stratum from the
sands immediately incumbent on the chalk is not well founded.
Beds of the sands here referred to occur, in the same geological
place, in Kent; near St. Omer; at Cassel; at Mount- Panisel, and
Ciply, south of Mons ; at Brussels; between Charleroi and Fleurus;
and at Kleyn-Spauwen, between Tongres and Maestricht. "
    2. Maeslricht stratum. — Between the deposition of the sands
last mentioned and of the chalk, a considerable interval must have
elapsed ; during which various beds may have been deposited,
of which no trace, or but obscure remains exist, at present, in En
gland. The well known stratum of St. Peter's-Mount near Alaes-
tricht is one of these: it is throughout superior to the white chalk,
into which it passes gradually below, but the top bears marks of
devastation, and there is no passage from it to the sands above. The
siliceous masses which it includes are much more rare than those of
the chalk, ofgreatei bulk, and not composed of black flint, but of a
stone approaching to chert, and, in some cases, to calcedony : — and
of about fifty species of its fossils in the author's collection, about
forty are not found in Mr. Mantell's catalogue of the chalk fossils
of Sussex*. The author therefore, with Mr. Honyf, and Mr.
 Conybearc' | , regards this bed as differing from, though intimately
connected with the chalk.
    A very fine section of the Maestricht bed is visible on the sides
 of the valleys of the Meuse and of the Jaar ; and in the heights op
posite to Vise the bed gradually rising from Maestricht disap
pears, and is succeeded by white chalk with flints.              The section
 of this stratum, and all the accompanying circumstances, at Ciply,
couth of Mons, accord remarkably with those of Maestricht ; and
from M. Desnoycr's statements, a bed of the same description seems
 to exist also in the Cotentin.
    3. Chalk. — The thickness of this stratum in the Netherlands is
 much less than on the coasts of the Channel ; especially of the part
 containing flints, which is succeeded, in descending, by chalk with
 out flints, passing into marl, and thence into fire-stone and green-
 sand.   The white chalk is well seen at Wonck and Heur le Romain
 opposite to Vise; and, on the north of Aix-la-Chapelle, a remarkable
 group, which the author refers to the lower part of the chalk, con
 sists of hard beds of grey and cream-coloured limestone, alternating
 with calcareous sand. This stratum, which abounds in fossils, many
 of them belonging to the lower chalk of England, has been found
 at a considerable depth at Cawcnberg on the north-west of Maes
 tricht ; it is prominent in the well known quarries of Cunroot, on
 the east of Fauquemont, and caps the heights on the north-west of
 Aix-la-Chapelle, from Sehneeberg to the west of Laurensberg; a
 small outlying portion remaining also on the top of the Louisberg,
 near Aix. A stratum like this is mentioned by Mr. Forschammer as

  occurring in a similar place below the chalk of Denmark, on the
  shores of the Baltic ; and seems also to exist in the Cotentin.
     4. Green-sandformation. — The marly chalk is succeeded by the
 equivalent of our upper green-sand, or fire-stone (the Planer-kalk of
 Germany,) in some places identical with that of Surrey, Kent, and
 Wilts; and like that stone is employed exclusively in constructing the
 interior of furnaces and buildings underwater: extensive quarries for
 these purposes being worked at Konigsberg opposite to Vaels, on the
 confines of the Prussian and Dutch territories. In this country how
 ever, there is not, beneath the fire-stone, (or at least does not distinct
 ly appear,) a stratum of clay, like ourGault; but the chalk, becom
 ing gradually charged with green particles, passes, in general with
 out an intermediate valley, into green and ferruginous sands, obvious
 ly analogous to the lower green (or Shanklin) sands of England.
     5. These sands are well exhibited in the hills on the south-west of
 Aix-la Chapelle, and, extending beyond the chalk, occupy a large
 portion of the surface above the coal and mountain-limestone
 country.    Distinct sections of the stratum are seen on the sides
 of Louisberg close to Aix, and along the road from that city to
 Liege, — the scenery ofwhich resembles that of theWoburn sand-hills;
 and on the descent of this road to the Calamine Works, near Moresnet,
 beds are found in the sand, analogous to the fuller's-earth of Woburn
 and of Nutfield, in Surrey. The fossils which abound in this forma
 tion include (along with many species common to them and the su
 perior beds, and hitherto not found in England) some species almost
 characteristic of our lower green-sand ; among which may be men
 tioned the Tiigonia aliformis, and Rostellaria Parkinson!.             The
 sands, at the Louisberg, include a thin bed of lignite; and near the
 bottom of the formation at Gemenich, and thence along the foot of
the hills to Eynatten, a remarkable stratum of grit from 6 to 10
feet in thickness, of great firmness and uniformity, occurs, — resem
bling in its characters the grey-wether stone of England, &c. and
possibly the equivalent of some of those beds of conglomerate which
 occur in our green-sand, (the Bargate stone of Surrey,
                                                              &c.) though
differing from them in external character. The ferruginous sands of
Grafenberg and other hills on the east of Dusseldorf, belong also to
this formation, containing the same fossils as at Aix-la-Chapelle,and
occupying a similar unconformable position above beds of lime
stone; a striking section ofwhich is visible on the banks of the
Dussel, at Ncanders-Hohle.        The sands extending from thence to
the north and eastward into Germany, are there well known under
the denomination of Quader-sandstein.
    6. In some places, the more ancient strata come in beneath the
green-sands withputany intervention ; in others, there are indica
tions of intermediate beds of clay, but too indistinct to admit of as
certaining their relations.
    7. The coal-formation and other subjacent beds are not consi
dered in the present paper ; the author referring for an account of
them to the works of local geology already published or in progress;
and to the paper on the Environs of Bristol, by Messrs. Buckland'
                                                                       and

the analogous portions of England, which may perhaps remove
some of the difficulties connected with the corresponding formations
in the low countries.
    The chief points of difference then, between the formations above
referred to and their equivalents in England, are —           The apparent
                                                                     1.
identity of the fossils in   the sands above the chalk, with those which
appear in the clay of London. — 2. The Maestricht stratum, dis
tinctly superior to the chalk, and differing from that bed in its
fossils and other characters,      is without any equivalent yet ascer
tained in this country   ;    but some facts are mentioned, which show;
that the former existence of such       a stratum above our chalk        not  is
improbable, and that further traces of      itmay still be discovered upon
sufficient search. — 3. The hard beds (of Cunroot,&c.) form remark        a
able feature of the lower chalk in the country above described. —
4. The absence or indistinctness of the Gault,         one of the principal
                                                          is
circumstances distinguishing the green-sand formation from ours                      ;
and the want of     a   valley, like that which commonly exists in this
country along the foot of our chalk-hills,        an important difference
                                                 is
of external feature. — 5. The entire absence of the formations which,
in the south-east of England, succeed the green-sand (theWeald clay,
Hastings-sands, and Purbeck strata), deserves also to be mentioned                  ;
for, of these beds, though so fully developed on our coast, none have
yet been distinctly recognised upon the continent, and traces only
detected  in   the interior of England and in the lower Boulonnois.
    In conclusion, the author remarks upon the great diversity of the
upper and unconformable formations which,              different places, are
                                                          in
in immediate contact with the older and inclined strata beneath. In
some cases (as near Bristol) the red marl, lias, and lower oolite —in         ;
 others (lower Boullonois) the upper oolite      ; others still, the green-
                                                     in
 sands, the gault, and even the chalk itself, — are        contact with the
                                                                in
 coal strata.  It may be difficult to explain the cause of this variation,
 and to account for the absence of the beds which are wanting             for ;
 the upper formations bear no obvious marks of disturbance, and
 are generally horizontal or very little inclined.
    Jan.I,   1830.— The Rev.  J.    Henry Coddington, of Trinity College,
 Cambridge, was elected a Fellow.
     A paper was read, " On the Geology of the shores of the Gulf of
 La Spezia; by Henry Thomas De la Beche, Esq.F.G.S. F.R.S. &c."
    The chief objects of this memoir are to show,
     1st. That the marbles of Porto Venere, although possessing some
 of the characters of transition rocks, may be the equivalents of part
 of the oolitic series.
    2nd. That the diallage rock and serpentine of Southern Liguria have
 been protruded through the formerata period later than their formation.
     Previous to his description of the geological structure of the                 di
 strict, the author gives short sketch of its physical outline and super
                         a
 ficial covering. The Alpi Appuani, or mountains of Massa and Car
 rara, form  a  distinct group, being separated from the main range
 of the Apennines, by considerable depression, and from the hills of

  La Spezia by a plain through which the Magra flows. The plain is
  covered by gravel rising to some height above the Mediterranean. Of
  this gravel the banks of the Frigido afford a good section. NearPonzo,
 between La Spezia and Borghetto, a torrent cuts through a hill com
  posed of large rounded boulders and gravel, the coherence of which is
  trifling.    These boulders could not have been produced by any causes
  at present existing in the district.   The boulders are carried down the
  bed of the torrent but a short distance beyond the places where they
 occur as component parts of the hills.       In the bed of the Vara, into
  which this torrent flows, there is gravel of the usual size, which may
  have been formed, and afterwards cut through, by the river.

 rate, are described us being seen in vertical strata at Caniparola,
  near Sarzana, the shaly beds containing the Fucoides "mint-;uns (Ad.
  Brongn.) and the conglomerate being made up of compact limestone,
  macigno sandstone, and jasper, cemented by clay. These tertiary
  beds are supposed to have been thrown into their present vertical
  position by the forces which elevated the adjoining Alpi Appuani.
      1.6. Breccia, with a porous limestone cement, is one of the
 youngest rocks in the gulf of La Spezia, where it occurs in promon
  tories, and caps some of the cliffs : — from its resemblance to the
 rauchwacke of the zechstein, it has been erroneously referred to that
 formation.
      1 . c. Siliceous sandstone is connected with the breccia abo»e-men-
  tioned, with which it is associated in contorted beds at St. Terenzo;
 The author does not pronounce positively upon the relative ages of
 the rocks of this group, although he asserts that they are all younger
 than the macigno.
      2. Macigno. —Two sandstones of somewhat the same mineralogi-
 cal structure, but of very different age, are comprehended under this
 name by the Italians ; but the author here restricts the term lo that
 which is highest in the order. The macigno is a brown and gray sand
 stone, both calcareous and siliceous, generally micaceous, with black
 specks, and is occasionally mixed with shale.          It occurs near the
 Bagni di Lucca overlying gray compact limestone, which ranges from
 thence into the district under consideration, and has similar relations
 near Massa and Carrara, details and diagrams of which are given j it
 is also much developed north of La Spezio, and on the right bank of
 the Magra.        In the absence of organic remains, the author has not
 been enabled to decide upon the equivalent of this rock.
     Z. Gray compact limestone or Porto Pencre marble. — At La Spezia
this group consists of, 1. Dark gray, black and yellow limestones, in-
terstratified with schists and argillaceous slates ; 2. Dolomite ; 3. Dark
gray compact limestone in thin beds;           4. Ditto with brown shale,
and containing Orthoceras, Ammonites, Belemnites, and round balls of
iron pyrites ; 5 and 6. Shale, with compact thin-bedded limestone,
resembling that of the Jura. The islands of Tino and Palmaria are
composed of this system,        whence it rises into the high land of La
Castellana, and extends to Pignone, forming the mountains of Co-
regna, Santa Croce, Parodi, and Bergamo. The dolomite occupying
                                                                       the

the centre of this range presents the appearance either of an included
bed, or of a great dyke which throws oil' the strata on either side. The
fossils of Coregna collected by the author (first noticed by Guidoni)
are,
    Orthoceras : — A species resembling O. elongatum of the lias, and
also   O. Steinhaeri of the coal measures.
    Belemnites (many alveoli of).
    Ammonites : — 15 species, one of which is the A. erugatus of the
Yorkshire lias (Phillips's Geol. of Yorkshire); and another resembles
A. Bucklandi ; whilst two are fossils of the coal-measures, viz. A. Lis-
teri and A. biformis.    The remainder are undescribed, but have been
drawn by Mr. J. Sowerby to illustrate this memoir. From the nature
of these organic remains, and principally from the presence of be-
lemnites, the author, whilst admitting the conflicting nature of the
evidence, similar to that observed in parts of the Alps described by
M. Elie de Beaumont, inclines to the belief that this range of lime
stone, &c. is equivalent to the lias or some member of the oolitic series.
    4. Brown shale and variegated beds are seen beneath the gray
limestone; and again, below the variegated strata, there is a consider
able developement of brown sandstone and gray schist, which consti
tutes a high range extending from La Castellana to beyond Vernazza,
wherein a large Fucus is found. This gray schist at Monte Rosso seems
to have been penetrated by diallage and serpentine rocks.
    Saccharine limestone, SfC. of Capo Corvo. —The coast section of
Capo Corvo exhibits thick and thin beds of gray limestone alternat
ing with schists ; a thick-bedded fine conglomerate which passes into
chlorite and micaceous schists ; and saccharine limestone of various
colours with mica schist ; the whole in highly inclined and contorted
positions.    Similar rocks occur between the mouth of the Magra and
Amegliu, where they are covered by the gray limestone, and contain
a subordinate conglomerate very much resembling that of the Valor-
sine. The author is disposed to refer this group to the same age as the
older conglomerates which occur between the high Alps and their cal
careous zones on the side of Italy.
    Carrara Marbles. — These seem to form part of the system of gneiss
and mica schist of the adjoining Alpi Appuani, being distinctly stra
tified and underlying the gray limestone, resembling that of Porto
Venere.
    Gneiss and mica schist are well exposed in the valley of the Fn-
gido near Massa.

passing into each other are protruded from beneath highly inclined
beds of sandstone, in which are also many faults.      These serpentine
rocks    seem   to be  prolongations  of the great developement   of the
same system in Southern Liguria ; and, to 'illustrate more fully their
nature, the author gives a section of their relations in a contiguous
district at Monte Ferrato, where, as has already been noticed by M.
Brongniart, gray compact limestone and slaty shale and jasper are
covered by serpentine anddiallage rocks, which, in one place, seem to
traverse and cut through the strata.
     In conclusion, the author observes, that if the Porto Venere mar
 bles be considered equivalent to any part of the oolite formation, they
 afford a striking example of the little value of mineralogical structure
 as a character taken by itself, and show the extreme caution that
 should be used in assigning names to rocks from hand specimens,
 brought home by distant expeditions, without the accompaniment of
 organic remains. He considers that the diallage rock and serpentine of
 Southern Liguria, have been intruded among these rocks subsequent
 to the epoch of the oolite formation ; and regards the diallage rock
 and serpentine as of igneous origin, concurring in opinion with those
 geologists who attribute to these rocks in common with granite and
 trap, and the forces that ejected them, the contortion and fracture
  of the stratified rocks, and their consequent elevation into ridges and
  mountains.

      Jan. 19th— An Account was read of the Mode of Growth of
  Corals of the genus Fungia.        By Mr. Samuel Stutchbury, A.L.S.
      The writer observed, when collecting specimens near Tahiti, that
  though the larger ones were unattached, in the young state they
  are fixed to rocks or dead fragments of coral, growing on a foot
  stalk, and remaining attached till about an inch in diameter, when
   the}' separate.
       A communication was also read : On a new species of Wild Swan,
  taken in England, and hitherto confounded with the Hooper. By
   William Yarrell, Esq. F.L S. &c.
       To this new species, which Mr. Yarrell names Cygnus Bewickii,
   after the celebrated artist who so greatly promoted the study
   of natural history by his works, he give* the following cha
   racter : " C. rostro semicylindrico atro, cera flava, corpore albo,
   cauda rectricibus 18, pedibus nigris." Mr. Yarrell's previous suspi
   cions that a species distinct from the Hooper existed, occasioned
   by an inspection of several preparations, were confirmed by an ex
   amination of three specimens of different ages which he obtained in
   the markets of the metropolis, where they were brought during the
   late severe weather.      The new species is one-third smaller than
   the Hooper at the same age. It differs much more in anatomical
   structure than in external character, and principally in the trachea,
    a minute description of which in all the specimens is given.

                 Sixteenth  Annual Report qftJte Council.
    In presenting the Sixteenth Annual Report, the Council cannot
but congratulate the Society on its increasing interest and improve
ment: they have great satisfaction in stating, that since the last
anniversary meeting, a considerable addition has been made to the
Museum, by the erection of a new Cabinet, and that the metallic
and earthy minerals are now completely arranged.
    The Cabinet, which was removed from the Museum, has been
placed in the apartment lately occupied by the Penzance Library,
and a portion of it already appropriated to Cornish geology, con
sisting of rock specimens illustrative of the geology of several dis
tricts of the county.
   The Council have much pleasure in informing the Society, that
several sections of the map of Cornwall, presented last year by
George S. Borlase, esq. have been transmitted to the following gen
tlemen, who have kindly undertaken to lay down the geology, &c.
of the different districts to which they refer : W. M. Tweedy, Esq. ;
Mr. Kenwood ; Mr. Petherick, Lanescot Mine ; G. B. Kingdon,
Esq. of Stratton ; and Mr. Mitchell, of Breage. Any other gentle
men who are inclined to assist in this most interesting labour, may
be supplied with sections of other districts of the county by apply
ing to the secretary, who will also furnish them with the instructions
sent with the sections already circulated, that a uniform plan may be
observed.
   Some further communications on the Stream Works of Cornwall
have been received this year; but as it is highly desirable that all
possible information should be obtained on a subject of such impor
tance, both in a philosophical and geological point of view, the
Council again take the liberty of impressing it strongly on the at
tention of those members who reside in the neighbourhood of these
deposits.
   The donations of minerals this year hare not been so numerous
as on many former occasions ; but those which have been received
are interesting, and a considerable acquisition to the Cabinet ; par
ticularly a series of specimens from the silver lode in Dolcoath mine,
presented by Captain Petherick ; a specimen of gold imbedded in
micaceous iron stone, from Cocaes mine, Brazil, by G. C. Fox, Esq. ;
and several specimens of Elba iron, by Mr. Thomas Morgan.            In
addition to the above minerals, a very interesting series of organic
remains, both animal and vegetable, with Wood-tin, &c. from
Happy Union Stream Work, at Pentuan, near St. Austle, has. been
presented by Mr. John W. Colenso; in illustration of a paper which
will be read before the Society at this meeting.
   The Council have to lament the absence of one of the greatest or
naments and most efficient members of the Society, who is prevented
from attending the meeting by extreme illness; but they sincerely
hope that he will ere long be again enabled to fill the high situation
he has held in the Society from its establishment. Every person pre
sent must anticipate the individual alluded to, and regret his ab

     The Council cannot close their Report, without calling the atten
 tion of the meeting to the severe loss which they and the whole sci
 entific world have sustained during the last year, by the deaths of
 two of the most eminent honorary members of the Society, Dr. Wol-

           XXII.     Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
         M. ALDlNl's INCOMBUSTIBLE DRESS FOR FIREMEN.
          the request of M. Aldini, a commission was named by tlie
AT     Academy of Sciences, at Paris, composed of MM. Fourier, Du-
long, Chevreul, Flourens, and Gay Lussac, to examine the dress
constructed by him for the protection of firemen from the action of
the flames, and to report upon it.         M. Aldini, in consequence, ex
plained to these gentlemen the principle of his invention, and in
vited them to witness some experiments at the station of the fire
                                                                      men

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.          149
men in the Rue de la Paix, in the presence of the civil authorities
and several other individuals. — The following account is principally
taken from the Report upon those experiments, made by M, Gay
Lussac to the Academy.
    ThedressofM. Aldini consists of two garments; — one, a thick tissue
of amianthus, or of wool rendered incombustible by being steeped
in a saline solution : the other, an iron wire-gauze dress covering the
former. The idea of the latter, he says (in a pamphlet lately publish
ed), was suggested to him by the chain-armour of the ancients, which
he found to be impervious to flame; upon the principle first discover
ed by Sir H. Davy, and employed by him in the construction of his
safety-lamp. This wire-gauze dress, however, would not alone be suf
ficient to protect the body from the action of heat, though it might
ward off the flames : but the dress of amianthus, or wool, by its thick
ness and non-conducting power accomplishes this, and forms with the
wire-gauze an efficient defence, for the time at least that the exertions
of the firemen require.
     The head-piece consists of a stout cap of amianthus-cloth, fitting
close to the SKull, and covering the throat, having holes made in it
for the nose and mouth: spectacles are also provided for the eyes,
 lined with fine brass wire-gauze.
     The metallic dress consists of five different pieces: — the helmet,
 between which and the amianthus cap there is a considerable space,
 and which is moreover furnished with a mask in front, to afford ad
ditional security to the face; a cuirass ; arm- and thigh-pieces, the
 latter joining the cuirass over the hips ; a pair of boots ; and a shield
 of an oval form, five feet and a half long, and two and a half wide. This
shield is useful in stopping or turning any strong jet of flame, and
 thus enabling the fireman to see his way; and it is proposed to con
  struct frames on a similar principle, to intercept the flames issuing
   hrough a door or other aperture.
     The whole of this dress is composed of iron wire-gauze, the meshes
 of which are about one twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter : the
 weight of it altogether is about 151bs. The fireman has likewise a
 basket, covered with wire-gauze, strapped to his back, for the pur
 pose of transporting a child through the flames j ropes and double
 gloves also of amianthus have been made, with the latter of which
 red-hot bars of iron may with safety be carried in the hand.
     We shall proceed briefly to describe the experiments, which ap
  pear at least satisfactorily to establish the efficacy of the principle
  of M. Aldini's invention.
     A fireman, with the double protection of the incombustible cloth
  and wire-gauze, subjected his face to the flame of a straw-fire held
  in a chafing-dish, for the space of 1 minute and 30 seconds. Another,
  armed as the former, with the addition of a sheet of amianthus in
  front, supported the heat during 2 minutes and 37 seconds without
  any symptoms of suffering.       The pulse of the first rose during the
  experiment,   in  the space  of  a minute, from 80° to 120°, and that
  of the second from 72° to 100°.
      The next experiment was still more satisfactory. Two parallel
  hedges, about 3 feet distant from each other, were formed of straw
                                                                       and
                                                                       <L

and brushwood, piled upon bars of iron.       When these were set on
fire, the flames from the two rose in a body to the height of at least
9 feet, and filled the entire space between; while the heat was too
great to approach nearer than 8 or 10 paces.        At this instant, six
firemen, accoutred with the dress of M. Aldini, and following each
other at a slow pace, traversed the flames between the hedges many
times in succession. One of them carried an osier basket covered
with wire-gauze, containing a child eight years old, protected only
with a mask of incombustible cloth.        This experiment, which the
bystanders    witnessed  with apprehension, had a most satisfactory re
sult; and had the smoke been more dense, it would have been en
tirely decisive. The firemen were unhurt : the one with the child
retreated from the fire in the space of a minute, on account of the
cries of the child, who was frightened at a sudden movement of the
man in shifting it on his shoulder.     The child was also uninjured,
and when taken from the basket its pulse had risen only from 84° to
98°. The other firemen sustained the experiment 2 minutes and
2'2 seconds ; and on coming out, were in a profuse perspiration.
        The pulse of the fireman who carried >
            the child rose                     J
                                                 from   ^         0
        That of the second                            88° to 152°
        That of the third                             84° to 138°
        That of the fourth                            78° to 12*°
    The main question was, the possibility of supporting respiration
 in the midst of the flames : and if by this we suppose the men to be
 completely enveloped in them for 2 or 3 minutes, their situation cer
 tainly appears most perilous.     M. Gay Lussac observes, that when a
 furnace is heated so as to flame and smoke, the air within is entirely
 deprived of oxygen ; and therefore it is certain, that if the imme
diate action of the flames were guarded off by the wire-gauze, still
it would be impossible to sustain respiration in the midst of them.
 We must therefore conclude that if the firemen did not experience
the difficulty of breathing which we should naturally expect, they
must have been supplied in some way with pure air. There are
several ways of accounting for this; and one, which M. Gay Lussac
suggests, appears the most probable: viz. that the men were supplied
by a current of fresh air from the space between the two garments.
Besides this, we cannot suppose that their heads were constantly en
veloped in the flames, and they would of course find favourable
moments for breathing; but the power of suspending the breath is
also an excellent resource, which every fireman ought by practice to
acquire. The fireman has another difficulty to contend with, in the
dense volumes of smoke, which prevent his breathing, blind his sight,
and consequently retard his exertions. To obviate this, it has been
proposed to furnish a supply of air from a portable reservoir ; or by
means of a flexible tube, rising from the feet to the mouth, through
which the fresh airwould naturally rise,as the heated air escaped above.
    There is little doubt that amianthus may easily be manufactured :
M. Aldini has succeeded in weaving a stout cloth of           it,
                                                              9      feet
5  inches long, and 5   feet
                           3   inches wide, being nearly equal to the
celebrated one preserved in the Vatican.      But the cost of this ma

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              151
teriaj cannot admit of very general use, and on this account M. AI-
dini is endeavouring to substitute for it a manufacture of wool.
    Wool is naturally but little inflammable, and when steeped in a so
lution of sal-ammoniac and borax, or alum, burns to a cinder with
out inflaming ; it is also slowly penetrated by heat. It appears from
an experiment of M. Flourens even to have an advantage over
amianthus. That gentleman presented a finger covered with amian
thus-cloth to the flame of a wax candle, and afterwards repeated
the experiment, substituting a covering of the prepared wool of the
same thickness.       In the first case he experienced the effect of the
heat sooner than in the latter.        In point of ceconomy, facility of
preparation, and convenience, from its greater lightness and weaker
conducting power, the preparation of wool has the preference over
amianthus : and though its resistance to fire is less than the latter, it
is still sufficient in all ordinary cases, and may form a very sufficient
substitute.
     The experiments which we have related above, have been made
 under the superintendence of M. Aldini at Milan, Turin, Geneva,
and Paris.       M. Aldini has not only the merit of ingenuity in this
 invention, but of indefatigable zeal in pursuing it. He has dis
 played the greatest industry in perfecting and bringing it to the test
 of experiment ; and he has the satisfaction in return of receiving
 the unanimous approbation of those most competent to judge of
 the merits of his invention. M. Gay Lussac has subsequently moved
 that the Academy, when it proceeds to the distribution of the Mon-
 tyon Prizes, should offer a reward to M. Aldini, worthy of his ho
 nourable exertions for the preservation and protection of human life.
     M. Aldini having lately arrived in England, has published a short
 account of his experiments, and announces a more extensive work
 with plates entitled, " The art of preserving firemen and workmen
 from the action of flame, and of saving human life in cases of fire :
 with a series of experiments performed in Italy, Geneva, and in Paris."
     METHOD OF OBTAINING SKELETONS OF SMALL FISHES.
     Some time since      I was employed in making observations on the
 produce of some of the ponds in the neighbourhood of London ; and
 I discovered that the Tadpole was a very serviceable animal in ana
  tomizing the very small fishes, as well as some of the larger sorts,
 generally found in such places; the Tadpole acting in the same manner
 as the Ant.    I have tried the experiment several times, and on various
 sorts of fishes, and was always successful, particularly with that very
 little one called by children Stickleback : even in these the skele
 ton was at all times perfect. My method is this : I suspend the fish
 by threads attached to the head and tail, in a horizontal position, in
  a jar of water such as is found in the pond, and change it often till
  the tadpoles have finished their work, which if two or three tadpoles
  are allowed to work on so small a fish as the species just mentioned,
  they will complete in t wun ty-four hours. I always select the smallest
  sort of tadpoles, as they can insinuate themselves between the
 smallest bones, without destroying their articulation. — T. BLUETT.

In the case of Mr. Woolf's invention of working steam engines by
high pressure steam acting expansively, (either in one or in two

unequally upon different patentees? — Excessively so, almost in the
inverse ratio of the merit and importance of the invention. An im
portant invention        only a source of expense and labour to the
                         is
inventor during several years, until              brought to bear very com

pletely and frequently the greater part of the term expires before

it  isbrought to bear at all.         often happens that the profit arising

establishment.
    Can you give any instance of this oppressive operation of the
law — Many

                     :                   striking instance
                                            is   a               he carried on   ;
business to     loss for at least ten years of his patent, and though he
                 a
made profit in the last four years,          did not pay the loss during the
                                                      it
first period.    The extension since given to that invention             so im         is
portant, that the existence of deep mining in Cornwall at this mo
ment depends upon it. The difference in cost between the quantity
of coals consumed by the engines now in use (which are all on Mr.
Woolf's system), and by an equal force of engines, such as were in
use before he went into Cornwall             1813, would absorb the profit
                                                      in
of all the deep mining that now carried on in Cornwall.

ever been rewarded by Parliament.           The establishment, and con
sequent profitable exercise of many inventions when made complete,
is often retarded and prevented by public prejudice, and ignorance
of their true value ; also by the opposition of workpeople, and the
fear that they may mutiny, in establishments where new inventions
are first practised.     I could give many instances of such cases:
Mr. Eaton's, who invented the self-acting mule to put up by power,
ia a strong one;     the few machines that he made, when I prepared
his specification ten years ago, have continued in profitable use ever
lince, but no more can be got introduced.           Also Mr. Morton, for
whom I made a specification in 1818, for anew slip to draw up ships,
in order to repair, instead of a dry dock.
    Will you state to the Committee what is the mode of proceeding
by a patentee when his patent is infringed ? — He must wait till he
gets unquestionable evidence of the fact of infringement, which is
often a very great difficulty.    It facilitates the obtaining evidence to
apply to the Court of Chancery ; but if he has got good evidence,
he had much better come to a court of common law at once.
    What is the course of defence usually made by the infringer of a
patent? — The usual course (if unquestionable evidence is given of
the infringement) is to contend that the patent is bad in law. Such
defences almost always prevail ; it is so exceedingly difficult to main
tain a patent, the grounds upon which a patent may be vitiated being
BO numerous.       Several different defendants may act in concert, by
infringing   the  patent in every quarter, and making a common purse
to carry on the war; that is the best course for them, because if the
patentee succeeds in one action, he must then try another and an
 other, till his money is all gone, and he can scarcely ever keep his
 patent right alive to overcome them all. The few patents that have
 been supported, have been commonly sustained by collusion with
the infringers themselves ; after one trial has decided that the patent
 is not absolutely bad, they combine with the patentee to allow them
free use of the patent on moderate terms, and then, by making a
 common purse, they prosecute and suppress all new infringements :
 to effect that, they must keep up the appearance of law proceedings,
 but defend themselves so as to let the patentee get a verdict, which
 is only sham ; but, added to the common purse, it serves to terrify
 new infringers, who are not allowed to have licenses or practice at
 all, whereby the patent right becomes a close monopoly, instead of
 a general practice paying a small rent to the patentee.         If patent
 rights were made more secure in law, and by less expensive pro
 ceedings, it would not suit the interests of patentees to enter into
 such combinations, but, on the contrary, to promote the most
 extensive and open use of their inventions, under licenses, at a
 moderate tax.
     Supposing an incorrect specification has been made, what remedy
 have toe public besides that of using the invention ; have they any
 means of setting the patent aside? — A scire facias may be brought
 in the King's name against a patentee, calling on him to show why
 his patent should not be repealed.

 154             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
      Is it not the law with regard to patents, that you cannot take
  advantage of the invention of a principle, without describing how
  that principle is to be exercised ? — It is. The patent contains a pro
 vision, that no other person shall counterfeit, imitate or resemble
  the invention ; that is construed in the courts to mean, that they
  shall not take the same principle, and use other means of carrying
  it into effect. But if the new means used by infringers arc so supe
  rior as to supersede the original altogether, then they are com
  monly allowed to be used, on the ground that they must necessarily
 be new inventions, and not the patent one, which from its non-suc
  cess must be defective.
      So that if in a specification you describe one mode of carrying
  the principle into practice, that patent would not cover other modes,
  by which the same principle might be carried into effect ? — It would,
 if those other modes do not produce any superior effect to the origi
  nal mode; but if they are so very superior, as to supersede the ori-
 ginal, they could not be stopped by the patent. That is the man
 ner in which I have found the courts to proceed ; but it may be
 easily imagined, in such matters the courts will be continually de
 ceived in the facts ; and as there is no declaratory law, all inference*
 from precedents of this nature are very deceptive, because we can
 not know upon what facts (real or assumed) the courts founded their
 decisions.
     Does not this prohibition to take out a patent for a principle, lead
 to a great multiplication of counts in the specification of a patent?—
 It does ; and it is a great trouble and difficulty in preparing a speci
 fication, because it is necessary to foresee all the varieties of modes
 of execution that may be given to the invention or principle, which
 is the essence of the patent right.     It is necessary, for the security
 of the inventor, to describe them all, to preclude other people using
 them, and that the inventor may have his choice of that way which
 future experience will decide to be the best.
     Would not the allowing the patent to cover the principle, pro
 vided there were one good method described of carrying the prin
 ciple into effect, lead to a more precise and clear specification ? —
 Decidedly it would ; but if the patent were given for the principle
 exclusively, it would be pernicious to the public, that other inventors
 should not be permitted to work upon that principle by other
methods of execution, so as to produce a belter result.
     You think that for a limited period, between the taking out the
 patent and theinrolling the specification, the right ought to cover
the principle of the invention? — Unquestionably, during that period
the inventor should have an entire right to all those principles of
which the heads are detailed in the first paper that is lodged, and
all possible applications of them, in order that he may have his
choice, which application he will pursue in practice. Having speci
fied, his right should be contracted to what he has so specified, but
leaving him full liberty to add supplements, and thereby keep his
right always enlarged up to the fullest extent that he can maintain,
by continuing his labours.
    Supposing a man falls upon the discovery of an entirely new prin
                                                                    ciple

  ciple of science, such as the condensation of steam, and its appli
  cation to mechanism, how would you propose to secure the advan
  tage to the discoverer of that principle,     without precluding the
 attempt at improvement by other persons? — I do not conceive that
 patents are or ought to be a recompense to the inventor for the merit
 he has displayed, in what he has done previous to the grant being
 made; it is a sort of bargain, or a lease granted of some small por
  tion of the public employment that has not hitherto been cultivated ;
  that if the lessee will go to work to bring the new invention to bear,
 he shall have the benefit of working it for some certain time, which
 it is supposed will leave him a fair term, after it is brought into pro
 fitable exercise; but if the time, when properly employed, does not
 allow that fair term of profitable exercise, then some extension or
  recompense should be allowed, to cover the deficiency.
     Supposing a person had discovered the principle of the conden
 sation of steam, as applicable to first movers, and had merely given,
 as the mode of carrying that into effect, the form of the atmospheric
 engine ; do you think that his patent ought to have precluded Mr.
 Watt, during the continuance of fourteen years, from applying for
 a patent for his steam-engine ? — Certainly not ; but at the same time
 it is very unjust to an inventor, that because he is superseded by
 some successor, he should lose all benefit from his patent ; they
 ought to be allowed to go on together, and the profit ought to be
 fairly divided between them according to their previous labours,
 and expenses not yet recompensed, and the share each one has had
 in obtaining the improved result ; neither ought to be stopped, the
 public ought to be served in all cases, and a recompense ought to
 be found for all those that have served the public.      Such cases are
 not likely to occur very frequently in great inventions, unless very
 long patent rights were established ; a term even of twenty years is
 barely sufficient to establish one such invention, much more to see it
 superseded by another.
     Supposing a person has discovered a principle, without inventing
 any method of carrying it into effect, and subsequently some method
 of using that principle is invented by another person ; do you con
 ceive that the person who has invented the method, should make
 some compensation to the person who has discovered the principle ?
— I think that he who has invented the method should be made to
divide the advantage with him who had before discovered the prin
ciple, because both parties have contributed to the public benefit;
they are in the relative situation of a land-owner, and the farmer
who cultivates his estate, — both should participate.
     How could you arrange the compensation ? — It could only be
arranged by arbitration.
     Do you know any instance of a secret patent being granted? —
Some specifications have been kept secret by specific Acts of Par
liament.     In the interval between granting the patent and inrolling
the specification, application is made to Parliament to suspend the
operation of that clause in the patent, whereby the specification is
to be inrolled; and to enact that the specification shall not be made
public, commissioners are appointed by the Act to take charge of

their means, to steal secret inventions, of which they possessed an
 exclusive knowledge         the best remedy was to take out
                                    :                                  patent ina
 France, and       was sent there to solicit the patent, and thus prevent
                     I
 their exercising the invention there, after they had stolen it. That
 French patent has one of the most complete specifications                   ever       I
made       ;   in the French language, and is now deposited in Paris
               it   is                                                                            ;
 but no specification of the same invention exists in England, or in
 English. After that French patent was so obtained,                  very consi

it is, that so long as patents are granted merely upon the request of
the inventors, and whilst they are left at liberty to specify what they
please,      there were not some limiting penalty of that sort, they
               if
would put inventions ad infinitum into their specifications, for the
chance, that        one hook did not catch, another might.

that part which       not original? — Decidedly, that

ing them to their own discretion, under the penalty of setting aside
their whole patent, because they have exceeded just bounds (which
bounds are not defined) is both unjust and impolitic.
     Since a patent for the three kingdoms, with the attorney's bill,
costs from four to five hundred pounds, does not that operate as a
tax upon different inventions with great inequality ? — The expense
of the patents for the three kingdoms is decidedly too high ; I think
that the present expense of a patent for England, would be about
 the proper expense for a patent for the whole of the British domi
nions.     I mean, that in the absence of any other check to an unli
 mited multiplication     of patents, they should not be granted too
cheaply.      At present, while patents are to be had merely for paying
 the fees, there must be some limitation applied by means of the ex
 pense, and I think the present expense for England is a limitation
 which is sufficient ; but when to the expense of a patent for En
 gland, the expense of one for Scotland, and another for Ireland, is
 added, and also an additional variable expense depending upon the
 difficulty of the subject, the sum total is in my opinion too much
 for mere limitation, and becomes a tax upon particular inventors,
 who are commonly the most deserving of encouragement.           The ex
 penses relating to the specification vary according to the nature of
 the subject.    I think the sum total to the patentee should be made
 invariable, or nearly go.

                             AURORA        BOREAL1S.
    At six o'clock P.M. Dec. 14th, a bright light appeared abrut
the magnetic north, and gradually formed into a small segment of
a circle, from the base of which in the horizon fourteen perpendi
cular columns of light emanated to altitudes of from ten to twenty
degrees; their breadths varied from half to one and a half degree,
and they showed a faint red colour.               At a quarter past six a well-
defined flame-coloured arc arose from the aurora, and was three
degrees in width ; its vertex, when at its greatest height, was about
sixteen degrees in altitude, and its extremities terminated in the
N. by E. and N.W. by W. points of the horizon ; but it suddenly
disappeared, or was apparently extinguished by a dense passing
mist. When the mist had cleared away, a distant mild light, which
often varied in height, remained about the magnetic north till nine
o'clock, or twenty minutes after the moon rose. A very heavy dew
fell during this meteoric appearance, and several small meteors oc
casionally appeared over the aurora.

    General Obtervatiolu.—'The first part of this month was dry, and alter
 nately mild and frosty : the latter part was unprecedentedly cold for Decem
 ber, with a prevailing N.E. wind, which brought on a high pressure the
 last six days.
    The 5th instant was foggy, with the exception of three hours in the nf-
 ternoon, and was the mildest day in the month. The morning of the 15th
 was also foggy, and the maximum temperature for the twenty-four hours
 occurred iu the night.      On the 20th a sufficient quantity of snow fell to
 cover Portsdown Hill.     It again snowed on the 22nd, and on the 24th and
 25th nearly three inches in depth fell here, the greater part of which dis
appeared by evaporation, the other part remained on the ground till the 3rd
of January, in places shaded from the sun's rays.      On the 26th the moats,
marshes and ponds in this neighbourhood were firmly frozen, and thronged
with skaiters and sliders.     Early in the morning of the 28th the thermo
meter receded to 18 degrees, and one that had been exposed on a bed of
snow the preceding night, stood at the same time at 14 degrees.        A large
steel magnet (which had also been exposed to the frost) held in the hand
a quarter of n minute, to bring down the metallic float of a thermometer
at the time of this low temperature, so benumbed the fingers, as to render
the touch insensible for several minutes.     On the 29th the maximum tem
perature did not exceed 29 degrees.
   The mean temperature of the external air this month is 12'27 degrees
colder than the mean of December 1828 ! it is also upwards of six degrees
colder than the mean of December for the last fourteen years, and the
coldest December by one degree and a quarter we have ever registered.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are, one lunar halo, four meteors, an aurora bo-
realis, and five gales of wind, or days on which they have prevailed ; namely,
four from the North-east, and one from the East.

XXIII.     Notes on the Formation of extensive Conglomerate and
   Gravel Deposits, By HENRY T. DE LA BECHE, F.R.S. Sfc.*
                              [With a Plate.]
  A T   the present time, when actual causes are by some geo-
•**-
      legists considered adequate to the production of nearly all
the phaenomena which we observe in the structure of the earth's
crust, it becomes important to ascertain, as far as our know
ledge will permit, the value of such causes, and thence judging
how far the whole, or any part of them, may have been capa
ble of forming the rocky masses of which the surface of our
planet is composed.
   It has been imagined that extensive conglomerate and gravel
deposits are owing to causes similar to those now existing; in
some cases to the joint action of rivers on their beds and seas
on their shores, and in others solely to the action of the former.
 To ascertain if such causes could have produced such effects,
we should examine the present action of seas on their coasts
and rivers on their beds, so far as regards the production of
rounded gravels.
              I.   Action  of Tidal Seas on their Coasts.
   It has long been known, and often remarked, that seas gain
on some coasts and lose on others ; in other words, that seas
cut away and destroy rocks, even the hardest, in some places,
and pile up the detritus, acquired either from this destruction,
or from rivers, in others.        Playfair has well observed, that
rounded gravel " can only be found in the beds of rivers, or
on the shores of the sea ; for in the depths of the ocean, though
currents are known to exist, yet there can be no motion of the
                       * Communicated  by the Author.

162         Mr. De la Beche's Notes        on the Formation
water sufficiently rapid to produce the attrition required to
give a round figure and smooth surface to hard and irregular
pieces of stone".*         Although it is acknowledged that no tri-
turation of rock fragments into rounded gravel is now effected
in the bottom of the ocean, it has been supposed that gravels
formed or collected on the shores of continents or islands are
conveyed there, to be consolidated, and converted into beds of
conglomerate.        An attention to the effects of seas on their
coasts will, however, show us that these gravels do not travel
outwards into great depths, but that the ocean exerts its power
to throw them back upon the dry land whence they were de
rived.    Attention to a sea coast with a shingle beach during
a gale of wind will show this.         Every breaker is more or less
charged with shingles, which are forced forward as far as the
broken wave can reach, and in their shock against the beach
drive others before them, that were not held in momentary
mechanical suspension by the breaker.             By these means, and
particularly at the top of high-water, the shingles are projected
on the land beyond the reach of retiring waves. Heavy gales
and high tides combined seem to produce the highest beaches;
they do indeed sometimes cause breaches in the ramparts
they have raised against themselves, but they quickly repair it.
The great accumulation of beach upon the land being effected
at the height of the tide, when the tide ebbs, it is quite clear
the sea cannot deprive the land of what it has thrown upon it.
In moderate weather and during neap tides various little lines
of beach are formed, which are swept away by a heavy gale ;
and when these little beaches are so obliterated, it might be
supposed by a casual observer that the sea was diminishing the
beach ; but attention will show that the shingles of the lines,
so apparently swept away, are but accumulated elsewhere.
These remarks of course only apply to such situations where the
sea, during gales, has no access to cliffs or piers, from whence
there might be a back-wave carrying all before it ; but to such
 situations, and they are abundant, where the breakers meet
 with no resistance, and strike nothing but the more or less in
 clined plane of a shingle beach. Even in cases where the waves
 in heavy gales and high tides do reach cliffs, and for the time
 remove shingle beaches, it is curious to see how soon these lat
 ter are restored when the weather moderates, and when the
 breakers, in consequence of a diminished projecting force, cease
 to recoil from the cliff behind.
    Shingle beaches travel in the direction of the prevalent winds,
 or those which produce the greatest breakers ; of this, excel-

          of extensive   Conglomerate     and Gravel Deposits.            163
lent examples are seen on our southern coast, where the pre
 valent winds being W. or S.W. the beaches travel eastwards.
 If rocky projections or points of land occur on the east of any
 shingle beach so travelling, the sea soon forms n considerable
 barrier against itself, more particularly when the mouths of
 valleys or flat hinds back the shingles; such flat lands or
 mouths of valleys thus obtaining protection from the ravages
 of the sea (Plate 1 1. fig. 2).      If  the streams which discharge
 themselves into the sea from such valleys or flat lands are small,
 their mouths are barred by the beach, and the water perco
lates through the shingles. Such streams, in cases of flood, cut
 through the shingle a passage again to be dammed up by the
 effects of a gale of wind.
    It would appear that though shingle or pebble beaches
 travel coastways, in consequence of the general direction of
the breakers, there is no evidence of their being transported
outwards or into the depths of the ocean.             The seaward front
of most shingle beaches, particularly when they defend tracts
 of flat country, is bounded by a line along the edge of the
 beach ; above this line the beach generally makes a consider
 able angle with the sands, in cases of sandy flats.
     In cases where shingle beaches are not entirely quitted by
 the tide, sandy, shelly, or very fine gravel soundings are
 commonly obtained a short distance from the shore, unless the
bottom be rocky, in which latter case it is generally a mixture
of sand, rock, or fine gravel* and shells. In fact, if the present
 continents or islands were elevated above, or the sea depressed
 beneath, the present ocean level, shingle beaches would be
 found to fringe the land, but not to extend far seaward.
    It is but rarely that the pebbles on shingle beaches are found
to have travelled considerable distances, even along shore ; in
the Chesil Bank indeed, — that extraordinary ridge of pebbles
about sixteen miles long, which connects the Isle of Portland
with the main land, — the shingles seem to have travelled twenty
or thirty miles from the westward. This bank is remarkable
on many accounts, and among others for the power the sea
has exhibited of heaping up a barrier against itself, even when
not backed by land, provided it has two solid resting places
   * These gravels are generally fine, very different in size from the com
mon shingles of beaches.     It might be supposed by persons unaccustomed
to take soundings, that the gravels marked on charts were coarse, resem
bling shingles ; but in general such gravels do not exceed the size of a nut,
and are most commonly smaller.        Such fine gravels are very frequently
mixed with shells; and no soundings are more common on coasts, particu
larly our own coasts, than gravel with shells, sand and gravel, and sand and
shells.

shingles do not travel from the bank (see fig. 1.) ; for Portland
Roads have a bottom of clay, the continuation of the Kim-
meridge clay of the base of Portland and the Ferry Point,
affording one of the best holding grounds for vessels in the
Channel; and the bottom to the S.W. of the bank is sand,
fine gravel with shells, or rock *.
   Shingle beaches are generally formed on the sea shores under
consideration, from the harder parts of the neighbouring
coasts, destroyed by the joint action of atmospheric agency,
land springs, and the sea. The softer portions are soon washed
away, and even the harder, first forming the shingles, are
eventually ground down into sand. It                     is,
                                            however, by no means
uncommon to find, in coasts composed of both hard and soft
materials, taluses of blocks or large indurated concretions, de
tached from the cliffs, and defending them from that quick
destruction that would otherwise ensue.

         is                                     There the granite
decomposes    into its usual blocky forms,   the  angles gradually
disappear,  and  eventually the masses  fall  on the beach, where
the tremendous breakers of that coast grind them against each
other into balls, and often hurl them high up on the shore.

ing waves were merely confined to the shore             for the de

struction of coasts of equal hardness almost always bears a
proportion to the extent of open sea to which they are ex
posed, allowance being always made for the force and dura
tion of prevalent winds.

other circumstances than those previously noticed,        very ably is
   •This bank also possesses considerable interest in another point of view.
The hills behind the bank are composed of clays and loose rubbly or slaty
limestones (Forest marble, Cornbrash, Oxford clay, Oxford oolite, and
Kimmeridge clay), which,    if not protected     this mass of shingles, would
                                                    by
soon be swept away before the heavy seas rolling in from the Atlantic, and
breaking with so much fury on this coast. That they have not been thus
attacked  isevident, for the large rounded forms o( the hills and dales are
only here and there marked by little cliffs, cut by the water intervening be
tween the bank and main-land     ;    therefore seems fair to conclude, that

folk.     After observing that the land encroachment at Lowes-
toft Ness had been effected at distinct and distant intervals ;
that its form had been influenced by the direction of the cur
rents in the channel, and the position of the adjacent shoals,
and that the lines of growth are indicated by a series of con
centric ridges or embankments, inclosing certain areas, he
observes, " a rampart of heavy materials is first thrown up to
an unusual altitude, by some extraordinary tide, attended with
a violent gale.        Subsequent tides extend the base, and heap
up lighter substances on its summit.            Sand is blown from the
beach and fills the interstices. The Arundo arenaria and other
plants, by degrees obtain a footing ; creep along the ridge,
give solidity to the mass, and in some cases form a matted
covering of turf: meanwhile another mound is forming ex
ternally, and by the like process rises and gives protection to
the first      Occasionally the sea forces its way through one of
the external and incomplete mounds, but it is singular to ob
serve how soon the breach is repaired*."
    In tropical countries the advance of the Mangrove trees
outwards from sheltered situations at the bottoms of creeks,
bays, or the mouths of rivers, has a great tendency to increase
land at the expense of the sea.           So long as the sea continues
sheltered, it throws up no barrier against the Mangroves; but
when their strange stilt-like roots have advanced the mass of
these trees to places exposed to the waves, the sea accumu
lates a beach against them, forming lagoons or lakes .             f
    I  have observed off Jamaica, that the coral reefs and islands
are protected on the side of the prevalent winds and breakers
by shingle beaches composed of rounded pieces, and, occa
sionally, large fragments of coral J.

   f Lakes of this description at Albion, south side of Jamaica, contain nu
merous alligators (Crocodilui acutus, Cuv.) and marine fish. The zoology
of some of these lakes would be interesting to geologists, as they become
brackish from the heavy rains that drain into them from the mountain sides,
and may thus contain marine and fresh-water animals.
   J  I remarked one or two curious instances of the growth of land behind
such beaches at Old Harbour. There are many islands, some covered by
Mangrove trees ; one in particular struck me : on its windward side there was
a beach of coral shingles, evidently on the increase, the older or back part
bound together by tropical sea-coast creepers; behind these were the
Mangroves, mixed, if my recollection does not fail me, with some other
tropical sea-shore trees near the beach, but alone and advancing into the sea
on the leeward side of the island, where, not being exposed to the breakers,
they accumulated silt and mud about their roots, and thus extended the
island in that direction.
                                                                       From

 166         Mr. De la Beche's Notes               on the Formation
    From what has been above stated, it will be seen that the
sea endeavours to throw back upon the land the detritus it has
received from    and even, as in the case of corals and shells,
                       it,
of hard substances that have been formed in       and that theit,
pebbles or shingles are not likely to quit the coast under
                         * indeed the common
ordinary circumstances                ;             velocity of
tides seems inadequate to transport them in moderate depths,
where the power of the waves on the surface of the sea
 ceases.
            II.    Action      of   Tideless Seas on their Coasts.
   The principal    difference between these and those above
noticed, consists in the phenomena attendant on the discharge
of rivers into them, which will be noticed under the head of
rivers.   Shingle beaches are accumulated, and protect lands
behind them, but from the want of tide we do not se'e their
bases, and they appear of inferior dimensions to those on tidal
seas.   From the want of tide, which should successively pre
sent different portions of     cliff to the greatest action of the
                                      a
breakers, the destruction of coasts    not so great, and the spaces
                                              is
of open sea being more or less limited, the battering power of
the breakers    greatly inferior to that of the great ocean swell,
                  is
discharged on a tidal coast. Still the same rejection of detritus
derived from the land will be observed when           does not fall
                                                              it
into deep water, beyond the reach of the moving power of
such seas; and we know of no current sufficiently strong in tide-
less seas to distribute the gravel that has been thrown into
their deep waters.
   Large lakes present nearly the same phaenomena as to shin
gle beaches as tideless seas and as most of them are lower at
                                       ;
one time than another, we may observe the shingle beaches
better and
       ;        it by no means uncommon to see
                       is                               skirting of a
shingle round them when their waters are low.
                  III.       Action   of Rivers   on their Beds.
   Rivers most frequently, though not always, take their rise
among hills and mountains, and are supplied either             the      by
melting of snows   or  glaciers, the draining of rain waters, or
by springs.    The two former particularly bring down frag
ments formed by decomposition from the neighbouring rocks,
into the bed of the river.    In mountainous regions fragments
of rocks of greater or  less dimensions  fall into the river from
the mountain sides.      The river also undermines its banks,
and the loose decomposed surface of the rocks tumbles into it.
  * Even   in the case of sands, which do not enter within the scope of this
memoir, there       tendency in the sea to throw them upon the land. Wit
                is
                a
ness the sandy Dunes, so common on various coasts.
                                                                        From

         of extensive  Conglomerate    and Gravel Deposits.      167
From these sources the river obtains the materials for its
gravel. The greater the velocity of the water, the sooner will
the angular fragments be ground by attrition into pebbles.
Rivers are most rapid in high mountain ranges, having to find
their way from a high to a much lower level in comparatively
short distances.     Now as the decomposition and the fall of
rocks is greatest amid high mountains, and as the rivers are
most rapid in the same situations, the greatest quantity of river
gravel is there produced.
    In low situations, where rivers lose their rapidity, gravels
are rarely formed, but sands or mud are common.             In times
of flood, gravels formed     in their   beds, in the high lands, are
brought down into their beds in the plains ; but even these do
not appear to travel far. It is asserted, but has not been proved,
that rivers carry their gravels to considerable distances ; but
 I  cannot avoid suspecting that pebbles derived from great
gravel plains, or from cliffs of loosely aggregated conglome
rate, such as the Nagelfluhe of Switzerland, cut away by the
rivers, and thus carried into their beds, have been sometimes
mistaken for gravels transported from great distances by the
rivers. There is no want of gravel, composed of pebbles
from the high Alps, in the bed of the Rhone, where that river
quits the lake of Geneva, or in the bed of the Ticino, where it
quits the Lago Maggiore ; and I presume no person would
imagine that the gravels have been brought down by either
river from the Alps, as all such pebbles must have been quietly
deposited in the bottoms of the respective lakes.        In both in
stances the gravels have been derived from conglomerates
formed by more general causes, cut through by the rivers after
they have quitted the lakes.          Innumerable other instances
might be produced.        The same observation applies to rivers
 cutting great gravel plains, where they obtain pebbles, de
rived originally from distant rocks, from their banks, but to
 the transport of which, by the rivers, physical obstacles oppose
themselves.     Such obstacles commonly present themselves in
the shape of lakes, the beds of which it is impossible the rivers
could have cut.       Into these the rapid and detritus-bearing
rivers deposit their gravels and sand, so that such rivers con
 stantly tend to fill up lakes so situated.       The detritus, thus-
driven into a lake, will always be deposited in a peculiar form,
variously modified according to the depth of the lake, and the
pebbly or sandy nature of the detritus.
    In cases where rivers discharge pebbles into lakes, that of
the Drance torrent for instance, which deposits its pebbles in
the lake of Geneva, the advance is gradual and local. It is ob
vious that the stratification resulting from these causes must
                                                                have

 168        Mr. De la Beche's   Notes on the Formation
have a peculiar figure ; and supposing a lake, nearly filled by
these means, to be examined after drainage, the beds of gravel,
sand or clay, would be very irregular, and not be disposed hori
zontally.
    To   take examples from the      Alps; the present transport
of river-formed pebbles from     a  large part of these mountains
is prevented by numerous lakes on their north and south sides.
On the north the Rhine deposits its mountain detritus in the
lake of Constance, and the Rhone its transported pebbles and
sands in the lake of Geneva.          Between these the lakes of
Zurich, Lucerne, &c. receive the gravels of other alpine rivers.
On the south the Lago Maggiore receives the alpine detritus
of the Ticino, the lake of Como that of the Adda, and the
lakes of Garda, &c. perform the same office to other rivers.
 From these circumstances it will be evident that the river-
formed pebbles of a large portion of the Alps cannot travel by
the rivers into either the ocean or the Mediterranean : it might
at first sight be supposed that the Po could transport the river-
formed pebbles of a large portion of the Alps into the Adriatic ;
but the Po becomes a sandy-bedded river before it receives
 the Ticino.
    It may also be supposed that though the Rhone can trans
port no alpine detritus beyond the spot where it enters the
lake of Geneva, yet that, after it has quitted that lake, it can
 carry all the pebbles borne down by the Arve from the district
 of Mont Blanc.     I have often stood at the junction of the two
 rivers, and could not perceive that there were marks of any
 great transport of pebbles by the Arve, though it held, as is
 common to most alpine glacier waters, a considerable quantity
 of sand in mechanical suspension. The banks of both the Arve
 and the Rhone afford abundance of rounded alpine pebbles,
 and it would be no easy matter to say, how much of the peb
 ble bed of the Arve was derived directly from the Alps, and
 how much from its banks near Geneva.          But supposing the
 Arve did bring down abundantly pebbles from the Alps, their
 progress would seem to be checked at the gulf known as the
 Perte du Rhone.
    As a general fact, it may be fairly stated that rivers, where
 their courses are short and rapid, bear down pebbles into the
 seas near them, as is the case with the torrents in the Mari
 time Alps ; but that when their courses are long, and changed
 from rapid to slow, they deposit the pebbles where the force
 of the stream diminishes, and finally transport mere sand or
 mud to their mouths, as is the case with the Rhine, Rhone,
 Po, Danube, &c.

          of extensive  Cottglomerate and Gravel Deposits.        169
              IV.   Discharge  of Rivers into Tidal   Seas.
     Tidal rivers, when large, most frequently keep their mouths
open, though there is always a tendency to form bars and sand
 banks; as for example, the Thames, the Severn, the Seine, the
 Loire, the Tagus, the St. Lawrence.          In such situations, the
 detritus, if any, is small enough to be held in mechanical sus
 pension.
      Some tidal rivers, or rivers which discharge themselves
 into tidal seas, form deltas when the force of the current is con
 siderable, the tides small, or the seas not much subject to storms
 setting in shore, but merely to land and sea breezes. Of the
 mouths of such rivers, the Missisippi, the Oronoco, the
 Ganges, and the Yellow River of China, are examples. The de
 tritus brought down by such rivers to their mouths is either
 sand or mud ; therefore they do not contribute towards the
 formation of gravels at the bottom of the ocean.
     Tidal rivers, when small, have a tendency to be blocked up
 by the sea, which often increases the bars into long banks of
 pebbles or sand, and it is with difficulty that the rivers deliver
 their waters into the sea: if the line of coast keeps the direc
 tion of the prevalent winds, the difficulty is increased, and the
 river generally gains a cliff or some hard ground, for one of
 its banks, before it can effect its escape into the sea.      Good
 examples   of  these  embouchures   are seen  on our southern coast.
 The Teign has a tendency to be blocked up by the bank upon
 which part of Teignmouth is built, named the Den, which the
easterly winds, producing the greatest breakers on this beach,
drive across the mouth of the river from E. to W., and the
 Teign escapes by the side of the Ness Point, which affords it sup
port. The Axe is also deflected from its course by the pebble
bank thrown up from \V. to E. by the prevalent W. and S. W.
winds, which here afford the heaviest breakers, and it escapes
into the sea by supporting itself against Axmonth cliff; the
sea, however, is constantly endeavouring to bar up its pass
age (fig. 2.).
    The harbour at Shoreham is a good example of a fiver
deflected from its straight course by banks thrown up by the
sea (fig. 3).      The river in this case escapes through a gap
which it has formed in the bank itself.
    It is obvious that in these cases the sea rejects the detritus
it receives from the rivers, and forces it back, with the cliff de
tritus, upon the land.
    The great flats on the western coast of South America are
excellent examples of mud and sandy detritus forced back
upon the land.

              V. Discharge of Rivers into Tideless         Seas.
     These discharges are more or less modified, according to
 the open waters and prevalent winds to which they are ex
posed ; and in general they tend to push forward deltas be
fore them (fig. 4.), which more or less protrude according to
 the depth of water into which the rivers deliver themselves,
 the greater or less shelter of the coasts, the quantity and na
 ture of the detritus held in mechanical suspension, and the
 force of the current.         Those rivers which push forward great
 deltas, such as the Nile, Rhone, Po, Danube, and Volga, bear
 mud and silt before them, and of these materials the deltas
 are almost wholly composed.             The rivers which bear down
 pebbles     into tideless    seas are short,   rapid, and of the torrent
 kind.      Most frequently, from the high and mountainous na
 ture of the coasts, the gravel is deposited in deep water, and
 therefore, being out of the influence of breakers and waves, re
 mains quietly at the bottom, unless carried by currents suffi
 ciently strong to remove it : of currents so strong we have not
 any known examples in a tideless sea. Nice will afford a good
 example of such deposits. The Var and the Paglion bring
 down pebbles into the Mediterranean, which are almost imme
 diately conveyed into deep water and remain undisturbed, ex
 tending but a short distance seaward ; for the gravel soundings
 obtained further from the coast must not be confounded with
 the river detritus, such soundings being upon the prolongation
 of the tertiary conglomerates beneath the level of the sea*.
     If tideless seas, such as the Mediterranean, Black and Cas
pian Seas, were to become dry, these deltas and gravel deposits
would be very apparent, both more or less presenting the ad
vance noticed in the case of lakes, and we should not have
 beds of detritus parallel to the coasts, but a series of projections
 with a stratification peculiar to each, but not common to the
 whole.
     Upon a review of the phaenomena productive of gravels on
 sea   beaches and in river beds, it will, I think, appear pro
bable that in neither case could pebbles be furnished in such
a way as to afford materials for those great deposits of gravel
 and conglomerate, which we observe in rocks that must have
 been formed at various epochs ; the coasts present lines of
 shingle or sand, more advanced in cases of the embouchures
of rivers into tideless, generally calm, or nearly tideless seas,
 and the rivers afford mere lines of pebbles. To make these
     * It should
                  always be recollected that in gravel soundings the probabi
lities are as great of finding rounded pebbles beneath the sea as on the sur
face of the land.
                                                                   materials

           of extensive   Conglomerate    and Gravel Deposits.           171
materials available in the formation of extensively deposited
gravels and conglomerates, some greater and more general
force than the action of seas on their coasts, or rivers on their
beds, must collect them together.            This force it seems natural
to seek in masses of water more or less voluminous according
to circumstances.          To produce these at various times and in
greater or less abundance, the various dislocations of strata
everywhere so observable, seem adequate.                    It is now known
that mountains       have   been  raised  at  different    epochs, and that
horizontal strata, even those deposited at comparatively recent
geological epochs, have been shattered and broken into faults,
a large proportion of which are only covered by the gravels
that have been termed diluvium.              Can we imagine that such
great convulsions and disruptions of our planet's crust could
have been unaccompanied by violent movements in the mass
of waters, and that debacles, as they are called, have not been
frequent and great ? It seems but rational to infer that such
debacles or deluges must have more or less resulted from every
great convulsion, and have been more or less extensive ac
cording to the power of the disrupting force.                    Such causes
could easily form the extensive gravel and conglomerate de
posits j we now observe, not only by their own destructive
power, but also by amassing all the river and sea-shore gravels
within their influence.
    According to this theory, the extent of gravels would cor
respond with the extent of the disturbing forces, and would
be general where these forces were appliea generally, and par
tial where these forces were applied partially.

XXIV.        On the Construction and Arrangement of the Berlin
   Astronomical Ephemeris for 18S1. By Professor ENCKE*.
HPHE       construction of the Ephemeris for this year is the same
 -*•
       as that for the preceding one, with the exception that some
columns have been added to those relating to the positions of
the planets, and to the occultations of stars.          With a view to
prevent all misunderstanding in regard to the times of rising
and setting of the sun and moon, and of the changes of the
moon,      I  distinctly remark that, with the -exception of solar
eclipses, the times given never refer to apparent time, but are
always meant for mean solar time.
     The comparison of the end of the last with the beginning
of the present Ephemeris, has led to the discovery of differ
ences, fortunately of no moment, which had arisen from error,
and from neglecting small quantities.
     In the calculation of the Ephemeris of the sun both for the last
and for the present year, the tables of Professor Bessel, pub
lished, subsequently to the calculation, in Professor Schuma
cher's Nachrichten, could not be applied. Having however de
rived, from the corrections which had been published, the ele
ments on which they were founded, I constructed from the same
the necessary tables, and thus the difference is of any conse
quence in one column only.             In order to obtain a rigorous
agreement with Professor Bessel's tables, it will be necessary
to increase the mean right ascension of the sun, or the sidereal
time at the mean noon, given in the Ephemerides for the two
years, throughout, by +0"-06.              This correction is constant
through the whole year, because the smaller corrections de
pendent on the two nutations are exactly the same in Bessel's
and in my tables.
     In the calculations for the positions of the moon, my aim has
again been to be accurate to + 0"'5; yet there are places
wne re the differences appear to indicate the necessity of cor
rections greater than this quantity.           A revisal of the calcula
tions having, however, not shown any error, the data have been
given without alteration.          The columns of the place of the
 moon at the two culminations have in the present Ephemeris
been calculated more accurately, and each datum has been
found directly without interpolation.           Although the excellent
method of Professor Bessel of predicting occultations of stars,
which, with his permission, I have reprinted in this Ephemerisf,
will perhaps supersede the use of the lower culminations here
               I
given ; yet did not think it proper to leave them out, as they
were necessary to me for the calculation of occultations of

On the Construction      of Prof. Encke's Ephemerisfor        1831.    173
stars, and as they may, perhaps, still be used for observations
of the moon in general.
    I have now availed myself, in the calculations for Mercury, of
the corrections of Lindenau's tables, which Prof. Schumacher
had already published some time since. I deem it not super
fluous again to observe, that the examination of the places cal
culated for every second day by their differences, is not suffi
cient to discover all possible errors of the calculation.
    There is an error of 10" in the heliocentric place of Venus
on the 31st of December in the preceding Ephemeris, caused
by an error in the calculation, which extends likewise to the
geocentric place ; this error has however no influence on the
data for other days, as the place on that day had been calcu
lated directly and could not be examined by differences.
    Mr. Hansen has kindly informed me that the longitude of the
node of Venus, used in the calculations for this year and the
preceding one, differs from the value assigned to it in Lin
denau's tables.      I  have thought proper to make an alteration
in this element, because the value derived for 1808, in the
preface of the tables, from the latest epoch, is smaller by 1' 15"
than the value afterwards adopted. The calculation is founded
on the epoch of 1750, and from that date forward an annual
motion of 31"'2 has been applied, contrary to what the author
himself declares to have been formerly adopted.               As the cal
culations of the transits of Venus likewise give a smaller longi
tude of the node, and a motion of the node smaller than 31"%
I   have thought that    I  might assume the longitude of the node
of Venus Q      =  74° S3' 48" + 30-66       (f-   1765).
     Hence we have for 1808, 8 =74° 55' 46"; while, according
to the preface, the observations have given 8 = 74° 56' 37";
and the tables have 8 = 74° 57' 52".             The values adopted by
me give therefore a result more nearly approximating to the
latest observations, than that of the tables, and agree at the
 same time with those transits which must give the longitude of
 the node with greater accuracy than any other observation!
 If, however, later observations should prove the longitude of the
                                  I
tables to be more accurate, shall adopt their values in future..
     Of all heavenly bodies whose places were given in the last
 Ephemeris, Ceres was the one whose places were likely to de
viate most from the truth.          For the present year, I have there
fore derived new elements from the last oppositions, taking into
calculation the perturbations of Jupiter only, respecting which
 a more detailed explanation will be found below*.              Although
 it cannot be expected that these preliminary determinations will
 very accurately represent the places of Ceres, yet they will give

   The manner in which the perturbations of the small planets
are calculated, — viz. by applying the corrections to the ele
ments themselves, and not to the places calculated by the
mean elements, — renders a generally true exhibition of their
orbits impossible, and the data given in astronomical books
neither refer to mean elements generally, nor even to variable
elements taken for a certain moment of time.           As however for
all the four new planets, the effect of Jupiter at least, although
perhaps not on the same hypothesis of its mass, has been ap
plied, it may perhaps be interesting to exhibit the form of the
four orbits for the same moment 01 time.         The following ele
ments of Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, refer to the moment of the
opposition of Pallas; those of Ceres properly for the moment
of her opposition. The distance being however small, the
change of the latter, in order to reduce them accurately to the
moment to which the others belong, would be very small.

                                                      the planets
 were to be arranged by the length of the great axis, Pallas and
 Ceres ought properly to exchange places.       As, however, by
 this manner of applying the perturbations, Ceres may and will
 have at times, in consequence of the periodical changes of the
 great axis, a greater mean distance, it will not be necessary to
 deviate from the arrangement usually followed.
    With regard to Jupiter and Saturn, it had been overlooked,
when preparing the preceding volume, that the data of the
tables of epochs were to be corrected, on account of the in
equality of the precession.     Without regarding the changes
of the longitudes of the perihelion and ofthe node, as well as
the greatest equation of the centre, all which will have but an
exceedingly small influence, the heliocentric longitudes of Ju
piter and Saturn, as given for the year 1830, must, for the
reason above assigned, be augmented throughout by 2"-2 de
cimal seconds, or Or'-7 sexagesimal seconds. The influence of
this correction on the geocentric places will not be of any con
sequence for the declinations of the two planets, as it may be
assumed with sufficient accuracy          = 0"*3   . —      cos A, where   r
and    A designate the heliocentric distance and longitude, A and
8  the geocentric distance and declination. In like manner, the
 principal part ofthe influence of the geocentric right ascension
 may be applied by increasing the right ascensions in time by
 0"-05.
    The ratio of the axes of the orbits of all the satellites of Jupiter,
given in the preceding volume, deviates considerably from the
truth. This ratio was obtained by the reduction ofthe positions
ofthe orbits ofthe satellites to the ecliptic, for which purpose
Gauss's formulae were applied. In calculating them, however,
it was overlooked, that these formulae do not give the inclination
itself, butonly one half of    so that the ratio ofthe axes given iu
                               it;
the preceding year's Ephemeris refers to an inclination ofthe
orbits, which     only one half of what ought to be. This error
                   is                         it

   The calculations of the path of the moon have again been
divided between Messrs, Herter, Wolfers, and Dannemann.
Science has lost the services of the latter gentleman                                   by   a
sudden and premature death, shortly after he had finished his
share of these calculations, when on the point of undertaking
a situation at the public school at Lingen.
   Mr. Herter has, besides, had the kindness to undertake the
calculations for Mercury while Mr. Wolfers has completely
                                           ;
calculated the paths of Venus, of Jupiter, and of Saturn, and
the occultations of Jupiter's satellites.
   The apparent places of Maskelyne's thirty-six principal stars
will have, in this year's Ephemeris, an unequalled degree of
accuracy, as Prof. Bessel, at my request, has had the kindness to
have them calculated                  by
                           one of his pupils, agreeably to his latest
investigations. The comparison of the calculations of 1830,
which has been added, proved that, with the exception of a.
Aquilae, no alterations would have been required in the. right
ascensions. For this star the correction      for Jan. 0... — 0"-012.

178           On the Construction and Arrangement
manner of calculating the reductions. Neither can it be de
nied that for well-furnished observatories too great a number
of principal stars is unnecessary and a waste of time.            I  have,
however, believed, that I ought not to swerve from the example
of Professor Schumacher. For observatories which have not
the advantage of a perfectly firm position of their instruments,
a greater number of northern stars, which may be observed
both above and below the pole, may be of advantage in many
cases, even if the rigorous determination may be better de
rived from the thirty-six principal stars.           Some differences,
 imperceptible in practice in the mean places, compared with
the data of the preceding year, arise from a new derivation of
the same.
    New tables of S Ursle Minoris, which we are to expect from
 Professor Bessel, could not yet be made available for the pre
sent year. A comparison of these tables with the data for 1830
and 1831, has proved that the following corrections are to be
applied to the date of the Ephemeris with respect to this star.

we shall have nearly such an approximation to the latest de
terminations, as a rigorous calculation by them would have
admitted.
    Agreeably to the wish of some of the astronomers whp use
this Ephemeris,     I have given the conjunction of the planets
Mercury,    Venus,    Mars,   Jupiter and Saturn, with the moon
and with each other, in every case in right ascension, for every
month, even when no occultation will take place. For the
four new planets the intensity of light in their opposition has
.been given agreeably to Professor Bessel's idea ; viz. that the
intensity of light which the planet would have when equi
                                                                   distant

               of Prof. Encke's Ephemerisjbr     1831.
 distant from the sun and the earth, and at a distance equal to
 its mean one, or to its semi-axis major, should be taken as
 unity.    For the purpose of determining the longitude, the
 stars which are on the parallel of the moon at the time of
 the moon's transit over the meridian, have again been selected.
 Agreeably to the wish of Professor Argelander, the horary
motion of the moon in right ascension has always been added,
 in order to facilitate to observers in other places the exact cal
culation of the transit.    The given horary motion of the moon
in right ascension, being multiplied by the difference of longi
tude from Berlin, expressed in parts of an hour, taken nega
tively if east, and the product being applied to the given right
ascension, the time of transit will be obtained with perfect ex
actness, as the given horary motion is that belonging to a
 lunar hour.    The declination which is added has already for
 the greater part been divested of the influence of parallax,
 at least for Berlin, and may serve in our northern countries,
 without any further correction, for pointing the instruments.
 It may perhaps be doubtful whether, for observations of the
moon's second limb in the early hours of the morning, the ad
dition of stars would be of essential service, as they must often,
for having the necessary light, be at a considerable distance
from the parallel of the moon. Considering the accuracy of
the principal stars, it appears that the derivation of the right
ascension of the moon's second limb from all principal stars,
and the position of the instrument, would lead to results quite
as accurate as would be obtained by the observed difference
in right ascension, of stars which are at considerable distances
from the parallel of the moon.
    The arrangement with regard to occultations of stars is
sufficiently explained by the paper on that subject (Phil. Mag.
for Nov. and Dec. 1829). The size of the page did not permit
me to add at once the declination of the stars, which is to be
taken from the list of occulted stars immediately following.
The calculation was made twice, in order to ensure exactness :
First, by the method explained in the preceding year's volume,
which, especially for several occultations on the same day, fa
cilitates the decision as to their taking place, or not. Next, a
moment of time was chosen, which was as near the time of
the smallest distance, and as convenient for interpolation, as
possible; and for this moment the values of p, g,p', q1 were
calculated, and thence the immersions and emersions were de
duced. The year 1831 is distinguished by many considerable
occultations.    Aldebaran will be occulted six times, Hegi.il us
twice, and, besides, Jupiter and Saturn once.
    Although the tables next following will no more serve the

the moon to the stars and the motion of the former, they have,
notwithstanding, been added, in order to facilitate the calcu
lation of the occultations of such stars as are not given in our
list.
    Both my own comparison and the communications of others
have brought to my knowledge a greater number of misprints
than ought to exist in such a volume. Most of them, or almost
all, do not arise from a want of attention in the printing-office,
which has perfectly fulfilled every expectation, but from the
 unavoidable transferring and copying of the columns. It would
 hardly be worth while to enumerate them, as by the regularity
 of the differences every considerable error will be easily de
 tected at first sight. I beg, however, to add this one remark-
 that, as in the case of logarithmic tables one acquires the habit,
 when taking out a number, always to cast one's eye on the
 preceding and following number, so, in the use of this book,
 the small trouble of slightly looking at the numbers close to
 the one wanted, ought not be dispensed with.            For accurate
 calculations it is besides always necessary to form several or
 ders of differences.
  XXV.     On Artificial and Natural Arrangements of Plants      : and
    particularly on the Systems of Linnceus and Jussieu.            By
     WILLIAM ROSCOE, Esq. F.L.S.
                          [Concluded  from page 10-1.]
   A CCORDING           to each of these systems, the classes are
  ^~*- divided into orders.      Linnaeus, still aiming at simplicity,
  but founding     his decisions   on strong natural distinctions, has
  for this purpose recourse to the pistillum, or style, the imme
  diate organ of impregnation, and essential to the formation of
  the fruit.   As a single word has expressed the class, so an
  other word now gives us the order ; and to a practical bo
  tanist the expression Pentandria monogynia suggests the idea
  of a division of plants including, among many others, the
  natural order of asperifolise ; as that of Pentandria digynia
  does of the umbel liferffi.    The difficulties under which Jussieu
  labours    now  become    apparent.     He has indeed formed the
  vegetable kingdom into fifteen classes ; under which heads he
 has arranged one hundred tribes or orders, each consisting of
  various families of plants supposed to be allied to each other;
 but when we ask for the distinctions of these orders, or, in
 other words, by what peculiarities they are to be recognised,
                                                                   and

                                         of Planti.

                      Arrangements                                     181
and in what terms they are to be described, we find only a
series of appellations, mostly derived from some particular
genus of plants which is supposed sufficiently predominant to
give a name to the order, and which order includes certain
other genera which appear to be related to it*.              If, however,
we are dissatisfied with this mode of distinction, as affording
us no determinate idea, nor giving us any clue to discover how
such order is formed, we can only have recourse to a com
parison of the descriptions placed at the head of each of the
orders of which each class is composed. That the Jasmineae
may form a part of the same natural class as the Gentiunae,
although their relation be not very apparent, may be admitted ;
because they equally germinate from two cotyledons, and have
 each a monopetalous corolla situated beneath the germen;
 but when we ask why these genera are not also of the same
 order, we must seek for an answer in the description prefixed
to each order in the body of the work ; until by a careful per
 usal and comparison of these descriptions, which in many re
 spects agree, we are at length enabled to determine in what
 the difference between a Jasmine and a Gentian, a Laurus or
 an Atriplex, really consists.          In this secondary part of the
 system it will therefore scarcely be denied that the advantages
 of perspicuity and precision are wholly on the part of Linnaeus,
 whatever may be the case as to the natural order of the plants ;
 in which respect, however, it is by no means clear that Jussieu
 possesses any superiority over his predecessor.
     From classes and orders we descend to genera, in the de
 termination of which the chief difficulties of the science con
 sist; but as in some of the orders the number of genera is very
 great, it has been found indispensably necessary to divide such
  orders into sections, so as to place each genus in its proper
 relative situation, and break in as little as possible upon their
 natural or apparent affinities. This Linnaeus and his subse
  quent editors have endeavoured to do by a kind of collateral
  arrangement placed at the head of each class, though not
  strictly conformable to the rest of the system.         For the discri
  mination of these sections there remained ample materials.
  The stamina and pistils had indeed already been employed in
  characterizing the classes and orders ; but the corolla, as well
  with respect to the number of its petals as its form and situa
  tion, the calyx, the receptacle, the germen, the stigma and the
  fruit, all offered important marks of discrimination, which
  have been made use of so as greatly to assist the student, al-
     • Thus the 4th order of the 8th class is denominated
                                                          .Tasminece, and in
  cludes the genera of Maytenus — Nyctanthes — Lilac — Hebe —Fraxinu*— '
  Chionanthus— Olea— Phillyrea — Mogorium— Jasminum and Ligustrum.
                                                                    though

     18'2         Mr. Roscoe   on  Artificial and Natural
     though not with all the beneficial effect that might have been
     expected, or so as to define with accuracy the relative situa
     tion of each genus.     The same mode of dividing the orders
    into sections has also been resorted to by Jussieu ; but as he
     had already employed the corolla and the situation of the
     stamina in order to characterize his classes, he has been obliged
     to have recourse in his subordinate divisions to other distinc
     tions. He therefore chiefly employs for this purpose the num
    ber of the stamina, and the style, with the addition of the re
    ceptacle, and particularly of the fruit.      Thus it appears that
     the two systems of Linnaeus and Jussieu are in this respect
    nearly a transposition of each other ; and that whilst Linnaeus
    begins his great divisions with the essential organs of fructifi
    cation, and proceeds to characterize his inferior divisions by
    parts of less natural importance, Jussieu has formed his lead
    ing distinctions upon the corolla, and the situation of the
    stamina ; and has employed the number of the stamina and
    style to divide his orders into sections.     Which of these me
    thods is to be preferred the reader will decide ; but as they are
    in fact equally natural, or equally artificial, that which most
    clearly defines the plant in question, which supplies a concise
\ and intelligible nomenclature, and most effectually assists the
 {
    student in his researches, is undoubtedly to be preferred : and
   in these respects it will scarcely be contended that the system
    of Jussieu is superior to that of Linnaeus.
        In forming their genera, both Linnaeus and Jussieu have
   exerted all their talents.      They were both of them equally
   convinced that these combinations were founded in nature, and
   ought equally to be adhered to under every mode of arrange
   ment.     Here then there can be no comparison, except as to the
   superior skill exhibited in the composition and description of
   such genera.     Which of them has excelled in this respect I
   shall not take upon myself to decide; but if the preference is
   to be given to Jussieu in any instance, it is perhaps in the full
   and scientific manner in which his genera are defined.
        But whatever may be the merits of these rival systems in
   other respects, there is one objection still remaining against
   that of Jussieu, which strikingly reminds us of the prediction
   of Linnaeus, and renders it as a nomenclature entirely useless.
   Unable to comprehend in any of his divisions all known ge-
   nera,he is compelled to annex to the close of several of his orders
   many plants, which he denominates genera qffinia; besides
   which, he is obliged to add at the end of his work a longappendix
   of plants whose proper stations he has not been able to ascer
   tain ; not from the want of opportunity for investigation, for
   many of the plants were obvious ; but because they either fall
                                                                under

under different classes with equal claims, or are not reducible
to any class whatever. As a nomenclature this defect is fatal;
for, unless the inquirer can be confidently assured that some
part of the system will afford him the information he requires,
he is disheartened in his efforts, and relinquishes his search in
disgust.
    Here, then, the comparison between these rival systems
necessarily terminates ; and whatever may be the merits of
Jussieu as a botanist, it is sufficiently clear that they are not
exemplified in the superiority of his arrangement as a nomen
clature of the vegetable kingdom. In fact, the inconveniencies
arising in such arrangement from its primary distinctions be
ing founded on the mode of germination, from the want of
a succinct and explicit division of the classes into orders
and sections, and particularly from the unfortunate circum
stance of a considerable portion of vegetables not being in
cluded in any part of the system, compel us to conclude that,
as a nomenclature and series of plants, it is greatly inferior to
 that of Linnaeus ; and that, however excellent it may be in
 some respects, it will never supplant in general use that long
 established work.
     III. That the work of Jussieu, considered as an illustration
 of the natural affinities of plants, possesses great and intrinsic
 merit, we may however readily admit ; but that the study of
 plants in their natural orders can supply the want of an arti
 ficial system, may safely be denied. In fact, these two methods
 are as distinct in their objects as they are in their [means, and
 should never be confounded with each other. The one com
 mences its observations with the obvious and exterior ap
 pearances of plants ; and, seizing upon the most striking cha
 racters, immediately arranges them into their different classes
 and families. No distinctions are employed but such as are
 visible, and present ; and wherever the plant is seen in its
 perfect state, it bears upon it its own name and character. As
 the means thus employed are confined to the exterior of the
 plant, so the object in view is limited to the mere knowledge
 of its proper appellation ; and as soon as that is attained, the
 purpose of an artificial system is complete. — A real natural
 system, on the other hand, if such a one should ever be prac
 ticable, must be founded on a long and intimate acquaintance
 with the nature of plants, their habits and places of growth,
 the form and qualities of their seed, the manner of their evo
  lution, increase, and reproduction, the peculiarities of their
 radication, their interior substance, whether medullary or con
 centric, the infinitely varied formation of their vascular system,
 by which the plant is not only enabled to circulate the juices
                                                          necessary

 184          Mr. Roscoe    on Arrangements   of Plants.
 necessary to its support, but to elicit those peculiar qualities
 of acids, salts, gums, resins and aroma, by which they are di
 stinguished, and on which their natural combinations so ulti
 mately depend.     When these facts are sufficiently developed,
the system then proceeds to arrange the individuals of the ve
getable kingdom, not by their exterior phenomena, but by
those primitive and secret alliances by which nature has bound
them together ; uniting such as are most nearly allied, and se
parating such as have no inherent affinity to each other.       In
an artificial system, some plain and obvious distinction, such
for instance as the number of the stamina, is decisive of the
character.     In a natural system this must depend on some
more remote circumstance, such as the mode of germination
of the plant, and which, though deeply founded in nature,
cannot at the instant be demonstrated, but must for the pre
sent be admitted on the credit of the founder.        Even to de
termine the primary distinctions on which such a system should
rest, is a matter of no small difficulty : and notwithstanding
the concurrent authority of both Linnaeus and Jussieu, it is
by no means certain that the number of cotyledons with which
a plant germinates is the most secure foundation; or whether,
for instance, the classification by Gaertner from the seeds them
selves is not to be preferred.    Hence there arises between the
two modes of arrangement this important distinction, that an
artificial method, devised and completed by one person, may
readily be communicated to another, and is as intelligible to
the student as to the preceptor; whilst, on the contrary, the
knowledge of a natural system is chiefly confined to the author,
and cannot be fully attained by any other person without en
tering into the same investigations, and ascertaining the same
facts; many of which might perhaps afford different results,
or lead to different conclusions.    Whenever a pretended na
tural system relinquishes these primary distinctions, and at
tempts to arrange the genera and species of plants by their
exterior phenomena, it is no longer natural but artificial ; and
the superstructure being wholly different from the basis, it
becomes incongruous and absurd ; neither furnishing the re
condite information which is obtained from the study of the
natural relations of plants, nor affording us those advantages
of a ready discrimination which we derive from an artificial
arrangement.      As long as these truths are acknowledged and
acted upon, a real progress will be made in the science ; and
to no country has the world been of late more indebted than
to France, for that knowledge and information which a deep
inquiry into the recesses of the vegetable kingdom can alone
supply ; although this country may also boast of many distin

eminent men have either not been aware of the true limits of
the science which they cultivate, or have not been satisfied to
confine their efforts within the bounds which it prescribes ;
but have endeavoured to establish their system as capable of
exhibiting a complete arrangement of the vegetable kingdom,
which would render unnecessary all the labours of their pre
decessors ; and still more is it to be regretted, that they should
have endeavoured to establish such an opinion on the authority
of Linnaeus himself, and should have represented him as speak
ing a language the most foreign from his thoughts, and as
having condemned a system which he laboured with incessant
assiduity to establish, on which his hopes of fame were in some
measure founded, and which will certainly not defraud him of
those honours which are so justly his due.

        Gentlemen,
  I    OBSERVE         in Mr. Witham's interesting paper " On the
       Vegetation of the First Period of an ancient World," pub
 •*•
lished in your Magazine for the present month, [Jan. 1830.J
a notice of the fossil trees discovered about twelve months ago
in Jefferies Rake Vein at Derwent Lead Mine in the county of
Durham, in which he states that it has been the opinion of som*
gentlemen who have visited these ancient relics, that they havt
been washed into and deposited in their present situation by
some aqueous revolution. Soon after the discovery of this very
singular natural phenomenon, I visited the place, and must
confess     I was one of those who drew the conclusion mentioned
by Mr. Witham ; at least I conceived, that the trees had been
deposited in the situation in which they were found after the
formation of the vein, but by what means I did not conjec
ture. The following detail of the particulars connected with
this extraordinary occurrence will enable others to judge how
far this opinion is borne out by the facts of the case.
     The lead mine of Jefferies Rake seems to form nearly the
eastern extremity of a series of very rich lead ore veins, ex
tending from Garrigill Gate through Neuthead, Coulcleugh,
Allenheads, and so on to the Derwent veins; in the counties
of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Durham respectively.

 The continuity of any one vein in this series cannot, indeed, be
traced for the entire distance ; but it is probable that the whole
have been formed by some general power operating in a direc
 tion nearly east and west.
    Jefferies Rake vein has been worked for a great number of
 years, and has yielded considerable quantities ol lead ore, which
 has been principally raised in the upper series of lead mea
 sures above the great limestone of this district, numbered 1 53
 in Forster's Section of the Strata, and marked " Great lime
         " in a
 stone          copy of this section, vol. xlv. plate 2. of the Phi
 losophical Magazine.        Here the strata of sandstone, called
 provincially   "Hazels,"    are much thicker than in many other
 places not far distant, where they have been sunk through,
'which circumstance has rendered themining ground at Jefferies
 Rake much more valuable. The vein was formerly worked
 by shafts from the surface ; but the adit mentioned by Mr.
 Witham called Deborah's Level, was driven up to the vein
 some years ago, and by means of it the workings have been
 carried considerably deeper towards the eastern extremity.
 Here an engine-shaft was sunk to the adit level thirty-eight
 fathoms, and below the adit fifty fathoms, and out of this shaft
 galleries or drifts are still driving in the vein at various heights,
 to explore the ground in an easterly direction ; in one of these
 galleries or drifts the fossil trees forming the subject of this com
 munication were discovered. The following is a section of the
 strata sunk through in the engine-shaft just mentioned, com

    The grit sill here made forty fathoms thick is usually di
vided into two near the middle by a plate bed, and in that case
the separate parts are called the High and Low Grit Sills ; but
in this situation, as far as I know, the only bed between them
is the thin stratum of carbonaceous shale mentioned above.
    The grit sill here is a soft sandstone not difficult to work,
and in point of situation among the strata of lead measures,
there seems to be some correspondence between it and the
firestone sill, No. 137 of Forster's Section.
     The drift alluded to, in which the trees were discovered, was
driven east from the engine-shaft about fifty fathoms, the whole
distance in the vein, having the north cheek or wall of the vein
on the left side, and the south or sun cheek (as it is called by
the miners) on the right side respectively.         The vein stood
 almost perpendicular, and was from three to four feet wide ;
 but instead of being filled between the cheeks with a matrix
of quartz and fluorspar, as in situations further west where it
 had been productive of lead ore, it contained a compact stone
 very much harder than the stratum of sandstone in which it
 occurred.
     At the distance of fifty fathoms from the engine-shaft the
 first tree was discovered, standing directly in the vein in close
 contact with the north cheek, upon which an impression was
 left corresponding to the indentations on the surface of the
 tree.    The diameter of the tree was twenty-two inches, and
 the space between it and the sun cheek of the vein was filled up
 with the hard veinstone mentioned above, by which it was
 closely enveloped all around; but between the veinstone and the
 tree was a thin black carbonaceous skin very smooth and
 slippery to the touch. The substance of the fossil was a hard
 stone apparently the same as the veinstone by which it was
 surrounded. The workmen broke this tree to pieces, and found
 it extend to and rest upon the thin stratum of carbonaceous
  shale, below which it did not appear to penetrate, but it extended
  upwards into the roof of the drift to an unknown distance: the
  length taken down and broken to pieces was about four feet.
      The second tree, twenty inches in diameter, was met with at
  the distance of five feet from the first, and, like it,  was found
  standing upright   in close  contact with the  north cheek   of the
  vein the rest of the space between the cheeks being filled
     ;
  up with veinstone as before.      The same coaly matter occurred
  between the substance of the fossil and its envelope, and in
  this case the space contained also some particles of lead ore.
   This tree, like the first, rested upon the bed of carbonaceous
   shale, and penetrated upwards into the roof to an unknown
   distance.
                                2   B2                            At

188   Mr. Pattinson          on Fossil Trees in Derwent       Lead Mine.
  At eight   feet from the second, the third tree was discovered,
standing upon the bed of carbonaceous shale, and penetrating
upwards into the roof of the drift as before, but differing from
the two last instances by being near the sun cheek of the vein.
Towards the base of the tree it was in contact with the cheek,
where an impression of bark was made ; a little further up it
bent off the cheek to the distance of six or eight inches, and
further up still it again approached the cheek, but did not
touch it. The space all around was completely filled up with
the veinstone, as in the instances already mentioned.       This is
the tree in Mr.Witham's possession.
   The fourth tree was a very large one, two feet in diameter,
and occurred at the distance of three feet from the last, standing
like it against the sun cheek of the vein, but differing from all
die others in the circumstance of its penetrating through the
carbonaceous bed downwards, below the drift sole, to an inde
finite distance, and being cut off entirely by a bed, as the
miners called       at two feet above the floor of the drift, no
                      it,
vestige  whatever   appearing  further up in the vein.
   The fifth tree, four feet from the last, three feet in diameter
at the bottom, and twenty inches at top, was standing       the exin
act position in which     was found, extending five feet in height
                                 it
from the carbonaceous bed at the drift
sole upon which        rested, to near the

of its discontinuance did not appear.

discoverable in each cheek of the vein, and that of large fossil
trees of the same species being frequently found standing up
right in sandstone strata connected with seams of coal, cer

 XXVII.       Observations on some Parts of Mr. De la Beche's
     Paper   on  the Classification of the European Rocks.       By
     A CORRESPONDENT.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
       Gentlemen,
           some time since Mr. De la Beche's paper On the
       Classification of Rocks appeared in your Journal, I have
 wished to make a few inquiries concerning it; but my time
 having been much taken up during the last three months, I have
 not had an opportunity of doing so before.         With regard to
 Mr. D.'s preliminary observations, it must be confessed by
 every one, that there is no matter in geology of greater im
 portance than the being able to offer a satisfactory answer to
 the question, — Can we in distant countries recognise deposits
 as similar to our own by their organic contents, and consider
 them as established portions of beds in our own quarter?
 which involves the question put by the Baron Cuvier in his
 DiscoursPreliminaire, — " Are there certain animals and plants
 peculiar to certain strata and not found in others?" (Jameson,
 p. 47). Mr. D. considers the subject very forcibly, and not only
  states with truth how little has been yet done towards that an
  swer by observations of the earth's surface, but in great measure
  shows that we must answer it in the negative, if we take into
  consideration the present distribution of organized beings on
  our globe. But can he in accordance with these statements
  agree in the many. instances which we are continually having
  presented to us, of persons first assuming this question as an
  swered in the affirmative from no wider induction than this
                                                             country

190 Observations     on some  Parts ofMr. De la Beche's Paper
country affords, and then, by its means, naming and classifying
strata in accordance with our own, and in fact, absolutely
identifying them with certain terms of our series ?
    A good example of this may perhaps be found in Dr. Buck-
land's paper On the Irawadi River.           We are told that shells
there   found  have  been  identified by   Mr. Sowerby as those of
our   London    clay ; while  we  are left  to conclude  that others
were likewise found which that gentleman could not identify.
We may also, I think, justly infer, that on a more extended
examination of the country, many would be found in the
same " dark slaty limestone," widely differing from any of our
London clay fossils.        Now every geologist will, perhaps,
confess that   " the London clay" presents as narrow a field for
observation as any of our strata, being principally confined to
two small basins in our island ; while the neighbouring one at
 Paris affords an example of the great variance in appearance
and mineralogical details, of an equivalent formation, even
when its organic contents are partly the same. Does it ap
pear, then, scientific, or even reasonable, from two patches of
clay in a small island, as the type, together with a few doubt
ful auxiliaries on the Continent, to affirm positively, — that it
may be considered as now established on the authority of
 Mr. Crawfurd's notes and specimens, that the Burmese country
 contains London clay ? In the same way Mr. Colebrooke is
 represented as having established the occurrence of this bed
 in the N.E. corner of Bengal.        Even if other beds of great
 extent in Europe could be thought recognizable from certain
 fossils in distant parts, of which we may be allowed to doubt,
 surely " theLondon clay," which we cannot show the existence
 of even in the very next basin to that from which it derives its
 name, cannot be discovered with any degree of certainty.           I
 would therefore ask Mr. De la Beche, as a member of the
 Geological Society, present very likely when the above-men
 tioned paper was read, whether, consistently with his state
 ments about temperature and the distribution of animal and
                                                 "
 vegetable life, he can agree in thus assigning the London clay"
 a locality on nearly the opposite side of our globe ? — in a part
 where, unless we uphold the Wernerian theory of beds encir
 cling the earth like the coats of an onion, we must allow the
 probability of depositions having been made perfectly inde
 pendent of those on which we live, if we may not actually con
 clude that they are so ; — in a latitude also, where every ob
 jection made with regard to difference of temperature will hold
  good to a great degree.
      In confirmation of the above, the following passage of
  Cuvier's work (Jameson, page 11) may perhaps be brought
                                                            forward :

               on the Classification   of the European Rocks.       191
forward    :   — " When
                      we institute a more detailed comparison
between the various strata, and those remains of animals which
they contain, we presently perceive that this ancient sea has
not always deposited mineral substances of the same kind, nor
remains of animals of the same species ; and that each deposit
has not extended over the whole surface which itcovered. There
has existed a succession of variations ; the former of which
alone have been more or less general, while the others appear
to have been much less so. The older the strata are, the more
uniform is each of them over a great extent ; the newer they
are, the more limited are they, and the more subject to vary at
small distances.    Thus the displacements of the strata were
accompanied     and followed by changes in the nature of the
fluid, and of the matters which it held in solution ; and when
certain strata, by making their appearance above the waters,
had divided the surface of the sea by islands and projecting
ridges, different changes might take place in particular basins."
Might not Cuvier have had in his mind, at the writing of this
last sentence, the differences observed between the London
and Paris basins ? And ought we then to profess to detect " the
London clay" in the Burman empire ? Far, therefore, from ex
pecting to find the same series of beds in a distant country,
 which exists in our own, should we not rather look for another
 bearing no analogy to it ?— Each bed differing from the one
 of the same probable age in our own series, both from its mL-
 neralogical character being altered more or less by accidental
 circumstances, and its organic contents being those of another
 latitude, which have existed in a temperature and under circum
 stances probably highly different from those of our own climate?
   I  would fain take this opportunity of considering the subject
 more fully, were it not that          I
                                   feel conscious of my inability
 to do justice to      even in the present state of our obser
                        it,
 vations of the earth's surface.       will therefore, for the pre
                                           I
 sent, do no more than offer a few observations on the two first
groups of Mr. De        Beche's classification of our rocks. In

192   Obseivations   on some   Parts of Mr. De la Heche's Paper
of beds of the newest formation, deposited by causes now in
operation, continually going on, such as the tranquil action of
rivers, &c. ; by " the diluvial," a group formed earlier than the
last, ending where it began, the effects of violent and sudden
 inundations.    But will not the latter naturally be somewhat
intermingled    with, and even preceded by, some of the for
mer  ?  for the first of the alluvial deposits will manifestly be
coincident with the commencement of the present state of
our globe (meaning thereby, the effects of the last of the geo
logical revolutions, the one immediately preceding the creation
of the cavern hyaenas and bears), and will therefore precede,
be covered, and perhaps partly destroyed by, the earliest
diluvial catastrophe. Where, then, are the limits of this group
to be found ? Or, how are we to know the one from the other ?
Not surely by the presence of sand, and rolled portions of the
older rocks ; for these we may find among the silty deposits of
any considerable river.     We must in this case confine the di
luvial group to the gravel and boulders on hill-tops and other
situations, not likely to have ever formed part of the beds of
water-courses.     But can these be classed as a distinct group,
formed in all probability at various periods since the com
mencement of the present state of our globe ?            Mr. Vernon
(Phil.  Mag.  and  Annals,   Jan.  1830)  has clearly shown    the oc
currence of alluvial deposits previous to any signs of diluvial ac
tion having taken place : if therefore we retain the terms, and
distinguish, as the latter gentleman does, the diluvial beds by
large stones being present, must we not divide the groups into
three, — antediluvial alluvia, diluvia, postdiluvial alluvia?      Or
perhaps fourth
          a       would   be  necessary, designating   a silty deposit
lying between two gravel beds, if we should ever meet with
such a section as diluvial alluvia.     What is to prevent us from
removing all this difficulty by classing thegroups together, after
the manner of Dr. Fleming in his excellent " Tabular View of
the Geological Epochs" (Preface to " British Animals"), as a
modern group, or by any other name adapted for the purpose ;
signifying in detail, the causes of the very different effects
portrayed in the two parts ? Again, supposing that the al
luvia constitute a distinct group formed since the diluvial period,
as Mr. Dela Beche seems to contend, I think, with Mr. Vernon,
that Mr. D. has very insufficient data before him, for concluding
that man and monkeys first appeared during this epoch. Can a
few caverns and gravel-beds, perhaps inadequately searched, in
one quarter of the globe, and that not the most likely one to
be the burial-place of the human race, render the fact even
presumable ? As Mr. Vernon remarks, the only consequence
that can justly be inferred      is,that these regions of the earth
                                                                were

            on the Classification of the European Rocks.         193
 were not peopled previous to the diluvian epoch. As yet have I
 supposed Mr. De la Beche to be reasoning purely in a geolo
 gical sense, without any reference to the Mosaic account of
 our globe. But taking this into consideration (and        I should
 hope that Mr. De la Beche is willing to consider       it as an in
 spired writing), is it proper, I would ask, in a country like this,
 merely to admit, and that with considerable difficulty, that
 there is no reason why man should not have lived previous to
 the diluvial period, and conclude by saying that the mass of
 evidence is at present against it? evidence purely negative,
 end scarcely able to bear sifting. — On the Continent things are
 in such a state, that before long I have no doubt man will be
 admitted among the number of animals found fossil ; and even
 inour own island, appearances have shown the probability of the
 occurrence of human bones; for in the neighbourhood of our
 most extensive bone-cavern, that at Torquay, many creditable
persons attest the finding of pieces of pottery, flint axes, and
 other works of art, deep in the osseous loam, as I doubt not
 Mr. D. well knows. If such are found, why should human re
mains be absent ? Have we not every reason to conclude that
they are there, until the cavern has been thoroughly examined?
    On this subject, however, we shall probably know more
 when the work proposed to be published by a gentleman there
resident, on the contents of this cavern, appears.
    I am by no means an advocate for bringing geology into
contact with the Bible : on the contrary, I think that for the
present at least they must essentially be kept separate ; and      I
therefore dislike the occurrence of the term "diluvial" in any
system of the science, as continually bringing into view the
 Noachian Deluge, as if geologists assigned it as the cause of all
the gravel and rubbish on the earth's surface:     Yet, as it must
be the wish of every Christian to see the two accounts of the
occurrences on our globe agree (and they no doubt ultimately
will agree), I think it would be better if opinions opposed to
the Divine Record, in parts where it is distinctly expressed,
were omitted, unless supported by a very wide induction of
facts collected from every quarter; and then only mentioned as
true in very qualified terms.     The treatises of Penn, Faber,
and others, show how impossible it is at present to offer the
two in connection: while the "Scriptural Geology" forms a
miserable instance of what ignorance and prejudice can effect
when wandering from the subjects really in debate; it stretches
every expression of the inspired historian further than even
common sense can warrant, and treats the Bible as a full re
cord of science. — I have the utmost respect, no man more so,
for the industry and research which Mr. De la Beche displays

rr*HE       general accordance in the nature and order of suc-
  •*•
       cession  of the strata of the opposite coasts of England
and France, has been demonstrated by several eminent geo
logists. Dr. Fitton has shown that the
                                                   " denudation" of Sus
sex is continued across the Channel into the Boulonnais; and
Mr. De la Beche has traced the oolitic system of the South
of England into the interior of Normandy.                 The object of the
present communication is to make known the appearances ob
servable at a remarkable point of the French coast near Havre,
where the chalk and the beds beneath it are exhibited in a
very instructive section ; and to compare the order of stratifi
cation which there prevails, with the analogous series of En
glish rocks.
     The complete series of the formations beneath the chalk
has been only lately ascertained, and they can be seen together
in very few situations.         In consequence of unconformity of
stratification, the chalk and green-sand are found to rest, in
different situations, on very different members of the inferior
formations. One remarkable example of this kind on the South
coast is explained by Mr. De la Beche, and another is repre
sented in one of the sections which accompany my " Illus
trations of the Geology of Yorkshire."
     But besides the discordance introduced by this want of con
formity in their planes and areas of deposition, considerable
deviations happen in the nature and thickness of the strata be
neath the chalk.       The total disappearance of the green-sand
from the escarpments of the wolds of Lincolnshire and York
shire is probably not due to an unconformity between it and
the chalk, but to a real deficiency of the deposit.
     To illustrate so variable a series of strata, it is desirable to
bring together sections taken in distant places, and to confirm
the order of succession by a careful comparison of the organic
 remains.
     The chalk in the neighbourhood of Havre is the lowest part
of that thick stratum, and is remarkably stored with large black
nodular flints, arranged in parallel rows, at unequal distances,
in some parts closely crowded, while above and below they
are scattered far asunder.
     Organic remains do not appear to be plentiful.                In pro
ceeding from Havre along the shore towards the N.W., we
observe the strata beneath the chalk.            At a small village about

196          Mr. J. Phillips  on the Geology   of Havre.
a mile from the town, clay, full of Gryphaea nana, M. ('., is
due beneath the sand of the beach, for the fabrication of bricks
and hexagonal tiles, which are white within, and only partially
reddened on the surface by the flame passing over them.
    Haifa mile beyond, the chalk hills are separated from the
sea by a buttress of chalk rubble resting on green and ferru
                           I
ginous sands, in which found a shark's tooth, small Terebra-
tula, and fragments of Inoceramus. These materials, in a state
of confusion, lie in the cliff against the sea, upon some of the
lower pale beds of the Kimmeridge clay, alternating with thin
layers of ochrey stone.
    The clay contains abundance of Gryphaea nana, and of an
other small species with striated valves. Some specimens of a
quadrate Serpula, Hostel laria composita?, smooth Terebra-
tula spines and plates of Cidaris, Cucullaea, Amphidesma recur-
vum (Phil.), Trigonia costata, Pholadomya, Isocardia? Te
redo, Inoceramus.
    In the alternating layers of stone we find Rostellaria com
 posita, Amphidesma recurvum, and A. securiforme (Phil.},
 Ostrea gregarea (a coarse variety exactly like one in the co
ralline oolite at Sinnington, Yorkshire), Melania Hedding-
tonensis, M. striata.
    A similar series of stony layers, containing some fossils of the
 coralline oolite formation, occurs near the bottom of the Kim
meridge clay, in North Wilts, and in the Vale of Pickering.
    Further on, these beds rise a few feet into the cliff, and still
lower portions of the blue clay appear, inclosing one continuous
layer of Ostrea deltoidea (Sow.), and beneath this more com
pact clay,with abundance of casts of the shell which he callsMya
depressa. Above all these layers of clay and stone lies a mass of
much darker clay, apparently more sulphureous, with nodules
of argillaceous ironstone, as at Speeton in Yorkshire, but with
out any marks of the Astacidae, which are common there. Upon
this lies a confused heap of brown sand and blocks of white and
greenish sandstone, which have fallen from the neighbouring
steeps, and constitute a sort of underclifF.
    In the steep cliff which rises above this mass of fallen sand
 stones we see the chalk, resting on about thirty feet of green
and gray sand, and this reposing on the uppermost part of
the argillaceous series before noticed.        The line of division
 between the clay and the sandstone is pretty clearly marked,
but that between the green-sand and the chalk is almost ima
ginary.    On close inspection the mouldering surface of the
sand, and the pale hue of its layers of chert, serve to point out
its extent, and to distinguish it from the firmer chalk with
its more decided bands o\Jlint; but at the junction these cha

  198             On the Position ofSaliferous Bocks
    On comparing what is above said with other well-known
 sections of the strata immediately below the chalk, the follow
 ing conclusions appear to be warranted.
     1st, That the green and gray sand of Havre is perfectly
 identical with the green-sand of VVarminster, contains simi
 lar subordinate masses of chert, incloses the same charac
 teristic fossils (Siphoniae, Galerites, Pectinidae, and Terebra-
 tula:)j and lies in the same geological position, immediately in
 contact with the lower chalk.
    2ndly, That the series of strata observable at Havre below
 the green-sand is very similar to the great clay formation of the
 Vale of Pickering in Yorkshire, of which the upper part ap
pears analogous to the gault, while the lower part is decidedly
 Kimmeridge clay, no trace of the Portland oolite or wealden
formation being visible in either district. Whether any por
 tion of the ferruginous sands observed in great confusion at
 Havre belongs to the lower green-sand, I cannot undertake
 to decide.
    Srdly, That the manner in which the fossils are disposed
in the Kimmeridge clay at Havre, is extremely like what
obtains in North Wilts and in Yorkshire ; the shells being
most plentiful towards the bottom of the deposit, and accom
panied by partial layers of stone, which indicate the proximity
of the coralline oolite formation beneath.         As near Wotton
 Basset in Wilts, at Heddington near Oxford, at Brickhill in
Buckinghamshire, at Welton, Elloughton, Malton, Helmsley,
and Kirby Moorside in Yorkshire, the flat oysters (Ostrea
deltoidea, Sow.) lie in a continuous layer parallel to the strati
fication, enveloped in pale blue clay, and unmixed with other
shells.
XXX.        On the Position of Backs in the Geological Series,
    whence the Salt Brine is derived, in the State of New York,
    North America. By A CORRESPONDENT.
  A CORRESPONDENT, adopting                 the signature E. W. B.,
•^*-
       in the Phil.   Mag.  and  Annals   of   Philosophy for July
IS 29, page 75, decides, without personal inspection, and at a
distance of more than three thousand miles from the beds, that
a particular saliferous rock, because it contains brine springs
and cavities of old crystals of salt, " is in reality the equivalent
of the new red sandstone." And he imputes to Mr. Feather-
stonhaugh the error of supposing it to be the old red, on ac
count of the contiguity to each other of the new and old red
                                                          sandstone

                   in the State of New York.                     199
sandstone    in the county of Monmouth.          He then infers that
this (supposed) error casts " a doubt on Mr. F.'s opinion,
that none of the beds which are in England higher in the
series of formations than the coal measures, are to be found
in North America, north of 40° N. lat."
    The details by which Mr. Featherstonhaugh supported his
views of the succession of rocks in North America, in his letter
to Mr. Murchison, read before the Geological Society, Ja
nuary 2, 1829, were necessarily excluded from the abstract
of that paper, published in No. 9 of the Proceedings of the
Geological Society.       But it does not appear in any part of
that abstract, that reliance was placed upon the old red sand
stone, more than upon any other rock, in the table over which
his name is placed, to assert the agreement in the order of
rocks in England and North America, which was the main geo
logical truth of the letter to Mr. Murchison.
    If Mr. F. has fallen into so great an error, then that agree
ment does not exist: and it will be true, according to Mr.
Eaton's Synopsis, that the productive bituminous coal-mea
sures of this continent are found much higher up in the
series than the lias. If E. W. B., as a philosophical geologist,
is prepared to admit this, Mr. F. is not.       He perceives in such
a proposition an utter abandonment of a well-adjusted and
continuous operation of causes, which constitutes one of the
highest and most attractive branches of geological knowledge.
And from this consequence there can be no escape : for the
author of the Synopsis already named, has placed his 3rd
grauwacke above his cornitiferous limestone ; has described
the thin beds of coal lying in it in the State of New York*,
and has advised the boring for thicker beds.          This has not
yet been done in the State of New York, though even the Go
vernment has been strongly solicited to encourage the under
taking.    But in Pennsylvania the coal-beds of this formation
are thicker, and at Pittsburgh the coal lies immediately upon
the rock called Cornitiferous. in the Synopsis.
    If Mr. F. has fallen into this error, he must then contend,
according to the Synopsis, that the lias in North America lies
under the carboniferous limestone; for if any limestone cor
responding in its geological associations, in its extent, in its
mineral and cavernous structure, in its fossils, deserves to be
thought the equivalent of the carboniferous limestone of the
 British islands, then the cornitiferous lime-rock, and the geo-
 diferous lime-rock of the Synopsis, constitute its equivalent

But this must rest upon assertion ; the identity is not so sus
ceptible of proof as that of coal. Coal makes no mistakes. «
  But where are the mineral or fossil characters of the lias of
Europe to be found in the lias of this Synopsis?    It would be
a vain attempt to look for them : nothing can be more dis
similar.   Instead of the calcareo-argillaceous beds with their
marly partings, we find imperfect beds of limestone, and
isolated beds of gypsum, laid in a slaty shale ; and instead
of the Ichthyosaurus, the Gryphaea incurva, the Ammonites
Bucklandi, &c. &c. we have the Trilobite, and never-ending
congeries of Producta and Spirifers.    What is the reason that
the Saurians and other characteristic fossils have not been
found in the State of New York ? We have the true answer
to the question, in supposing the formation not to exist there.
   But this saliferous rock whence the brine is derived, and
which is acknowledged to be subjacent to the pseudo lias; this
must, it would appear, be new red sandstone, because it con
tains brine, and cavities of former crystals. There is nothing
 very extraordinary in crystals of salt being found in muriati-
 ferous earths ; any desiccated salt lake might be expected to
 contain them, and such lakes do not affect particular forma
 tions.   But is it because gypsum and rock-salt are found in
 new red sandstone in England, that the rock which contains
 brine in America must be its equivalent ? For the gypsum of
 the State of New York is found in the lower beds of the car
 boniferous limestone or in the lias, according to the Synopsis,
 and not in the saliferous rock.      The saliferous rock then, to
 vindicate  its claims  to promotion in the series, has to place its
reliance on the brine.       Now suppose that brine were drawn
from a red sandstone on this continent, the equivalent of Mac-
 Culloch's primary red sandstone (and there is such a rock in
 North America), which even alternates with the gneiss, and at
 Suil Veinn    is>
                 horizontally laid upon the highly elevated gneiss.
Would that constitute the rock         new red sandstone?
                                        a                       How
could we account for the brine? And how do we account for
the brine drawn from the transition slates on this continent      ?
At the city of Albany borings have been made more than four
hundred feet into those slates, and perennial source of mineral
                                         a
water has been disengaged, which upon analysis gives 64- parts
of muriate of soda. The celebrated mineral waters too of Ball-
ton rise through the transition slates.    It must also be remem
bered that the analogy entirely fails with the new red sand
stone in Cheshire, since rock-salt has not yet been found in
this part of North America.
    To illustrate still further the true position of this saliferous
rock as  it   iscalled in the Synopsis, E. W. B.        referred to
                                                        is

succession is not peculiar to Kiskeminitas will appear from
the following passage: " In many parts of the western coun
try boring for salt water is frequently continued some hun
dreds of feet (sometimes as much as four hundred feet) below
the surface, through calcareous and sandstone rocks, and oc
casionally through beds of coal*."
    The writer of this paper is by no means so anxious to vin
dicate Mr. Featherstonhaugh's opinions, as to give a proper
influence to facts.       In Mr. F.'s table of North American rocks,
the three great calcareous formations, primitive limestone,
transition limestone, and carboniferous limestone, are in their
proper places in the general series, and with their becoming
associations.      The old red sandstone is found supporting the
carboniferous series, and the coal-measures being the termi
nating formation of the series, (which the Synopsis admits f,)

   t  As to the basalt of the Synopsis, which overlies the 3rd grauwacke,
that is a pure piece of fancy : it has never yet been found in North America
overlying thai part of the series by any one. And as to the rest of the upper
beds of the Synopsis, with the exception of the calcareous clay made by
Mr. F., they are nothing but ordinary diluvial and alluvial matter.

   M.Boblaye furnishes us with the following list of the Fossils
of the North of France : he considers the Gryphaea Cymbium
as most characteristic of the marls and calcareous sands, and
the Plicatula echinata of the ferruginous limestones :
      Ammonites Delonchampi, and many others.
      Belemnites trisulcatus (Blainville), and many others.
      Gryphsea arcuata.                      Lythodomus.
                    Cymbium.                 Modiola.

      Pecten (new species).                  Caryophyllia.
      Ostrea.                                Turbinolia.
   M. Dufrunoy mentions           that near Aubenas a lamellar lime
                           --
stone rests on lias, and contains an abundance of Entrochi.
He also states, that near Uzer the Ammonites are so abundant
as almost to compose the rock: the principal are,
                           Ammonites elegans.
                                          annulatus.
With these are found Terebratula ornithocephala, T. obso-
letn, Modiola, and Unio crassissimus. Near Villefranche, mi
caceous argillaceous beds seem to afford a passage of lias into
inferior oolite ; they contain Gryphaea obliqua, G. Cymbium,
and Belemnites.
   From the above lists we may construct the following table
of organic remains found in more than one of the localities
enumerated ; omitting Gryphsea Cymbium, the only fossil of
the North of France found in either of the other localities.

inferior oolite of Yorkshire, thirteen have been met with in
the other localities ; and of these, eleven occur at Dundry Hill,
seven in Calvados, and one in the South of France.

thirty-two occur in the other localities ; and of these, eleven
are found in Yorkshire, twenty-four in Calvados, and three in
the South of France.

France, five are found in the other localities ; and of these,
three occur at Dundry Hill, one in Yorkshire, and one in the

  Feb. 2. — A paper was read,    entitled The Natural History of
Petrophila, a Lepidopterous genus, in its larva state inhabiting rivers,
and furnished with branchiae. By the Rev. Lansdown Guilding, B.A.
F.L.S.&C.
     Mr. Guilding relates that   the very singular little moth upon which
he establishes    this Genus occurs in myriads, in its larva state, on the
blocks of basaltic trap that occupy the bed of the river of St. Vincent.
Much as it differs in its habits from the majority of Lepidoptera, one
European species he considers to agree with it in its oeconomy, and to
be perhaps referable to the sub-genus which he would separate from
Botyt, which, from the variety of forms in which it abounds, appears
to him to call for division. The types in Mr. Guilding's cabinet which
are most remarkable, and which he incidentally enumerates and
describes, are Gen. 1. Chloephila, Spec. imeolata, found in St. Vin
cent's: Gen. 2. Kamptoptera, Spec.fuscescens, rare, in St. Vincent's :

a  trifling difference in the pupal spiracula and in the shape of the
branchiae.

compact habitation, which, together with the metamorphosis of the
insect, the author minutely describes as well as a small Trichopterous

    A paper was also read On the Functions of the Leaves of Plants.
 By J. H. Dallas, M.D. F.L.S.
    The author states that it is his object to point out the physiological
 relations of leaves, from which the conclusion is drawn, that they are
 the digestive organs of plants. — From the air plant of China and some
others, he infers that the leaves are not merely respiratory organs, but
 organs of nutrition.

    Jan.  15. — William  Parker, Esq. of Albany-street, Regent's Park;
and the Rev. H. P. Hamilton, of Trinity College, Cambridge, were
elected Fellows of this Society.
    A paper was read, entitled " On the Fossil Fox of CEningen, with
an account of the Lacustrine Deposit in which it was found," by
R. I. Murchison, Esq. Sec. G.S. F.R.S. &c.
    The author visiting CEningen in 1S28, acquired among other
organic remains a perfect skeleton of a carnivorous quadruped,
imbedded in a layer of slaty limestone, and the specific character
of which has since    been ascertained through the scientific labours   of
Mr. Mantell.
    A short account is given of the works of the various authors
who have described the fossils of CEningen, from the time of
Scheuchzer to that of Karg.       Cuvier, however, is mentioned as the
first who gave true specific characters to the vertebrated animals of
this formation, and who ascertained that all the mammalia hitherto
discovered in it were " Rodentia."
    The author differing in opinion from an eminent French geolo
gist, who has described this deposit as subordinate to the molasse,
proceeds to show that the formation is exclusively lacustrine ; and
in proof of this, he offers, 1st, a description of the deposit, and its
relations to the surrounding country ; and L'ndl y- a sketch of the
organic remains.
    CEningen is situated about midway between Constance and
Schafhausen, on the right bank of the Rhine, where that river tra
verses the tertiary marine formation of molasse.       This formation is
here covered by patches        of marl  and   limestone,   which extend
over the space of two or three miles, and are now well exposed in
several quarries, the lowest of which is two hundred, and the highest
six hundred feet above the Rhine, and in all of them are found or
ganic remains, exclusively freshwater and terrestrial.        The lower,
orWangen quarries, consist of light-coloured, sandy marlstones, di
                                                                    vided

 vided from each other by thin layers of brown marl, and white slaty
 limestone, in which leaves of dicotyledonous plants, fishes, &c. are
 not unfrequent.      The upper quarries offer a section nearly thirty
 feet deep, and are worked for the extraction of building-stone and
 limestone.    A detail of the beds is given, which shows a passage
 downwards, from brown clay into cream-coloured, indurated marl,
 and afterwards into a fissile, fetid, marlstone, containing flattened
 shells of Planorbes, small Lymnei, Sec., and Cypris : to these succeed
 light-coloured, fetid, calcareous, building-stone ; beneath which is
 a finely laminated bed containing insects, Cypris, shells of Anodon,
 and many plants : then follow two thin bands of fetid limestone, in
 the uppermost of which a large tortoise has been found, and in the
 lower was discovered the carnivorous quadruped.               Both these
 animals were in positions which show that their remains had not
 been disturbed since they first sank down into the silt of the lake.
  The succeeding strata consist of slaty marl, several bands of slaty
 marlstone, limestone, and strong-bedded         building-stone, with a
 repetition of finely laminated layers of marl, including plants and
 fishes, after which the incoherent sandstone of the molasse is
 reached/and forms the base of the quarry.
    A description of the fossil quadruped is then given by Mr. Man-
 tell, who has ascertained its specific character, by first clearing away
 the surrounding matrix, and afterwards comparing the skeleton with
 those of many varieties of the fox. He has no hesitation in referring
 the animal to the genus Vulpes ; but a difficulty occurs in positively
 assigning to it a specific character, owing to the compressed state
 of the head, which prevents the true form of the frontal bone and
 post-orbital apophyses from being determined.        After noticing this
 and some slight variations of structure, which he is of opinion are
 insufficient to establish a variety, much less a species, he concludes
 that the animal bears a closer analogy to Vulpes communis than to
 any other species with which it has been compared.
    The author proceeds to remark upon the existence beneath the
 lumbar vertebrae of the fossil faeces of the quadruped, which on
 being analysed by Dr. Prout, afforded the same proportion of phos
phate of lime as the Coprolites described by Dr. Buckland.         In this
 case, however, the whole of the adjoining rock is impregnated,
 though in a less degree, with phosphate of lime ; thus affording a
strong presumption that the bituminization of the marlstone is due
to the decomposition of the vast quantity of animal matter contained
in it. All the other quadrupeds occurring at CEningen have proved
to be Rodentia: amongst which, the Anoema CEningensis has lately
been figured by Mr. Konig ; and a Lagomys was this year found by
Professor Sedgwick and the author in a second visit to the quarries.
    A synopsis follows of many of the birds, fishes, reptiles, insects,
&c. In the insects there is a strong accordance in generic characters
to those now inhabiting the district.     Mr. Curtis recognizes Formi-
cidEE and Hymenoptene.       Mr. Samouelle has noticed larva of Libel-
lulae similar to our common English spec'ies Libellula depressa, also
the genera Anthrax, Cimex,Coccinelln,CeramI>yx,Blatta,          and Nepa,
                                                                    some

some     of which are known to feed upon such plants as we here find
them associated with in their fossil state, and others are well known
inhabitants of stagnant pools.
    Of the numerous plants, the few the author collected have been
examined by Mr. Lindley, who considers one to be undistinguish-
able from the recent Fraxinus rotundifolia, others strongly to re
semble Acer opulifolium and A. pseudoplatanus ; and a specimen
of the leaf of an extinct poplar, remarkable for its form, has been
named by him Populus cordifolia.
    In conclusion the author infers,
    1st, That the deposit of (Eningen is of purely lacustrine origin,
and that its formation must have occupied a protracted period.
   2ndly, That the tertiary marine formation of the molusse, was
deeply excavated before the lacustrine accumulation commenced.
    Srdly, That, from the intermixture of species undistinguishable
from those now existing, with others which are decidedly extinct,
this deposit must be considered one of those instructive examples
which exhibit a gradual passage from an ancient state of nature to
that which now prevails.
    4 (hi y, That, as it differs in most of its organic remains from all the
fresh-water formations hitherto described, either near to, or remote
from   it,   it must have been an independent deposit and judging;
from its fossils and superposition to the molasse,        it  must have been
of recent origin.
    5thly, That recent as its origin may have been, the lacustrine
basin has since been re-excavated to         a   great depth through hori
 zontal strata of limestone, the highest of which are still seen six
 hundred feet above the present bed of the Rhine.
    6thly, That although the deposit must have been formed long
 before the Rhine occupied its present level, the organic remains
 indicate, that even  in    those days there were insects, fishes, and plants
 almost identical    with  our   own and that among the quadrupeds there
                                    ;
 existed one, undistinguishable from the common fox now inhabiting
 our latitudes.
     Feb. 5. — James Calder, Esq. of Calcutta, and Edward Johnstone,
 Esq., of Trinity College, Cambridge, were elected Fellows of this
 Society.
  A     letter addressed to the Secretary, R.    I. Murchison, Esq. F.R.S.
 was read, entitled, " On the animal remains found          in the Transition
 Limestone of Plymouth," by the Rev. Richard Hennah, F.G.S.
     Thisis   the last of  a   series of communications by the author on
 the same subject; and          this he endeavours to 'classify all the organic
 remains found by him      in in the Plymouth limestone.      In this arrange
 ment there are enumerated several genera of Polyparia, including
  Spongia?, Stylina, Caryophyllia, Turbinolia, &c. several species
                                                           ;
 of Crinoidea, and genera of Conchifera and Mollusca.
     After
         a    detailed description of many species in each of the above
 classes, the author concludes, that as the number of Zoophytes
 bears  a    very large proportion to that of the Bivalves and Uni-
     N.S. Vol. 7. No. 39. March 1830.                 2  E               valves,

    210                      Geological Society.
    valves, the Plymouth limestone must be considered to be one of
    the earliest deposits.   But he states that great obscurity still in
    volves the relative distribution of these animals in their order of
    superposition.
       A paper was afterwards read, " On the gradual Excavation of
    the Valleys in which the Meuse, the Moselle, a"nd some other Rivers
    flow; by G. Poulett Scrope, Esq., F.G.S. F.R.S."
       The paper commences by a remark on the value which would
    attach to a test by which any one valley could be ascertained to be
    the result either of a rapid and violent, or of a slow and gradual ex-
    cavatory process ; since the forces of aqueous erosion are of a
    general nature, and while in activity in one river channel, were
   probably not idle in others.     Such a test has been pointed out by
    the author in central  France, where  lava-currents which have flowed
    into valleys at intervals of time, appear now at different heights
   above the actual river-bed, marking the successive steps of the pro
    gress of excavation.
       The author finds another equally valuable test in the extreme
    sinuosities of some valleys. Any sudden, violent, and transient rush
   of water of a diluvial character, could only produce straight trough-
   shaped channels in the direction of the current, but could never
   wear out a series of tortuous flexures, through which some rivers
   now twist about, and often flow for a time in an exactly opposite
   direction to the general straight line of descent, which a deluge or
   debacle would naturally have taken. Curvatures of this extreme
   kind are frequent in the channels of rivers flowing lazily through
   flat alluvial plains ; and the author shows the mode in which the
   curves are gradually deepened and extended, till the extreme of
   aberration is corrected at once, and the direct line of descent re
  stored, by the river cutting through the isthmus, which separates
. two neighbouring     curves.
       But examples must be infinitely rarer of whole valleys charac
   terized by extreme sinuosity ; because, in the author's opinion, the
  frequent shifiings of the channels of streams tend to obliterate their
  windings, and reduce the sum of the several successive excavations
  or valley to a more or less straight form. Still there are occasional
  instances where the bias of the river, or direction of its lateral force
  of excavation, has remained so constant as to give to the valley it
  self the utmost degree of sinuosity.
      The author quotes the valley of the Moselle between Bcrncastle
  and Roarn, excavated to a depth of from 600 to 800 feet through
  an elevated platform of transition rocks.        The windings are often
  •so extreme, that the river returns after a course of seventeen    miles
  in one instance, and nearly as much in two others, to within a di
  stance of a few hundred yards of the spot it passed before; wearing
  away on either side the base of the ridge-shaped isthmus that sepa
  rates the curves, and inclosing a peninsula of elevated land five or
  six hundred feet high ; but sloping towards the bottom of the curves,
  where it is strewed with'boulders, left there, the author presumes,
                                                                        by

                Royal Institution of Great Britain.                 211
by the river as it gradually deepened its channel and extended its
lateral curvature.
    The valley of the Meuse near Givet, offers, through a great di
 stance, a number of similar windings, and the same thing is seen at
intervals in many of the other rivers of that country.     Parts of the
 Seine below Paris, and the valley of the Wye between Hereford
and Chepstow, are examples nearer home.
    Valleys which like these twist about in the same regular curves
as the channel of a brook meandering through a meadow, can, ac
cording to the author, only be accounted for by the slow and long-
continued erosion of the streams that still flow in them, increased
at intervals by wintry floods.    To attribute them to a transient and
tremendous rush of water in the main direction of the valley, is in
his opinion impossible.    He contends that whilst these valleys were
slowly excavated, other rivers could not have been idle during the
same protracted period ; but will have produced likewise an amount
of excavation proportioned to their volume and velocity, and the
nature of the rocks they flowed over. In the examples quoted,
the rocks are mostly hard transition strata, yet the valleys are wide
and deep.     Where softer strata, as sands, clays, and marls, were
the materials worked upon, the valleys excavated may be expected,
as they are found to be, far wider in proportion to the volume of
water flowing through them. The comparative softness of the ma
terials also, by accelerating the lateral erosion of the stream, will
have multiplied the shifting* of its channel, and reduced their sum
with greater certainty to one average direction.      Hence the deeply
sinuous valleys are only found penetrating the more solid rock
formations.    The author thinks that a certain subdued velocity in
the stream is also necessary to produce this result; and, therefore,
in mountainous districts, where the torrents and rivers are most
rapid, their course is nearly straight; thus confirming the author's
opinion, that extreme curvature of channel can only be produced
by a slow and comparatively tranquil process of excavation.
FRIDAY-EVENING        PROCEEDINGS AT THE        ROYAL INSTITUTION
                         OF GREAT BRITAIN.
   Jan. 22.— On this evening Mr. Faraday gave an illustrated
account of the endeavours lately made by the Chevalier Aldini to
guard firemen from the effects of flames. He first demonstrated the
general principles of flames, then adverted to the peculiar circum
stances and conditions of the flames which arise in the combustion of
dwellings, their lateral and undulatory action, &c. and finally illus
trated M. Aldini's propositions, by exhibiting the apparatus of that
philosopher (who is at this moment in London), and showed the
defence it afforded by exposing a man, guarded by its means, to the
powerful flame of portable gas. The defensive armour consists of a
double clothing of asbestos cloth and wire gauze, and its defensive
power appeared to be very great.         Some magnificent specimens of
                               '_'!•'.-:                       asbestus

212              Royal Institution of Great Britain.
asbestus   cloth, of great strength and very close in texture, were
extended upon the tables.
    An unique collection of specimens of crystallized glass was laid
 out in the library.
   Jan. 29. — Mr. Fordham developed and illustrated a plan which
he has of transferring the power of fixed and cheap first movers to
locomotive carriages, &c. travelling on common turnpike roads. He
considers the power of a steam-engine, moving with the locomotive
carriage, as very expensive when compared to an equal power ob
tained by a large ordinary fixed engine, a wind or water-mill, or
other common first mover ; and conceives, that if the latter could
be transferred to the locomotive carriages, the saving in price of
 power might be far greater than the expense of transference.       His
plan  is to condense air into cylinders, and then to use this condensed
air as the motive force. He pointed out the numerous circum
stances which seemed to be in favour of this plan ; as the diminished
 weight of the locomotive carriage ; the continual diminution of
 pressure as the carriage proceeded; the cheapness of fixed steam-
 engine power, &c. ; not forgetting to estimate the actual draught
 required for a carriage, and the sufficiency of the force he pro
 posed applying in giving that draught.
    A very beautiful portable astronomical arch, by Captain Kater,
was explained in the library by Captain Groves, and also some
 other curious and novel nautical instruments.
    Feb. 5. — Mr. Burnet gave an illustrated account of the oak, and
especially of the naval oak of Great Britain; referring principally
to those circumstances which were connected with its durability or
decay. Numerous specimens of oak of all ages, and from many
ancient buildings and ships, were put together for comparison ; and
also of oak cut at different times and prepared in different ways.
The results of this mass of experience were drawn forth, and, as far
as possible, embodied in a few general conclusions.
   Feb.- 12. — This evening Mr. Ritchie briefly developed the first
principles of electro-magnetism, with the view of setting forth, in a
distinct and practical manner, M. Ampere's proposal of carrying
on telegraphic communication by means of this extraordinary
power.      Of course the principle consists in laying down wires,
which at their extremities shall have coats of wire and magnetic
needles so arranged, that when voltaic connections are made at one
end of the system, magnetic needles shall move at the other. This
was done by a small telegraph constructed for the purpose, where,
however, the communication was made only through a small
distance, the principle being all that could be shown in a lecture-
room.
   Some magnificent specimens of native platina from the Ural
mountains were upon the library table.
   Feb. 19. — A series of remarks on the comparative value of the
water in different kinds of steam-engines, was made by Mr. Ainger.
The use of water, alcohol, aether, condensed gases, &c. were first
considered, with the promise of advantage held forth by their pro
                                                                posers ;

                     Yorkshire Philosophical Society.                     21 S
          ; and the conclusion    arrived at, that water is by far the most
Eosers
   ivourable.    Alter this, the effect of increased pressure          on the
 vapour     was considered,   and   the  probable   advantages   which  might
 be philosophically deduced, independent of practice, were set forth.
     YORKSHIRE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY AND NEW MUSEUM.
 Annual Meeting of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society; and Opening
                              of the Netv Museum.
     The anniversary meeting of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society was
 held Februarys, for the first time, in the Theatre of the New Museum.
     The Yorkshire Museum stands in an enclosure of about three
 acres, part of the site of the once rich and powerful Abbey of St.
 Mary *, which, since the Dissolution, has been the property of the
  Crown, and was munificently granted by His present Majesty in 1827,
  to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society. The venerable ruins of the
  Abbey occupy the north-western side of the enclosure ; the Roman
  multangular tower and ancient city walls separate it from the city to
  the south-east. On an eminence in the centre, the Museum rears its
  noble front, looking down upon the river, and to the extensive land
  scape beyond.      The entrance to the grounds from the city is by a
  Doric gateway, or propylaeum.         On either side of the walk leading
  thence to the Museum, the ground is appropriated to a Botanic
  Garden. The remainder of the enclosure is laid out and planted with
  a view to picturesque embellishment, — and with particular reference
  to the favourable display of the venerable remains of antiquity which
  adorn and consecrate the ground.
     The front of the Museum extends 102 feet, and was designed by
   W. Wilkins, Esq., R.A. On the right of the hall is the library. A
  door on the left of the library leads to the staircase and council-room.
   Directly opposite the front door, corresponding folding doors lead
  into the theatre or lecture-room, a beautiful room, ornamented by six
   Corinthian columns, and four pilasters supporting beams enriched by
  guilloche ornaments.       On the right and left of the lecture-room are
  spacious apartments,      for the collections in geology and mineralogy ;
   the former containing a suite of nearly ten thousand specimens of
   British rocks and fossils, arranged in the order of their position in the
   earth; the latter exhibiting above two thousand minerals, classed
   according to their chemical relations. At the back of the lecture-
   room, and connecting the two lateral rooms, is the museum for
   zoology.
      The chair was taken by the President, the Rev. W. V. Vernon,
   who said, he regretted that he had to apologize for the absence of the
   Archbishop, who would not have been prevented from attending by
   any thing but a severe, though he trusted temporary indisposition.
      He then read the Report of the Council, of which the following is
   an abstract.
      * A highly interesting history and description of this
                                                             abbey, the remains
   of which have lately been excavated, are published by the Rev. C. Well-
   beloved, Curator of Antiquities to the Society, in the " Vetusta Monu-
   incnta," vol. v. of the Society of Antiquaries of London.
                                                                           The

  21 -t            Yorkshire Philosophical Society
    The Council commence their Report by congratulating the Society
 on taking possession of its new premises, and having thus entered
 on a new aera of its existence.
                                    " Hitherto it could only be considered
 as preparing the plan, not as acting the part, of a scientific institution
 for the county of York. It has now that of which all who have
 attended to the history of such institutions, know the importance, — not
 a local only but a visible habitation, and stands forth to open view,
 challenging the public »ye, and satisfying, as it is hoped, the public
 taste, — it calls with confidence on whatever public spirit, whatever
 respect or zeal for science is to be found, within the most extensive,
 the wealthiest, and the most patriotic district in England." After
 noticing the great obligations of the Society to the architects who
 had given it their valuable and gratuitous assistance, and stating
 that the Council had endeavoured          to do justice to Mr. Wilkins's
 designs, by adhering      to them   with  scrupulous fidelity, the Report
 gives an account of the plan contemplated for laying out the garden
 in such a manner as to combine a botanical distribution of the plants
 with a pleasing effect to the eye, mentions the intention of the
 curator* to adopt Decandolle's method of arrangement; and states,
 that by the activity of the sub-curator, lately appointed, 500 plants
 have been obtained ; and that from the liberality to be anticipated in
 these donations, the Society may soon expect to possess a very large
collection of hardy herbaceous plants. — The beautiful specimens of
architectural sculpture displayed in the Museum are then mentioned,
and a hope expressed, that large accessions will be made of other
antiquarian relics.
                         " A depositary for the numerous remains of
Yorkshire antiquities has long been desired, and where can such a
depository be formed with greater propriety than in the capital of this
county, amidst so many existing monuments of ancient grandeur, and
the yet distinct vestiges of successive generations ; and under the
auspices of an institution which will afford, in the increasing stores
of its Museum, the readiest and most invaluable aid to the labours of
the future topographer, as well as to those of the student and historian
of nature. And though there is no part of real knowledge, whether
of art or nature, to which the Society does not wish to apply itself,
yet local information, and whatever relates to Yorkshire, are its prin
cipal objects: — of those objects, in whatever degree its establishment
may be enlarged, it ought by no means ever to lose sight.              Other
collections  within  these  walls will have their use for the instruction of
the student; but as far as the progress of learning or science are con
cerned, intelligence of the district to which we belong, is our proper
study, and our most useful pursuit." — Several instances are then
noticed of the attention of the Society to subjects of local research,
as in Mr. Rankin's account of the discovery of a Roman road on the
Wolds ; in Mr. Phillips's excellent'illustrations of the geology of our
coast, which have been the means of communicating to distant
countries the information to be drawn from the Society's collections ;
and in the investigation of a very remarkable deposit of fossil bones
on Mr. XVorsley's estate, near North Cliff: it is added, that at the
                  * The Rev. William Hincks, M.A. F.L.S.
                                                                       same

                           and New Museum.                           215
same time more      general inquiries have not been neglected, and that
the Society's    cabinets have been enriched from every quarter, par
ticularly by   the contributions   of Mr. Marshall, Mr. Stapylton, and
Mr. Strickland. — The Report next announces that Mr. Phillips will
deliver, during the present year, a course of lectures on the C Economy
and Organization of Animals ; and the Curator of Botany (the Rev.
Mr. Hincks) has offered to favour the Society, in the months of May and
June, with eight lectures on that science, the profits of which will be
appropriated to the garden fund.
    The accounts of the Committee are arranged under six heads • the
first of these includes the total expenditure of the main building
(6860J).    Under the second head is placed the expense of the lodge
and entrance gates, the boundary walls, and outbuildings. The third
comprises the repairs of the ruined Abbey, the excavations carried on
to trace the old monastic foundations, the making of the roads and
walks, and the formation of the garden. The furniture of the Mu
seum, and the new cases prepared for the reception of specimens,
form the fourth head : and under the fifth and sixth are classed the
claims of the former occupiers, printing and other miscellaneous ex
penses. The sum total of the expenditure on all these heads is nearly
9800J.,— a sum greater indeed than had been anticipated, but not
greater than was necessary to do justice to the plan of a County
Museum, and to fulfill the wishes of the subscribers. The sum which
is in hand to answer that demand, is about 8300/., thus leaving
 a debt of 15002. ; a debt which, the Report adds, will undoubtedly
 prove a heavy incumbrance, if means cannot be devised of paying it
off. " We may indeed go on ; but let the meeting consider in what
 manner we shall go on as respects the character and utility of the
institution. We may go on, giving a salary of GO/- a year to the
keeper of the Museum — and would any member of the Society wish
to retain his services on such inadequate terms ? We may go on —
but with an unfurnished laboratory, and with a library to which the
naturalist and the antiquary might refer in vain. We may go on — but
we must leave it to others to explore, even in our own county, the
 mysteries of Nature, and to collect the monuments of Art."
    From the Treasurer's Annual Report, which was laid before the
 meeting, it appeared, that during the last year the receipts amounted
 to 528J. 4s. ; and the expenditure to 499/. 9s. Id. ; leaving a balance
 in the hands of the Treasurer of 281. 14*. I Id. ; which, added to 731.
 arrears due from members, leaves 10 1/. 14s. lid. in favour of the
Society.
    It was then moved by Sir George Cayley, and seconded by W.
 Marshall, Esq. that the warmest thanks of this Society are eminently
due to the Rev. W. Vernon, for his uniform zeal in the execution of
 his arduous office as President of this Institution, but more especially
for his indefatigable exertions in founding and completing this
 Museum.
    The Resolution was carried with great applause.
    The President, in returning thanks to the Meeting, said, that the
 Institution had risen to its present flourishing state by the combined
                                                                exertions

216                 Yorkshire Philosophical Society
exertions of many persons whom he had the pleasure of seeing
assembled    in that room ; and of none more than of those friends
whose kindness had so much amplified the services which he had
rendered to the Institution.      For himself, " he had only," in the
words of Bacon,
                    " taken upon him to ring a bell to awaken better
spirits than his own." Whatever exertions he had made for the esta
blishment of the Society, were founded upon fixed principles; upon
the opinion, that such societies were eminently serviceable to the
advancement of knowledge ; and upon the conviction, that the ad
vancement of knowledge is of the most real and practical importance
to the best interests of mankind. He considered the promotion of
science as the highest kind of charity, because science is the parent of
all those arts which minister to the supply of human wants ; and if a
man has any wish to do good, how couhl he do it so extensively as by
promoting the sciences on which those arts depend ? Every one, he
said, saw the utility of supporting a hospital, and it was surprising to
him that every one should not also see the utility of supporting those
sciences from which hospitals derived the power of doing good. The
most powerful remedies for the alleviation of human suffering were
the inventions of experimental philosophy, — chemistry. The great dis
covery of the circulation of the blood, on which so much of the. treat
ment of diseases depended, was drawn by the philosophical mind of
Harvey, from the analogy of the valves of the veins with the mechan
ism of a hydraulic engine.     He considered the promotion of science
also as one of the most pqwerful methods of promoting religion ; and
he had formed this opinion, not only from the obvious tendency of the
contemplation of nature to fill the mind with religious impressions,
but also from historical facts. That there was sometimes such an
anomaly as an irreligious philosopher was true ; but any one who
examined the history of human opinions accurately, would find, that
the times in which there was least science, had been those in which
both superstition and atheism flourished most.           In proof of this
assertion, he cited some remarkable statements of Petrarch in the
fourteenth century, and of Mersenner upon the rise of philosophy, in
the sixteenth century.
   The President then read a paper On the History and Influence of
Literary and Scientific Institutions, tracing them from an early period
to the present time, and remarking on their merits and defects. The
                                                             "
following were some of his concluding observations: — I wish the
national Society in the metropolis of Great Britain for the important
work of the advancement of human knowledge, were such in its esta
blishments and resources as to be worthy of such a country as this ;
and I wish that all such Societies were founded on the plan of the
New Atlantis in respect to one of its most essential principles, a
principle which the Royal Society at its first institution was unhappily
obliged to relinquish. One of the greatest defects in the state of
learning remarked by Bacon was this ; — that the sciences had never
possessed a whole and entire man.      He thought it ' necessary to their
progression, that those who are to generate and propagate them
should be placed in such a condition as may content the ablest man
                                                                       to

                            and New Museum.                            217
to appropriate his whole labour, and continue his whole age in that
function and attendance; otherwise/ says he, 'if the fathers of
sciences be of the weakest sort, or ill maintained, etpatrum invalidi
                                               ' There will
referent jejunia nati:' to which he adds,                    hardly be any
main proficiency in the disclosing of Nature, except there be some
allowances for expenses about experiments, whether they be experi
ments relating to Vulcan or Daedalus, furnace or engine, or any other
kind; and therefore as secretaries and spials of princes and states
bring in bills for intelligence, so you must allow the spials and in
telligencers of Nature to bring in their bills, or else you shall be ill
advertised.' Now this defect has not been supplied in the constitution
of the Royal Society, or of any of the Societies which have been since
formed in England ; in them the sciences have still, for the most part,
no more than fractions of men. In saying this, I do not mean to
undervalue the labours of those who unite scientific pursuits with the
active business of life.     I do not forget, that the very author of the
remarks I have quoted, lived himself in the full tumult of human
affairs, and was at once the first philosopher and the most consum
mate speaker and comprehensive lawyer of his day.           I wish, indeed,
it were enough considered, that men may contribute very usefully to
philosophy without taking the name of philosophers. I wish it were
fully understood, that philosophy itself is after all no more than an
ignorant child capable of gaining instruction from the commonest
observations, and being improved by the slightest hints : but how are
these scattered lights to be concentrated, if there be no one whose
business it is to collect them ? How can we expect any great or uniform
progress in the most arduous of all business from gratuitous services
and broken time ?       In thus noticing, Gentlemen, the defects as well
as the merits of other societies, it has been my object to deduce from
this experience the path which we ought ourselves to pursue. To a
great metropolitan institution the point of which I speak is only
a question of a greater or less degree of vigour ; to us 1 am per
suaded it is a question of life or death. The edifice, indeed, in which
we are now for the first time assembled, seems to promise us some
kind of perpetuity ; all the fortunate circumstances with which we are
surrounded are so many pledges of permanence ; but whether it shall
be a perpetuity of honour, and a perseverance of utility, or whether we
shall be obliged in the issue to own that we have abused the favour of
the Crown, and wasted the money of the county, depends in my opinion
principally on one thing, on our allowing or not allowing liberal
salaries to the scientific servants of the Society, such salaries, that is,
as will enable them to devote their whole time to the objects of the
Institution.    It is not the mere arrangement of a Museum, or the
care of a Garden, which is to be provided for by such a Society
as this, — the materials for a natural history of Yorkshire should be
collected, its antiquities investigated, its arts and manufactures
examined, and the principles of science applied to their improve
ment. There is also a philosophical correspondence to be maintained;
there are scientific foreigners to be received ; there are inquiries of
    N.S. Vol. 7. No. 39. March 1830.                     2 F       students

218                    Yorkshire Philosophical Society
students to be answered ; lectures are to be delivered, original ob
servations are to be made, and experiments devised. Not, indeed,
that the whole of the labours should be devolved on the salaried
officers, but that all which must be necessarily left defective by
their more occupied coadjutors may* be supplied, and the Institution
kept uniformly moving towards its intended objects."
   Mr. Phillips, the Keeper of the Museum, then enumerated the
donations which had been received since the last meeting.                One of
the most attractive parts of the large display of donations accumu.
lated in one month, was the collection of bones of antediluvian
quadrupeds discovered on the property of W. Worsley, Esq. at
Bielbecks,      near Northcliff.      Of these important reliquiae, Mr.
Worsley has determined to present a selection to the cabinet of the
Society, already rich in such evidence of the ancient condition of
the earth. Placed beside the similar series from the caves of Kirk-
dale, Banwell, Kent's Hole, and Plymouth, they will afford to every
visitor of the Yorkshire Museum, the means of studying the
structure and habits of the lion, hyaena, elephant, rhinoceros, and
other gigantic animals, which formerly inhabited our island.
   The DINNER was attended by upwards of sixty gentlemen. After
which many animating addresses were delivered, from which we
select the following:
   The Chairman. — The toast I am going to propose to the present
company, is one to which I hope we shall all contribute as much as
is in our power.         The prosperity of the Yorkshire Philosophical
Society you heard much about in the morning; and no doubt we
all feel great satisfaction at having built the Museum.               It will be
recollected, that when Gresham College was pulled down to build
an excise office, nobody cared either about the lecturer or the lec
tures ; they were transferred to a little room, over the Royal Ex
change, and hurried over, to an audience consisting of very few
persons : and thus the Institution, which was founded by that
liberal citizen Sir Thomas Gresham, in the reign of Henry VIII.,
and which had produced many of the most renowned scientific
                                                        —
professors, such as Briggs, Wren, and others, has dwindled into
insignificance.     I   hope   that the  reverse   will be  the case with this
Society   ;  and  that  the building  of  the Museum     will be the means of
giving  to  it increased   efficacy and  energy.   Gentlemen,    I beg to give,
" Success to the Yorkshire Museum."
   The Hon. E. Petre rose, and was warmly greeted. — In proposing
the health of my reverend friend, (and proud am 1 to call him so,)             I
am sure it will be drunk with the respect it deserves.            If we look at
him in the various situations he fills ; if we look at him as the
Christian minister ; if we look at him as the patron of science, — we
shall find him in all actuated by the same well regulated zeal, the
same spirit of true benevolence.         I like to see the clergy come for
ward, and support every thing having for its object the extension
of knowledge ; for it shows to me, as it must to every sensible man,
that they are influenced by a desire to promote the welfare of their
species.     You all know the rapid progress which knowledge is
                                                                        making

                                and New Museum.                                       219
 making through this kingdom; you all know how the people are
 making great strides in the acquisition of knowledge ; and it behoves
 every man to promote the diffusion of knowledge in every way
 which his humble abilities will permit.           Gentlemen, I will not de
 tain you any longer.       Iwill only express     the  great gratification with
 which I appear before you this day, as the humble instrument for
making a proposition I know will be so acceptable.                 It is the first
 opportunity       Ihave  had   of  showing    my respect      for my reverend
friend; and I hope he will not think that my feelings are the less
sincere, because I now so imperfectly express them.
    The Chairman rose, and as soon as he could obtain a hearing from
the cessation of the applause with which he was received, he said — I
had undoubtedly the greatest reason, in the morning, to blush at hear
ing the very flattering manner in which           I was taken notice of by my
friend on my left; and I have reason now to be overwhelmed by feel
ings it is difficult to express. I am well aware that the compliments ex
pressed are far greater than any exertions of mine can demand ; but
lam not the less grateful for the feeling.kind, and affectionate manner
in which my health has been proposed, and in which the meeting re
ceived what my friend has been pleased to say of me ; I am not the less
delighted to find, that my exertions, whatever they may have been,
are satisfactory to this meeting.           But it is a maxim of common
prudence     to  remember,    " quid  valeanthumeri,      quid ferrerecusent."
I am not so much elated by applause, of which I have reason to be
proud, as not to know that, although in the infancy of the Institu

trate of this city, The Hon. Edward Petre, — which was received
with great applause.
    Mr. Petre in returning thanks, expressed his earnest desire to be
a  supporter of every scientific institution in the city.
    The Rev. D. R. Currer proposed the health of Sir George Cay-

    Sir G. Cayley said, — Mr. President and Gentlemen, thank you in
                                                               I
the name of the Mechanics' Institute, for the honour you have con
ferred upon us.        The Mechanics' Institute          ahumble sister of the

    220                 Yorkshire Philosophical Society
    with respect to each other, as cause and effect, and each mutually
     aids the progress of the other. I am sorry to say, that though no
     minally the President of that Society, I aro, in fact, from my distant
     residence, the most inefficient member it has.           I am glad, however,
     to  know    that   our   virtual  and real President   (the Rev. C. Wellbe-
     loved)    is  here.    I  shall  call upon   him to  give us the particulars
     of the present state of the Institution. 1 may observe, gene
     rally, that I am aware, that there is a divided opinion as to the
     utility of such societies ; and that many hold a conscientious opi
     nion, that is adverse to them. There seems to be a fear that they
     may induce the lower orders of society to become too cunning for
     their rulers ; — surely society cannot be so constituted by Him who
     called us into existence, as to become too wise for itself.         Even our
     Philosophical Society has not escaped without similar aspersions,
     and those from very high quarters ; but I do not perceive that we
     are getting too wise at all. I cannot but believe that the best basis
     on which to build up the security of the British Government, is on
     the solid information and good sense of the people, and at the same
     time it forms the best security for the safe administration of the t! o-
     vernment.       Man is a social animal ; when alone he is weak and
     helpless,   but  in combination becomes invincible. Almost every man
     has some mental perfection in conjunction with many deficiencies,
     but when called together in such a society as the Mechanics' Insti
    tute, for mutual instruction and assistance, the best powers of each
     are brought to bear upon the concerns of all, and many centuries
     of experience in their united ages are made available towards the
     common stock. To the powers of combined effort we owe the valu
    able Institution we are now met to celebrate ; without         it, all the ma
     terials for science would have been scattered unclassed and useless;
     so beautifully and so surprisingly however are interwoven the laws
     of creation, that out of these individual deficiencies arise most of the
     endearing ties of life.        Had we all been perfect in our powers, and
    each as capable as the other in every particular, we should not have
     perceived the necessity of mutual assistance, and would never have
    experienced all that series of friendly exertion, gratitude, and affec
     tion, which flow from this source. But have already said too much
                                               I
     on this subject;  I    will only occupy your attention for few moments
                                                               a
    longer,  in   mentioning that we have lately discovered, at the depth
    of four feet of alluvial deposit, within the basin of the extensive an
    tediluvian lake which Dr. Buckland conceived to have flowed nearly
    up to the cave at Kirkdale,     a      Roman sword of brass in the most
    perfect preservation,   a       human jaw with the teeth perfect, and     a
     copper coin of Hadrian, all within    a     few feet of each other, at the
    same depth, and resting upon the bed of gravel which seems to have
    formed the real bottom of this lake.       I     mention the circumstance,
    because as     is
                  it     the fashion now to find human bones, and works of
'
    human hands, in company with antediluvian quadrupeds,                (two in
    stances in France and one in Germany,      )I      wish to guard against any
    false impression injurious to Dr. Buckland's very satisfactory theory
    —a morass with occasional floods will account for the case.

    Sir J. V. B. Johnstone the President, and Mr. Dunn the Secre
tary, of the Scarbro' Society, returned thanks, on their healths
being given.
    Dr. Belcombe.— Mr. Chairman, I beg to give you the health of
a gentleman who has been already alluded to, and whose name has
only to be mentioned to be received with enthusiasm — the Reverend
C. Wellbeloved.
    Mr. Wellbeloved. — If my name is connected with the York Me
chanics' Institute, it is my duty to acknowledge the honour : for I
do feel honoured by my connection with that Institution, under our
admirable President, who is always present with us in spirit, though
we regret that he is frequently absent in person. We have a very admi
rable bust of him in the room where we hold our meetings, which al
ways reminds us of him ; at thesame time fve are sorry that we have
only his bust. When the York Mechanics' Institute was set on foot,
 I took an active part in promoting            am proud that
                                                 it.   I          did so       I           ;
for  it   is
           avaluable Institution, and am convinced that its tendency
                                             I
is  good.     was told in .the outset, that
               I                                should do great deal of

have heard nothing of — of nothing approaching to it.

to the investigation of subjects interesting to all human beings                          :

 carry home with them, to read by their firesides; instead of being
 induced to seek for recreation in the haunts of idleness, and
amongst idle companions.         Since the commencement of this bene
 volent Institution,    have seen nothing else arising from
                        I                                           and as     it

 will not fall into those false  and erroneous opinions to which allusion
 was made in the morning.          By instructing them, and cultivating
 their minds, we shall preserve them from the arts of Carlile and
 others, who go about the country to induce the ignorant and un
 informed to embrace their erroneous and dangerous doctrines.              I
 can see no objection to such Institutions ; and I am happy to say,
 that not only Sir George Cayley, but our worthy President himself,
is enrolled amongst the members of the York Mechanics' Institute ;
 and I wish such examples were more generally followed.             If, Sir,
 (addressing the Chairman)       all in a similar rank   to yourself would
act as you do,     and  those  who   support you, —  if they would employ
their advantages in the same manner, there would be no danger of
 their ever           overtaken by their humbler brethren ; they will
              bein^
always keep     their station ; and however long the spur may be in the
toe of the mechanic, it will never reach the heel of the aristocracy.

 and J. Atkinson, Esqrs. — the gentlemen who laid the foundation of
the Museum by the valuable donation of those splendid remains
 which were found at Kirkdale.
    The Chairman gave the health of Mr. Smith, the Father of En
glish Geology.
    Mr. Smith returned thanks ; and said, he could truly say with
Mr. Atkinson, that nothing gave him greater pleasure than the pro
motion of science, and particularly in assisting this Society ; for
he had been very handsomely received in this county, where he had
now been a resident many years. He had always endeavoured not
to be behind in the March of Intellect ; and had early habituated
himself to habits of reflection and of combination ; and this was*
the best way to acquire useful knowledge. — He then gave, at some
length, an account of the progress of his discoveries ; the origin of
which he Bated about forty years ago, when he was employed in
superintending canals and coal mines, and in surveying land, in the
west of England ; and concluded by returning thanks for the ho
nour the company had done him.
f Mr. Phillips,      This toast was drunk with very great applause.
    Mr. Phillips rose to acknowledge the honour done him ; and
after returning thanks to the President and company, he said — I
cannot but think of the day on which I first arrived in York.           On
entering the rooms, I found a small collection, but great zeal
among the members ; and though I did not then expect to be in
any peculiar manner connected with the Society, I was sure its
exertions must be successful : and when I was afterwards appointed
to the situation I now hold, I expected to derive great pleasure
and advantage : that it would enable me to follow pursuits in which
I  have always delighted ; and bring me in contact with individuals
much my superiors in talents and in opportunities; — these hopes
have been fulfilled, and more than fulfilled.           The years I have
spent in York have been years of great pleasure and of great in
struction ; and I am gratified that my lot has fallen amongst those
whose object is to cultivate knowledge, and todiil'use it wide as the
                                                                    winds.

            health is spared me, I hope to fill the office in which I
am placed to the satisfaction of the Society.    It has placed in my
hands great means of instruction ; and from the extraordinary kind
ness and vast assistance      have   I
                                    received from all persons with
whom I have been connected, I feel that much is demanded of me ;
                         I
and I declare that will, as much as in me lies, discharge my duties
with a view solely to the interests of the Society.    I do feel, how
ever inadequate may be the expression of those feelings, great gra
titude for the manner in which I have been received, by the mem
bers generally, and by the officers of the Society particularly and
individually; and I trust that my actions will not disappoint their
good opinion of me.

     3. Observations made with u sextant of Dollond and a reflecting
 circle of Troughton, for ascertaining within what degree of accuracy
 these instruments would give the latitude of a known station, by
 Capt. Basil Hall, R. N.
     At the request of Mr. Henderson, who was desirous of ascertain
 ing the degree of accuracy to be expected from nautical instruments,
 Captain Hall undertook a series of observations to determine the la
 titude of the Calton Hill Observatory.              The instruments used were,
 a sextant by Dollond, of 11 inches radius divided to 10", the tele
 scope magnifying eighteen times; a reflecting circle by Troughton,
  10 inches diameter, divided to 20", with three verniers ; and an arti
 ficial horizon by Dollond.           The time was taken from a half seconds'
 chronometer by Molyneux, compared before and after the observa-
 tions with the transit clock.
     The latitude of the Calton Hill Observatory, as determined by
 Mr. Henderson from the data of the Trigonometrical                      Survey, is
 55°57'19",5.
    The computations were made by Mr. Henderson from Schuma
 cher's Hulfstafeln, and no observation rejected.

contradict most satisfactorily an opinion that the Edinburgh Observa
tory is unstable or liable to tremors. Though the hill was covered

   4. On the longitude of the Armagh Observatory, as determined by
transits of the moon and moon-culminating stars, by Dr. Robinson.
    This method of determining the differences of longitude between
two distant places is superior to nil other methods in ease and sim
plicity, and would seem to be scarcely inferior in accuracy when ;i
considerable number of observations is employed.            Ever since the
annual lists of moon-culminating stars have been published, Dr.
Robinson has regularly observed them, partly to furnish correspond
ing observations for other astronomers, and partly to confirm and im
prove the longitude of Armagh, determined by his predecessors.            He
was thus led to notice a source of error perhaps not sufficiently at
tended to, and to adopt a correction which he conceives will add to
the accuracy of the results to be obtained.
    It is well known that telescopes give different diameters of the
heavenly bodies, which appear too large in small and inferior instru
ments. When such are used, the transit of the moon's first limb
will appear too early, and that of the second too late ; whence, as
the stars are wholly unaffected, the longitudes deduced from observa
tions of a single limb will be erroneous to between twenty and thirty
times this spurious increase of disc, compared to the disc shown by
the standard telescope of comparison.         This error may be easily
eliminated when an equal number of transits of each limb can be
obtained, but this is obviously impossible in most cases, and incon
venient in all.
    The quantity of this optical defect, as it respects the sun, is easily
ascertained for any telescope, by comparing the diameter as given
by his transit with that given in the Ephemeris, or by the standard
transit telescope.  Sixty observations of both limbs gave the solar irra
diation of the old Armagh transit compared directly with the Green
wich transit +0',14, and compared with that of Dublin +0',32.
    Using these comparative solar irradiations respectively as an ap
proximate correction for the lunar irradiation, Armagh was found to
be west of Greenwich, —                                              m    s

lunar irradiation may be obtained, generally, by multiplying the solar
 irradiation by 1 •? *.
    In 1827 the new transit was put up at Armagh, and the solar irra
diation was found, by seventy-four observations, to be +0s,0l com
pared with Greenwich, and +05,19 with Dublin, through the data
of the Nautical Almanac; whence the comparative lunar irradiations
would be respectively +0S,02 and +0',32, on the preceding hypo
thesis.     With this correction, the longitude of Armagh was found

 the   oldf.

 squares, and the probable errors are also given

      ELECTRICAL FORMATION OF CRYSTALLIZED SULPHURET.
          NY chemical compounds which occur in the bowels of the
         earth, may also be produced in the laboratory ; and there are
some others which may also be obtained artificially, but not crystal
lized as they'occur in nature.
    M. Becquerel has attempted to supply the deficiency which existed
in this branch of science, and to furnish geology with the requisite
facts to explain their formation. It results from his labours, that
what was required in the apparatus of chemists to enable them to
emulate the products of nature, was the influence of electric forces
acting with slight tension and in a continued manner.
    • This greater irradiation of the moon
                                               may be owing to her greater bril
liance, and to the sympathy excited in the adjacent portions of the retina.
Dr. R. finds that the lunar irradiation is much less in the day-time. During
the winter months, the dark limb of the moon might probably be observed
with powerful telescopes, and the irradiation determined.

     In a memoir which M. Becquerel has read to the Afcademy, he has
 given an account of experiments upon the crystallized metallic sul-
 phurets, beginning with that of silver. The apparatus employed con
 sisted of two glass tubes, the lower part of which was filled with
very fine clay slightly moistened, with a fluid conductor ot electricity.
 In the upper part were poured the fluids, the reaction of which upon
 each other and upon the plate of metal, one end of which was placed
 in each of them, occasioned the electrical effects requisite to produce
 the compounds.       The two tubes were placed in another which con
 tained a fluid to establish a communication between them.       In order
to obtain the sulphuret of silver, a saturated solution of nitrate of
silver is put into one of the tubes, and a saturated solution of hydro-
 sulphuret of potash in the other, and the ends of a plate of silver is
placed in both of them.      That which is in contact with the nitrate, is
soon covered with metallic silver j whilst at the other, which is the po
sitive pole, water and sulphuret of silver are formed, and the latter
combines with the sulphuret of potassium.       This double sulphuret is
gradually decomposed by the action of the nitric acid, which takes
place slowly, because in chemical decompositions effected by electrical
 forces of slight tension, the oxygen goes first alone to the positive
 pole, and the acid follows afterwards. Sulphuret of potash is formed ;
 the sulphuret of silver is developed and crystallized in beautiful small
octahedral crystals, the appearance of which resembles that of the
crystals of the same substance found in silver mines.
    The crystallization of the sulphuret of silver is owing to the very
slow decomposition of the double sulphuiet, which gives the mole
cules time to effect the oscillatory motion necessary for similar faces
to react upon each other, according to the laws of crystallization.
    Sulphuret of coppe^ perfectly resembling the natural compound
may be obtained by the same process. Oxysulphuret of antimony or
kennes is procured in small octahedral crystals of a deep brownish
red colour, nnd in laminae.      As to the sulphurets of iron and zinc,
which decompose readily by the .siinultnn'unis action of air and water,
it is necessary to employ certain precautions to prevent this decom
position. M. Becquerel has however succeeded in obtaining very
small cubic crystals of sulphuret of iron, of a yellow colour, resem
bling that of pyrites. The iodides, the bromides, and crystallized
metallic seleniurets may be obtained by the same process.         The io
dide of lead is in brilliant yellow octahedral crystals ; that of copper
has a similar form, but a different colour.
    M. Becquerel concludes from these results, that it is probable that
nature has adopted a similar process in forming natural sulphurets ;
and he explains how the phenomena may operate at the instant of
the consolidation of the masses. — Le Globe, Nov. 4, 1829.
    Without in the slightest degree questioning the accuracy of the
above    detailed experiments, I may be allowed perhaps to doubt
whether the inferences deduced from them are perfectly correct; for
there are facts on record which prove that sulphuret of iron, in cry
stals, may be formed via fiumida. In the Phil. Trans- for 1/98, there

is an account by Mr. Wiseman of the formation of pyrites in the
Mere of Diss, a piece of water containing a vast quantity of mud de
rived from the streets of the town, where it has been accumulating
for ages. Mr. Hatchett, who examined both the pyrites and the water
in which it was produced, remarks that " to Mr. Wiseman's obser-
rations we are much indebted, as they make known the recent and
daily formation of martial pyrites, and other ores, under certain cir
cumstances. It is not to be supposed," he continues," that such effects
are local, or peculiar to Diss Mere ; on the contrary, there is reason
to believe that similar effects on a large scale have been and are now
 daily produced in many places. The pyrites in coal mines have, pro
bably, in great measure thus originated."        Mr. Hatchett makes other
 and similar observations, which it is not requisite that 1 should copy.
    Another instance of the recent formation of sulphuret of iron from
solution is detailed by Mr. Pepys in the Transactions of the Geolo
gical Society, vol. i. p. 399. Observing some oily matter and hairs on
the surface of a solution of sulphate of iron which had remained un
 disturbed for about twelve months, he poured off the solution, and
 found " at the bottom of the vessel a sediment consisting of the
bones of several mice, of small grains of pyrites, of sulphur, of cry
stallized green sulphate of iron, and of black muddy oxide of iron."
 Instead then of supposing that electricity had any share in the pro
duction of this effect, 1 agree entirely with the observation of Mr.
 Pepys, that "these appearances may with much probability be attri
buted to the mutual action of the animal matter, and ihe sulphate of
iron, by which a portion of the metallic salt seems to have been en
 tirely deoxygenated." — H. P.
              SIR HUMPHRY DAVY AND DR. WOLI.ASTON.
    The following eloquent and accurate estimate of the powers of the
above-named illustrious and lamented philosophers, is given by Dr.
 Henry in the Preface to the eleventh edition (just published) of his
excellent work, The ICIemenU of Experimental Chemistry: — a work
which we again strenuously recommend to every cultivator of the sci
 ence of which it treats.
    " It is impossible to direct our views to the future improvement of
this wide field of science, without deeply lamenting the privation,
which we have lately sustained, of two of its most successful culti
vators, Sir Humphry Davy and Dr. Wollaston, — at a period of life,
too, when it seemed reasonable to have expected, from each of them,
a much longer continuance of his invaluable labours.         To those high
gifts  of nature, which  are the characteristics of genius, and which con
stitute its very essence, both those eminent men united an unwearied
industry and zeal in research, and habits of accurate reasoning, with
out which even the energies of genius are inadequate to the achieve
ment of great scientific designs. With these excellencies, common
to both, they were nevertheless distinguishable by marked intellectual
peculiarities.    Bold, ardent, and enthusiastic, Davy soared to greater
heights ; he commanded a wider horizon ; and his keen vision pene
trated to its utmost boundaries. His imagination, in the highest de
                                                                      gree

gree fertile and inventive, took a rapid and extensive range in pursuit
of conjectural analogies, which he submitted to close and patient com
parison with known facts, and tried by an appeal to ingenious and
conclusive experiments.        He was imbued with the spirit, and was a
master in the practice, of the inductive logic ; and he has left us some
of the noblest examples of the efficacy of that great instrument of
human reason in the discovery of truth.            He applied       it,
                                                                   not only to
connect classes of facts of more limited extent and importance, but
to develop great and comprehensive laws, which embrace phenomena,
that are almost universal to the natural world. In explaining those
laws, he cast upon them the illumination of his own clear and vivid
conceptions; — he felt an intense admiration of the beauty, order,
and harmony, which are conspicuous          in  the perfect Chemistry      Na  of
ture — and he expressed those feelings with
    ;                                                  a  force of eloquence,
which could issue only from        a mind of the highest powers, and of the
finest sensibilities. — With much less enthusiasm from temperament,
Dr. Wollaston was endowed with bodily senses of extraordinary acute-
ness and accuracy, and with great general vigour of understanding.
Trained   in   the discipline of the exact sciences, he had acquired                 a
powerful command over his attention, and had habituated himself to
the most rigid correctness, both of thought and of language.           He was
sufficiently provided with the resources of the mathematics, to be en
abled to pursue, with success, profound inquiries in mechanical and
optical philosophy, the results of which enabled him to unfold the
causes of phaenomena, not before understood, and to enrich the arts,
connected with those sciences,         by   the invention of ingenious and
valuable instruments.       In   Chemistry,    he was distinguished         theby
extreme nicety      and delicacy    of his  observations   ;   by
                                                                the quickness
and precision with which he marked resemblances             and discriminated
differences ;   the sagacity with which he devised experiments, and
anticipated their results     ;  and the skill with which he executed the
analysis   of fragments    of   new   substances, often so minute as to be
scarcely perceptible    by  ordinary    eyes.    He was remarkable, too, for
the caution with which he advanced from facts to general conclusions                 ;
a caution which,   ifit  sometimes prevented him from reaching at once
to the most sublime truths, yet rendered every step of his ascent                    a
secure station, from which         was easy to rise to higher and more en
                                  it
larged inductions. — Thus these illustrious men, though differing essen

composed under circumstances of interrupted attention, a few errors
have crept into the text, towards which 1 must request the reader's
indulgence.    In that section I have endeavoured to extract, from a
mass of conflicting testimony, the most probable evidence of the two
generally admitted species of phosphureted hydrogen gas, consider
ing the third variety as of too doubtful existence to be reasoned upon
as a definite compound.     The experiments of Dumas, of which I have
given an account, have been recently repeated by M. Buff, in the
laboratory of M. Gay Lussac.      So far as respects proto-phosphureted
hydrogen, the results of Dumas were fully confirmed, especially that
 100 volumes require 200 of oxygen gas for saturation.       But in the
combustion of per-phosphureted hydrogen with oxygen, some differ
ences were observed.      This gas (containing from 13-5 to 14-5 per
cent of impurity), when heated in a graduated glass vessel, deposited
phosphorus without any change of volume, and, though it lost its
spontaneous inflammability, continued to be absorbable to the same
amount by solution of sulphate of copper. Besides being decomposed
by keeping, its composition appeared to be varied by the degree of
heat used in its production, so that we can never be sure of having
it twice alike. Heated in contitct with copper, each volume expanded
to 1*5 j mixed with three volumes of carbonic acid it burned com
pletely both with oxygen gas and with air, without leaving any trace
of phosphorus.     In the quantities of oxygen consumed by the com
bustion of a given volume, great and unaccountable variations were
observed, the lowest being 204, and the highest 270 volumes of
oxygen, to 100 of the per-phosphureted gas.
   " Both gases agree in giving 1-5 volume of hydrogen from each vo
lume, when decomposed by antimony, zinc, potassium, or bi-chloride
of mercury ; as well as in being absorbable by sulphuric acid, sulphate
of copper, and chloride of lime. — The following Table, which 1 have
compiled from various authorities, exhibits the two species in contrabt
with each other.

    " The  results of the combustion of both gases conspire, therefore, if
correct, to prove that the proportion of oxygen in the phosphoric acid
is to that in the phosphorous as 10 to 6, or 15 to 9, which arc the
same proportions as 5 to 3.
    " From a review of the compounds of hydrogen and phosphorus, 1
am disposed, however, to abide by the opinion expressed, vol. i. p. 465,
that more facts are wanted to decide the constitution of these gases.
The facility of obtaining the proto-phosphureted hydrogen in a state
of purity, the uniformity of its composition when first evolved, its per
manency when long kept, and its uniting constantly with the same
proportion of oxygen, point out that gas as a true chemical compound.
Whereas, the variable purity of the per-phosphureted species, its
change of constitution by mere standing, and the uncertainty as to
the proportion of oxygen required for its combustion, show an insta
bility of composition, which is inconsistent with the characters of a
true chemical compound.
    " The equivalent number for phosphorus, however, as derived from
the composition of either species of phosphiireted hydrogen, does not
accord with the relative weight of that substance (viz. 12), deducible
from its compounds with oxygen.           The nearest approximation to the
 number attained by the latter method is 10-5917.             Multiplied and
 more correct experiments will, it is to be hoped, reconcile these in
 congruities.''
 ANALYSIS OF SILICEOUS MINERALS BY ALKALINE CARBONATES.
    The ready fusion, observed by M. Berthier, of many atomic mix
 tures of salts, may be applied to the analysis of siliceous minerals by
 alkaline carbonates, aided by a spirit-lamp. A mixture of five parts
 of carbonate of potash and four parts of carbonate of soda is so fusible,
 that between 200 and 300 grains maybe rendered perfectly liquid by
 a spirit-lamp flame.     If sand be added to the mixture, there is an
 effervescence    as lively as if an acid had been added.            This effer
 vescence occasions the expulsion of part of the substance ; and by
 the addition of too much sand, the mass would become too difficult of
                                                                          fusion,

  fusion, unless the sand. or mineral had been previously pulverized
  and mixed with the carbonates.           Hence the operation should com
 mence with the mixture of the carbonates and the mineral.            In this
  manner considerable quantities of felspar may be readily decomposed
 by the heat of a spirit-of-wine lamp. — AnnalenderPhysik,\828. Royal

 EXAMINATION          OF SOME     MINERALS.      BY M. VICTOR HARTWALL.
     Fcrgusonite.  — This mineral,      named in honour of Robert Ferguson,
 Esq. of Raith, occurs near to Kikertauvak, not far from Cape Fare
 well, in Old Greenland.            On account of its near resemblance to
 Ytestantalite, it was referred to that species, until Haidinger, by a
 careful survey of its crystals, proved it to be a new species.        Being
 analysed, it afforded the following constituent parts:

     Manganesian Epidote or Pistacite. — The mineral found at St.
 Marcet, in Piedmont, and known to mineralogists under the name of
 Manganesian Epidote, was referred to the epiaote genus, on account
 of its series of crystallizations.
     This mineralogical determination it was desirable to have confirmed
 by chemical analysis ; and further, chemists were curious to know the
 particular state of oxidation of the manganese and iron which it con
 tains. The following is the analysis of M. Hartwall :
                     Silica                           38-47

                                                     100-27
    M. Hartwall infers      by the calculation of the result of the analysis,
 that the manganese and iron occur in the mineral in the state of
 peroxide. This is proved, not only by the diminished quantity of the
isomorphous alumina along with them, but also by the reddish-brown
colour of the mineral.
    Pyrophillite, a new mineral- by M. R. Hermann of Moscow. —
This mineral occurs in the Uralian Mountains, and is known to
mineralogists under the name of Radiated Talc.             But its relations
before the blowpipe are different from those of indurated talc.
 Heated before the blowpipe, without any re-agent, it divides in a
fan-shaped manner into a swollen mass, which occupies twenty times

the space of the original specimen.      The pounded mass is quite in
fusible. If heated in a glass retort, there condenses in the upper
part of it a water which does not attack the glass, and which on
evaporation leaves no silica.    Soda dissolves the mineral, with effer
vescence, into a clear yellow glass.   Phosphoric salt dissolves it into
a colourless glass, leaving a siliceous skeleton. It acquires a blue
colour with solution of cobalt. By these characters the mineral is well
marked, and is distinguished from talc, particularly by its relations
with solution of cobalt, its aqueous contents, and its fan-splitting by
heating. Subjected to analysis it yielded :

on exposure to heat. — Jameson's Journal, Jan. 1830.
           IMPROVEMENT IN THE SMELTING OF IUON.
    Heated air for blast furnaces has been used for some time at the
Clyde Iron Works, and with great success. Experiments have proved
that iron is smelted by heated air, with three-fourths of the quantity
of coal required, when cold air, that is air not artificially heated, is
employed for that purpose, while the produce of the furnace in iron is at
the same time greatly increased.   All the furnaces at Clyde Iron Works
are now blown with it. At these works the air, before it is thrown
into the blast furnaces, is heated 220° of Fahr. in cast iron vessels
placed on furnaces, similar to those of steam-engine boilers.       It is
expected that a higher temperature than 220° will be productive of a
proportionally increased effect.   But this is a subject of experiment.
It is supposed that this improvement will accomplish a saving in the
cost of the iron in Great Britain, to the amount of at least £200,000
a year. — Ibid.
       NEW VEGETO- ALKALIES OBTAINED FROM CINCHONA.
  Dr. Serturner, in    re examining the products obtained by chemical
means from the cinchonas, finds that the precipitates produced by
alkalies from the acidulated infusion of these barks contains, besides
cinchonia and quina, other vegeto-alkalies, which are to be considered
as modifications of the former.      The new bodies recall the case of
opium to the mind, in which narcotine exists simultaneously with
morphia. The new substances, and especially that named by M.
Serturner chinio'idia, exist in the alkaline precipitate in intimate com-
bination with a resinous subacid substance, which is not injurious,
but is of no advantage. It is very difficult to separate these two sub
stances, and M. Serturner succeeded only when he used the charcoal
obtained when croconic acid is prepared by Liebig's proce; s. This

 substance, combined with animal charcoal, completely decolours the
 solution of the alkaline matter in sulphuric acid (diluted with three or
 four pints of water) j but it is necessary afterwards to act on the
 thick solution with alcohol, to separate earthy salts.
    The new vegeto-alkalies exist in the red and yellow cinchona with
 the quina and cinchonia. The chinioidia hus more alkaline power
 and capacity of saturation, and also more medical power, than any
 other vegeto-alkali in the cinchona ; but it resembles them by its
 insolubility in water, its colour, and taste. Its alkaline reaction on
 known vegetable colours, and its intimate state of combination with
the brown extractive matter, are remarkable. Its salts are very fusible
 by heat, and become viscid like some balsams.
    According to M. Serturner, in febrifuge power, chinioidia is as
 superior to quina and cinchonia as these are to ordinary bark. It is
 to this alkali that many cinchonas are indebted for their medical
 powers.     M. Serturner has, in many cases, given his new medicine
 in doses of 2 grains three times per day.      The patients take a little
 vinegar after each dose, for the. purpose of saturating the gastric
juice, which by its alkaline nature would else decompose the salt.
 From 1 2 to 24 grains have, in all cases, sufficed to prevent the return
of the fever ; whilst patients in the same neighbourhood, treated with
the sulphate of quina, had frequent returns of the disease. — Hufeland'*

                 PROCESS FOR PROCURING BROMINE.
    According to M. Lowig, the following is an advantageous method
 of preparing bromine:— He evaporates the mother water of the
salt springs of Kreutznach, in large iron vessels, to one-third of its
 original quantity, and allows crystallization to take place for some
 days.   He decants the supernatant liquor, dilutes it with water, and
 adds sulphuric acid until no further deposition occurs : he then strains
 the liquor, presses the residue, and evaporates it to dryness. The
 remaining matter is dissolved in an equal weight of water : by this a
great quantity of insoluble sulphate of lime is separated : it is then
                                                                  distilled

distilled with oxide of manganese and muriatic acid. Excess may be
added, as there is no danger of forming chloride of bromine.
   M. Lowig does not perfectly agree with M. Balard as to the
specific gravity and boiling point of bromine. Thus, according to
M. Balard, the sp. gr. is 2-966 ; while M. Lowig finds it to be 2'98
to 2-99 at 59° of Fahr. and its boiling point he bas ascertained to be
11 3° instead of between         1 16° and 1 17° Fahr. — Journal de Phannacie,

                            COMPOUNDS        OF IODINE.
   M. Serullas       has lately read a memoir to the Academy              of Sciences
 " On the action         of different acids upon the neutral lodate of
 Potash," &c. &c.
   The following are the principal results -.—That there are two
i«dates of potash ; the first is produced by the imperfect saturation

of chloride of iodine with potash; it   is a crystalline double com
pound, which being separated and crystallized, gives the bi-iodate
of potash.
   The other iodate results from the action of one of the following
acids on the neutral iodate of potash : — the sulphuric, nitric, phos
phoric, muriatic, and silicated fluoric ; or it may be obtained di
rectly by treating a great excess of iodic acid with potash.
   During the incomplete saturation of chloride of iodine by potash,
a double compound is formed of chloride of potassium and acidulous
iodate of potash, in definite proportions.
   No such compounds as acidulous iodate or chloro-iodate of soda
exist. Davy's process of obtaining iodic acid by the oxide of chlo
rine and iodine may be advantageously replaced, by that of preci
pitating the soda from the iodate by means of silicated fluoric acid.
   M. Serullas has also discovered a process by which iodic acid is
obtained abundantly and well crystallized. It consists in treating a
solution of iodate of soda with an excess of sulphuric acid.      The
mixture left to spontaneous evaporation gives in a short time pure
crystals of iodic acid. The sulphate of potash formed and the
excess of sulphuric acid remain in solution. M. Serullas concludes
from his researches, that the double acids designated by Davy iodo-
sulphuric, iodo-nitric and iodo-phosphoric, do not exist ; and he
attributes Davy's mistake to the small quantity of materials which
he employed in his experiments, and their being made only once. —

    General Observatioiu.—The weather this month has been very cold, ge
nerally cloudy and humid, with frequent heavy fulls of snow, which be
tween the llth and 20th appear to have been unprecedented.                   Here
the moats and marshes were ice-bound till the 23rd, and the houses
and ground most of the time covered with snow ; but the ice was rugged,
from the snow-water having frozen upon it. It snowed more or less on
fifteen days, and the whole depth upon a plane surface was sixteen inches ;
but forty or fifty miles inland the depth exceeded four feet, and in several
dales in Gloucestershire and Somersetshire it was found the square of that
number in depth, in consequence of the great drifts from off the hills, which
rendered the roads impassable for nearly two days, till passages for the
coaches, &c. were cut through it. In the night of the 18th snow fell here
seven inches in depth; but assuming its specific gravity at one-tenth the weight
of water, the quantity received in the rain-gauge on being dissolved, gave
eight inches in depth ; the snow, however, was very moist and adhesive,
and weighed down the branches of short trees and shrubs to the ground.
A remarkable circumstance accompanied this heavy fall of snow, namely, a
depression of 1-05 inch of mercury in the barometer in twenty-four hours,
notwithstanding the wind blew very strong from the N.E. most of the time.
                                                                              The

           Meteorological Observations             for January         1830.          239
   The maximum temperature of the external air on the 17th was five de
grees below the freezing point, and the minimum temperature in the night
of the 18th was fourteen degrees below that point.
   There was a recurrence of hard frosts and snow on the last three days,
and the 31st was the coldest day since January 14th, 1820: the mean tem
perature of the twenty-four hours- for each of these days was only 20-5 de
grees.
   It appears from various published reports, that the cold in the South of
France and in Spain has long prevailed, and been more severe than has
been experienced there for a great number of years; but that in Scotland
and places in a higher north latitude, although they have had very deep
snow, yet it has been found comparatively mild for a winter like this;
therefore the rigour of the frosty air seems to have been confined within
the parallels of fifty-five and thirty-eight degrees of north latitude, with
prevailing North and North-east winds from over the continent of Europe.
Ireland being within these parallels, it is curious that its inhabitants should
at the same time also have enjoyed a mild atmosphere.
   The mean temperature of the air at this period is l°-44 lower than that
of any month during the last fourteen years ; nor has there been so long
a continuance of severe frosts since the winter of 1813 and 1814.
   The atmospheric phenomena that have come within our observations
this month, are, one lunar halo, and four gales of wind, or days on which
they have prevailed ; namely, one from the North, two from the North
east, and one from the South-east.

                      JAMES IVORY, Esq.         M.A. F.R.S. $c.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
 T HAVE to request you will insert, in your next publica-
 •*•
      tion, the few lines which follow, relating to the figure of the
earth, on which I have formerly written in your Journal.            It
is not my intention to add any thing new on this subject, but
merely to state briefly what              I
                                     have contributed to the theory,
and to assert my claim to my own proper notions.
     1st,   Ihave shown the insufficiency of Clairaut's theory, as
it is universally taught and applied, for finding the figure of
equilibrium of a homogeneous planet supposed fluid.
     The reason of the insufficiency              is,
                                            that the theory inadver
tently neglects     the  attraction between   certain portions of the
fluid, and by this means omits to take into account pressures
               in the interior of the mass and vanishing at the sur-
Srevailing
   ice, which cannot but have an influence on the figure of
equilibrium*.       This remark alone overturns all the arguments
that have been urged against me in the foreign journals.
But,    if the objections brought forward in these works fall to
     * Clairaut demonstrates the equilibrium      from the single consideration
that the whole force at every point of the outer surface       perpendicular to
                                                              is
the surface.    Besides the perpendicularity of the whole force to the sur
face, Maclaurin's demonstration essentially requires certain properties pe
culiar to the ellipsoid.   How are the two demonstrations to be reconciled   ?
The answer        that Clairaut omits the internal pressures have alluded to
                is,                                           I              ;
and when the inadvertence        corrected, the two modes of reasoning will
                                     is
agree, or rather will be identical.    Yet the property of the ellipsoid, which
is essential to Maclaurin's reasoning, has been said to be accidental, and
not necessary.

 the ground, the use that has been made of them in this coun
 try, and persisted in for so great a length of time, by men who
 certainly advanced nothing of their own to apologize for their
 conduct, can never be repaired, whether it be considered in
 point of real injury, or as harassing the feelings of one with
 whom they had no pretence to interfere in the inexcusable
 manner they have done.
     2ndly, The true conditions for the equilibrium of a homo
 geneous planet in a fluid state, deduced a priori from the
 principles of hydrostatics, without neglecting any cause tend
 ing to change the figure of the fluid, are given, for the first
 time, in the Phil. Trans, for 182*.
     I do not pretend that no faults can be found with the inves
 tigation I have there given, although the faults are not of great
 moment.      I know well that, in following my original ideas, I
 have not succeeded in reducing the reasoning to the utmost de
 gree of simplicity, as will appear from the work I have in hand,
 which will speedily be published.        It is very probable too,
 that, in writing hastily and under great irritation, I may have
 fallen into some inadvertencies in answering objections not
 easily disentangled without going back to the first principles
 of the equilibrium of fluids, the theory of which is incorrectly
 laid down, as far as this problem is concerned.       But I appre
 hend there is nothing in all this that will appear very extra
 ordinary to those who judge candidly, and are acquainted with
 the progress of scientific discovery.      Are all former writings
 on this problem perfectly correct?      And what are all the ob
jections, without exception, that have been urged against me ?
 The solution of the problem      I have published is perfectly ex
act : and, although no part of the celestial mechanics has
been more copiously treated, the only way in which the dif
ficulties that occur can be overcome, has escaped the pene
tration of every geometer from the time of Clairaut, in 1743,
to the latest publication on the subject in 1829.
    One objection has been brought forward, which, as it may
operate against my intended publication, ought now to be rec
tified and removed.     I allude to a note published in the Phil.
Trans, for 1826. I am persuaded that the author of the note
is now convinced that it is founded on misapprehension. And
as the Royal Society has given publicity to the note, it is not
too much to expect from its justice that it will be induced to
reconsider the matter.      The subject   I  press upon its atten
tion has always remained the least satisfactory part of the
system of Newton, and the part in which the least improve
ment has been made ; and, if we may judge from the interest
which other scientific societies have taken in the research, we
                                                               may

               Mr. Ivory    on the    Figure of the Earth,              243
may expect that it merits some regard from that learned body,
by which no important point of the philosophy of Newton can
ever be deemed indifferent or unfashionable.              If
                                                        new informa
tion be wanted, I engage to produce demonstrations that will
bring the question to a perfect decision, as soon as                I
                                                                 know
that a proper use will be made of them.           This will only put
me to the trouble of transcribing part of what I have written.
   Srdly, Maclaurin demonstrated that a homogeneous planet
supposed fluid, is in equilibrium when it has the figure of an
oblate elliptical spheroid of revolution ; and he investigated the
equation of the surface of the spheroid.        D'Alembert, in ex
amining    this equation,  discovered  that it admits   of more than
one solution; and it is now well known that the number of
solutions is two, and no more. It is therefore a mathematical
deduction from the equation of Maclaurin, that the same mass
of fluid, revolving with the same angular velocity, will be in
equilibrium in two different figures.         But there must be a
physical   reason  that determines  the number    of figures of equi
librium : and this reason must be a part of a solution of the
problem d priori.        Accordingly, in examining the forces in
action in the interior of the mass, which forces are entirely
omitted in the usual manner of solving the problem, I found
that two different sets of surfaces may be traced within the
fluid, each of which is possessed of the property of the level
surfaces in Clairaut's theory, that        the intensity of pressure
                                              is,
is the same at all their points.     The two sets of interior sur
faces have different relations to the outer surface, and one set
only can properly be called level surfaces.        The definition of
the level surfaces given         Clairaut
                                by           exact only in one par
                                                is
ticular case of the equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid entirely
at liberty ;  and no other definition has ever been thought of
 by  any geometer.
   ••Hhly,  When the difficulties respecting the equilibrium of
a homogeneous fluid are overcome, the same principles are
easily applied to a heterogeneous fluid.       In this latter case the
equation of the surface cannot be found in a finite expression,
but   itmay be determined to any required degree of approxi
mation.      Clairaut solved the problem long ago, retaining only
the first power of the ellipticity.      have already published in
                                           I
this Journal*,   a solution which takes in the second power of the
oblateness, by a method which leaves no doubt respecting the
equilibrium of the fluid, and which requires no more than the
labour of calculation to extend to any power of the oblateness.

cause they overcome a difficulty insuperable in any other way,

by superseding much of the abstrusest and least satisfactory
writings on the celestial mechanics. My only object in what
I have written is to assert and prove my claim to what    have      I
discovered, by my own labour, in spite of much unprecedented
opposition.    I put myself in comparison with no one ;       will      I

  have the justest title to claim; nor do think it necessary at
present to explain particularly the reasons .that have induced
me to write this letter.
   It may be proper to add that the subject of this letter has
no connection with another contestation, entirely mathemati
cal, relating to the series for computing the attraction of sphe
roids.    I remain, Gentlemen, yours, &c.

XXXV.      On the Blue Colouring-matter of Lapis Lazuli, and on
artificial Ultramarine. By Dr. FR.W. SCHWEIGGER-SEIDEL.*
HPHE      mineral colour known by the name of Ultramarine,
-*•
      esteemed for its beauty and durability, especially in oil-
painting, has long been an object of chemical inquiry. The lapis
lazuli, from which the colour is obtained by careful washings,
is procured from Asia (partly through the East Indies, partly
by way of Orenburg), where it is found in Little Bucharia,
Thibet, several provinces of China, and Siberiaf. It seems to
have been known to the Romans under the name of Sapphire,
as appears from some passages of Pliny^.        But the produc
tion of ultramarine seems not to have been invented till the end
of the fifteenth century ; the name of Axurrum ultramarinum
 (the origin of which is very evident) is said to have been first
used in the year 1502 by Camillus
                                          LeonariusJ.    It once
 formed a considerable article of trade in Italy, where this co
lour was probably first produced, and even now the greatest
 quantity, and that of the best quality, comes from there.

     This is different from the- lazulite or copper lazure (Armenian stone),
which owing to the similarity of their colour used formerly to be mis
taken for it ; hauyn seems to be more nearly related to lapis lazuli.

Whether it be in consequence of a lessened demand, and con
sequent diminished manufacture since the discovery of prussian
blue, and other cheaper blues, or in consequence of a dimi
nished importation of the lazure-stone, that this colour has
become    so very scarce, this much is certain, that its high
price (an ounce of the best quality being said to sell now at
from one hundred to two hundred francs*) has greatly limited
its use ; whilst formerly, especially in the sixteenth century, it
was almost wasted by painters, as is proved by many pictures
of that period.
   The value of the colour naturally led to a desire of pro
ducing it artificially.    Some assert, that the art was known in
the sixteenth century, but kept secret.     But this probably im
plied only  the  art  of obtaining ultramarine  of the best quality
from the Jazure-stone. What are called artificial lazure-stones,
for the production of which there are many formulae-)-, are in fact
artificial pieces of glasses coloured with some metallic oxide
(mostly oxide of cobalt), which will of course yield no ultrama
rine.     Indeed the colour oflapis lazuli was generally ascribed,
until lately, from the results of chemical analyses, and according
to analogy, from a metallic oxide (oxide of cobalt, copper, iron,
&c. supposed to be contained in it). Wallerius derives it from
silver:):, which, however, has not been found by any modern
chemist, and which was probably only believed to be it through
a well-known mistake usual in former times. The common opi
nion, however, was, that the blue colour of the mineral was
produced by oxide of copper, until it was shown by Marggraf,
that the lazure-stone contained oxide of iron only, and no
oxide of copper §. It was his analyis which gave the first ex
planation of the component parts of this stone ; for the ac
counts of Rinmann and Cronstedt are not sufficiently defined.
 Klaproth's subsequent analysis || generally confirms the re
 sults of that of Marggraf, except that he points out a portion
 of alumina which the latter overlooked ; for the rest, he also
 inclined to the opinion that the blue colour was produced by
 the oxide of iron.    It was Guyton de Morveau who first drew
 public attention to a portion of potash contained in the lazure-
 stone, and which he thought accidental, but considered that it

             Dr. Schweigger-Seidel   on the Blue Colouring-matter
was chiefly the sulphur it contained which, combined with the
iron, produced the colouring matter of the stone*. This view,
however, was refuted by Clement and Desormes, who proved
that the ultramarine contained sulphur, but no ironf; which
conclusion was confirmed by the experiments of R. Phillips,
on the methods of ascertaining the degree of purity of the
ultramarine^. Clement and Desormes at the same time men
tioned a considerable proportion of soda in the ultramarine,
which also seemed to contain some potash §. These two che
mists, however, express no opinion as to the cause of the blue
colour.   Thenard, indeed, does not deny the possibility of a
coloured body being produced by the combination of colour
less bodies, but adds that the loss of 0'8 per cent, experienced
by MM. Clement and Desormes in their analysis, might
lead to the supposition that it was just the colouring substance
which had escaped them||.        Phillips expresses the opinion
that the lazure-stone perhaps owes its colour to a peculiar
substance not metallic, and recommends this part of the sub
ject to the attention of chemists If.
    With this difference of views on the nature of the colouring-
 matter in the la/ure-stone, scarcely any result could be ex
pected from the experiments instituted for producing ultra
 marine artificially; indeed they were all unavailing.     An in
 teresting  accident, however, had led  to a probable hope of the
 result ultimately turning out advantageously.       M. Tassaert,

naces for soda, in the foundation of               it,

as long  as the hearth  had  been built of brick, and not of sand
stone as  it was then, he had never noticed*. Vauquelin on ex
amining this substance found      greatly to resemble the lazure-

stone, and the analysis also indicated alumina and silica united
with soda and sulphite of lime, but at the same time with iron
and sulphuretted hydrogen, from which latter components in
connection with alkali Vauquelin felt inclined to deduce the
blue colour of this substance as well as of the lapis lazuli                   f.
Soon after L. Gmelin examined a volcanic product thrown
out by Vesuvius, which Breislak (in his Voyages dans la Cam-
panie) mentions as a seventh kind of lazulite, and which was
afterwards classed by Bruun Neergard with the hauynf.
Nevertheless this mineral seemed to agree in its external cha
racters more with the lapis lazuli than with the hauyn, which
induced L. Gmelin to repeat the analysis of lapis lazuli at
the same time, and to compare the results of these analyses
with those he had recently obtained from the chemical investi
gation of the hauyn        The result was, that the blue volcanic
                            §.
product above mentioned had in reality        great similarity with
                                                         a
 the lazure-stone even in its chemical composition. But the same
observation was also applicable to the hauyn, which seemed to
differ from the lazure-stone, essentially, only by      proportiona
 ately great quantity of sulphuric acid, and                 by
                                                     its containing
 potash instead of the soda found in the lazure-stone. The lat
ter, however, was also the case in the blue volcanic mineral,
by which the latter seemed again more closely related to the
hauyn than to the lapis lazuli, or at least to form an interme
diate link between the two minerals.      This induced L. Gmelin
 to arrange the lazuli, containing soda, with the hauyn, contain
 ing potash, as species or subspecies nearly allied, but to con
 sider the blue mineral, under the name of earthy hauyn, as
 a mere variety of the common, called granular hauyn.             In
 other respects the volcanic product differs from the two other
       According to verbal communication of Dr. W. Weissner, the admi

mical process.    Perhaps we ought also to add to this the blue colouring-
matter which at times dyes the calcined potash a beautiful lazure blue,
and which has been usually attributed to metallic oxides or finely divided
carbon.

would not have been disinclined to take the colouring principle
for protosulphuret of iron, had not Clement and Desormes
shown that there is no iron in the ultramarine.
    Almost at the time when Vauquelin's and Gmelin's inves
tigations of substances resembling lazulite* (which evidently
were indebted for their existence to chemical processes nearly
related,) raised the possibility of an artificial production of
ultramarine almost to a certainty, without, however, giving
any clear explanations respecting                it,

    By the communication of some experiments on the fuming
sulphuric acid, which were published in the year 1815 in this
(Schweigger's) Journalf, Drebereiner developed his views on
the composition of sulphur, as consisting of hydrogen and a
probably metallic body (sctrwefelstaff), whence he felt inclined
to deduce the blue colour of Vogel's blue sulphuric acid. " And
if," concluded this able chemist, " the colour of the pure sul
phureous substance       really blue, the colour of the ultramarine
                              is
seems to be solely produced by this substance; and that from
potash or soda, sulphur, silica and alumina, under certain con

beautifully clear, may be produced,       have shown a year ago to

     We cannot conclude this review more suitably than by      a ver
   bal transcript of the following account from the Berliner Hand
   und Spener'sche Zeitung, (10th April 1828,) No. 8t, and which
   in substance seems to be from the distinguished inventor
   himself.
      " Tubingen. — Prof. C. G. Gmelin, who for some time past
   has been employed in the investigation of ultramarine, has
   arrived at the conviction that sulphur is its colouring principle,
   and particularly that there is no metal, properly so called, en
  tering into its composition.      Gmelin had received some ultra
  marine from Paris eighteen months ago, but which, according
  to the opinion of M. Seybold, the artist at Stuttgard, was
  not of the best quality.      In order, therefore, to obtain ultra
  marine of all kinds, and to determine by strict analysis what
  proportions of its component parts are most favourable to the
  production of its fiery colour, he addressed himself months
  ago to Prof. Carpi at Rome. During a short residence he made
  in Paris, in the spring of 1827, he expressed it as his opinion
  to the chemists of that metropolis, especially to M. Gay-
  Lussac, that ultramarine, with the investigation of which he
  told them he was then engaged, might be produced artifi
 cially.    It is perhaps, therefore, his own fault if another (M.
  Tunel of Paris, who wishes to keep his discovery a secret) has
 anticipated him in this respect.        The process by which, ac
 cording    to M.  G.'s inquiries, the  production of ultramarine is
 always successful, is the following : — Procure silica containing
 water and alumina; calculate how much a given weight of
 these earths will leave after being calcined.          (By Gmelin's'
 investigations 100 parts of hydrous silica contained only 56,
 and 100 parts of hydrous alumina only 32-4 parts of pure
 earth.)     Next, dissolve as much of the hydrous silica as can
 be dissolved in caustic soda, and calculate the quantity of
 earth used.       Add now to 72 parts of this silica, (calcu
 lated as free from water,) 70 parts of alumina (also calcu
 lated in a state free from water) ; add the latter to the sili
 cate of soda, and let it evaporate, stirring it all the time till
 the residue presents a damp powder.           (One may also take at
once 60 parts of dry caustic soda to 72 parts or alumina ob
tained from alum, the latter being reduced to the dry state.)
This colourless mixture of silica, soda, and alumina, is the
foundation of the ultramarine, which is to receive its blue co
lour.     For this purpose, melt in an earthen crucible, well
closed, a mixture of two parts of sulphur and one part of an
hydrous carbonate of soda, and when the mass is properly
melted, throw very small portions of the first mixture at once
into the middle of the crucible : as soon as the effervescence

      is   of  an equal intensity,  the most fiery ultramarine (and
this     a very important circumstance) may be obtained by

        by the analysis,        cannot be formed, without

     5*

that the artificial production here mentioned may be usefully
varied, but this can only be discovered by experiment."

     It will at once be observed how very little the lists of or
 ganic remains enumerated at the different localities agree with
 each other. Unfortunately we have no good detailed and pub
 lished lists of fossils in the rocks under consideration, either
 in our midland or southern counties ; but as Mr. Conybeare's
listsf are principally compiled from these parts of England,
 I  shall employ them, though by their general nature they do
not exactly enter into the object of these notes, adding those
fossils that have appeared hi Sowerby's Min. Conch, since the
publication of the "Outlines."
     The additions to Mr. Conybeare's lists are, for the cornbrash,
 Mytilus sublaevis, Isocardia concentrica, Pecten annulatus, and
 Perna quadrata; — for the Stonesfield slate, Patella lata; — and
for the Bradford clay, Terebratula coarctata, and Serpula tri-
angulata. The additions to the list of great oolite fossils are
considerable ; the following are all from Ancliff in the environs
of Bath.

 256   Mr.Dela Beche        on the Geographical Distribution        of Organic
 which accompany it in the latter locality, may have had great
 influence on the animal life of the vicinity.
     M. Dufre'noy mentions that in the oolite beds of Mauriac,
 the upper contain many polypifers, and appeared to him ana
 logous with the calcaire a polypiers of Caen (corabrash and
 forest marble).        He enumerates the following fossils in these
 beds:
 Pecten obscurus.                       Modiola cuneata?
         Jibrosiu.                      Unio crassissimus.

 M. Dufrenoy remarks, " In the first of these localities the rock
 contains an abundance of smooth Terebratulae ; and strikingly
resembles      the limestone observed between Oxford and Blen
heim, referred to the cornbrash."            The fossils are :
Pecten    obscurus.                     Terebratula     hnllata.
——   — laminatus.                                      ornithocephala.

Plagiostoma punctatum.                               • annuiatus.
Terebratula perovalis.                  Rostellaria.
    Of the 26 species mentioned in the Yorkshire cornbrash,
8   occur in France, one (Ostrea Marshif) being the same with
one of the 3 of the great oolite, : of these, 1 is found in the
forest marble of Calvados ; 1 in the forest marble and corn-
brash of the North of France ; and 2 in the Mauriac beds,
South of France.            Of the two Echinites of the Yorkshire
cornbrash, 1 is found in the forest marble of Calvados.
    Of the 32 species of fossil shells enumerated in the forest
marble of Calvados, 7 are found in the other localities : of
these, 3 occur in the great oolite, and 1 in the cornbrash of
Yorkshire ; 3 in the white marls or Bradford clay of the North
of France; and 1 in the Mauriac beds, South of France.                     Of
these 32 species, 7 are noticed in the lists of Mr. Conybeare
and Mr. Sowerby ; 2 in the forest marble, 5 in the cornbrash,
and 5 in the Bradford clay.
    Of the 6 species noticed in the forest marble and corn-
brash of the North of France, 3 are found in the lists of Mr.
Conybeare and Mr. Sowerby : of these, 3 occur in the corn-
brash, 1 in the forest marble, and 1 in the great oolite. Of
the same 3 species, 1 occurs in the great oolite, and 1 in the
cornbrash of Yorkshire ; 1 in the forest marble of Calvados ;
and 2 in the Mauriac beds, South of France.

       Remains in the Oolite Series of England and France.     257
    Of the 61 species of fossil shells enumerated in the York
shire great oolite, 7 occur in the lists of Mr. Conybeare and
 Mr. Sowerby : and of these, 6 are mentioned in the cornbrash,
 1 in the forest marble,   1 in the Bradford clay, and 1 in the
 great oolite.   Of the 61 species, 3 are stated to occur in the
 forest marble of Calvados, and 1 is found in the cornbrash
 and forest marble of the North of France.       Melania striata
 is marked questionable in the great oolite of Yorkshire and
in the Mauriac beds.
    Of the 7 species noticed in the great oolite of Calvados, 3
occur in Mr. Conybeare's lists, 2 in the cornbrash, 1 in the
 forest marble, 2 in the Bradford clay, anil 2 in the great
oolite. None are mentioned either in Yorkshire or the North
 of France.
    Of the 9 species contained in the white marls of the North
of France, supposed equivalent to the Bradford clay, 4 occur
in the lists of Mr. Conybeare and Mr. Sowerby, 2 in the
cornbrash, and 3 in the Bradford clay. Of the 9 species, 3
are found in the forest marble of Calvados.       None are men
tioned in Yorkshire.
    Of the 2 species noticed as characterizing the great oolite
 of the North of France, 1, Ostrea acuminata, is mentioned as
found in the Bradford clay of Mr. Conybeare's lists, but is not
noticed either in Calvados or Yorkshire.
    Of the 3 species of shells, exclusive of Belemnites, in the
fuller's earth of the North of France, 1, Terebratula media,
 is found in the same rock in England (Conybeare).
    Of the 12 species enumerated in the Mauriac beds, 5 are
found in the other localities, 2 being questionable : of these, 2
occur in the Yorkshire cornbrash, 1 being questionable at
Mauriac ; 1 is marked doubtful both in the Yorkshire great
oolite and the Mauriac beds ; 2 occur in the cornbrash and
forest marble of the North of France, and 1 in the forest
marble of Calvados.     Of these 12 species, 2 are found in Mr.
Conybeare's lists ; 1 in the cornbrash ; and 1 in the cornbrash,
forest marble, and Bradford clay.
    By considering the cornbrash, forest marble, Bradford clay,
great oolite, ana fuller's earth, as a mass in which sometimes
divisions can be made, while at others none can be observed,
the most common fossils would appear to be fish teeth and
palates, Clypeus clunicularis, Belemnites, Pecten fibrosus,
Avicula ecninata, Terebratula subrotunda, T. digona, T.
coarctata, numerous polypifers, and the Bradford encri-
nite.

     Of  the 63 species    of fossils enumerated in the Oxford clay
 of Yorkshire, more than one half are new : but of the re
 mainder, 12 occur in the other localities; of these, 8 are
 mentioned in Mr. Conybeare's lists, 7 are discovered in Nor
 mandy, and 2 in the North of France.
     Of the 16 species noticed in Mr. Conybeare's lists of Mid
land and Southern England, 1 1 are found in the other loca
lities, and of these, 8 occur in Yorkshire, 7 in Calvados, and
 1 in the North of France.
    Of the 34 species enumerated in Calvados, 12 are found in
the other localities ; and of these, 7 are discovered in York
shire, 7 in Midland and Southern England, and 4 in the
 North of France.
    Of the 1 1 species, not questionable, mentioned as found in
the North of France, 4 are discovered in the other localities ;
and of these, 2 occur in Yorkshire.
    It will be observed that the Gryphaea dilatata is found in
 nil the localities ; and that Ammonites Duncan!, A. sublaevis,
and Terebratula ornithocephala, are common to England and
 Normandy.

   M. Elie de Beaumont notices numerous polypifers and
echinital spines in the coral rag and Oxford oolite of Bur
gundy.     The same rocks also contain large Nerineae, Deci-
ceratae, large fibrous shells, dentated oysters, striated Tere-
bratulae, vegetable impressions, &c.*
   M. Dufrenoy describes rocks, which he considers equiva
lent to coral rag, near Marthon and Rochefoucault, and states
that they contain an abundance of polypifers of the same kinds
as those of the coral rag, and numerous crinoidal remains.f
   The reader will perceive that, though the coral rag and
Oxford oolite occur in numerous parts of England and France,
their organic remains have not been well determined, excepting
by Mr. Phillips in Yorkshire. The other published lists are
exceedingly defective, more particularly in the catalogue of the
polypifers from which the rock has received one of its names.
The following list, therefore, of organic remains which have
been noticed in more than one of the localities, will be exceed
ingly meagre; whereas if the polypifers had been better known,
it would have been quite the contrary.

266   Mr. De la Beche    OM theGeographical Distribution      of Organ
    Of the 13 species of Echinites enumerated in the coralline
oolite and calcareous grit of Yorkshire, 6 were first named by
 Mr. Phillips ; of the remainder, 3 are found in Midland and
 Southern England. The species of Echinites are not enume
 rated in the Continental lists.
    Of the very numerous fossil shells of the Yorkshire lists, the
greater proportion are new ; 1 2 of the remainder are found in
the other localities; 12 in Midland and Southern England; 3 in
 Normandy (one being questionable); and 3 in theN. of France.
    Of the 21 species contained in Mr. Conybeare's lists, or
noticed in the Weymouth beds, 12 are found in the other lo
calities; and of these, 12 are found in Yorkshire, 3 in Nor
mandy (1 being questionable*), and 3 in the North of France.
    Of the 7 species mentioned in Normandy, 3 are questionable;
of the remainder, 3 are found in Northern, Midland, and
Southern England, and 1 in the North of France.
    Of the 5 species determined with certainty in the coral rag
of the North of France, 3 are found in Northern, Midland,
and Southern England, and 1 in Normandy.
    Ostrea gregarea occurs in all the localities ; and Lima nulls,
Melania Heddingtonensis, ami M. striata, are extensively dis
tributed.      It is probable, that when the Echinites and Poly-
pifers shall have been determined with care, many species will
be found widely dispersed.

sioners appointed by His Majesty to inquire into the supply
                                          I
of water in the metropolis, have stated that when the expe
riments were nearly brought to a close,- a quantity of water was
sent to me, purporting to have been " taken in the river, in
the current of, and immediately at the mouth of the King's
Scholars' Pond sewer."        described it as " in a state of ex
                                      I
treme impurity, opaque with filth, and exhaling a highly foetid
odour."    When it had been about a week in my possession,
a considerable quantity of black water subsided from      but the        it,
fluid was still dark-coloured and opaque, and nearly as offen
sive as at first, while the odour and colour were only in part
removed by being passed through a layer of sand and charcoal
six inches in thickness.
   The water remained for some time in my laboratory with
out being attended to when, after an interval of some weeks,
                            ;
I   observed that   a   great change had taken place in its appear
ance.   It was become much clearer, whilst nearly the whole
of the sediment had risen to the surface, where       formed           it      a
pretty regular stratum of about half an inch in thickness; the
odour, however, still continued extremely offensive, perhaps
even more so than at first.        From this time the process of de
puration,    which   had  thus  spontaneously commenced, was con
tinued for about eight weeks, when the water became perfectly
transparent, without any unpleasant odour, although still re
taining somewhat of its original dingy colour.
    After the formation of the scum mentioned above, the next
change that observed was its separation into large masses or
              I
flakes ;  to these, as well as to the scum itself,      number of mi

their buoyancy     :  after some time the masses again subsided,
leaving    the fluid almost  totally free from any visible extraneous
matter.      The   quantity  of  gas discharged was inconsiderable,

so that it was difficult to obtain any of it for examination.        It
seemed to be principally composed of carbonic acid, containing
a little sulphuretted, and perhaps carburetted, hydrogen gas.
     When the process of depuration appeared to be complete,
the water was filtered through paper, and was then subjected
to the same mode of analysis which was employed on the
former occasion.* It was now perfectly transparent, and with
out taste or odour, but still retaining a slight brown tinge. It
sparkled when agitated or poured from one vessel to another,
and by boiling, a quantity of gas was disengaged from it: at the
same time a thin film pf carbonate of lime formed on the sur
 face, which gradually subsided : 10,000 grains left by evapo
 ration a saline crust of a light brown colour, which, after being
 thoroughly dried, weighed 7.6 grains.            By the appropriate
 tests, the water was found to contain lime, sulphuric acid, mu
 riatic acid, and magnesia.        There was a trace of alumine and
 an indication of potash ; but no ammonia, sulphur, or iron
 could be detected. The lime, the magnesia, and the sulphuric
  and muriatic acids were all of them obviously in much greater
  quantity than in the specimens of the Thames water previously
  examined.     If we suppose the sulphuric acid to be combined
  with a part of the lime, and the remainder of the lime to be
  in the state of carbonate, and that a part of the muriatic acid
  is combined with the magnesia and the remainder with soda,
  as was conceived to be the case in the Thames water generally,
  the respective quantities of these salts in 10,000 grains will be
  as follows :

      The result of this analysis shows, that although the water
   has, by this depurating process, freed itself from the great
   quantity of organic matter which it contained, and acquired a
   state of apparent purity, which might render it sufficiently pro
   per for many purposes, yet that the quantity of saline matter
   is increased as much as fourfold.        The greatest proportionate
   increase is in the muriates, which are very nearly twelve times
   more in the purified water than in the Thames water in its or
   dinary state.    The carbonate of lime is between two and three
   times as abundant as before, and the sulphate of lime between
   five and six times.    I may remark, that this water, when ex
    amined in its foul state, gave very obvious indications of both

sulphur and ammonia, neither of which could be detected after
depuration.
   This depurating process may be denominated a species of
fermentation ; i, e. an operation, where a substance, without
any addition, undergoes a change in the arrangement of its
component parts, and a new compound or compounds are pro
duced. The newly formed compounds were, in this case, en
tirely gaseous, and, except a part of the carbonic acid, were
discharged. The saline bodies, being not affected by this pro
cess, remained in solution, leaving the fluid free indeed from
what are considered as impurities, yet so much loaded with
earthy and neutral salts, as to be converted from a soft into a
hard water*. The source of the saline bodies may be supposed
to be the organic substances, principally of an animal origin,
which are so copiously deposited in the Thames ; of these the
most abundant are the excrementitious matters, as well as the
parts of various undecomposed animal bodies.        The different
species   of the  softer and more soluble  animal compounds act
as the ferment, and are themselves destroyed, while the salts
which were attached to them are left behind.      It may be con
ceived therefore, that the more foul is the water, the more com
plete will be the subsequent process of depuration ; and we
have hence an explanation of the popular opinion, that the
Thames water is peculiarly valuable for sea stores, its extreme
impurity inducing the fermentative process, and thus removing
from it all those substances which can cause it to undergo any
further alteration.
   The brown colour which the water exhibited after its depu
ration appeared to depend on the solution of a minute quantity
of what is generally termed extractive matter, and which is
observed in water that contains decayed vegetable substances;
it is almost always present in the beginning of winter in the
water of ponds, or of slow streams that have received the fall
ing leaves.     After the heavy rains that occurred in December
1827,   the  New  River water, with which my cistern is supplied,
was observed to be very turbid and dark-coloured.         By re
maining some hours at rest, a quantity of earthy matter sub
sided, and left the water nearly transparent, but the dark co
lour still continuedf    .
  • The terms hard and soft, as applied to water, are obviously relative ;
but water which contains as much as 5 grains in the pint of saline matter, is
generally regarded as too hard for many oeconomical and manufacturing
processes. The water in question contained 4.36 grains per pint.

twenty times their weight of water, and afterwards diluting the infusion

the New River water in the state      which
                                     in   I    examined it.

     I found  that this colouring matter was hot removed by boil
ing,   nor  by filtration through sand and charcoal, but that alum
and    certain  metallic salts, especially when heated with    threw          it,
down      aprecipitate, and left the water without colour. Of the
metallic salts the most effectual appeared to be the sulphate of
iron  ;   adrop of the solution of this salt, boiled with .500 times
its bulk of the water, threw down aflocculent, orange-coloured
precipitate, and left the water perfectly colourless.       obtained   I
the same results, only much less in degree, when these re
agents were added to the Thames water after its depuration.
    The sediment which was removed from the water by filtra
tion, as mentioned above, appeared to be a heterogeneous mass
 of various substances, about -^ths of which was siliceous sand                       ;
it  also contained a black matter, which gave the whole         dark           a
gray colour, and which was removed                   by
                                               a red heat    number    ;   a

 wood, fragments of coal, and small shining particles of a me
 tallic nature, which seemed to be sulphuret of iron. The mass
 indeed consisted of all those substances which were casually
 introduced into the Thames, and which had not been decom
 posed by the fermentative process.        They must of course differ,
 both in quantity and in quality, in every different portion of the
 water, so as to render        unnecessary to attempt

CINCE the completion of the first calculations for newly
^ determining the orbit of Ceres, one of my respected astro
nomical friends has given me the hope that the investigations
on this subject will be more completely and more accurately
performed by another hand. It will therefore be sufficient
in this place to explain the ground-work of my determination,
in order the better to form an estimate of the confidence to
which the places derived from      are entitled.

for the other small planets, in regard to the elements them
selves, and not to the places of the planets in space. A review

oppositions, seem to prove sufficiently that the equations for
the perturbations, if developed as is usual for the old planets,
would require to be extended considerably beyond the first
power of the eccentricity, if great accordance is intended. In
the same proportion, however, the calculation of a single place
would have become irksome, even taking into consideration
the facility afforded by the excellent construction of the tables
of perturbations (Zach'sCorresp. 1803, March); and therefore,
even if every part had already been perfectly developed, still
this method would hardly have deserved the preference on
the score of brevity of computation.
   As an interval of time, the number of one hundred days was
selected for this first approximation, and only the attraction of
Jupiter was taken into account. The mass of this planet was
taken, according to Nicolai, at                  .    This value, which is
 one-eightieth part more than the old determination by Laplace,
 appears in the cases of Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, to agree better
 with the observations, and therefore seems likewise for Ceres
 to deserve the preference.
    The four oppositions necessary for deducing the elements
 were found to be, from the observations published, as follows :

to heliocentric errors of 1 3" in longitude, and 7" in latitude ;
so that it is to be hoped, even if these errors are chargeable
to the elements only, and not, perhaps, also partly to the per
turbation caused by Saturn and Mars, which have been neg
lected, that these errors will not render the finding of Ceres
difficult for the approaching years, until the orbit shall have
been more accurately determined.

 sirable that the future oppositions should not pass by unno

 the question which has lately been agitated, Whether for all
planets, the attraction is rigorously proportional to their mass?
 XXXIX.        On the Composition of Chloride of Barium, Nitrate
    of  Lead,   and Phosphoric Acid ,• and on the Atomic Weights
    ofIodine and Bromine, By Mr. JOHN PRIDEAUX.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
 TN     a letter published in the Phil. Mag. and Annals, vol. vi.
      p. 166,  I  mentioned a scale of equivalents which, having
 found convenient in my own practice,       I was induced to pre-
         for publication.  This was deferred in consequence of
    r. Turner's experiments on chloride of barium; most of
 Eu-e
 the equivalent numbers having been taken from Dr. Thom
 son's " First Principles," which those experiments tended to
 call in question. And it seemed desirable to wait the result
 of the further investigations promised in Dr. Turner's paper ;
 in the mean while, having seldom found reason to be dissatis
 fied with the scale as it stood, employing my occasional lei
 sure in testing it by more accurate experiments.
     Not having seen any further progress reported by the Lon
 don Professor, I send you the following account of some of
  these experiments.
     So far as had occurred to me, chloride of barium and the
  sulphates precipitated each other completely in Dr. Thom
  son's proportions ; as did nitrate of lead, and oxalate of am
  monia: and on these equivalents depended the accuracy of
 many of the numbers in the
                                   " First Principles."   If the ex
 periment    of  Thomson,   Berzelius,  and  Turner,  with sulphate
  of potass, had been repeated by me, I should not presume to
 report it publicly: beside that, it is objectionable, without cer
                                                                tain

              Chloride  of Barium and Nitrate of Lead.        277
tain precautions, from part of the potassa precipitating with
the barytes.
    (A.) Sulphate of soda of commerce being purified by re
peated crystallization, some of the clearest and most regular
crystals were melted, dried, and heated to redness for half an
hour.
    (B.) Oxalic acid was saturated with carbonate of ammonia,
both of commerce.
    (C.) Nitrate of lead was similarly prepared with nitric acid
and ceruse ; and both these salts purified also, by repeated cry
stallization, and selection of the crystals, were dried between
folds of tissue paper in a current of warm air.
    (D.) Chloride of barium was in the same manner prepared
by neutralizing muriatic acid with common carbonate of ba
rytes.    Sulphuret of barium (sulphate ignited with charcoal)
was added, and afterwards caustic barytes (carbonate similarly
treated), till the liquid affected turmeric paper strongly.   The
salt was then crystallized, powdered, boiled in pure alcohol
and digested therein for a night ; redissolved in distilled wa
ter and subjected to a current of carbonic acid; recrystallized
and heated to redness for half an hour, avoiding fusion, by
 which the salt had on a former occasion become alkalescent
 (perhaps from impurity, as it was differently prepared).
     (1.) 13^ grains of this chloride were precipitated by 9 grs.
 of sulphate of soda: the former weighed with every precaution
 against absorption of moisture; the solutions mixed hot; and
 the phial immediately placed in the sand-bath, where it con
 tinued for three hours. The clear supernatant liquid when cold,
 tested with its original ingredients, remained at first perfectly
 clear with each ; but after a few minutes a slight opalescence
 appeared with the sulphate of soda ; and in time, a very small
 quantity of precipitate subsided. I could not collect this sa
 tisfactorily, and the estimate of '05 gr. for the quantity which
 might have been obtained from the whole solution, does not
 pretend to accuracy.        The first precipitate weighed, after
 heating red, 14'68 grs.; and there was an opacity about the
 sides of the phial in which the solutions had been mixed.
     (2.) 20| grs. of nitrate of lead were precipitated by 8| grs.
 of oxalate of ammonia ; the solutions being mixed warm.
 The clear liquor remained perfectly transparent when tested
 with its original constituents in every way.
     In checking these experiments by alternation of the in
 gredients, i. e, chloride of barium with oxalate of ammonia,
  and nitrate of lead with sulphate of soda, the result was not
  the same.
      Oxalate of nmmonia is   a delicate substance to dry. Whether
                                                                  it

 it would be perfectly freed from hygrometric water, by re
 maining in a cold vacuum with sulphuric acid, I do not
 know ; but conceiving there must be a vapour of that acid,
 which, however slight, must in the course of time settle more
 or less on the crystals, and still more on the powder, a cur
 rent of warm dry air seemed a less objectionable mode. This
 too required caution; for if the temperature reached anything
 approaching 212°, opacity appeared on some of the crystals,
 and the salt used in this state was always in excess.         About
 140°  seemed   to  answer very well, and  in  this the salt was kept
 three or four hours ; the nitrate of lead being kept beside             it,
 that they might be equally dried.
    (3.) 13^ grs. of chloride of barium were precipitated                by
 8| grs. of oxalate of ammonia; and
    (4.) 20 grs. of nitrate of lead

    In both cases the anhydrous salt was in excess, and the
 precipitation manifest and immediate on applying the test.
    All these experiments have been repeated as often as lei
 sure would allow, with materials prepared at different times,
 and with identical results (except when, as above stated, there
 were overdried crystals of the oxalate of ammonia).             The
 beam employed answers to the j-A^dth of grain        a   the weights

                                         ;   the salts were weighed
by the French method, first balancing the weight and then
putting the salt in its place. So far as confidence can be placed
in the results, Thomson's numbers seem nearer approximations
than those of Berzelius according to which there should have
                           ;
been in Experiment 1. an excess of -j^j gr. of chloride of
barium =s 0-145 of sulphate; and in Experiment 2. an excess
of -JWjr gr. nitrate of lead = 0-13 nearly of oxalate.
   The excesses in the 3rd and 4th Experiments correspond
so far with the tables of Berzelius they were not collected and

weighed, because the absence of hygrometric water could not
be depended on, though         I  can hardly believe the quantity
could be such as to account for so much precipitate. That
oxalic acid is  almost exactly 4P5,  I have no doubt      but    may
                                                                  it

                               is
equivalent, and deficient in relation to the others, the differ
ence would be well accounted for.        This would interfere with
Dr. Prout's law; but whilst the ablest chemists are at variance
on such simple experiments, we must be content with approxi
mations.
   Phosphoric acid    is stated     by

         oxygen. Thomson on the contrary makes, in the First
Principles," phosphorous acid an atom of each ; and phospho
ric, 1 phosphorus and 2 oxygen ; to which he has since added
a third acid (Phil. Mag. and Annals, vol. v.), of 1 phosphorus
and 3 oxygen. An extract from Dr. Henry's " Chemistry,"
in your Number for the present month (March) is favourable
to the views of the Swedish Professor, but with some expres
sions of indecision (regarding the uncertain composition of the
phosphuretted hydrogen gases).         The acid determined by
Davy to consist of             phosphorus 100, oxygen 134'5
and by Berzelius of                         100           133
is regarded by Thomson as 1 phosphorus and 2 oxygen ; which
opinion has some analogical corroboration from the constitu
tion of the acid obtained from sulphur by Davy's process, i. e.
combustion in oxygen.        But the process of Berzelius, solu
 tion and cohobation (if the term may be so applied) with nitric
acid, giving with sulphur an acid of 3 oxygen, the analogy
fails, unless in the latter process phosphuretted azotic gas was
formed, and £rd of the phosphorus thus wasted ; — a case so
 improbable, that nothing less than the decisive experiments
 in the " First Principles," on acid of atomic weight 3'5, would
 have allowed the supposition to be entertained.
     Combustion in chlorine and subsequent solution in water
 would be subject to the same uncertainty as combustion in
 oxygen, unless obviated by a current of chlorine through the
 solution.    The following was however preferred :
     Phosphorus melted in warm water was sucked up into
 a long glass tube, and there kept fluid until foreign matters,
 sinking or floating according to their specific gravity, had left
 the greater portion of it transparent and almost colourless.
                                                  I
  How to purify that substance more effectually, do not know.
     12'05 grains of the transparent part was put into a Woulfe's
 apparatus under water, and a current of chlorine gas, issuing
  close by the phosphorus, slowly passed.        The phosphorus
 being little diminished after a week's continuance in this, the
 apparatus was opened, and a small test tube introduced, into
  which were inserted the end of the tube from the generator,
 and the phosphorus, so that the bubble of chlorine should rise
 along it. The action thus expedited, the bubbles rose cloudy,
  settling as a dense vapour on the surface of the water, and in
  two days the phosphorus was completely dissolved. On open
  ing the apparatus the solution of phosphorus became turbid,
  and the sides of the bottle opaque and greasy, as though      it'
 were charged with powdered spermaceti.         Although tempted
 by   this new  appearance,
                          I     preferred continuing the experi
 ment as begun, and after leaving the tubulure open three days,
                                                               the

 the whole became transparent, the liquor (about 12 ounces)
 still continuing saturated with chlorine; but bleaching sud
 denly, when, on commencing the evaporation, it reached about
 150°.    Towards the end, about a drachm of nitric acid was
added to insure complete oxidation ; but no red fumes ap
peared.     The acid heated red for a quarter of an hour weighed
29-25 grains.     Yielding to the nail when cold, it still appeared
to contain water ; but as a small portion of black scum lay on
a part of the surface, the ignition was not repeated for fear of
decomposition.       This black substance being separated on
dissolving the acid, was too small to weigh. The acid dis
solved in distilled water, and cautiously neutralized with bi
carbonate of potassa, keeping it warm to dispel the carbonic
acid, was precipitated with nitrate of lead in excess. The pre
cipitate was boiled in weak acetic acid, and continued digest
ing in it twenty-four hours, to get rid of the excess of base so
constantly tantalizing in precipitated phosphates, and to show
the exact quantity of acid produced.                        I
                                          In this failed, the pre
cipitated  still weighing, after heating  red, 130*7 grains.   The
experiment       is,
                  however, sufficient to prove that 12-05 grains
of phosphorus require less than 17*2 of oxygen to form the
phosphoric acid of 4-5, (for       the acid thus formed had been
                                         if
that of 3-5, the precipitate must have weighed at least 141-25
grains,) and 16-2 of oxygen         exactly the quantity to corre
                                          is
spond with Sir H. Davy's experiment, by which 12-05 grains
of phosphorus would produce 28-25 of phosphoric acid. The
views of Berzelius on the phosphates appear to me correct,
and the acid of 3*5 still a problem.
    The new experiments of Berzelius quoted in the Quarterly
Journal for September, seem to prove that the atomic weights
of iodine and bromine have been deduced from materials not
free from chlorine     and he makes them
                       ;
                                         iodine 789-145         bromine 489-15
or x2 by the English system ... 1578-290                                   978-30
But as he makes chlorine 221-325, which x                   2   = 442-650, and
as  the above numbers were obtained                    by
                                               comparison with
chlorine,   ifthe true number for that substance     nearer 4*5, is
iodine will turn out 16'04, and bromine nearly 9.95 numbers           ;
as near to 16- and 10- as the nature of the experiments would
admit, and approaching,      the case of iodine, to the result of

                         HELD           a card between my eye and the candle,
                 and moved     gradually till    very nearly hid
                                                    it                              it
all the flame, when the edge of the card was tinged with red,
and the yellow and blue, &c. appeared in succession further
from the card. The order of the colours proves that the ray
of light (at least principally) refracted round or towards, and
            is
not from, the edgef.
             Fig.    A     section of the flame,
                              1.       is   a

                          CD             of the card                                ;
and     R  Y     V (using three, instead of the seven, for shortness)
are the prismatic rays.
    The red rays are in excess because of the colour of the
flame and when the card
        ;                         moved still more towards V, the
                                                    is
red   isno longer seen, the blue and violet are so pale as to be
hardly seen.
    By measurement which was not very accurate, the red rays
appeared to be refracted about 28' and my measurement was      ;
not accurate enough to determine whether or not different sub
stances refracted light differently. The brightest rays appeared
on the card rather than         the side of by as in fig.     making     it,              8,
the fringe described in Experiment            and from the cause        5,
there mentioned. Part of the inaccuracy of the measurement
mentioned above arose from this fringe.
   If
    I   applied to the ray second card      a  (fig. 9), between the    B
first card A and the candle, and in the same direction, the ray
disappeared, being refracted to C.
   If I applied     in the contrary direction, as D, no apparent
                         it
change took place, because, though one ray might be retracted
round D, there were others to fall on A but when the second              ;
card was applied exactly opposite to A, as E, then the coloured
rays were gradually drawn towards E, as           approached.                  it

   This experiment proved the refraction       caused by any edge
brought   near to a ray  of light,  more clearly and satisfactorily
than the former, but did not show whether the ray was re
fracted from or towards the intercepting edge, as it was not evi
dent on which side of the cobweb the ray passed.
                I
   Exper. 3. — then looked at the candle through a slit be
tween two parallel cards, sometimes ^ th of an inch apart and
sometimes less, when the candle appeared, as in fie. 2, very
broad, with its edges red ; nearer the middle it was yellow, and
the middle slightly blue or violet; the red and yellow much in
excess, because of the colour of the candle : there was also a
row of smaller candles on each side, each of which had its
outer edge red, and its inner one violet.
    When the cards were further apart, the flame was less dis
torted, as in fig. 3, with more but narrower traces of side
flames : when less apart, more distorted, as in fig. 4, with
fewer and wider side flames.
    In each case the width of the whole luminous appearance
was the same, because the refraction was the same ; but the
greater the number of rays which passed through the open
ing, the greater the number of candles into which the coloured
rays re -arranged themselves.
    Exper. 4. — When    I looked at the candle through a round
hole in the card of about the same diameter (^th of an inch),
the effect was much the same, but less regular in appearance,
                                      I
from its being circular : but when lessened the hole and came
within two feet of the candle (for in the former experiments
I  had been about ten feet distant), the distinctions "of colour
were lost, and the hole appeared as in fig. 5, with a distinct
luminous centre, but the outer part was marked with dark
rays diverging from that centre.
    When I closed the eye-lids a little, the centre remained the
same, but parts of the top and bottom of the outer circle were
darkened as in fig. 6 : when the eyelids were more closed, still
more of the top and bottom was darkened, as in fig. 7, plainly
proving that light enters the eye through the iris as well as
througn the pupil ; the luminous centre being made by those
rays which passed uninterruptedly through the pupil, and the
radiated outer circle being the shadow of the iris as thrown
on the back of the eye, unless lessened by the intervention of
the eyelid, as in figs. 6 and 7.
    The bright reflection of a window or candle on the bulb of
a thermometer is surrounded by the same radiations, from the
same cause.
   Exper. 5. — If a card be held so as just to conceal an object,
the card will appear fringed with the object, or the object may

but a space of sensible size, and the appearance is the same
as when, with two eyes, we hide the candle by a card from one
eye only, we may fancy that we see the candle through the card.
 And from this fringe or indecision of outline arises the slight
pain which the eye sometimes feels, on looking at one piece of
gauze of fine network through another.
    This fringe appears and affects the eye like an object not
exactly in the focus of a magnifying glass.

XLI.  On a Specimen of Varvicite from Ihlefcld.      By Dr.
  EDWARD TURNER, F.R.S. L.      E. $c. Prof, of Chemistry in
                                          $
  the University of London. (In a Letter to Richard Phillips,
  F.R.S. L. E.)  Sf
    My dear Sir,
   HAVE      lately received a curious specimen of manganese
I   from Prof. Stromeyer, in the history of which you will feel
considerable interest, as my examination of leaves little or no
                                                        it
doubt of its being a specimen of varvicite. It was found about
a year ago at Ihlefeld in the Hartz, and occurs in after-crystals
having the form of the six-sided pyramid of calcareous spar.
From this circumstance     it   probable that the crystals at one
                                is
time consisted of carbonate of manganese, which has been con
verted into its present state        by
                                  subsequent decomposition.
  Of the nature of the original crystals two views seem plausible.
They may originally have been composed of carbonate of
                                                             lime,

     Dr. Turner     on a Specimen  of Vanicite from Ihlefeld.    285
lime, which has been afterwards removed and carbonate -of
manganese substituted, by the action of carbonated springs
holding the latter salt in solution ; or, since carbonate of man
ganese is isomorphous with carbonate of lime, the former may
possibly have assumed the pyramidal form in which calcareous
spar sometimes occurs, by direct crystallization.          However
this may be, the crystals in my specimen are quite free from
carbonate of lime, and contain, besides oxide of manganese,
nothing but traces of baryta and oxide of iron.
    The mineral is made up of small lamellated prismatic cry
stals, too confusedly intermixed to admit of an accurate deter
mination of cleavage, but in lustre and general outline resem
bling varvicite and manganite. The colour of its streak and
powder is like that of varvicite, and in hardness also it corre
sponds with that mineral.       Its specific gravity is 4.623, while
that of varvicite is 4'531. When converted into red oxide by
a white heat, it loses 13'IS per cent, of which 4-98 are water
and 8'15 oxygen ; whereas your varvicite under the same cir
cumstances loses 13-11 percent, of which 5'725 are water,
and 7'385 oxygen.
    It appears to me from these characters that the mineral
under examination must either be varvicite with a small ad
mixture of peroxide, or a mixture of peroxide with a consi
derable quantity of manganite. But the last supposition is un
tenable; since a mixture of crystalline particles of such unequal
hardness as manganite and the peroxide, could not fail to be
recognised as such ; while this mineral, throughout, is of uni
form hardness.
   It may not be useless, while writing on the subject of man
ganese, to state a fact which I do not remember to have seen
noticed by others.        When chemists, in preparing pure salts
of manganese, add oxalate of ammonia or potash to a solution
of the chloride, and the liquid retains its transparency, it is
usual to infer the total absence of lime. But the inference is
not altogether correct; for the solution of chloride of manga
nese, though perfectly neutral, gives to oxalate of lime a de
gree of solubility which that salt does not possess in pure water.
          I
Hence have known a solution of manganese to retain its trans
parency an hour or two after oxalate of ammonia was added,
but to deposit a little oxalate of lime in the course of twenty-four
hours ; and when, after that period, the clear liquid was preci
pitated by an alkaline carbonate, the carbonate of manganese
taken up in nitric acid, and the nitrate decomposed by a heat
short of redness, the residue yielded nitrate of lime to water.

  XLII.      Results of some Experiments on the actual Force of
     Draught of Carriages upon common Roads.                    By B. BEVAN,
     Esq.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
            actual force of draught of carriages upon common roads
        has become a subject of interest and importance, as it re
 lates to the principles of conveyance by rail-roads, and more
 so as it demonstrates the importance of attention to the sur
 face of the road.           I   therefore take the liberty of sending
 you   the   results  of  some     experiments of mine on that subject,
 conducted with considerable care in August 1824.
     These experiments were all made, or reduced to roads per
 fectly level or horizontal, to separate the mechanical force due
 to the inclination of the hill or plane from the force necessary
 to overcome the friction of the carriage in its ordinary state
 as affected by the condition of the road ; and by way of ren
 dering them comparable with other experiments which have
 been or may yet be made on this subject,                  I have considered
 the gross load of the waggon and burden to be divided into
 1000 parts.

         the anatomy and physiology     of the internal ear, by T. W. Che
 ONvalier, Esq.      ;  communicated by Charles Bell, Esq. F.R.S.
   The author denies the correctness of the commonly-received opi
nion, that sounds are modulated in their passage through the tym
panum of the ear ; and believes that the vibrations are transmitted
•without modification to a medullary substance, which he thinks may
be regarded as a process of the brain itself.      He refers, for the proof
of this proposition, to a paper of which he is the writer, published in
the 13th volume of the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions ;*;uid in which
he endeavours to show that the malleus and the incus are so closely
united by ligaments, as to preclude the possibility of their moving as
levers upon each other.       The author lays it down as a fundamental
proposition, that every sound is characterized by three properties,
which are quite distinct from one another. The first of these is
its degree of loudness ; the second its tone ; and the third its qua
lity or kind. He conceives that the ear is capable of effecting a me
chanical separation of these three properties ; and of distributing
them on different portions of the organ, — without, however, destroy
ing their physical unity : and he claims to himself the originality of
the discovery of the several portions of the nerve of hearing on which
these different properties of sound are respectively impressed. That
part of the organ which is adapted to distinguish the loudness of
sound he terms the biameter; that which conveys the perception of
differences in tone he calls the tonometer;    and thirdly, to that portion
of the internal ear which is impressed by differences in the quality of
sound, he applies the denomination of poiometer.            He regards the
cochlea as performing the function of biameter, viewing it as being
essentially a conoidal tube, which is coiled into a spiral form merely
for the sake of greater compactness and strength ; for he observes,
that in the ears of singing birds, where compactness is no object, the
cochlea is a straight tube.      In order to explain his view of the office
of this part of the ear, he assumes it as a principle, that where a li
quid is propelled through a conoidal tube, its pressure against the
sides is inversely as the square of the area of a transverse section of
the tube.    This pressure, in the case of the sealae of the cochlea, will
be greatest at their apices.      Hence, the impression of sound will be
greatest at this part, and will diminish in regular gradation according
u   we trace the tubes from this part to their wider extremities ; — so
                                                                       that

 288                        Lintuean Society.
 that the louder the sound, the greater is the extent of the scula cochleae
throughout which it is felt ; an effect which will be still further aug
mented by the greater vascularity of the membrane of the scalae as it
approaches the cupola.      The author conceives that the internal ear
is protected from the injurious impression of very loud sounds by the
action of the stapedius muscle, which totally intercepts their trans
mission by the ossicula to the membrane of the fenestra rotunda, and
which is impressed upon a particular branch of the auditory nerve
 distributed upon that membrane. This view of the subject, he thinks,
is corroborated by comparative anatomy ; the base of the scala tym-
pani being particularly developed in animals easily awakened by
noises, as the cat, hare, and stag. The author ascribes to the mastoid
cells more particularly the power of transmitting sounds through the
bones of the head; and denies that any sonorous vibrations can take
place in close cavities filled with elastic fluid.
    The function of the auditory tonometer he assigns to certain me
dullary expansions, which he conceives he has discovered at the ampul-
lulur extremities of each of the semicircular canals. He is led to the
belief, that the fluid in these canals is capable of a species of circu.
lation, in consequence of the impulses received from the vibrations of
the membrane of the fenestra avails, which is itself set in motion by
the chain of ossicula. This he infers from the circumstance, that the
common orifices of superior and posterior canals, and that of the ex
terior canals, are immediately opposite to the fenestra ovalis in the
cavity of the vestibule, while their remote extremities are at the
greatest possible distance from the direction of the original impulses
given by the stapes.     The perceptions of tone conveyed by the three
semicircular canals in each ear coalesce in the mind into one per
ception ; nevertheless there is an advantage in this triple organ,
inasmuch as it may possibly be the means of our receiving perfect
impressions from different sounds, whether they be concords or dis
cords; and hence enabling us to perceive these qualities, for the per
ception of which the author does not see how a single organ could
suffice.   The writer, considering that, besides loudness and tone,
sounds are also capable of being distinguished by some other qualities,
thinks that these differences of quality may arise from different laws
of vibration. He imagines a monochord, for example, may, when
vibrating so as to occasion sound, perform its vibrations in very dif
ferent modes of acceleration or retardation of its velocity, and impress
these different modes of vibration on the air and other media by which
the sound is transmitted to the ear. The organ for the perception of
these differences he conceives to be a part of the vestibulum, which
he styles the poimneter, and where he has discovered a cushion of
medullary matter, over which the lining membrane of the vestibule is
loosely extended, so as to be unsupported and depressed at its centre.

 Mr. Bicheno, the Secretary, read a paper On the Plant intended by
 the Shamrork of Ireland, in which he attempted to prove by botani
 cal, historical, and etymological evidence, that the original plant was
 not the white clover, which is now employed as the national emblem.
 He stated that it would seem a condition at least suitable, if not neces
sary, to a national emblem, that it should be something familiar to the
 people, and familiar too, at that season when the national feast is
 celebrated. Thus the Welsh have given the Leek to St. David, being
a favourite oleraceous herb, and the only green thing they could find
on the 1st of March ; the Scotch on the other hand, whose feast is
 in autumn, have adopted the Thistle. The white clover is not fully
 expanded on St. Patrick's day, and wild specimens of it could hardly
be obtained at this season.        Besides it was probably, nay almost
 certainly, a plant of uncommon occurrence in Ireland during its early
 history, having been introduced into that country in the middle of the
 seventeenth century, and made common by cultivation.          He then re
ferred to several old authors to prove that the Shamrock was eaten by
 the Irish, and to one who went over to Ireland in the sixteenth cen
 tury, who says it was eaten and was a sour plant. The name also of
 Shamrock is common to several Trefoils, both in the Irish and Gaelic
 languages. Now clover could not have been eaten, and it is not
 sour. Taking therefore all the conditions requisite, they are only
 found in the Wood-sorrel, Oxalis acetosella.      It is an early spring
 plant ; it was, and is abundant in Ireland ; it is a trefoil ; it is called
 Sham-rogby the old herbalists ; and it is sour: while its beauty might
 well entitle it to the distinction of being the national emblem.       The
 substitution of one for the other has been occasioned by cultivation,
 which made the wood-sorrel less plentiful, and the Dutch clover
 abundant.

ing Address from the chair: —
        GENTLEMEN,
You have heard the report of the Council on the general state of
our Society, containing an account of its property and of its debts,
of the several sums received and expended during the last year,
and a careful estimate of all our resources for the current year.
You have also heard a separate report, from a select Committee,
respecting the various collections of our Museum, and the progress
which has been made in their arrangement.
    I cannot allow this opportunity to pass away without expressing
my hearty concurrence in the sentiments recorded by the Com
mittee, and my admiration of the talents exhibited by our Curator,
in n task of no common difficulty and of almost incredible labour.

290                        Geological Society.
At    the same time,   1 should ill express my own feelings and those
of the Society, did      I not on this occasion also acknowledge the
great obligations we owe to several members of our Council, and
especially to Mr. Greenough, who during many years has fully
given to us the benefit of his time and talents, both in directing us
to those sources from which our collection might be supplied, and
in arranging systematically the various specimens accumulated from
time to time in our cabinets.
    One result has been obtained from the excellent stratigraphical
arrangements of Mr. Lonsdale, which I had not myself anticipated ;
they not only place in an instructive point of view the excellencies,
but also the defects of our collection : and it appears from the report
of the Committee, that some of the suites of specimens intended to
illustrate the secondary formations of England are eminently defec
tive. It will be the endeavour of the Council by the exchange of
duplicates, and by all other means within their reach, to fill up
these chasms in the Museum: and in effecting this object they
look forward to the friendly cooperation of provincial bodies, asso
 ciated for purposes like our own, and, above all, to the zeal and
generosity of our own Members.
    You will perceive, Gentlemen, from the report of the Council,
 that in the general estimate of the receipts and expenditure of the
 current year, there is a balance of about ninety pounds against the
 Society.    Even such a deficit as this would produce feelings of
 deep regret, were it an indication of any general falling off in our
 resources; but the facf. admits of ready explanation without any
 such disheartening conclusion.       Our annual income is decidedly on
 the increase ; but our general funds have not yet entirely reco
 vered from the drain upon them which took place when we came
 into the occupation of these apartments. And during this year, be
 sides paying up heavy arrears, we have incurred an expense of more
 than six hundred pounds in the publication of our Memoirs.       There
 is, however, now laid up in the cabinets of the Museum a literary
 stock amounting in value to not less than twelve hundred pounds ;
 which, though but in a small degree available against the present
 claims upon the Society, must in the end be productive of a consi
 derable return.
     Of the merits of the several memoirs which compose our last
 publication I am not called upon to speak ; but I may direct the
 attention of the Gentlemen present to the number and beauty of
 its embellishments : and I am happy to record the expression of my
  thanks to Mr. Broderip, for the care with which he has superin
  tended every part of it during its passage through the press.    That
  Gentleman now retires from the laborious duties of the office of
  Secretary, which, for four years, he has filled so greatly to our ad
  vantage : but I am well assured, that we may still look with confi
  dence for a not less efficient, though perhaps less laborious, ap
  plication of his talents and experience in the promotion of our best
  interests.
     During the past year about fifty additional Fellows have been en
                                                                  rolled

rolled on the lists of the Society ; and among them I rejoice to ob
serve the names of some persons eminently distinguished in this
country by their knowledge in the exact sciences ; and of others to
whom we shall hereafter look, not merely for general support, but
for active cooperation in the field.     We have also added seven to
the number of our Foreign Members: and I need not tell the Gen
tlemen present, that our body is honoured by the addition of these
persons to its list* : for they stand without exception in the fore
most rank of those who, by a combination of great personal labour
and great talents, have pushed beyond their former limits those
branches of natural knowledge, for the advancement of which we
are incorporated.    At the head of this number I rejoice to see the
name of an illustrious Personage who, amid the distracting duties
attached to his exalted rank and commanding station, has found
time for the successful cultivation of science, which he adorns by
his high intellectual attainments, and urges on by the force of his
example.
   After placing before you these subjects of congratulation, it is
my painful duty to record the loss of an old Member of this So
ciety, who took a deep interest in its wellbeing and progress.       By
the death of Mr. Holme we have lost a man of rare simplicity of
manners, who in a life of retirement pursued science for its own
sake, without any alloy of selfish feeling, or any view to his emolu
ment or fame.      He was an admirable botanist ; and after many
years of application had acquired no ordinary skill in some difficult
parts of mineral analysis.     In one of the Papers in our last publi
cation I have had repeated occasions of acknowledging my obliga
tions to him.
   France has lately been deprived, by the death of M. Vauquelin,
of a man who for more than half a century devoted the efforts of
his powerful mind to the promotion of physical truth ; and we have
to lament the loss of a name which has long decorated the list of
our Foreign Members.       A proper homage has been already paid,
by the President of the Royal Society, to the memory of this illus
trious person; whose labours, however great the light they shed on
our department of natural history, were still more nearly connected
 with exact science.
    Several of the Papers read at our meetings, between the last
 Anniversary and our separation for the summer, have through
different channels already come before the public.      It would have
been well, that at least a part of them should have appeared in our
Transactions.     But our funds have not always admitted of a suffi
ciently rapid publication to meet the wishes of those authors es
pecially who have most original matter to communicate.          This is

a subject     of regret, and well deserves the consideration of the
Council     for  the coming year.   The Transactions of the Society
form unquestionably the most honourable official record of our la
bours.     It is through them that we are represented in the great re
public   of  science ; and without them, beyond our own immediate
circle, we possess neither voice nor animation.
    The progress of our body in geological inquiry since the former
Anniversary, will be best understood by glancing over the various
memoirs which have been the subject of discussion at our meetings.
It will be useless to do this in the exact order in which they came
before us ; I shall therefore follow that order in which the subjects
themselves appear to be naturally connected with each other.
    Our attention has been several times called to the theory of the
excavation of valleys, and to the effects produced by river currents
in modifying the form of the solid parts of the earth. The subject
was introduced during the former year by a memoir of Messrs.
Lyell and Murchison, on certain portions of the volcanic regions
of Central France; in which they show (in accordance with the
views of Montlosier, Scrope, and some other writers) that the ex
isting rivers have, by a long continued erosion, eaten out deep
gorges, not only through currents of basaltic lava which have
flowed through the existing valleys, but also through solid rocks
of subjacent gneiss. They further prove, on evidence which to
me seems not short of demonstration, that no great denuding wave
or mass of water lifted by supernatural force above its ordinary
level, could have assisted in forming such denudations : for the
country is still studded with domes of incoherent matter, the rem
nants of former craters ; from which may be traced, continuously,
streams of lava, intersected in the courses of the rivers by these
deep gorges — the gages and tests of the erosive power of running
water during times comparatively recent.
   The elaborate Paper of Mr. Conybeare on the valley of the
Thames is still fresh in our recollection.     He proves that the ero
sive power of the river has, within the records of history, produced
no eifect on the general features of the country through which it
flows, and that the propelling force of its waters is not now, and
never could have been, adequate to the transport of the boulders
which lie scattered on the sides and summits of the chains of hills
through which it has found a passage: that much of the waterworn
gravel, which has been drifted through the breaches opened in the
sinuous line of its channel, is composed of rocks not found within
the limits of its basin ; and that the form of the country is often
the very reverse of that which would have been produced by mere
fluviatile erosion, however long continued.      Similar facts are sup
plied by nearly all the greater valleys of England ; and on the
whole they point to one conclusion, that fluviatile erosion, as a
nu iv solitary agent, has produced but small effects in modifying
the prominent features of our island : at the same time they leave
untouched all the facts of an opposite kind, supported by direct
evidence, whether derived from the volcanic districts of Central
                                                               France,

                          Geological Society.                     293
 France,  or from any other physical      region on the surface of the
 earth.
    The power of mountain torrents in transporting heavy masses of
 stone is strikingly illustrated in a short paper by Mr. Culley. He
states that a small rivulet, descending from the Cheviot Hills along
a moderate declivity, carried down, during a single flood, many
 thousand tons of gravel into the plains below; and that several
blocks, from one half to three-quarters of a ton weight each, were
propelled two miles in the direction of the stream. Facts, similar
in kind, but on a scale incomparably greater, must be in the recol
lection of every one who has seen the Alpine torrents descending
into the plains of the north of Italy.
    When mountain chains abut in the sea, the laws of degradation
arc not suspended. At each successive flood, fragments of rock
are drifted in the direction of the descending torrents, and rolled
beneath the waters. This kind of action is indeed casual and in
terrupted ; but it is aided by another action which is liable to no
intermission — the beating of the surf and the grinding of the tidal
currents on all the projecting parts of a steep and rocky shore.
Under such conditions, I doubt not that there are now forming at
the bottom of the sea, and at depths perhaps inaccessible, alter
nating masses of silt, and sand, and gravel, which, if ever lifted
above the waters, may rival in magnitude some of the conglomerates
of our older formations.
    Our last Paper, on the excavating power of rivers, was from the
pen of Mr. Scrope.      He contends that diluvial torrents would only
form trough-shaped channels, extending in the direction of the
principal rush of water ; but would never produce curves in which
the excavating force worked in a direction opposed to that of the
general current.    He describes part of the course of the Moselle
and of the Meuse, where the rivers wind through hard transition
rocks, in long sinuous channels, varying in depth from 500 to 1000
feet.   In one of the great flexures of the Moselle, the river, after
passing over no less than 17 miles, returns to within 500 yards of
the point from which it started.       These phenomena are regarded
by the Author as sure indications of slow fluviatile erosion. For he
considers the idea of a great debacle, or diluvial current, winding
its way back in lazy flexures towards the point from which it
started, as absolutely unintelligible.
   If  I might give my own opinion on this debated question, I
should say, that the existing river drainage of our physical region,
is a complex result, depending upon many conditions — the time
when the region first became dry land — its external form at the
time of its first elevation above the sea — and all the successive
disturbing forces which have since acted upon its surface.        But
none of these elements are constant : no wonder, then, that results
derived from distant parts of the earth should be so greatly in con
flict with each other. In the formation of valleys there is therefore
little wisdom in attributing every thing to the action of one modi
                                                                 fying

fying   cause.   We know by direct geological evidence, that nearly
all the  aolid portions of the earth were once under the £ea, and
were lifted to their present elevation, not at one time* but during
many distinct periods. We know that elevating forces have not
only acted in different places at different times, but with such va
riations of intensity, that the same formation is in one country ho
rizontal, in another vertical ; in one country occupies the plains, in
another is only found at the tops of the highest mountains.        Now
every great irregular elevation of the land (independently of all
other results) must have produced, not merely a rush of the re
 tiring waters of the sea, but a destruction of equilibrium among the
waters of inland drainage.     Effects like these must have been fol
lowed by changes in the channels of rivers, by the bursting of
lakes, by great debacles, and in short by all the great phenomena
of denudation.     In comparing distant parts of the earth, we may
therefore affirm that the periods of denudation do not belong to
one, but to many successive epochs.        And by parity of reasoning
we may conclude that the great masses of incoherent matter which
lie scattered over so many parts of the surface of the earth, belong
also to successive epochs, and partake of the same complexity of
formation.
    The excavation of valleys seems therefore to be a complex re
sult, depending upon all the forces, which, acting on the surface of
the earth, since it rose above the waters, have fashioned it into its
present form.     We have old oceanic valleys which were formed at
the bottom of the sea in times anterior to the elevation of our con
tinents.    Such is the great valley of the Caledonian canal, which
existed nearly in its present form at a period anterior to the con
glomerates of the old red sandstone. We have longitudinal valleys
formed along the line of junction of two contiguous formations,
simply by the elevation of their beds.      To this class belong some
of the great longitudinal valleys of the Alps. We have other val
leys of more complex origin; where the beds through which the
waters now pass have been bent and fractured with an inverted
dip at the period of their elevation.     Such is the valley of Kings-
clere, described in a former volume by Dr. Buckland.           We have
valleys of disruption, marking the direction of cracks and fissures,
produced by great upheaving forces.        Such are some of the great
transverse valleys of the Alps. Of valleys of denudation our island
offers a countless number.    Some are of simple origin : for example,
the dry combes and valleys of the chalk, which appear to have
been swept out by one flood of retiring waters during some period of
elevation. Others are of complex origin, and are referrible to many
periods, and to several independent causes.      Lastly, we have valleys
of simple erosion : such are some of the deep gorges and river chan
nels in the high regions of Auvergne, excavated solely by the long
continued attrition of the rivers which still flow through them.
    I should not have dwelt so long upon this subject, hud it not occu
pied a large portion of our attention during the past year; and I
                                                                   may

may be pardoned for entering a record of my own views on a ques
tion of no small complexity, and on which there is still much con
trariety of opinion.
     During the past year we have been presented with several memoirs
describing formations superior to the chalk : which 1 shall also notice
in the order of the subjects, without any regard to the time when they
came before us. — In a Paper by Dr. Fitton on the structure of a por
tion of the low countries in the north of France, among other inter
esting details, is a description of three of this great class of for
mations.      He points out deposits in the neighbourhood of Calais,
Antwerp,     and  Tongres, which resemble the Crag of Suffolk. He com
pares    the sands  of St. Omer, Cassel, and Lille, with the sands which
overlie the chalk in the London basin : and he states that the arena
ceous beds of the hill of Cassel (like similar beds at Brussels) con
 tain large suites of fossils, generally agreeing with those of the Lon
 don clay.     Lastly, he describes in detail the structure of St. Peter's
 Mount near Mnestricht, and shows that the inferior beds form a gra
 dual passage into the white chalk on which they rest; while the upper
 beds bear marks of degradation and mechanical interruption, and
 offer no indication of a passage into the superior sands.        And he
 adds that, out of more than fifty species of organic remains collected
 by himself from this deposit, not more than ten are found in our best
 catalogues of chalk fossils.
     I may here remark, that the suite of fossils in the Cassel sand»
 throws no difficulty in the way of their comparison with the lower ter
 tiary sands and plastic clay of England. The terms London clay and
  Plastic clay may be preserved as convenient mineralogical designa
  tions. They mark, however, nothing more than the subdivisions of
  one great deposit between the lower and the higher members, in
  which there is no line of zoological separation. In the London and
  Paris basins, there is a great chasm in the order of succession between
  the tertiary and secondary systems, which the labours of Geologists
  may in time enable us to fill up. — The Maestricht beds are so nearly
  related to the formation on which they rest, that they may be regarded
   as the last term of a new series of deposits, which we hope hereafter
   to find interpolated between the calcaire grassier and the chalk.
      A Paper by Mr. Murchison makes us acquainted with the structure
   of the tertiary formations on the southern flank of the Alps between
   the Brenta and the Piave.      They are divided into two great natural
  groups exhibited in two zones : — an outer zone containing shells which
   seem to be nearly identical with the well known fossils of the newer
   tertiary Sub-Apennine formations; — an inner and inferior zone con
   taining in its higher portions a few shells resembling those of a part
   of the Bourdeaux basin, while its lower beds are distinguished by
   innumerable organic remains, more than half of which seem to be
   specifically identical with those of the calcaire grassier or London
   clay. These lower beds on the banks of the Brenta are inclined at
    70° or 80°, and are based upon a nummulite rock, which is abso
   lutely vertical, and conformable to the scaglia (containing ammonites
                                                                       and

   and belemnites), and together with it rises into peaks of considerable
   height on the extreme border of the chain : and there is no conglo
   merate or other mechanical degradation of the older rocks, to mark
   the junction    of 'the secondary and tertiary systems.    Some notion
   may   be  formed  of  the enormous  thickness of these deposits from the
  statement, that a transverse section (from Asolo to Possngno) through
   beds of only a part of this series, inclined at various angles from 25°
   to 40° and exhibiting no invertions of dip, is not less than five miles
  in length.      One important consequence seems to follow inevitably
  from    these details : the last epoch of elevation of the neighbouring
  mountains must have commmenced during a period posterior to the
  tertiary formations described in this memoir.
      In three Papers, recently presented by Mr. Murchison and myself
  to this Society, we have endeavoured to establish a series of similar
  conclusions, by induction from the phenomena observed on the flanks
  of the Salzburg and Bavarian Alps. I        will not give you any analy
  sis of details, which have so lately been    the subject of discussion in
  this room. 1 may, however, briefly recall your attention to the re
  sults, which we consider best established and of most importance.
  We have shown that several transverse sections from the central axis
  of the Alps to the basin of the Upper Danube would present a suc
  cession of phenomena in very near accordance with those of other
  transverse sections from the same axis to the tertiary formations at
  the other bise of the chain in the north of Italy.      On both sides of
  this chain, after passing over the great secondary calcareous zones,
  we meet with the lower tertiary strata, — always highly inclined, some
  times vertical, and occasionally conformable to the beds of the older
 system.       We contend that this remarkable symmetry confirms the
 hypothesis of a recent elevation of the Eastern Alps ; and makes it
 probable, independently of arguments derived from organic remains,
 that the tertiary deposits of the Sub-Apennine regions and of the
 basin of the Upper Danube belong to one period of formation.
     Thick masses of strata full of organic remains, and often occurring
 at low levels near the northern foot of the chain, are sometimes also
 found (e. g. in the valley of Gosau) in unconformable positions,
 caught up among the serrated peaks of the Alps, four or five thousand
feet above the level of the sea.      Such a disjunction of corresponding
strata (and I may observe that the argument bears not upon their
exact age), is inexplicable on any hypothesis which rejects the theory
of elevation. We have concluded, chiefly on zoological evidence,
that the unconformable beds of Gosau are more recent than the chalk.
We believe that they contain neither ammonites nor belemnites, nor
any other known species of secondary fossils ; and on the whole we
regard them as a term of that unknown series of formations which
may hereafter close up the chasm between the lowest beds of the Paris
basin and the chalk.
     We have pointed out the limits of the old chain of the Salzburg
and Bavarian Alps, and traced the direction of its valleys anterior
to the tertiary epoch : and we have described a great deposit of lig
nite far up the valley of the Inn, containing freshwater and marine
                                                                     shells,

                             Geological Society.                      297
shells, which seem to connect it with the period of the London clay.
We    have further shown, that there are within the basin of the Upper
Danube two or three higher zones of lignite separated from each
other by sedimentary deposits of enormous thickness.
    The tertiary system of Bavaria is shown to pass into, and to be
identical with, the molasse and nagelflue of Switzerland.      The higher
part of this series must therefore (on the system of M. Studer) be of
the same age with some of the formations of the Sub-Apennines. We
have proved that enormous masses of sandstone and conglomerate
many thousand feet in thickness, stretching from the base of the
Alps to the plains of the Danube, are chiefly derived from the degra
dation of the neighbouring chain — that many of these masses cannot
be distinguished from the newest detritus which lies scattered on the
surface of the earth — that in their prolongation into Switzerland
they sometimes contain bones of mammalia — that they are regularly
stratified, and alternate with beds containing marine shells — and that
they cannot have been caused by any transient inundation.
    Finally, we point out the probable effect of debacles which took
place when the basin was deserted by the sea.        We show that the ex
cavations produced by the retiring waters have been augmented by
 the bursting of successive lakes, of which we found traces in all the
 upland valleys of Bavaria ; and that these excavations have been since
carried on by the erosive power of the streams which roll down from
 the sides of the Alps to the plains of the Danube.
    The greatest number of tertiary formations hitherto described ap
 pear to have been produced either in estuaries or mediterranean
 seas ; the depth of which, however considerable, was probably much
 less than that of the wider oceans, wherein some of our secondary
 rocks have had their origin.         These circumstances tend to explain
 the frequent alternations of marine and freshwater beds in the tertiary
seas ; and they satisfactorily account for the appearance of land shells,
 lignite, and other terrestrial remains, drifted, at many difterent pe
 riods, into the regular marine deposits of the tertiary groups.       By
 the help of these alternations are certain species of marine and fresh
 water shells demonstratively shown to have been contemporaneous.
 And when this conclusion is once established, it may be applied to
 determine the age of those lacustrine* formations which have never
  communicated with the sea.
     In this way it has been shown that the enormous lacustrine depo
 sits of Aix in Provence, of the Cantal, of the Limagne d'Auvergne, and
 of other districts in the south of France, belong to the period of the
  great tertiary system of the Paris basin. I have no time even to allude
  to the important works connected with these subjects, which we owe
  to the naturalists of France : and the two Memoirs of Messrs. Lyell
  and Murchison," On the tertiary deposit of the Cantal," and " On
  the freshwater formations of Aix in Provence," have been already
  published *.    I am not, therefore, called upon to give any regular
  analysis of their contents.        I may, however, be permitted to recall

  your attention to the enormous thickness of a regular succession of
  deposits described by these gentlemen in a section extending from the
   hills above Aix to the coal works of Fuveau. We have at the base of
  the section a great system of alternating beds of limestone and shale
  containing many seams of coal, some of which are worked by perpen
  dicular shafts 500 feet in depth.    Over this succession of beds, come
   vast groups of strata forming ranges of hills composed of limestone,
  shale and sandstone.     These are surmounted by thick deposits of red
   marl and fibrous gypsum, and by vast masses of conglomerate.        Fi
   nally, over the conglomerate comes a series of beds conforming to
  the more ordinary tertiary type ; remarkable for the regularity of
  their deposition, and for the beautiful preservation of the shells, the
  fishes, and even the insects contained in them.    Such are the minera-
  logical characters of the lower members of this great series, that I hey
  have been referred (even by expert naturalists, who had not sufficiently
  examined the organic remains) to the old coal formation and the new
  red sandstone ; but from top to bottom their fossils are exclusively
  tertiary and lacustrine. At the same time we attempt in vain, by
  joining in imagination the prominent elevations of the older rocks in
  the neighbouring regions, to restore the former barriers once con
   taining that great body of water within which these deposits had their
  origin.
      The Paper on the Cantal brought before us a series of facts no
  less striking and impressive.     In this high region are the escarp
  ments of an old lacustrine formation, nearly 500 feet in thickness,
  full of freshwater shells, many specifically identical with fossils of
  the basins of Paris and of the Isle of Wight : but here, as in
  the former case, there are no barriers to mark the limits of the
  lake within which this deposit was once confined. The same region
  also bears the impress of another succession of phenomena; for
  within the area of this ancient lake, and after the solidification of
  the beds of marl formed in its waters, burst forth one of those great
 trachytic eruptions which mark all the neighbouring parts of France.
  So that we now find beds of basalt, trachytic breccia, and other old
  volcanic rocks, overtopping, on the side of one valley, by more than
  800 feet, the highest lacustrine rocks through which they have
  breached a passage to the surface of the earth : and in the neigh
 bouring region the same old volcanic rocks have risen to several
 times that elevation.
     When we examine the upper rock marl of the Isle of Wight, we
 see a deposit separated from us and the things about us, only by a
 few feet of transported gravel. The outline of the country might
 have been remodified, and the gravel formed by some transient
 inundation.     We have therefore no measure of the time which may
have elapsed since the first existence of the phenomena before us.
 If, however, we examine the shells in the rock marl, we tind that
few, if any, belong to species existing in our lakes or rivers. We
cannot believe that there is so great a violation of continuity in
the forms of animated nature, except in subordination to nature's
laws ; and we feel almost forced to seek for a solution of our dif
ficulties amidst the ideal revolutions of former ages.
                                                                      But

    But how differently is the history of the same great period tol <1 off
 among the volcanic mountains of the Cantal and Auvergne ! Great
lacustrine formations, of the same age with the rock-marl of the Isle
 of Wight, are there proved by their organic contents to have been
formed and solidified at a time anterior to the trachytic eruptions
which upheaved and desolated the whole surface of the country.
How long these great eruptive forces were in action, it is useless to
conjecture ; but they were followed by ages of repose, during which
the surface of the land was reformed, and deep valleys were exca
vated by the erosive power of water.            A new period of volcanic
agency    succeeded,  marked    by  domes   of cinders  and scoriae, remain
ing   to this day  almost  unchanged,      and  by  streams  of lava, which
may   be traced from  them   into  the existing   valleys.  And   even these
last operations, however recent in the order of geological events,
were anterior to the records of history; so that we can still only
approximate to their date, by a careful comparison of the effects
since produced upon these streams of lava by the destructive power
of the elements.
   A description by Mr. Murchison of the lacustrine strata and
fossils of OEningen is the last communication connected with ter.
tiary formations, which I am called upon to notice. He shows that
this deposit consists of horizontal beds of a considerable aggregate
thickness, laid bare in quarries on the side, and near the summit
of a ridge of hills, the base of which is washed by the waters of
the Rhine — that they do not alternate with the molasse but repose
upon it unconforinably— and that from top to bottom they are of
freshwater origin.     He enumerates in detail a great variety of fos
sils (such as insects, plants, shells, fishes, tortoises, and mammalia,)
discovered at different times in these quarries ; and he adds a de
scription (from the pen of Mr. Mantell) of a fossil fox not to be
distinguished from the Vvlpes commiuiis, found in the middle beds
of this system. From all these geological details, as well as from
the position of the strata, he concludes that they belong to a very
recent tertiary period.    At the same time, the waters of the Rhine
descend from the lake of Constance at a level no less than 600
feet below that of the old lake, in which the (Eningen beds origi
nated ; and there is not in the present outline of the country any
indication of the surface over which they once extended.
    Such, Gentlemen, have been the prominent subjects of discussion
during our meetings of the past year. Before 1 proceed to other
questions, let me express my thanks to Mr. Vernon, for the zeal
with which he has investigated, and the fidelity with which he has
described, a deep excavation at North Cliff in Yorkshire.             Under
the ancient gravel of the district are found regular deposits of
river silt, containing bones of the mammoth, the horse, the urus,
the rhinoceros, the wolf, the ox, and deer ; mingled with thirteen
species of land or lacustrine shells, absolutely identical with those
now living in the neighbouring district.           Phenomena like these
have a tenfold interest, when regarded as the extreme link of a
great chain, binding the present order of things to that of older

periods, in which the existing forms of animated nature seem one
 after another to disappear.
    Twenty years are not yet passed away since MM. Cuvier and
 Brongniart first published their researches on the geological struc
 ture of the Paris basin.     The innumerable details exhibited in their
 various essays ; the beautiful conclusions drawn from unexpected
 facts ; the happy combination of mineralogical and zoological evi
 dence; the proofs of successive revolutions, till then unheard of,
 in the physical history of the earth — all these things combined,
 not merely threw new light on a subject before involved in compa
 rative darkness, but gave new powers and new means of induction
 to those who should in after times attempt any similar investiga
 tion*.
    Mankind are, however, dazzled and astonished by great disco
veries, as well as guided and instructed : and for some years after
the publication of these admirable works, the naturalists of various
 countries, whose attention had been so loudly called to the deposits
above the chalk, saw in them only a repetition of what was already
described, and of which the true type was in every case to be sought
among the formations of the Paris basin.          Investigations conducted
in this spirit sometimes ended in disappointment.           But this was not
the spirit recommended in the incomparable Essay of Cuvier »; for
after exhibiting the true method of geological induction, and de
scribing the intense and almost tormenting interest with which he
had followed out his own investigations, he points to the long series
of deposits in the Sub-Apennine hills, and states his conviction that
in them lies concealed the true secret of the last operations of the
ocean.
    Since that discourse was written, much has been done ; but much
more still remains to be done. It has been my pleasing task to place
before you the labours of some of our own body in illustrating the
recent geological periods in the history of the earth : by such de
tails alone can \ve expect to comprehend the more intricate pheenn-
mena of still older periods, arid to connect them with the great phy
sical laws by which all matter is governed.
    Considered in the most general point of view, without any re
gard to the lacustrine beds, which are perhaps local or acciden
tal, the tertiary groups of the Paris basin may be described as a
great complex system of deposits, belonging to one protracted zoo
logical period ; characterized by extinct genera of mammalia, and
by innumerable marine shells; but affording very few species by
which we can connect them either with the chalk, or with the for
mations of our neighbouring seas.           Their position is therefore en-
tirely insulated ; and by what new links they may be connected with
the physical events which went before them and followed after them,
can only be determined by a long scries of observations.               I have
already pointed    out  the  source   from   which  some   of  the older links
may hereafter probably be supplied.            Of the same palaeotherian
age, and in the same insulated position, are the tertiary deposits of
              * See  Ditcoitrt Pre/iminairc, p. 112, 1st edition.
                                                                  Hampshire,

Hampshire,     and some of the great lignite     formations in the north
of Germany.
    The next group of the tertiary system is ill defined, and still but
imperfectly understood. Some members of it are seen on the banks
of the Loire, and have formed the subject of a late important me
moir by M. Desnoyers; and the same portion of the series is repre
sented on the eastern coasts of England, by the beds of crag over
lying the London clay. It contains, like the former division, the
bones of many mammalia, some of extinct, and some probably of
living species ; but the remains of the extinct animals do not be
long to the palaeotheria of the older period, but to the mammoth,
the rhinoceros, and other animals, of which the bones are found so
constantly in the superficial gravel.     To the fossil shells of this di
vision the same observations may be applied : many belong to spe
cies which are unknown, and perhaps extinct ; others cannot be dis
tinguished from the living shells of the neighbouring seas.
    A third division of the system may comprehend all the higher
Sub-Apennine deposits; distinguished by the bones of mammalia in
still greater abundance, and by the number and beauty of the fossil
shells, many of which are of living species.         It is of enormous
thickness in some of the low regions at the base of the Apennines ;
and it probably extends over a considerable portion of the basin of
the Danube, and over the plains beyond the eastern termination of
the Alps. I have, however, no time, nor do I possess information,
to give any detailed account of its distribution.
   During the periods in which the two last tertiary groups were
elaborated in the sea, there must have been deposited on the land,
in caverns, in fissures, and in beds of superficial gravel, many bones
 of the same species of animals by which those groups are charac
terized : and during the same periods may have originated in inland
lakes some of the deposits of which we now only see the traces
in masses of lacustrine marl, found in various countries resting
unconformably upon the older strata.
    It is impossible with our present knowledge, to form even a con
jecture respecting the subdivisions into which the whole tertiary
series may finally be separated. I am only anxious, in the mere out
line I am now attempting, to describe the successive groups above
the chalk in terms the most general, and in divisions the most com
prehensive ; especially, as they appear in connexion with our labours
of the past year.
    I must, however, notice one more group in the succession of
marine deposits, before I can complete the ascending series and
reach the limits of history: the name tertiary cannot perhaps with
propriety be applied to it, as the animal remains contained in it
are almost exclusively of the species now living in the nearest seas.
To this class we may refer certain shelly deposits in the West India
Islands — on the shores of the Red Sea — and on various parts of
the shores of Italy, Sicily, and Spain. Their position, as might be
expected, is generally low.       But near the focus of volcanic action
they   rise to more  considerable  elevations: in proof of which I need
                                                                     only

 only state, that beds of shells are found on the mountains of Sicily
 three thousand feet above the level of the Mediterranean, and of
 the same species with those now living in its waters*.
    Such are the steps by which we ascend through the divisions of
 the tertiary period. I need not, however, inform you that we can
 seldom determine their relations by the mere evidence of super
 position. Most frequently they appear in detached masses, the age
 of which can only be known by thuir fossils. This kind of evidence
 is,however, sometimes brought before us in       manner at once the

                                                                It    is
 of MM. Deshayes, Basterot, and other expert naturalists, who are
 devoting their talents and time to the completion of great works on
 the organic forms of the several tertiary groups, that we must
 look for information, which     the end may give us the means of
                                       in                                                       a
 safer and wider induction.
    With the exception of an interesting notice      Dr. Buckland ofby
 the occurrence of agates in the dolomitic strata of the Mendip
 Hills, not single memoir has been read before us during last year,
                a

                                is

 The work of Mr. Phillips on the strata and organic remains of the
Yorkshire coast offers, however,     splendid contrast to this portion
                                                 a
of our year's productions.    The clearness of the descriptions, the
accuracy of the sections, the figures of more than 4-00 fossils faith
fully arranged according to their grouping in the formations be
tween the new red sandstone and the chalk, combine to make                                      it
one of the most valuable and instructive Essays in our language.
   Much, Gentlemen, remains to be done, before the structure of the
various formations of the British Isles can safely be appealed to
as one of those complete middle terms of comparison, by help of
which the disjointed fragments of    former world mny

beds on the coast of Suffolk, we are greatly deficient information.        in
The accounts of all our tertiary strata, however excellent at the
time they were written, must be entirely remodelled. Even the his

type to which foreign naturalists are attempting to conform some
of their own secondary rocks)       defective. We know, in admirable

    Something is left to be done in illustrating the upper part of the
new red sandstone. It is here that the poverty of our secondary
rocks offers a striking contrast to the riches of the coeval rocks
on the flanks of the Vosges and on the banks of the Neckar. And
this very poverty makes every scrap of information, whether derived
from mineralogicul or organic characters, of importance in assisting
us to complete this broken part of our secondary series.
    Even the history of our coal formations is not yet perfect.     The
association of the coal and mountain limestone of Northumberland
has not been well explained.       The great corresponding deposits
of Cumberland are undescribed : nor does it appear in our pub
lished works, that coal is found alternating in the North of England
with all parts of the mountain limestone group ; and that beds of
coal are worked in several places, resting upon transition slate, and
surmounted by the whole limestone series.        More than half of Ire
land is a blank on our geological maps : and on many of the tran
sition districts of England our information is lamentably defective.
    The study of our older deposits is indeed difficult and toilsome,
and unenlivened with the frequent occurrence of organic bodies.
But no country, hitherto described, shows a more splendid series of
phenomena, to illustrate the intrusive agency of crystalline rocks ;
and to exhibit the great successive internal movements, by which
our continents have been elevated, and brought under those laws
of degradation which have fashioned them into their present forms.
In these investigations there is still a rich spoil ready for any one
who will have the courage to stretch out his hands to grasp it. A
part of it I have myself gathered among the mountains of Cumber
land, with no small labour; which I shall count for gain, if I may
be permitted, hereafter, to lay it up in the storehouse of this Society.
    Leaving, however, the subject of British geology, I must call
your attention to those Papers which, during our sessions of the
past year, have described the general phenomena of secondary
rocks. — On the secondary formations of the Netherlands we have
heard some interesting remarks in a recent Paper by Dr. Fitton,
above quoted ; in which he describes the structure and distribution
of the chalk, the firestone, and the green and ferruginous sands;
shows their discordant position over the coal-measures ; and indi
cates the characters, both in which they differ and agree with the
corresponding members of the English series.
    In a Paper on the geology of the shores of the Gulf of Spezia,
beautifully illustrated by sections and drawings, Mr. De la Beche
describes a long series of stratified and unstratified rocks. Among
the former may be enumerated, beds of clay sandstone and con
glomerate, supposed to be tertiary ; beds of macigno ; the marble
of Porto Venere ; the crystalline limestone of Capo Corvo, &c.
among the latter, diullnge rock, serpentine, mica schist, &c.         He
endeavours to show, from the structure of the district, and the fos
sils of the neighbouring rocks, that the marble of Porto Venere may
belong to the age of the oolitic series ; and that the diallage rocks
                                                                     and

and serpentine are a prolongation of the system of southern Ligu-
ria, and have been protruded by igneous action among the depo
sitory rocks, after the period of the oolites.
    Among the contributions to our knowledge of the structure of
foreign secondary deposits, I must lastly notice the communica
tion of Mr. Murchison on the bituminous schist and fossil fish of
Seefeld.     This singular rock rises to a great elevation among the
bare calcareous peaks of the Tyrolian Alps, and contains such a
quantity of bituminous matter, probably derived from the animals
imbedded in it, that some of its strata are broken up and exposed
to a process of distillation, by which a great quantity of what may
be called mineral fish oil is extracted for economical use.        Among
the fossil fish M. Valenciennes of Paris discovered at least four
species ; one a clupea, and three distinguished          by quadrangular
scales, without articulating points, and resembling the Esox osseus;
but differing from that genus, both in the form of the tail and the
position of the fins.
    There is a large family of fish, made up of many genera and
 species, and distributed from the old red sandstone to the magne-
sian limestone, which belong to the order Malacopterygii abdomi-
nales, and are particularly distinguished, like the Esox ossrus, by a
pointed tail, the lower side of which alone is supplied with rays. It
 is obvious from this description that the Seefeld fish are not com
prehended in that family.       And as they are not identified with the
fossils of any known formation, we must consider their place as
still undetermined.      This is at least a safe conclusion : and minera-
logical   indications in the calcareous regions of the Alps are of very
 small value in determining the question.
     During the past year, we have received from Dr. Buckland several
 additional notices, drawn up with his well known sagacity and sin
 gular felicity of illustration, on the characters and distribution of
 various specimens of coprolites.        The results of his inquiries are
 published in the last Part of our Transactions ; and on that account
 I  am precluded from any further remarks upon them. They belong,
 indeed, to important discoveries of the former year, and have al
 ready been noticed in the Anniversary address of my predecessor
  in this chair.
     From the same pen we have also a description of the bones of
  the Iguanodon and other large reptiles, discovered at Sandovvn
  Bay in the Isle of Wight, and near Swanwich in the Isle of Furbeck.
  In both localities the formation is the same with that of the sand
  stone of Tilgate Forest, in which Mr. Mantel! first discovered the
  remains of the Iguanodon, an herbivorous reptile of extraordinary
  stature.   Dr. Buckland describes an external metacarpal bone (six
  inches in length, five inches in its greatest breadth, and six pounds
  in weight) of the right foot of some reptile, supposed, from the
 stratum in which it is found in Sandown Bay, and from the bones
  with which it is associated, to be an Iguanodon.         It is in linear
  dimensions twice as large as the corresponding bone of a large
                                                                elephant :

                              Geological Society.                         SOS
elephant: and we must consider the small proportion which the legs
 of a reptile bear to the length of its body, in order to form any
notion of the gigantic proportions of this quadruped.
    Finally, I have to notice a communication from Mr. Hennah,
containing a systematic and descriptive catalogue of the fossils of
 the transition limestone of Plymouth, read at our last meeting.
    Such, Gentlemen, have been the memoirs presented to us since
our former Anniversary.          I have brought them before you in that
order in which they seem to cast light upon each other ; and I
have indulged in no comments but such as sprang immediately
from the subjects themselves.
   I rejoice in the number and activity of our provincial institutions ;
and still more that the same spirit which has of late years induced
so many Englishmen to combine for the furtherance of natural
knowledge, is extending to our colonies in America and Asia.
From the labours of so many ingenious men, united for the same
end, and with opportunities for observation so widely different, the
happiest results may be anticipated.
    I should wish to say something on the general structure of the
Alps; and to describe the speculations of one of our Foreign Mem
bers and best fellow-labourers on the different epochs of eleva
tion. These are inviting topics, to which, on a future occasion, I
may perhaps return : but had I evpn time for their discussion, it
would not be well for me, at present, to trust myself in so wide a
field.
   Of the various works which, during the past year, have been
poured out from the German and French press, on subjects con
nected with geology, it is impossible for me to offer an analysis, or
even an enumeration.         Most of them are the productions not only
of great talent, but of great good sense; not only of great labour,
but of labour happily directed.               And it is no small matter of
pride   to  this Society,   that   its  researches  have been highly valued
by   the   naturalists   of the   Continent.     They  have not given their
praises   to  us grudgingly;     but   have  sometimes   scattered them with
a lavish hand ; and have, I fear, awarded to us higher honours than
we ourselves can be conscious of deserving.             I think I could point
out more than one Essay, in which, during the past year, the geo
logists of the Continent have injured their descriptions of secon-
dary formations, and impeded their own inductive powers, by fixing
their eyes too steadily on the types of the Enlgish series.
   I congratulate you on the completion of the geological map of
Germany, by an illustrious naturalist, who for many yenrs has de
voted, and continues still to devote, the best efforts of his life to the
promotion of our science.             He has not affixed his name to this
great  work,    and he perhaps      still regards some parts of it but as an
approximation.        The elaborate and accurate maps of north-western
Germany by       Professor    Hoffmann, and of the Odenwald and the
neighbouring      districts by Dr. Klipstein, belong also to the produc-

tions of the past year *. Professor Hoffmann's map is to us of pe
culiar interest ; not merely from the extent and intricacy of the
country it delineates; but also from the number of secondary for
mations which it represents, in perfect conformity with the subdi
visions adopted in our own geological maps.          Works of this kind
are of inestimable value: they are the embodied results of observa
tions without number, directed to one object ; and, when well per
formed, may be regarded as the last generalizations from facts ex
hibited in their clearest and simplest form.      But more than this,—
they guide us to the fountain-head of information, and lead us to
still more general conclusions, by giving us at every step of our
 way the means of comparison with the structure of other regions f.
    To some admirable works on natural history, now in progress,
which bear more or less directly on our subject, I have no time
to allude.    But I may point, with peculiar satisfaction, to the ad
vancement of the work of M. Adolphe Brongniart on fossil plants,
and to the appearance of a new number of the work of Goldfuss
 on organic remains.        By the continued labours of these excellent
 naturalists, we are supplied with new terms of geological compari
 son, and new means of legitimate induction.         I am happy also to
 announce the approaching publication of a general index to the
 volumes of Mr. Sowerby's " Mineral Conchology," in which the
 errors incidental to such a work will be corrected, and all the fos
 sils arranged according to their position in the successive groups
 of the British strata. Such an Index has long been wanted ; and
 its execution will be an advantage above all price to the student of
 secondary geology.
     Each succeeding year places in a stronger point of view the
 importance of organic remains, when we attempt to trace the va
 rious periods and revolutions in the history of the globe. Crystal
 line rocks are found associated with the strata of almost every
 age ; and the constant laws of combination which have produced
 a certain mineral form in rocks of one era, may produce it again
 in another. Nearly all the modifications of structure in rocks called
 primary are also found in secondary formations: and among tertiary
 deposits we sometimes find millstone-grit, red marl with fibrous
 gypsum, red conglomerates, compact, subcrystalline, and oolitic
 limestone; in short, all the distinguishing characters of secondary
 formations.    The great barriers, which the fancy or ingenuity of

 published) of the districts north of the Main ; on the same scale, and of
 the same extent, with the Odenwald map.
    t The geological maps of Germany are sold by Simon Schropp and Co.
 of Berlin. I take this opportunity of observing, that the difficulty of pro
 curing copies of works like these has long been a matter of complaint.
 Of the excellent geological map, by MM. Oeynhausen, von Dechen, and
 De la Roche, though published in 1825, not a single copy has, I believe,
 yet found its way into the shops of any of our geographers.      I only pro
 cured it myself at Berlin.

the other. I do not deny the importance of mineralogical charac
ters ; I only mean to assert that, taken by themselves, they are no
certain indications of the age of any deposit whatsoever.
    In reasoning from organic remains, from the succession of large
groups alone can we establish any safe induction.         Positive rules
founded on the presence of particular genera or species are of com
paratively small value.      But the mind becomes wearied and bewil
dered by the endless succession of individual forms, and delights to
take refuge in some generalization : and generalizations would be
excellent things if we could be persuaded to part with them as easily
as we form them. They might then be used like the shifting hypo
theses in certain operations of exact science, by help of which we
gradually approximate nearer and nearer to the truth.
    In England, and many other parts of the north of Europe, num-
mulites are only found in tertiary rocks, and orthoceratites only in
those of the transition periods ; but in the secondary limestone of
the Alps we find, abundantly, both orthoceratites and nummulites.
 Ammonites and belemnites have not yet been found among the
 strata called tertiary.    But should the chasm between the secon
 dary   and tertiary systems    ever be filled up, it may be as difficult
 to draw any line between them, as it now is to draw the line be
 tween the transition and secondary series. Belemnites descend no
 lower than the lias. Ammonites descend among the transition rocks:
 and it has been remarked, that in all the deposits under the lias,
 the concamerations of this genus are of a simpler figure (being
 marked at their junction with the outer shell only by lines undula
 ting or in zig-zag,) than those of the corresponding fossils in the
 higher formations.      As far as regards the English carboniferous and
 transition series, this rule is true. But the only ammonite I ever
 found in the magnesian limestone had those suture-like markings
 which distinguish this genus in the upper secondary beds.           The
 producta is not found above the magnesian limestone (zechstein):
 it occurs abundantly in the lower part of that formation, and it
 also abounds among the fossils of the transition periods.          Cer
 tain plants are eminently characteristic of our coal formations ; but
 in England they also occur in the sandstone beds, which alternate
 with the mountain limestone. Near Magdeburg they are found in
 grauwacke; and M. Elie de Beaumont has, on the south flank of the
 Alps, found the same vegetable forms in beds of the age of our lias.
 Positive and negative rules like these, when kept in subordination
 to new facts, are of the greatest value ; for they record in a few
 words the result of many observations.
     When we examine a series of formations which are in contact,
 we constantly find them passing into each other : and when we
  place the groups of fossils derived from the successive terms of
  the series in the order of superposition, their passage is still more
 striking.    I do not mean by this to vindicate the transmutation of
  species ; because that doctrine is opposed by all the facts of any
                                     2 R 2                          value

  value in determining such a question.           Neither do I assume any
  positive  law  of continuity  such  as  may   be  predicated of a formula
  in exact science. I only wish to state a fact of general observation.
  We sometimes, however, find that this order in the works of na
  ture is interrupted ; a leaf seems to be torn out from the volume
  of her history.     At the same time all the connecting links, which
  bind the successive mineral masses to each other, are broken ; and
  their separation is marked by contortions and disruptions, by
  heaps of conglomerate, and by all the other proofs of violent internal
  commotions.       But these internal commotions have not been uni
  versal : and when we get beyond their operation, we recover the
  lost page in the history of the world, as it is told in the succession
  of animal forms, and every thing is again reduced to harmony and
  order.    I do not intend to deny that there may have been certain
 great epochs of elevation, of such wide-spreading violence as to
 affect every living thing on the face of the earth. This is a mere
  question of fact, and to be resolved solely by observation.           I only
  wish to vindicate a principle which we know from experience to
 be of very extensive application, and to which I have before alluded
 in this address. I may therefore again be permitted to enforce it by
 a specific illustration.
     In many parts of the west of England, the lias is only separated'
 from the coal measures by a few hundred feet of red sandstone and
 conglomerate, which do not contain the vestige of an organic fossil.
 It might be supposed (and such a supposition would not be new)
 — that the red sandstone and conglomerate were formed during some
 short period of confusion, produced by the dislocation of the older
 rocks — that after a time the sea again became tranquil — and that
 the fossils of the lias were called into being, upon the ruins of an
 older world, by a new fiat of creative power.          Nor should I object
 much to such a hypothesis, if it were only regarded as a mere ex
 planation of local phaenomena.      But the fossils of the coal measures
bear no resemblance to the fossils of the lias. There          is, therefore,
such    a  break of continuity, that we are forced in imagination to
 supply many new groups of organic forms, before we can bring the
order of succession into accordance with the known analogies of na
ture.     If we continue our investigations to the north of England,
we see the coal measures less disturbed, and the dolomitic conglo
merates less developed. We find, at the same time, new divisions
of the dolomites some of which abound in organic remains, having
                  ;
a   resemblance to the fossils of the carboniferous strata, and being
in  a  few instances specifically the same with them.          We also find
among them many new species of organized beings. Still the
sequence    is incomplete ;   the fossils of the dolomitic beds make but
little approach to the fossils of the lias and no part of the British
                                            :
Isles has hitherto supplied us with the intervening terms of the series.
But if   we extend our inquiries to the secondary formations of Ger
many and France (particularly       in  the regions of the Vosges, or on
the banks of the Neckar), we meet with       a   solution of our difficulties.
In the place of our barren deposits, between the magnesian lime
                                                                        stone

stone and the lias, we have three great formations, each charac
terized by its suite of fossils ; and among them we find a series of
zoophytes, and shells, and great reptiles, gradually leading us to
the organic types of the lias and the oolites.    In proof of what I am
stating,  I need  only refer you  to that part of  our collection, whi^
we owe to the liberality of M. Voltz, whose labours have thrown
so great a light upon this interesting chapter of the physical history
of the earth.
    In this way, by successive but secure inductions, we resolve our
first difficulty; and are no longer startled at the change of organic
types, in the west of England, between the coal measures and the
lias. For between the times of their deposition, there were com
pleted at least five great geological periods ; each distinguished
 by its own group of animals, and each, therefore, probably con
 tinued during a long succession of ages.        I must, however, for
 bear : the subject is boundless ; but our time allows not of further
details.
     It   I think, a matter of regret that there have not appeared, from
          is,
time to   time, in our language, works placing clearly before the world
the progress of geology, the laws of its induction, and the subjects of
its speculations. Such works, however, demand more than common
powers, — a grasp of details only acquired by practical experience;
and habits of mind fitted for the exhibition of them, in their most
simple and general form.         But above all, they require a moral ele
vation, and a dignified forbearance, to free the mind from those at
tractive visions of ancient cosmogony, and those seductions of fanciful
hypotheses, by which the history of geology has so often been de
graded.
    It is indeed true that an essay representing our science as it now
 is, must in    afew years be left at    distance by the progress of new
                                           a
discoveries. At the same time, to no works in the history of physics
do we revert with more pleasure and instruction, than to those
which record the progress of discovery, and the early approxima
tions to general truth. Their lessons of wisdom remain and we     ;
look back to them with veneration, as to ancient monuments, which,
however rude, or ill suited to the fashion of our day, still bear the
stamp of the genius that produced them.
    But, Gentlemen,        our science has not been adorned
                              if                             in  this country

                                           its monuments of wisdom,   it  has
been disfigured          by
                       its monuments of folly.      There have issued from
 the English press, within        few years, such dreams of cosmogony as

 readier road to their own conclusions.            would be

 them — that the records of mankind offer no single instance of any

  and observation ; and in advancing, by such means, to those general
  laws by which all things are bound together. They seem not to
  know that inventive power in physics, unlike inventive power in works
  of art or of imagination, finds no employment in ideal creations,
  and only means the faculty by which the mind clearly apprehends the
  relations and analogies of things already known ; and is thereby direct
  ed and urged on to the discovery of new facts, by the help of new
  comparisons — that the history of all ages (and I might add, the writ
  ten law of our being, where it is declared that by the sweat of our brow
  shall we gather up our harvest) has proved this way of slow and
  toilsome induction to be the only path which leads to physical truth.
     Laws for the government of intellectual beings, and laws by which
  material things are held together, have not one common element to
  connect them. And to seek for an exposiiion of the phenomena of the
  natural world among the records of the moral destinies of mankind,
  would be as unwise, as to look for rules of moral government among
  the laws of chemical combination.         From the unnatural union of
  things so utterly incongruous, there has from time to time sprung up
 in this country a deformed progeny of heretical and fantastical con
 clusions, by which sober philosophy has been put to open shame, and
 sometimes even the charities of life have been exposed to violation.
     No opinion can be heretical but that which is not true. Conflict
 ing falsehoods we can comprehend ; but truths can never war against
 each other.    1 affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from
 the results of our inquiries, provided they be followed in the labo
 rious, but secure road of honest induction.      In this way we may rest
 assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any
 truth, either physical or moral, from whatsoever source that truth
 may be derived : nay rather (as in all truth there is a common es
 sence), that new discoveries will ever lend support and illustration
 to things which are already known, by giving us a larger insight into
 the universal harmonies of nature.
     Had the authors to whom I have alluded, contented themselves
 with pointing out the errors of our logic, and the fallacies of our in
 duction, they might, perhaps, have done us some service.           For it
 cannot be denied that we have sometimes lost ourselves amidst the
 strange forms of nature which have started up before us, during our
 wanderings among the monuments of an older world : and in the re
cords of our labours, a critical eye may perhaps sometimes discover
that the modesty of our facts is but ill assorted with the boldness of
 our conclusions.
    I should have been well content to have ended with these general
censures. But during the past year there has been sent forth, by
one of our own body, " a New System of Geology, in which the great
revolutions of the earth and of animated nature are reconciled at once
to modern science and to sacred history :" and to this title 1 will
venture to add, — in which the worst violations of philosophic rule, by
the daring union of things incongruous, have been adopted by the
author from others, and at the same time decorated by new fan
tasies of his own.     I shall not stop to combat the bold and unautho
                                                                     rized

                         Geological Society.                        Sll
rized hypothesis, that nil the successive formations of the old schistose
rocks were called into being simultaneously by a fiat of creative
power anterior to the existence of creatures possessing life : nor
shall I urge, that among these primitive creations of the author,
are mountain masses of rock formed by mechanical degradation from
rocks which preceded them, and beds of organic remains, — placed
there, if we may believe his system, in mere mockery of our senses; —
neither shall I detain you by dwelling upon the errors and contra
dictions which are scattered through the early pages of his volume.
On this part of the " New System" all criticism is uncalled for here ;
for it soars far above us and our lowly contemplations.      Its charac
ter is written, and its very physiognomy appears in that dignified
and oracular censure which he himself has quoted from the works
of Bacon : " Tanto magis haec vanitas inhibenda venit et coercenda,
quia ex divinorum et humanorum male-.sana admixtione, non so-
lum educitur philosophia phantastica, sed etium religio haeretica."
"This vanity merits castigation and reproof the more, as from the
mischievous    admixture of divine and human things, there is com
pounded at once a fantastical philosophy and an heretical reli
gion."
    All these things, Gentlemen, I shall pass over : but the author has
stood forward as the popular expositor of the present state of secon
dary geology ; of that very portion of our science, which has for
so many years employed the best efforts of our Society. This part
of the work appears not to contain one original fact, or the result
 of one original investigation : and of this we do not complain. We
have, however, a right to look to it for information, which shall not
 repeat exploded errors ; but shall make a near approach to the level
 of recent observations. But is this the case in the work before us ?
 Unquestionably not. All the old errors in the arrangement of the
English strata, between the chalk and the oolites, are unaccountably
repeated; — errors which have been corrected since 1824, in our
Transactions, in English and Scotch philosophical journals, and in
various independent works of natural history ; and have excited, du
 ring the lust five or six years, more discussions in this room than
 have arisen out of any other part of secondary geology.      Other anti
 quated errors, of like kind, have found a place of refuge in the pages
 of this " New System."
    But let us pass over what may be, perhaps, only regarded as errors
 of omission, and see how the author has employed the materials
 before him.    The best part of his narrative is made up of successive
 extracts, often taken word for word, yet without the marks of quota
 tion, from various well-known works on geology. Many of these
 extracts, although in themselves admirable, appear in the book be
 fore us but as disjointed fragments, in the arrangement of which
 the author has but ill performed the humble duties of a compiler.
 For in the chapter on secondary formations, we find enormous faults
 and dislocations, of which there   .is  neither any written record, nor
 any archetype  in   the book of Nature. Thus we find the lias some
 times below the oolites, sometimes between the oolites and the
                                                                   green-
                                                                            ,

green-sand*.         In one page the cornbrash and forest marble have
shifted places ; in another the whole lower oolitic system is abso
lutely inverted t- Again, at p. 247, we are told that the several beds
are given
              " as usual, in the ascending order ;" yet in this very page
the inferior members of the lower oolites are copied, word for word,
from another book, and are in the descending order.             On the next
leaf, the same error is repeated in a still worse form : and within
four pages of this last bouleversement we find the Oxford clay, the
cornbrash, and the forest marble, twice shuffled under the great
oolite J. The goodly pile, Gentlemen, which many of you have
helped to rear, after years of labour, has been pulled down and re
constructed : but with such unskilful hands that its inscriptions are
turned upside down ; its sculptured figures have their heads to the
ground, and their heels to the heavens ; and the whole fabric, amid
the fantastic ornaments by which it is degraded, has lost all the beauty
and the harmony of its old proportions.
     So much has been written in illustration of the zoological history
of our several formations, that the labour of a compiler is now made
 comparatively easy.       Yet in the distribution of organic remains,
given     in the " New   System," there is such a complication of errors
as nearly baffles all attempts at description.        In one place we are
 told, that the lower secondary rocks are characterized by the sim
 plest forms of the animal kingdom.          In another, we find fish enu
merated among the fossils of the transition (or submedial) strata §.
 In one place our magnesian limestone is properly identified with
the first Hot/- limestone of Werner.       In another, our mountain lime
stone is placed on the same parallel ; and, by a double blunder, is
described " as the lowest sepulchre of vertebral animals ||."
    In one page orthoceratites are brought near the order of corals.
In another, a coral is figured as an encrinite. In a third, the Steeple
Ashton caryophyllia (the characteristic fossil of the middle oolite),
is figured as a fossil of the inferior system.       In a fourth, a caryo
phyllia of the mountain limestone is figured among the organic
remains of the cornbrash.        And lastly, the celebrated lily encrinite
(a characteristic fossil of the muschel-kalk, a formation unknown
in England) is introduced and figured among the fossils of the lower
oolitic system H.
    Errors like these are above every thing calculated to mislead men
who are unpractised in geology ; and they do not terminate here.

    Are we then for ever to wander among the mere perplexities of
details, and never to hope for any system by which we may com
bine them ? You must have seen, Gentlemen, that am not the ad         I
vocate of any such steril sentiment. It is indeed true that in the
very classification of our facts and of our phenomena, there are
difficulties connected with all parts of natural history, which, for
ages yet to come, may continue to require for their solution a com
bination of the greatest industry with the greatest skill. But these
difficulties do honour to our science : and the same great rule by
which the father of physical astronomy was guided, applies, at
every step, to us and to our conclusions.

conchologist      is  confounded at the sight of the well known turrilites and
 hamites of the green-sand group, of the turritellae and superb rostellaria ma-
croptera of the London clay, jostled in among the fossils of the oolites.
 Had the author drawn out by lot, from all the fossils in Mr. Sowerby's
work, the species which were to decorate this plate, chance might have
given him a more illustrative series.
    Plate V. " Shells of the Chalk and Superior Strata." Among the nineteen
figures of this plate, no attempt        is made to separate the shelli of the chalk
from those of the overlying tertiary deposits; although the two groups have
 not perhaps one species in common.             In Plate two freshwater shells were

 racteristic, but are omitted altogether        ;   and the pecten quinquecostatus
is  the characteristic fossil of the green-sand.

 of organic remains, could never have been led into such complication of  a
 errors and they are the more discreditable, as the greater part of them
      :

 duced by the action of material things upon each other : and we
 know that the laws by which these material things are governed, are
 liable neither to change nor intermission.         There is, therefore, one
 safe rule in all our inquiries, whether tiiey be simple or complicated.
 Effects similar in kind to those which are produced now, must in all
 former times have been produced by some corresponding power of
 nature.
     As the historians of the natural world, we can describe the order
 of the events which are past ; and we can trace a succession of re
 volutions through which we go back, till we arrive at periods where
 the characters of nature's work are all obliterated, and there our
 descriptions end. Like things we can compare with like ; and this
 comparison teaches us the analogies of the forms which we exa
 mine : but we define not the length of time during which they were
 elaborated ; and still less do we dare to speculate about the physical
 revolutions of the ages which are to come.
    The very commencement of the task of speculative geology re
 quires a wide and philosophic knowledge of the physical world as it
 now   is,and of all the great phenomena exhibited by the fragments
 of its former history.      A    mind so prepared has already within its
 grasp the means of large induction and our science, though hardly
                         a                :
 yet come out of its cradle, has supplied materials of thought for       in
 tellects the most robust, and results to satisfy imaginations the most
 ardent. Let us, therefore, go on as we have begun       ;    giving up our
 best efforts to the search of new facts and of new phamomena, and
 using them like men who have no higher passion than the love of
 truth.
    The greatest problems of astronomy are simple in their conditions.
 A few physical points moving        in free space, with given velocities, in
 given directions, and acting upon each other in subordination to a
 given law, — these constitute the chief data for the mathematical analysis
 of the system of the heavens. And the results are of corresponding
                                                          a
 simplicity. The phenomena of the heavens are demonstratively proved
 to recur in     afixed order, after the lapse of fixed periods of time; and
 the apparent aberrations from the'general law are also proved to be but
modifications of that law, and to return into themselves after the com
 pletion of definite secular periods. But where are the secular periods
of geology, and where are its cycles of phenomena recurring, again
and again, in        acertain order
                                 ?   I  must confess that can not discover
                                                       I
 even the traces of them     ;   and
                                  I    think we do injustice to our subject,
 in bringing     it too nearly into comparison with the exacter sciences.
    The earth has been brought into its present form by countless
causes, of which we know nothing — by corpuscular and chemical ac
tion, varied by changes of temperature, of pressure, and of all other
external conditions — by the violence of volcanic forces, culled into
         by by
being       unknown powers of nature, and at unknown intervals of
time —       all the combined effects of mechanical degradation — and by
all the endless modifications of matter, resulting from beings possess,
ing the organs of life. These conditions are infinitely too complex
and ill defined to come within the grasp of any exact analysis.
                                                                I     believe

    I believe therefore that our subject will never be so far abstracted from
the materials which weigh it down, as to rise to the rank of an exact
science. But this, at least, I will dare to predict ; that so long as we
are of one mind, and animated by our present spirit, year after year,
we shall find new fields for investigation, and new grounds for ra
tional induction.      That which is exact in science must be circum
scribed and defined : but of our labours we have no power to foresee
the limits ; and there is an intense and poetic interest in the very un
certainty and boundlessness of our speculations.
    It is no small advantage that our studies are so large and so va
rious, that they not only carry us into all the kingdoms of nature,
but have a direct bearing on the business of life. Of their econo
mical importance, I have, however, now no time to speak ; and I
would rather conclude by reminding you of their importance in all
questions of physical geography, to which they are as essential as
anatomy to the sculptor, or the knowledge of ancient tongues to
the decipherer of ancient monuments — of the light they have shed
on every branch of natural history — and of the problems they have
suggested to the investigations of exact science.            Our field is in
deed so large, and our physical problems of such complexity, that we
 find at every step, how much we stand in need of the support of
our fellow-labourers ; and this feeling has produced a strong social
uympathy, not merely among us, but among the geologists of all the
nations of Europe.       And it is to this principle that I am willing to
attribute a part of the great excitement which has hitherto carried us
on, and of those youthful and lusty efforts, which are the best indi
cations both of our physical and of our moral health.
    And now, Gentlemen, after having detained you so long, allow
me to express my gratitude for the kind assistance which I have re
ceived from you in discharging all the duties of my office during
the past year.      And if your lives and mine should be spared till ano
ther Anniversary, I hope to have the delightful task of recounting to
you the still more extended labours of our body, and of rejoicing with
you at the gathering in of a still richer harvest.
 FRIDAY-EVENING         PROCEEDINGS AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION
                            OF GREAT BRITAIN.
    Feb. 26 — Mr. Watson gave an account of the means of preventing
ships from foundering at sea. He illustrated his proposed method by
the use of numerous models, and by experimental illustrations of
the actual floatage or buoyant power of certain bulks of different
kinds of wood used in ship building. The principle which he adopts,
and upon which every thing rests, is the buoyant power of tight
copper tubes filled with air and built in with the vessel in the va
rious convenient situations afforded in the lower part, as between
the timbers, under the decks, &c.          He illustrated his calculations
by a model of an 80-gun ship, and         then   drew the results as to ex
pense, saving,     &c.  upon  the  same  scale.   His conclusion was, that
the saving of property and lives would be very great, and the adap
tation very practicable.

    A microscope constructed for Capt. Grover, and the first con
taining the application of Dr. Wollaston's doublet, was exhibited in
the library.    It performed exceedingly well : it was made from the
model left by Dr. Wollaston to Capt. Kater.
    March 5. — The subject this evening was, On the transmission of
musical sounds through linear conductors, and their ultimate reci
procation.     It was delivered by Mr. Faraday, but he informed the
 members that the matter, experiments, and new facts which he
 should have to bring forward, were altogether Mr. Wheatstone's.
 The general nature of musical sound was first distinguished from
 noise, and then its transmission through different bodies illustrated.
The views gradually developed by Bacon, Hooke, and others, down
 to the present time, were detailed, by which ultimately we had
gained much accurate knowledge of the conduction of sound through
solid conductors.
    After this the nature of the sounding-boards of instruments was
 entered upon, and it was shown how the vibrations of a string, rod
 or other almost inaudible phonic could be rendered strong and
 powerful when transmitted to planes extended in the direction per
pendicular to the course of the vibrations, and also how far the in
 closed volumes of air between the tablets of an instrument still
further exalted the sound by resonance, and rendered it evident.
    The conduction of sound by linear bodies and its ultimate reci
procation was then taken up, and numerous experimental illustra
tions were adduced.       A tuning-fork vibrating on the roof of the
Lecture-room had its vibration communicated inaudibly through
forty feet or more of deal rod to the floor below, and then the
sound developed by reciprocation ; so that those close even to the
tuning-fork referred the origin of the sound to the lower end of
the apparatus. Conducting rods and wires were passed through the
floor of the Lecture-room into a repository below, and the sounds
of a piano transmitted from below to a harp above, whilst the sounds
of the harp in the Lecture-room were transmitted to the piano
forte below.     The music of stringed instruments, wind instruments,
and even of the orchestrina or symphonium was equally well trans
mitted, being rendered evident and audible onlj at the place where
by pre-arrangement their reciprocation had been provided for.
 Mr. Wheatstone intends shortly to arrange the new matter which
he has been able to add to this branch of acoustical science in a
separate form. Parts of it are already before the public in the An
nals of Philosophy, and Quarterly Journal of Science.
    March 12. — This evening Mr. Brande gave an account of the
composition of Urinary calculi, and particularly of Dr.WoIlaston's
discoveries in that branch of chemistry. He did this, he said, because
he was fully convinced that, if timely attention were paid to the
attacks of sand and gravel in their early stages, many persons would
be saved from the dreadful attacks of stone, and the evil cured be
fore it had become unmanageable.
   After stating what had been done before Dr. Wollaston's time,
and then what nad been effected by him, Marcet, Prout, and others,
                                                                     he

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                317
he referred at last to the cases of Siliceous calculi, and stated that
some new matter had been added to the subject lately, on this point,
by Dr. Yelloly ; but as we understand Dr. Yelloly's paper will come
before the Royal Society, we shall probably have occasion to notice
it more minutely hereafter.
    March 19. — The evening was.'occupied by Mr. Ritchie, who gave
an account of the methods proposed for measuring the intensities
of natural and artificial light. He referred to the methods of Bou-
guer, Leslie, Rumford, and others; and amongst the rest to that upon
which his own photometer is founded. This and the other instruments
are known to the public.        Mr. Ritchie's appears to be a very accu
rate and convenient instrument in numerous cases. By means of it
the light of an Argand oil lamp and a gas lamp were compared ; also
 the light of the Argand lamp and wax candles. The light of phos
phorus burning in oxygen gas was compared to the light of the
candle and lamp ; and also a comparison made of the light of a
 wax-candle with that of the ball of lime ignited by the oxyhydrogen
 flame, as in Lieut. Drummond's application.          Mr. Ritchie proposes
 to  ascertain  these   numbers    very accurately, and give the results
 to the public.

     ACTION OF METALS ON WATER AND CARBONIC ACID, &C.
     M. Despretz has stated to the French Academy, that nickel, cobalt,
  zinc, and tin, possess, like iron, the property of decomposing water at
  a red heat, and that their oxides are reduced by hydrogen at the same
  temperature ; he has also observed that carbonic acid is converted by
  zinc and tin into oxide of carbon, and that this gas completely reduces
  the oxides of these metals. Thus a fact, which was considered as ano
  malous, extends to several metals and binary compounds. — Le Globe.
                           GLACIAL ACETIC ACID.
     M. Despretz also    states that crystallizable acetic acid may be pro
  cured by heating a mixture of an atom of acetate of lead, well dried,
  with one of concentrated sulphuric acid ; and he further mentions,
  that in a good forge, at a high temperature, a mixture of sulphur and
  oxide of zinc yielded a sulphuret, which experienced mineralogists
  mistook for blende or native sulphuret. — Ibid.

    General Observations.— The weather this month has been mostly frosty,
with  a humid and cloudy atmosphere, and occasional gales of wind.       The
first six days and nights were extremely cold.      Early in the morning of
the 2nd the ground was lightly covered with snow, and a thick crust of ice
continued all day on the inside of the windows in apartments with fire.
The maximum temperature of the air did not exceed 21 degrees, and the
minimum was within 13 degrees of zero ; consequently this was the coldest
day and night here, during the last fifteen years at least ; and we suspect
that a lower temperature has not been fairly registered in the south of
England and in the vicinity of the sea, since Six's thermometer has been
in use. The day was fine, with light snow, and the night cloudless, with
a dry gale from N.E.     At the time of this low temperature at 1 1 o'clock
P.M., a wet finger, after being exposed to the wind about two minutes,
adhered to a bar of iron : spittle applied to the same bar became solid ice
in four seconds of time, and in six seconds on a fir rail.  An adherence of
a wet finger to iron did not succeed with a temperature of 16 degrees and
a moister wind; therefore, in this as well as in former experiments, it ap
peared that the drier the air     whether in motion or quiescent, the more
                                     is,
rapid    the congelation of water, &c. It also snowed on the 3rd, which was
        is
nearly as cold as the preceding day. On the 4th the ice had much increased
in Portsmouth harbour, in some places to the distance of three hundred
yards from the western shore. Light snow descended in the morning of
the 5th from     mixture of black and white cumuli: the night was very cold,
                 a
the minimum temperature being         degrees.

and Fareham lakes, branching from the harbour, were firmly frozen over
this and the preceding day ; and on the reflux of the tide, immense masses
of salt-water ice presented a snowy aspect about the shores to the distance
of two or three miles, as far as the eye could perceive.
    In the morning of the 6th there was much rime on the ground, &c. with
faint sunshine; opposite winds in the day, and a little snow by night. During
the morning of the /th the sky was overcast, the clouds lowering, and the
wind from every quarter of the compass, with a rising temperature.                         In
the afternoon a gale sprung up from the S.W., which caused a sudden
breaking up of the frost and a very rapid thaw, when a great quantity of ice
in a connected chain upwards of a mile in length was carried out of the
harbour; and copious streams of water ran down the wainscots and
walls in apartments without fire. The successive masses of ice which had
broken away from the lakes and the shores of Southampton river, had
also a novel appearance in going out with the tide this and the two pre
 ceding days.
    From this time to the 21st, the nights were generally frosty,-and the
 last seven days the temperature of the air increased with a moist S.W.
wind, accompanied with fogs, mild light rains, and spring-like weather at
intervals.     The difference between the temperature of the 2nd and 26th
 was 3SJ degrees.
    The large lunar halo that appeared in the evening of the 28th, was re
markable for the breadth of its edge, which was upwards of three degrees,
 and of a faint vapourish colour; within the halo a close yellow corona ap
 peared round the moon, which, with Aldebaran and the Pleiades, formed
 an isosceles triangle, Aldebaran being to the southward.
     The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
 observations this month, are, four solar and four lunar halos, lightning and
 thunder early in the morning of the 23rd, and six gales of wind, or days on
 which they have prevailed ; namely, two from the North-east, three from
 the South-west, and one from the West.

X L V. Letterfrom      the Rev. Dr. W. Buckland, F.R.S. %c. Pro
   fessor of Mineralogy    and Geology in the University of Oxford,
    on the Discovery of Coprolites in North America.
       Dear Sir,
 | HASTEN intotheannounce
-*•
                               of
                                 a discovery of the occurrence of
     Coprolites          State    New  Jersey, which has just been
communicated to me by Mr. J.         E. Dekay of New York; and
as this is the first recognition of these substances in the trans
atlantic world,  I think it due to Mr. Dekay to publish his dis
covery   in his own   words, extracted from his letter to me on
this subject
    " Sir, — Among    the various organic remains of our country
whicli have attracted my attention, there is one specimen that
has puzzled me exceedingly. Being aware of the strange and
anomalous forms exhibited among the extinct saurians, I was
disposed at one time to consider it as a tooth, and should most
probably have published it as such; when a
notice of your interesting coprological re
searches met my eye. The notice (Loudon's
Magazine) was short, but sufficiently satis
factory; and I now am enabled to state that
faecal matter resembling your Sauro-copros
has been found in the unconsolidated se
condary strata of the United States. There
is but a solitary specimen in our cabinet, or
 I would send it to you with much pleasure.
I have procured casts of it in wax, which I shall forward to
you. The adjoining sketch will give you an idea of this co-
prolite.    I shall ask permission of the Lyceum to allow it to
be analysed.      My imagination may possibly be too vivid, but
    N. S. Vol. 7. No. 41. May 1830.            2 T                in

322     Dr. Buckland   on a Coprolite  found in North America,
in the confused irregularly impressed lines on the surface of
my coprolite, I feel assured that I detect the marks left by the
membranous coats of the smaller intestines.
    This substance was found some years since by Dr.Mitchill,
and presented to the Lyceum of New York. It was found in the
ferruginous sand formation of New Jersey.            I have a clue to
                   if
its locality; and my     health   permits,  will examine the country
thoroughly in the spring.        The district in which it occurs, is
referred to your green-sand formation. Dr. Morton (American
Journal, vol. xvii. p. 275) has recently described its fossil
contents. As far as I am acquainted with the subject, it ap
pears to be analogous to the chalk formations of your country
 (crate inferieure of the French geologists).       This deposit fur
nishes also Mososaurus and Geosaurus, upon which I have
written a short article for our " Annals." — But to return to
the coprolite. Its length is nine-tenths of an English inch, and
the thickness of the tblds about one-tenth ; in the lower end
the folds may be traced some distance.         Since reading the no
tice of your memoir, my attention has been called to some ap
pearances which would in all probability have otherwise escaped
my attention. In one part of the fossil, there is a quantity of
foreign substances which have not yet been faithfully examined.
It appears to be fibrous animal matter with small fragments of
quartz.        I am, Sir, with unfeigned respect,
                                   Your humble servant,
   New York, Jan. 26, 1830.                           J. E. DEKAY."
    " P.S. — I send by the same opportunity a cast of a bone of
Megalonyx (metatarsal ?) recently discovered at Big Bone
Lick."
                                 I
    Together with this letter have received the casts alluded
to therein, and entertain not the slightest doubt of the accuracy
of Mr. Dekay's conclusion respecting the coprolitic nature of
the body from which these casts are taken.          I also recognise
on their surface the fine lines and impressions derived from
the membranous coats of the small intestines.
    Mr. Dekay mentions the occurrence of an extraneous sub
stance, and of grains of quartz, within this coprolite: it is ob
vious that coprolites may contain extraneous substances of
various kinds ; viz. scales, teeth, and undigested fragments of
bones of any animal they may have devoured ; also shells, and
fragments of shells, e. g. shells of small ammonites swallowed
together with their molluscous inhabitants : since my paper on
Coprolites was printed,      I have seen a small ammonite entire,
with   its nacre beautifully iridescent,  inclosed in a coprolite, in
the collection of a lady at Lyme Regis. Miss Aiming has also
                                                               found

         Mr. Henwood       on the Steam- Engines       of Cornvxill.  323
found fragments of pearly shell in other specimens of copro-
lite from the same place. A small fragment of quartz occurring
within a coprolite may have existed in the stomach of some
animal that was devoured by the saurian or fish, from which
such coprolite has been derived ; or it may have been acci
dentally swallowed by the animals in gorging their prey at the
bottom of the sea.
    The shape and size of the American coprolite accords suf
ficiently with those we find in the inferior chalk of Sussex, to
add probability to Mr. Dekay's opinion, that it is from the
inferior chalk or green-sand formation in New Jersey. And
whatever may be its geological position, the discovery of this
specimen in North America encourages me to anticipate the
speedy verification of my conjecture, that coprolites will be
found to occur universally wherever there are fossil remains
of saurians, or of any other carnivorous animals that swal
lowed their prey entire, or which, like dogs and hyaenas, de
voured bones as well as flesh.
                                1 remain, Dear Sir, yours, &c.

 XL VI.     Observations on some late Statements by         Mr. Farey re
    specting the Steam-Engines of Cornwall.              By WM. J. HEN-
    WOOD,    F.G.S.
           To Richard Taylor, Esq. F.L.S. F.G.S. fyc.fyc.
       Sir,
 TN a late Number of the Phil. Mag. and Annals*, you have
     reprinted a part of Mr. Farcy's evidence on the patent laws,
•*,
in which are statements injurious to some of the improvers and
builders of steam-engines.          The substance of those to which
 I object, may be stated as follows :
    1st, Ascribing to Mr. Woolf the " invention of working
             steam- engines by high-pressure steam acting expan
              sively."
    2ndly,   "  The difference between the cost of coal for a given
             force of engines in 1813 and at present, would ab
             sorb the profit of all the deep mining that is now car
             ried on in Cornwall."
     Srdly, Stating " that all the engines in the county are on
             Mr. Woolf 's plan."
    1st, I  believe the invention    of expansive working has been

                                 2 T   2                             with

324       Mr. Henwood        on the Steam-Engines    of Cornwall.
with propriety ascribed to Mr. Watt by every person, except
ing Mr. Farey : and in another place* even he has concurred
in this opinion; variation in the elasticity of the steam cm-
ployed by no means affecting the invention.                Moreover, the
evidence at present before the world, seems to preponderate
against the use of steam of very high tension.
    2ndly, With regard to the performance of steam-engines, it
has been stated       f  that Mr. Watt's proposals were, that his en
gines should lift 23-44 millions of pounds one foot high, by
the consumption of one bushel ( = 84 pounds) of coal ; and
 I am informed by Mr. Sims, an engineer well known in this
county, that the average duty of Watt's engines here, whilst
superintended by his own agents, was about 25' millions; but
 this will be seen more accurately stated in a paper recently
 read before the Royal Society, by its illustrious President.
 Subsequently to Mr. Watt's relinquishing the superintendence
of the engines here, the average duty suffered a considerable
diminution.        The following may be regarded as an approxi
 mation to the duty for some years.
          Average   of all    Average  of      Highest  of   Highest of
             Cornwall.         Woolf's.         Watt's.       Woolf's.
1823            26-9 millions.  36-  millions.     40-6         47-  millions.

1825            28-97           34-7               42-3         41-9
 1826           28-36           40-4               45-4         40-4

    I  presume Mr. Farey follows many other writers, in ascri
bing to Mr. Woolfthe invention of an engine, all the mechanical
contrivances of which were made by Mr. Hornblower.                        But
the merit of invention apart, — there is not one engine on this
construction now at work in Cornwall; the last, which was at
Kuel Alfred, having been stopped in 1826. Indeed, beside some
five or six rotatory engines, neither of which exceeded twenty-
eight inches cylinder, the only engines on Mr. Woolf's plan
 (or rather on Mr. Hornblower's, erected by Mr. Woolf)
worked on the mines of this county, were at

Woolf's superintendence ceased.

XL VI I.    Some general Considerations respecting the Propa
    gation of Motion through Elastic Mediums ; with Remarks
    on a former Communication.  By J. CHALI.IS, Esq. Fellow of
    Trinity College Cambridge, and   of the Cambridge Philoso
    phical Society^.
          following mode of considering the transmission of
      motion through elastic substances, which has not yet,
I believe, occurred to any one, may serve to throw some light
on a subject confessedly difficult, but which is nevertheless
interesting; as it has direct reference to the manner in which
our organs of hearing and sight are acted upon" by external
objects.
   The elastic substance to be considered may be either solid
or fluid. Suppose an indefinitely slender column of         the                               it,
transverse section of which      every where the same, and the
                                                is
parts of which are moving in any manner, to be divided into
an indefinite number of very small equal masses.    Call a,  y,                                     /3,
three of these masses  taken  in order, of which a. nearest the               is

one to another.   Let   be the length of a,

Then the distance between the centres of gravity of a and                                           /3    is
 ^-r —    ,    and   that between              the centres      of gravity of            /3   and y,

 Each of the two systems of equations (1) and (2) refers to
propagation in a single direction ; and it will follow from the
general equation (A) that in each of the two cases the velocity
 of propagation is exactly a. This result may also be obtained
 from the equations themselves           ; for  if in   (1) x and t be made
 to vary, so that      g  does not alter,    it will be found that          =

 of propagation together with the velocity of the fluid. Hence
 the velocity of propagation is a.           If in (2) x and t be made to
 vary so that     g   remains unaltered, and consequently so that
 dv = P dt,      the resulting Value        of -j— is again a +     v.   This
 subject  I  have considered more at length in a recent com
 munication to the Cambridge Philosophical Society ; at pre
 sent I wish to make another kind of application of the equa
 tion (A).
     Experience has shown that the velocity of propagation in
 air of the same temperature is constantly the same, and is in
  dependent of the magnitude of the condensations and motions.
  The precision with which slight modifications of the disturb
  ing causes are appreciated by the ear, is very probably depen
  dent on the absolute uniformity of propagation of every indi
  vidual portion of the aerial undulations, and the constancy of
  their type during their progression.              Assuming that they are
  of this nature, the equation (A) will be applicable to aerial
  propagation.      Now, by the general consideration of fluid mo
  tion in space of one dimension, the two follow.ing equations are
  obtained:          .__

   To take another instance of propagated motion, let us con
sider the passage of light through transparent bodies according

diminished velocity of the propagation of light          the interior                       in
of mediums, to be accounted for by the existence of a less
elastic force of the aether in their interior than exterior to them.
But this supposition leaves out of consideration the obstacle to
the free motion of the particles of the aether, which must be
presented      by

larding force P, according to this view, will result from the
mean effect of the reflections of the undulations from the ma

force which under the same state of density would exist out of
the medium, might be shown to vary as the number of the
material particles in a given space, and the velocity of propa
gation conjointly ; but the reasoning for this purpose is too
long to be inserted here.    Admitting this, which of itself is

  The quantity H will be the same in different states of the
same medium, but different in different mediums. If the states
of the medium be as different as the aeriform and fluid or
solid, H will probably not retain the same value, because this
quantity must be a function depending on the arrangement of
the atoms.     If the   medium be a gas,          m   =   1    nearly, and *^-j—
is nearly constant for different states of compression. This
M. Biot has found by experiment to be the case in atmo

statesof the same medium is a result which has been deduced
from the corpuscular theory of light ; and in this respect (per
haps, in this alone) the corpuscular seemed to have the ad
vantage over the rival theory.

vdy wdz, on which the integral

 XLVIII.       On the Conversion of Right Ascension and Decli
      nation into Longitude and Latitude, and vice versa. By
      Prof. ENCKE*.
 "1TARIOUS       applications have been made to me, requesting
  *   that I would give in the Ephemeris, besides the geocentric
 right ascensions and declinations of the planets, also their lati
 tudes and longitudes, as was usual in the former construction
 of the Ephemeris, it having been hitherto the custom to ex
press the places of the planets by these latter co-ordinates.
 Without considerably enlarging the book, this wish could not
be fulfilled ;   I
                have, however, endeavoured to supply this want,
as far as it may still exist, by the following tables for approxi
mately finding these quantities with an accuracy sufficient for
nil useful purposes.                  If
                           only minutes of longitude and latitude
are required for heavenly bodies moving in the zodiac, neither
trigonometrical calculations nor logarithms will be wanted ; a
simple multiplication of two numbers will be sufficient. Com
bined with a small trigonometrical calculation they will give
both conversions with nearly the same accuracy as can be ob
tained with logarithms having five figures of decimals.

show the various beds in which the same organic remains may
occur, and at the same time to convey an idea of the organic
contents of the oolitic series in general,   have formed the fol        I
lowing table    from the authorities already mentioned,  and from
others that will be noticed in their places.  Such a table must
necessarily be very defective, and can only answer temporary
purposes but    ;     hoped that

      L.  On    M. Guinand's              Glass for Telescopes.             By M.
                                    UTZSCHNEIDER*.
T ADDRESS                  you, Sir, as a friend to truth, in order to re-
•*•
      move some unfavourable impressions which have got abroad
relative to my manufactory of glass for optical purposes.
     It is stated' in the Bibliotheque Universelle (November 1828,
page 175) that the 9-inch object glass, belonging to the Dorpat
telescope, made by Utzschneider and Fraunhofer, came from
the crucibles of M. Guinand.
     Several other journals also have repeated, from the Globe
(French newspaper) of November 1828, that MM. Thibeau-
deau and Bontemps had, in concert with M. Guinand the
son, re-discovered the secret of producing flint glass of any
magnitude, highly favourable for optical purposes ; a secret
which they pretend has been lost since the death of Fraunho
fer, and Guinand the father : and that amongst the pieces
presented to the Academy of Sciences, there were some of
fourteen inches diameter.
            * From Schumacher's Attron. Nachrichten, No.               163.
                                                                                  I do

 352    M. Utzschneider       on M. Guinand's Glass for      Telescopes.
     I do not wish to occupy the public attention about my own
 affairs ; but  I   am nevertheless obliged, by the interest which
 is attached to this singular discovery, to state some particulars
 relative to the residence of M. Guinand in my glass-house at
 Benedictbeurn.      I  have already spoken of it in 1826, in my Life
 of  Fraurihpfer  : but  it is necessary to recur to it again, in order
 to refute the reports which are circulated injurious not only to
 my establishment, but also to the memory of Fraunhofer.
     Before M.Pierre Louis Guinand entered my service,            I  made
 him communicate to me every thing he knew, up to that time,
 as to the art of making glass :       I also obtained from him a de
 scription  of  the    small  castings  made  by him since 1775: and
 I  was convinced that his efforts would not have been attended
 with any advantage either to science, or to his own interests.
 M. Guinand renewed unsuccessfully his attempts, but was not
 the less received by me.         His efforts directed me in the path
 which he ought to have pursued to obtain his object: and
 I  therefore resolved to continue to work with him, after a set
 tled plan, and to take advantage of every moment of leisure
 I  could spare from my public duties to assist at his castings.
 We obtained some pieces of flint glass, with which we made
 object glasses for instruments forming in the manufactories of
 Reichenbach, Utzschneider and Liebherr. Our labours were
 only discontinued when        I  attended my public duties :      I then
 charged M. Fraunhofer with the direction of the castings which
 were undertaken at my expense : and this excellent optician
 always gave me a written report of the experiments and castings
 that he had made.
     M. Guinand announced to me, on December 6, 1823, that
 domestic affairs required his presence at Brennets : in fact,
 he left me some time after, and never returned again to Bene
dictbeurn.
    The description of the castings of M. Guinand, written with
his own hand, and still in my possession, proves that in 1 805
he could not then make perfect flint glass : and that he would
not have succeeded but for the experiments made with me at
 Benedictbeurn, and at my expense.            Still the glass of the last
casting, which was made at the commencement of the year
 1814, was not equal in quality to that which Fraunhofer made
at a later period.
    The Jlint glass for the object glass of the Dorpat telescope
lens not cast till four years after the departure of M. Guinand,
in the thirty-third casting of December 18, 1817; as may be
seen by M. Fraunhofer's journal : and it was            I who furnished
the principal materials for this and the thirty-second casting.
    On the llth of January 1816, M. P. L. Guinand wrote to
                                                                       me

                             Royal Society.                           353
me that he was about to superintend an important glass ma
nufactory: to which I replied that he ought so to do, and re
commended him to undertake to instruct some one to make
flint and crown glass.        A short time afterwards (in a letter of
February       10, 1816)  he  again offered me his services, stating
" have recently obtained some knowledge about making
    I
glass, and have lately put it in practice by two small castings."
But, M. Guinand, at that time, still did not know how to pro
duce glass for optical purposes.
     After the departure of M. Guinand, my friend Fraunhofer
made several large and excellent castings which succeeded to
our utmost wishes. Since his death, I have myself under
taken the continuation of the manufactory of glass destined
for optical purposes ; and I believe that I can guarantee its
excellence. The object-glasses recently constructed by my
workmen, sufficiently well attest that the secret of making
flint glass, of any size, for optical purposes, is not yet lost, as
the Globe would have us believe.              I assure you I shall be
 happy to see our neighbours        follow   us, or even surpass us, in
 an art which is so immediately connected with the interests of
 science.      I shall take care, on my part, to continue the re
 searches commenced by Fraunhofer on the theory of light,
 hoping that those who contribute thereto will receive the re
 ward which they so justly deserve. Suum aiique.

           following are abstracts of papers which have been read before
 THE   the  Royal Society, during the present session.
     Mr. Lister's paper on the Compound Achromatic Microscope of
 Mr. Win. Tulley ; with some account of the present state of the mi-
 croscope, and suggestions for its improvement on a new principle.
  Communicated by Dr. Roget, Sec. R.S.
     The principles on which the reflecting, and also the achromatic
 refracting telescope are constructed, have been recently applied with
 considerable success to the microscope, and have added much to the
 power of that instrument. The author speaks with much commen
 dation of the peculiar construction adopted in Mr. Tulley's compound
 achromatic microscopes, consisting of a combination of object-glasses
 of short focus and large aperture, the curvatures of which are such as
 very nearly to equalize the refractions produced by each. As the
  magnitude of the aperture, he observes, is valuable only in proportion
  to that of the pencil of light which it admits, the latter circumstance
  is that which chiefly claims attention ; and as it is often erroneously
  estimated, a method is pointed out of ascertaining it with sufficient
      N. S. Vol. 7. No, 41. May 1830.                2 Z         exactness

exactness     for every practical purpose. He then enters into a detailed
 description of the several parts of an instrument in his possession,
 constructed on the principles he recommends, referring to the draw
 ings which accompany the paper.            The magnifying power may be
 varied at pleasure, either by drawing out the tubes containing the eye
 pieces, or by substituting an eye-glass of different power or differently
 combined j and by these changes an uninterrupted range of ampli
 fication is obtained from 35 to 800 diameters. No sensible loss as to
 distinctness is observable, whether the effect is produced by changing
  the eye- piece or by varying the length of the tubes. The construction
 of the instrument admits of the utmost variation of magnifying power,
 without the risk of losing sight of the object viewed ; and every part
 which relates to the illumination being wholly detached from the
 stage, ample opportunity is afforded of rapidly moving the objects,
 and bringing into view a succession of them, while the light remains
 the same.       Minute directions are given for the employment of the
 instrument, and its application to various purposes ; and great stress
 is laid on the importance of a skilful management of the light.            In
 stating the results of his experience on this subject, the author takes
 occasion to advert to some of the sources of fallacy, by which in
 cautious observers with the microscope have so often been greatly
misled. When a pencil of rays proceeding from an indefinitely small
bright portion of an object is brought to a focus by the most perfect
 object-glass, the image thus formed is in reality not a point, but
 a small circle, and will always appear as such, if the eye-glass of the
microscope be sufficiently powerful. These circles have a considerable
analogy to the spacious discs of stars viewed through telescopes.
 Like the latter, they become much enlarged by diminishing the aper
 ture of the object-glass ; and they are also enlarged by increasing
 the intensity of the illumination.         The overlapping of contiguous
 circles  of  diffusion   has  given  rise to  many fallacious appearances,
 (such   as  the  spottiness    which  some   surfaces  assume,) which have
 been mistaken for globules.        This optical illusion has been the basis
 of some ingenious but visionary speculations on the intimate structure
 of organic matter. The appearance, in certain directions of the light,
 of lines on the surface of an object where they do not really exist,
 may be traced to a similar cause.
    The author proceeds to describe the method he uses for measuring
the dimensions of the objects viewed; and notices different test-ob
jects with reference to their affording the means of judging of the
 powers of the instrument.         He next enters into a review of the com
 parative   merits   of various  microscopes   constructed by Cuthbert and
 Dollond in this country.and by Chevalier, Selligue, Amici, Utzschnei-
 der, and Fraunhofer, on the continent.
    The concluding part of the paper is occupied by the development
of a principle, from the application of which to the construction of the
 microscope, the author expects that a still greater extension of its
powers will, ere long, be obtained. He remarks, that the circumstance
 which limits the magnitude of the pencil, admissible with high powers
by a single achromatic object-glass,      is,  that the correction for spheri -
                                                                           cal

cal aberration by the concave lens is proportionally greater for the
rays that are remote from the centre, than for the central rays.   The
degree of confusion in the image hence arising,     in similar glasses,  is,
inversely as the square of their focal lengths.      increases very ra   It
pidly with   small enlargement of the aperture, but may be rendered'
                    a
much less considerable by distributing the refractions equally among
a greater number of lenses of smaller curvature.   Hence the advan
tage obtained                by
                  certain combinations. The experiments made      the                        by
author have established the fact, that  general an achromatic object-
                                                                in
glass, of which the inner surfaces are in contact, will have on one
side   of   two aplanatic foci           its axis, for the rays proceeding from
                                                  in
which,      it it
            will be truly    corrected,    with     moderate operation

those proceeding from any part of the interval between these two
points, the spherical aberration will be over-corrected and that for            ;
rays beyond these limits              will be under-corrected.

pointed   out  for  ascertaining     the  situation   of these  aplanatic foci. The
principle   here  explained     furnishes   the  means    of destroying both kinds

   The observations made on an Aurora Borealis which appeared on
the night of the 14th of December, are particularly detailed.                    On
that occasion the disturbance of the magnetic declination was so
great, and so frequently changing from east to west, and the reverse,
as to leave no doubt           the mind of the author of the reality of this
                                       in
influence. The needle, however, was affected at those times only when
the fringes of the aurora were                  position such as to include the
                                                       in   a
needle in their planes.           appeared to him also, that the side towards
                                        It
which the needle declined was the greater, where the aurora gave out
the most vivid light.
   His experiments on the oscillations of the needle have not yet
enabled him to determine satisfactorily whether any change of mag
netic intensity accompanied these changes of direction.
   In  a second letter, dated 26th December, he gives the results of
                                         2Z2                                   later

 later observations.    From a comparison of his own with the observa
 tions of the Rev. James Paull, minister of Tully-nestle, he infers that the
 height of the particular aurora which was seen by them on the 20th,
 did not, at its upper extremities, exceed 4000 feet above the ground ;
 and is led to the general conclusion, that the aurora borealis is situated
 in the region immediately above the clouds, and therefore varies
 much in height, according to the different states of the atmosphere.
 He believes it to be an effect of the development of electricity from
 the condensation of vapour. The position of the fringes which
 are constantly at right angles to the magnetic meridian, their pro
 gressive movements from the north magnetic pole, and their influence
 on the needle whenever they come into the plane of the dip, are all
 of them circumstances which establish the relation of this phenomenon
 to magnetism ; while they at the same time illustrate the intimate
 connection subsisting between magnetism and electricity.
    On the production of regular double Refraction, in the Molecules
 of Bodies, by simple Pressure; with Observations on the Origin of
 the doubly-refracting Structure ; by Dnvid Brewster, LL.D. F.R.S.
 Lond. & lid. The author has already shown, in former papers which
 have appeared in the Philosophical Transactions, that the phenomena
 of double refraction may be produced artificially, by effecting certain
 changes in the mechanical condition of hard and of soft bodies.          In
 all these cases, he observes, the phenomena are entirely different from
 those of regular crystals; and in none of them is the doubly-refracting
 force a function of the angle which the incident ray forms with one or
 more axes given in position.      In the year 1815 he noticed the de
 polarizing properties of a thin film of a mixture of resin and white
 wax, compressed between two pieces of glass. Accidentally meeting
 with the specimen which had originally been the subject of this observa
 tion, he found that after fifteen years it still retained this property of
 depolarization, and was induced to pursue the inquiry to which it led.
 He varied the proportions of the ingredients, and observed in the dif
 ferent cases the modifications produced in the phenomena by employ
 ing various degrees of pressure.     He found that in every point there
 existed an axis of double-refraction perpendicular to the plane of the
 film ; and that the doubly-refracting force varied with the inclination
 of the incident ray to this avis ; just as happens with all regular uni-
 axal crystals.    He infers from hU observations, that the property of
 uni-axal double-refraction is communicated to the molecules simply
 by the agency of pressure ; for in all cases where pressure has not
 operated, the aggregate does not exhibit this property. These effects
are precisely the same as those which would be produced by sub
jecting elastic spheres to a regular compressing force ; the axis of
pressure becoming an axis of positive double refraction ; while ex
tension, on the contrary, produces a negative axis.
    From the consideration of the preceding facts, the author is led to
 a very simple explanation of the origin and general phaenomena of
 double refraction in regular crystals.    He considers this property as
 not being inherent in the molecules themselves ; but as resulting
from their compression, either by an extraneous force, or by their
                                                                      power

power of inherent attraction of aggregation. The phenomena of cry
stallization and of cleavage prove that the molecules of crystals have
several axes of attraction, or lines along which they are most power
fully attracted, and in the directions of which they cohere with dif
ferent degrees of force. Guided by the indications of hemitrope forms,
and supposing the molecules to be spherical or spheroidal, it is in
ferred that these axes are three in number, and at right angles to each
other, and that they are related in position to the geometrical axis of
 the primitive form. In like manner, the phenomena of double refrac
 tion are related to the same axis of the primitive form ; and may be
all rigorously calculated by a reference to three rectangular axes.
The author pursues the consequences of these principles in their ap
 plication to various kinds of crystals.        It follows, from this theory,
 that the forms of the ultimate molecules of crystals existing separately,
 determines within certain limits the primitive form to which they
 belong, while the doubly-refracting structure and the precise form of
 the crystal are simultaneously produced by the action of the forces
 of aggregation. These views receive a remarkable confirmation in
 the doubly-refracting structure which the author discovered in cha-
  basite ; and they also enable us to understand the nature of that in
  fluence which heat produces on doubly-refracting crystals, as dis
  covered by Professor Mitscherlich. The optical phenomena exhibited
  by fluids under the influence of heat and pressure, and by crystals
  exposed to compressing or dilating forces, are also in perfect confor
  mity with the above views, and would in themselves have been suf
  ficient to establish the principle that the forces of double refraction
  are not resident in the molecules themselves, but are the immediate
  result of those mechanical forces by which these molecules constitute
  solid bodies.

    A paper was read, entitled " On the Tertiary deposits of Lower
 Styria ;" by the Rev. Adam Sedgwick, Pres. G.S. F.R.S. &c. and
 Roderick Impey Murchison, Esq. Sec. G.S. F.R.S. &c.
    The region described in this memoir, is a great depression on the
north-eastern watershed of the Alps, in which has been accumu
lated a very fine series of tertiary deposits terminating eastward in
the plains of Hungary.       This great trough or bay of Lower Styria,
which is intersected by the river Mur, is bounded on the west by the
Schwanberg Alp ; on the north by the calcareous chain of Gratz and
the primary mountains of Pettau, Vorau, and Hartberg j on the south
and south-west by the Matzel and Bacher-Gebirge.
   Two principal sections are offered, explanatory of the views of the
authors : — The first from the Schwanherg Alp to Radkersburg, in a
direction nearly east and west, develops in an ascending succession
all the tertiary deposits : — The second, from south to north, is con
fined to the youngest zone of those deposits, and exhibits its relations
to the volcanic rocks of Hungary.
   I. Section in an ascending order of the Tertiary formations between
Eibeswald on the west and Radkersburg on the east.
   a. The lowest members of these deposits consist near Eibeswald, of
micaceous sandstones., grits, and conglomerates, made up of the de
                                                                   tritus

tritus of the primary slaty rocks on which they rest at high angles of
inclination, and rise into the lofty mountain of the lladlberg.
    6. Shale and sandstone with coal. There are various beds of lignite
near Eibeswald, one of which is deposited on the grits of the Radl-
berg. At Scheineck, where the coal is extensively worked for use, it
contains bones of anthracotheria, and in the shale are found gyro-
gonites (Chara tuberculata of the Isle of Wight), many flattened
stems of arundinnceous plants, cypris, shells of paludinae, scales of
fish, &c.    From the organic remains and position of the strata it is
presumed by the authors that this coal is of about the same age as
that of Cadibuona in Piedmont.
    c. Blue marly shale, sand, &c.    The carboniferous strata are sur
mounted by dark-coloured marls inclosing well preserved shells,
many of which are identical with species found in the London clay
and Calcaire grossier, amongst which are Lutraria oblata, Lucina
mutabilis and renulata, Venus vetula, Cerithium thiara, Bulla cylin-
drica, &c.&c.
    d. Conglomerate, with micaceo-calcareous sand and millstone con
glomerate. This group is of very great development and occupies
all the hilly region of the Sausal.
    e. Coralline limestone and marl. The preceding group is seen, both
atEhrenhausen and VVildon on the Mur, to pass under a hard, mottled,
coralline limestone of a yellowish white colour, which at the latter
place forms a cap several hundred feet thick in beds nearly hori
zontal.    The fossils seem to be of the age of the English Crag
and middle Sub-apennine formations, and include many corals of the
genera Astrea and Flustra, Crustacea, Balanus crassus, Conus Al-
drovandi, Pecten infumatus, Pholas, Fistulana, &c. The authors com
pare this coralline limestone with the tertiary marble of Possagno
near Bassano, and they also observe that it far exceeds in magnitude
the secondary coral rag of England.
   f. White and blue marl, calcareous grit, white marlstone, and con
cretionary white limestone. The Mur in its easterly course from
Ehrenhausen, exposes all the members of this and the following group,
although some of them are still better seen in transverse sections to
the south. At Santa Egida concretionary, white limestone alternating
with marls, contains Pecten pleuronectes, Ostraea bellovicina, Sca-
laria, Cyprea, &c. and in the Zirknitz-thal, Echinanthus marginatus
with gigantic oysters and pectens. At St. Kunegund and Morgruben
the white marls graduate into a compact building stone undistin-
guishable from the clunch or lowest chalk of Cambridgeshire.       Near
Mureck on the right bunk of the Mur, the upper portion of this group
is remarkable by containing a very white concretionary limestone
made up of small tubular and concentric layers, several varieties of
which, occurring in other parts of this tertiary series, very much re
semble concretions in the magnesian limestone of England.
    g. Calcareous sands and pebble beds, calcareous grits and oolitic
limestone.      These form the superior and youngest stratified deposits
of the country. At Radkersburg, where the section terminates and
the hills sink into the plains of Hungary, the sands, marls, and grits
                                                                     are

 360                         Geological Society.
 are charged with shells similar to those of the highest members of the
 basin of Vienna.     Some of the beds pass into concretionary masses
 of an oolitic limestone similar to that which is described at other places
 in the next section.
     II. Section from Radkersburg on the south to Riegersberg on the
 north, exhibiting the structure of the youngest zone of the tertiary
 deposits of Styria, and its relations to certain volcanic rocks.
     Several lofty and serrated ridges of volcanic rocks range from Haiu-
 feldt on the Raab towards Radkersburg, and a section made along
 their western face offers the following phenomena.
     At Straden shelly sands and pebble beds are capped by irregularly
columnar basaltic lava with olivine, &c.
    The hill of Poppendorf exhibits in great detail the structure of this
younger tertiary zone. Marls, sands, and conglomerates, occupy its
lower and middle parts, together with many beds of calcareous shelly
grits, indurated marlstone, limestone, &c. the whole being very mi
caceous, and the organic remains identical with those of Radkersburg.
These are overlaid by micaceo-calcareous sand containing concre
tionary masses of a perfect oolite which is quarried is a building stone,
and which differs from the great oolite of Bath only by its concretionary
structure and the tertiary shells associated with it.
    The fine-grained oolite passes upwards into other concretionary
beds something like English cornbrash, and the whole is surmounted
by micaceous sands and marls. In an adjoining hill near Gnaess,
these beds inclosing shells, alternate with volcanic peperino made
up of basaltic lava, scoria, vitreous felspar, olivine, pyroxene, the
detritus of tertiary rocks and shells, &c. ; and on the summit the
peperino in a more compact state is quarried as a building stone.
The conical hills of Gleichenberg, overlying the shelly sands, are
entirely of volcanic origin, and were probably the centre of igneous
eruption in these parts.       Here the predominating rock is a coarse
trachyte used for millstones (felspathic porphyry, probably analogous
to the Porphyre molaire of Beudant), and with it are associated ba
saltic lavas, scoria, and fine peperino, which near Hainfeldt repose
upon the sands.      Considerably to the north of the Raab the volcanic
conglomerate on which the castle stands, is also recumbent upon the
shelly sands and pebble beds.
    From these and several other examples in the neighbourhood, the
authors infer, that no tests can be established by which the relative
ages of these various igneous rocks can be fixed, since the same ter
tiary strata are in one place covered by basaltic lava, in a second by
trachyte, in a third by volcanic conglomerate, whilst in a fourth they
alternate with peperino.
    In conclusion they remark :
   That the lowest tertiary strata near Eibeswald must from their
high inclination have been considerably elevated after their de
position.
    That the various groups described, unquestionably represent, —

    Feb.  1 2. — Extract  from the Report of the Council of the Society
to the Tenth Annual General Meeting, held this day.
    Amongst the deaths, the Society have to regret the loss of Mr.
Edgeworth, a gentleman of the highest promise and attainment, and
worthy of a name dear to science and to literature.
    The exquisite transit circle by Troughton, of two feet diameter,
presented by Dr. Lee, is now in the possession of Captain Smyth, after
receiving from the hands of its maker some important additions and
improvements. Upon these much time was necessarily expended ; and
since the instrument was placed in the Bedford Observatory, the
weather has not allowed Captain Smyth to prosecute the delicate re
searches in which he is engaged.         The Society will have remarked
with satisfaction the excellent observations of occulted stars by this
active astronomer, and by Mr. Maclear, to whom Dr. Wollaston's
telescope was intrusted.        The transit clock presented by Lieutenant
 Beaufoy, and now in the possession of Mr. Herschel, has been lent to
the Rev. Michael Ward, and will be forwarded to him by the first op
portunity.      The Beaufoy circle has been safely received, but too re
cently to have enabled Mr. Ward to furnish the observations which
may be expected from his zeal and attainments.
    A library has been formed, of considerable extent and value, from
the contributions of individuals and scientific bodies.           The want of
 any  means    of consulting this has long been  felt ;  but  the Council have
 the gratification of stating, that Professor De Morgan has offered his
 valuable services to arrange and catalogue the books and manuscripts
belonging to the Society, — a tajk which is now nearly completed. It
 is well known that the Council have long been endeavouring to pro
cure more convenient apartments for the use of the Society, such as
 would be better adapted to their increasing demands, and under a more
 permanent tenure than those which they now hold. It is to be regret
 ted that so desirable an object has not hitherto been attained.
    Upon the increasing attention paid to our noble science, it is
 scarcely possible to speak in terms too flattering.         In addition to the
 increased activity of public observatories, the exertions of private in
 dividuals are by no means slackened in this race of improvement.             A

 of   the largest dimensions, having 1      If   inches clear aperture, and 19
 feet focal length, has been purchased by our spirited President. The
 task of mounting this gigantic telescope equatorially, has been under
  taken by the most celebrated of our modern artists, and we may hope
 to see this active astronomer speedily engaged in pursuing, with un-
 equulled means and unabated ardour, the path of discovery in which
 he is already so advantageously known*.
     Your Council trust, that they have not been backward in promoting,
 to the utmost of their power, every attempt to advance the interests
 of the science of Astronomy.
     Before the departure of Captain Ross on his Arctic expedition, that
 enterprising officer proposed to make any scientific observations, for
 which his situation might be considered favourable, should he unfor
 tunately be detained upon his perilous route. An application was
 made by him to the Lords of the Admiralty, and supported by your
  Council, for a loan of the requisite instruments, which was received
 by their Lordships in a most gratifying manner. Captain Ross was
 amply supplied with the proper instruments ; and, at the request of the
 Council, a list of moon-culminating stars, for the months of January,
 February, March, and April, 1831, was prepared for him by Mr. Hen.
 derson, the Astronomer Royal having undertaken that the correspond
 ing observations should be made at Greenwich.
    The numerous and excellent observations of Aldebaran, during the
 preceding year, which have been already communicated, are a satis
 factory proof of the increased interest felt for the science, and of the
 importance attached to the views and wishes of the Society.              In some
 instances the star disappeared instantaneously after the bisection of its
 disc by the moon's limb, while in others the projection lasted nearly
six seconds.      It does not appear that a sensible diminution of bright
 ness was perceived previous to immersion. When a sufficient number
of well-attested appearances has been collected, it may be possible
 to account for the anomalies which have hitherto been so perplexing.
The attention of astronomers towards this interesting phenomenon
 is earnestly requested during the present year.            Neither should the
    • [Although this telescope was placed on a
                                                   temporary stand, at the Presi
dent's Observatory at Kensington, on January 29, the weather did not per
 mit of any trial of its powers previously to the Anniversary.        It may now,
therefore, be interesting to state, that the first night on which an opportunity
was afforded, viz. the 13th of February, Mr. Herschel discovered a sixth star
in the trapezium in the nebula of Orion, a few degrees south following of, and
about five or six seconds distant from, the star denominated A in that tra
pezium, in Mr. South's observations of the double stars.          Its brightness is
about one-third of that of the fifth star, discovered by M. Struve, which is
as distinctly seen as the companion to Polaris is in a 5-feet achromatic.        It
was immediately after detected
                                     by Mr.  South,   and has since  been  seen  by
Mr. Daily, Mr. Troughton, Mr. Sharpe, and others, and repeatedly by my
self.    Saturn, with his Belts, Double Ring, and Seven Satellites, is beau
tifully defined, with powers of 130, 280, and 350. The object-glass is not in
very perfect adjustment; it was placed in its cell, as now used, by mere ac
cident, and, in consequence of unfavourable weather, it has not been deemed
prudent hitherto to attempt any alteration. — W. S. S. See.}

predicted     occultations of other stars be neglected by observers.
It   is   from them that the most accurate determinations of longi
tude are, in the generality of cases, to be obtained ; and the tedious
difficulties with which they were embarrassed, have been in a great
measure removed.         The Council have distributed from time to time
monthly notices of the principal lunar occultations, for the meridian
of Greenwich, computed by Mr. Henderson, to whom this branch of
astronomy is under peculiar obligations.           It is to be regretted that
the avocations of this gentleman will not allow him to continue these
useful lists much longer.        Fortunately, this loss is greatly diminished
by    a  recent memoir   due   to  our excellent associate Professor Bessel,
and inserted in Encke's Ephemeris for 1831 , which gives a short and
simple method of transferring to another meridian the time and cir.
cumstances of an occultation already computed for Berlin, along with
the quantities required for the calculation.          These subsidiary quan
tities have been prepared for the first six months of the present year
by Professor Troeger of Dantzic, and inserted in the Astronowische
 Nachrichten, an early copy of which was transmitted to the Society by
the accomplished editor.          This has been printed for distribution, in
the hope that the zeal of Mr. Henderson will find worthy successors.
To mark their sense of obligation to this gentleman, and as a small
 tribute of respect, the Council have unanimously agreed, " That it
 be recommended to the general meeting to present to Mr. Hender
son a copy of the Memoirs, handsomely bound, for the very valuable
 assistance which he has rendered to the cause of Astronomy in his
various computations presented to the Society*."               The numerous
communications that have from time to time been received from Ger
 many, and the valuable astronomical works that are constantly issuing
from the press of that country, render an acquaintance with the Ger
man language almost essential to the prosecution of the science.          The
difficulty which the Council would otherwise have experienced has
been greatly removed by the cordial and very valuable assistance of a
gentleman deeply versed in every branch of the science, who has, on
all occasions, been ready in favouring the Council with translations of
such papers as they have from time to time required.            To murk their
sense also of this obligation, and as a small tribute of respect, they
have agreed, "That it be recommended to the general meeting to
present to Dr. Tiarks a copy of the Memoirs, handsomely bound, for
his kind and ready assistance at all times in translating various foreign
papers for the use of the members, and for other valuable services ren
dered to the Society*."
    A simple and ingenious method of determining the mass of the
moon, by observing the JR. of the bright limb of Venus, has been
proposed by Professor Airy, with a request that the Society would
use their influence in obtaining for it an extensive circulation.      Copies
 have, accordingly, been forwarded to every public and private obser
 vatory in Europe, with a strong recommendation for its adoption.

      The fluctuating use of symbols in mathematical investigations more
   frequently occasions mistake and misapprehension than the inherent
   difficulty of the subject matter ; and it is to be lamented that so little
   cure is taken by the generality of authors to be consistent with each
   other, or even with themselves.      An attempt has been made by Mr.
   Lubbock, under the auspices of the Society, to introduce a system of
   notation depending upon fixed rules. This paper is now in the press,
   and will be submitted before publication to the geometers of this and
   other countries.    In this way, it seems probable that a considerable
   degree of accordance      may be obtained, which it is hoped may be
   strengthened and confirmed by the sanction and practice of the
  Society.
,     The paper upon the Constant of Aberration, by Mr. William Rich
  ardson, to which such marked attention was drawn in the Report of
  last year, has subsequently been published in the Memoirs of the
  Society, and fully justified the high expectations excited. The im
  mense labour bestowed upon this important investigation, the clear
  ness with which it is developed, and the number of observations on
  which it is founded, must command the admiration of all astronomers.
  Your Council have unanimously awarded to Mr. Richardson the gold
  medal for the determination of this fundamental constant.
      A gold medal has also been voted to Professor Encke for the superb
  Ephemeris of Berlin.      It would be superfluous to dwell here upon the
  merits of this well-known work, which, far outstripping all rivalry,
  must be considered as the only ephemeris, on a level with the present
  wants of the science, — the manual and standard of practical astrono
  my wherever it may be cultivated.
      The President will deliver the medals at the close of this meeting in
  the accustomed form.
      Your Council trust that this exposition of the resources and pro
  gress of the Society will be satisfactory to the members at large ; but
  it is not to be forgotten, that much remains to be done, and that more
  labourers are demanded.       It is not sufficient to thank or to admire
  those who have toiled in the good cause, — the necessity of imitation
  must be strongly felt and inculcated. There is scarcely any instru
  ment which may not be usefully employed, or any acquirements which
  may not perform good service. Phwnomena may be predicted, preli
  minary computations furnished, reductions prepared, with little more
  knowledge than that of common arithmetic ; occultations, eclipses,
  moon-culminating stars, planets, may be observed, and portions of
  the heavens examined and surveyed, with instruments of moderate
  price and of inferior dimensions.     Indeed, in the present state of as
  tronomy, the class of differential observations embraces far the greater
  portion of celestial phenomena even for the best instruments ; and
  by the publication of the Berlin Ephemeris, computation is almost
  wholly reduced to simple interpolation.       At no distant period it may
 be possible for the Council to provide skeleton forms, not merely for
 registering observations, but for their reduction and for all ordinary
 calculations.
     It would also be highly desirable to collect and publish annually,
                                                                           in

in a condensed   form, observations presented to them by British and
 foreign  astronomers, and not printed elsewhere, — a repository and
digest of the services of amateur observers.   The Council confidently
 rely upon the energy and activity of the members, and of all friends
 to astronomical science, for the accomplishment of this important ob
ject.    Thus, not only will a large mass of valuable information be
 rescued from oblivion, and preserved in a shape the best adapted to
comparison and use, but a deeper interest will be felt by Ihe contri
butor, and a stronger motive offered for that care and method, without
which computation is rendered useless, and instruments degenerate
 into toys.
  ( The President then addressed    the Meeting on the subject        of   the
award of the Medals, as follows : — )
    GENTLKMEN, — Ere we proceed to the distribution of our honorary
rewards, I cannot but congratulate you on the general state of astro
nomical alluirs ; whether we turn to the north or to the south, to the
east or to the west, the astronomical horizon presents a more pro
mising aspect than it has done for many years ; and what is peculiar
ly gratifying to us is, that amidst the general endeavours to advance
astronomical knowledge, our own country this year stands indeed
conspicuous.      Since our last anniversary, the observations of Profes
sor Airy have done honour to the University of Cambridge ; those of
Dr. Robinson have rewarded the. munificence of the Primate of Ireland ;
and others made at Paramatta, in the observatory founded by Sir
Thomas Brisbane, and which (thanks principally to the exertions of
members of this Society) is now become an observatory in the service
of the British government, give us an earnest of the value of those
observations of Sir Thomas's, now in the course of reduction by Mr.
Richardson, as also of the importance of others, which, on the autho
rity of the government, we are henceforth regularly to receive from
Paramatta. Again, within these few days has arrived a first series of
standard transit observations, made by Mr. Fallows at the Cape Ob
servatory. They are, as yet, unpublished.          Knowing him, however,
intimately as I do, and having witnessed his early astronomical career,
I may be permitted to felicitate you on their arrival, confident that
whatever comes from him will be honourable to his country, for it will-
be worthy of himself.       But that these observatories have rendered to
us their  first fruits, is not all : others are in a state fast approaching
to practical utility ; and when another year shall glide away, he who
shall have the honour to fill the chair I now so unworthily occupy, will
have, I hope, to applaud the activity of the observatories of Brussels
and Cadiz, of Cracow and of Edinburgh, of Geneva and Madras*.
   While exulting, however, in the accession of these new observato-
   * This is not literally a new observatory ; the instruments, however, now
about to be sent thither, arc so far superior to those already there, that it
may almost be regarded as a new establishment.        The same applies to the
Geneva observatory, but with greater force ; for not only are superior in
struments ordered for  it,  but anew building is  being prepared for their re
ception.
                                                                        ries,

ties, let us not forget honourably to notice, that from the Royal Ob
servatory of Greenwich has issued, but a few weeks since, a Catalogue
of 720 Stars ; — a valuable treasure, and for which the astronomical
•world is indebted to this Society, as well as to the Astronomer Royal ;
inasmuch as the stars it embraces have been selected from, and re
duced by, the Society's Catalogue.         On examining the important facts
resulting from this first series, and which the Astronomer Royal has
exhibited by actual comparison with our own work, let us hope, now
that his fundamental catalogue has reached a degree of accuracy pro
bably unexampled in astronomical history, he will persevere in the
task ; assured as he may be, that no one thing would tend more to
the credit of the Observatory, and to his own glory, than that his name
should be attached to a large catalogue of stars, called, as in the good
old times of Flamsteed, " The British Catalogue."
     The Royal Observatory of Paris is also an object of increasing in
terest} a splendid equatorial by Gambey has been added to its pre
vious collection ; and the transit instrument by the same distinguished
artist, so long and so anxiously looked for by our ccmfrZres of Paris,
is at length placed on its piers ; whilst the observatory, properly so
called, is about to be remodelled and rendered more convenient for
astronomical labour. We hail the recommencement of the observa
tions as an aera which will be worthy of the country of Cassini*, of
La Caille, and of La Lande ; of La Grange, Legendre, and La Place.
The sentiments of the late distinguished Secretary of the Institute,
that " Ce n'est pas le tout que de fonder un observatoire et de doter
1'astronome, il faudrait faire un fonils annuel pour 1'impression, et
imposer a 1'astronome 1'obligation de n'rtre jamais en retard d'une
anne'ef," being adopted by the astronomers of Paris, we shall not
have to regret that observations, made with such instruments and by
such men, shall be available only to those who reside within the wall*
of the observatory. We have this year set our Parisian friends a
splendid example, and doubtless they will follow it.
    As to the improvement of the achromatic telescope, since our last
anniversary, much cannot be said. The theory of Mr. Rogers has not,
as far as I know, been put to the test of practice, in a manner at all
commensurate with its merits ; whilst Mr. Barlow's achromatic, of
eight inches aperture and eleven feet focal length, owing to imper
fections in the material of its exterior lens, does not define close side
real objects so neatly as might be wished, but is, nevertheless, appli
cable to many useful purposes ; and there is a hope that the labours
of a sister society, although hitherto unsuccessful in furnishing us with
   * Cassini was an Italian
                              professor ; he was, however, called to Paris by
Colbert, whose comprehensive mind felt that not only military success, but
scientific reputation could confer glory on his country.     Not only did he
place the observatory of Paris under the care of Cassini, but men of all
countries who had distinguished themselves by their scientific acquirements
were invited by that illustrious patron of science to reside in Paris. He wai
also the founder of the Academic de» Scieucet, and of the Observatory of
Paris.

     Again, as to hydrography : scientific surveys are gradually spread
ing to every quarter of the globe, under the influence of the noble
Lord who has lately enrolled his name in this Society. But little does
it matter if coasts are well surveyed, rocks detected, shoals discovered
and currents ascertained, if the results are not digested so as to be
practically useful to the seaman.        It gives me pleasure therefore to
announce, that since we last met, an appointment has been made by
the Admiralty, which has given universal satisfaction ; for it assures
us, that the day is not far distant, when an Englishman shall visit the
hydrographic department of the Deptit de la Marine of a neighbouring
state, without feeling humiliated by the comparative inferiority of the
corresponding establishment of his own country.
     Proceed we now to the distribution of our medals.       By the minutes

decreed to Mr. Richardson, for his investigation nnd determination of
the constant of aberration, from observations made at Greenwich with
the two mural circles ; — the other to Professor Encke, for his Berlin
 Ephemeris."
     Three hundred years have now elapsed since Copernicus proposed
 to the world that system which bears his name ; and if we except the
labours of Tycho Brahe, who, besides a catalogue of 800 stars, made
attempts to determine the altitude of the pole star at different seasons
 of the year, little was done by practical observation to support or refute
 the ideas of Copernicus till the time of Galileo.      Observations of the
 eclipses of Jupiter's satellites induced him to propose them as a means
 of determining differences of longitude, whilst his discovery of the
 phases of Venus removed a serious objection to the truth of the
 Copernican system, and which Copernicus himself predicted would be
 removed, though he had not the means of doing so himself. About
 the year 1665, Huygcns, by his discovery of the pendulum clock, gave
 to astronomical observations an accuracy hitherto unknown ; and
 ("-'assini, by means of the excellent glasses of Campani, accumulated
 a vast mass of observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, and
deduced from them tables whereby astronomers could predict their
occurrence.
      Notwithstanding the powerful arguments advanced in its favour,
 the Copernican hypothesis was not generally embraced; for in the
year 1669, nearly a century and a half subsequent to its promulga
tion by Copernicus, even the celebrated Hook, to use his own words,
" would not absolutely declare for it*." To settle the matter, there
fore, this extraordinary man, feeling that the instruments of Tycho,
although magnificent beyond all others, were, from the nature of their
construction, and from their being unprovided with telescopic sights,
incompetent to detect minute alterations of sidereal positions, and

knowing that the laws which governed refraction were so little under
stood* as to render all observations in which that element was mate-
rially involved, liable to errors greater probably than the quantities
he was in search of, invented the zenith sector.            It was erected at
Gresham College, and consisted of a telescope 36 feet long, a divided
arc, and a plumb-line.       The star selected for observation, and with
reference to which, indeed, his instrument was entirely constructed,
was one which passed within two or three minutes of the zenith of
Gresham College, was visible in the day-time throughout the year,
and was y Draoonis: by observing its zenith distance when the earth
was in opposite points of her orbit, he found (as he erroneously con
cluded) a sensible parallax, amounting to about 20 seconds, and,
consequently, determined that the Copernican system was the true
onef.
     In the   mean time, the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, — thanks to the
facilities of predicting them afforded by Cassini's tables, — had been
assiduously observed; and in the year 1675, the discordances found
between the predicted and the observed eclipses enabled the cele
brated RoSmer to demonstrate that light was not instantaneously pro
pagated, and that the discordances between the tables and the obser
 vations might be considered as the measure of its velocity.
     The yearof Rogmer's discovery was further marked by another epoch
 in astronomical history, namely, the foundation of the Royal Obser
 vatory.      Flamsteed, with his mural quadrant, detected a change of
 place    in the pole-star, amounting to 35, 40, or 45 seconds, attributed
 it to parallax, and regarded it as confirmatory of Hook's discovery.
 Indeed, the observations of Hook, as well as of those who preceded
 him, although nominally in search of parallax, had for their object little
 else than the confirmation or verification of the Copernican system ;
 and this arrived at, there seems to have been but little disposition to
 repeat them.
      Hence it was that, the brilliant discoveries of Newton having placed
 the accuracy of the Copernican system beyond all possibility of doubt,
 the investigation of parallax was not resumed till the latter end of
  November, in the year 1720, at which time Molyneux erected his 24-
  feet zenith sector, by Graham, in his observatory at KewJ. "On the
  3d of December, y Draconis was, for the first time, observed as it
  passed near the zenith, and its situation carefully taken with the in
  strument; and again, on the 5th, 1 1th, and 12th, when, no material
  change in the star's place having been detected, further observations
  seemed needless, since it was a time of the year when no sensible
  alteration of parallax could soon be expected."            Bradley, however,
  being on a visit to his friend Molyneux, was
                                                      " tempted by curiosity
  to repeat the observation on the 1 7th, and perceived the star pass a
  little more southerly than when it had been observed before :" sus-

peeling that the apparent change of place might be owing to errone
ous observation, it was observed again on the 20th, and he found the
star still further south than in the preceding observations. This sen
sible alteration surprised himself and Molyneux, inasmuch as it was
the contrary way from which it would have been, had it proceeded
from an annual parallax of the star; but being incapable of account
ing for it by want of exactness in the observations, and having no
notion of any other cause from which such apparent motion could
proceed, they suspected that some change in the materials of the
instrument itself might have occasioned it. Under this apprehension
they remained some time; but being at length fully convinced, by
repeated trials, of the great exactness of the instrument, and finding,
by the gradual increase of the star's distance from the pole, that there
                                                                    it it,

the observations were conducted, or the modest unassuming manner
in which they are recorded       no possible source of error
                                  :                                 allowed to       is
pass without the most rigid examination — no theory suffered to em
barrass the observers in their observations            the slightest anomaly
                                                                   ;

the most perfect regularity.
   That observations so conducted, leading to results so unexpected,
could be abandoned till the law which governed them should be un
folded, was impossible. But Bradley rejected all inquiries into the
cause till the effects were accurately determined and feeling that the  ;
apparent motion was obtained           observations only of one year, —
                                           by                                                     by

of IL'.Wcet focus, formed, indeed, upon the same general plan of
Molyneux's, but furnished with a divided arc of f i{ degrees on each
side of the zenith point, for the purpose of enabling him to ascertain,
by direct observation, whether other stars than y Draconis, would be
similarly affected. The instrument's situation, when adjusted,
                                                                    " might
be securely depended upon to hulf a second," and its telescope could
be directed to " not less than 12 stars, bright enough to be seen in
the day-time" throughout the year: the same changes were observed
as had been previously detected with Molyneux's instrument.               In
flexible, however, in his resolution not to generalise till sufficient
means were collected to lead him to a " probably just conclusion,"
the year of probation was suffered to be completed before " the ob
servations were examined and compared :" then it was that he satis
fied himself of the general laws of the phenomena ; and then, and not
till then, did he endeavour to find out their cause. Convinced that
the apparent motion of the stars which he had observed was not owing
to nutation — persuaded that a change in the direction of the plumb-
line with which the instrument was rectified, was insufficient to have
occasioned it — and having appealed unsuccessfully to refraction, — he
perceived
              " that if light was propagated in time, the apparent
                                                                        place
 of a fixed object would not be the same when the eye is at rest as
 when it is moving in any other direction than that of the line passing
 through the eye and the object ; and that when the eye is moving in
 different directions, the apparent place of the object would be differ
 ent."     He therefore announced his discovery in these words : "That
 all the phenomena proceeded from the progressive motion of light and
 the earth's annual motion in its orbit,' or, as he afterwards called         it,
 aberration of light.
    But he who determined its existence determined also its constant,
 and fixed   it at 20"; giving us, therefore, the interval of time     which
                                                                      in
 light travels from the sun to the earth, as eight minutes and seven se
 conds, differing from that deduced            by
                                             Roe'mer nearly three minutes
 of time, circumstance not at all to the discredit of Roe'mer, consider
         a
 ing the imperfect knowledge of the theory of Jupiter's satellites at
 the time he made his important discovery.
     The observations, however, which led Bradley to the discovery of
 aberration, and to the determination of its constant, being as yet un
  published, have given rise to insinuations certainly ungenerous, and
  probably unjust. Impelled       by

  associate Bessel, alluding to the observations of      Draconis made

   Till within these few years, the constant, as determined by Bradley,
was universally employed in all our astronomical reductions; re
cently, however, astronomers have re-investigated it. Delambre,
from the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, regards it as 20'' ,25. Bessel,
from Bradley's observations made at the Royal Observatory, after he
was appointed Astronomer Royal, has deduced for the constant 20",68.
Lindenau, by comparisons of Bradley's, Maskelyne's, Bessel's, and
Pond's observations of Polaris, has obtained for it20",61.        Brinkley,
from his own observations, considers it as 20",37. Whilst Struve, by
his observations, draws almost the same inference, namely 20",35.
    Such were the results most entitled to our confidence, when Mr.
Richardson, in the hours allotted to him for repose or recreation, un
dertook those labours which form the subject of our present considera
tion, and of which the followingisa brief outline. A second mural circle
by Jones, after the model of that of Troughton's, having been erected
at the Royal Observatory, in the April of 1825, corresponding obser
vations with the two instruments were carried on simultaneously ;
they were confined, indeed, to a few stars, but every precaution to
render them as accurate as possible was adopted.         Thus, the index
error of each instrument was ascertained by observing the same star
alternately, by direct vision and reflection ; each pair, therefore, giving
to its respective instrument one horizontal point perfectly indepen
dent of astronomical tables, the final accuracy of the determination
 of the index error being directly as the number of pairs observed.
 Throughout the observations, the place of each star was arrived at by
 reference to the six microscopes of each circle ; care also being taken
 to equalize, n» nearly as possible, the temperature of Ihe observatory
 with that of the external air, so that errors to any extent, arising from
 partial expansions or erroneous divisions of the instrument, were
 effectually excluded.
    From such unexceptionable data, fourteen stars were selected by
 Mr. Richardson as the fittest for his purpose, being those the least
 affected by refraction, and the most affected by abenation, so that
 the errors of observation might have the minimum influence upon the
 results.   Upwards of 4000 observations he separately discussed, and
in no instance was the actual aberration of each observed star less
 than 1 4"; and the conclusion to which he has arrived        is,
                                                              from Trough-
 ton's circle, that the Constant of Aberration      is20",;>05     whilst by
                                                                    ;
 Jones'sit   is20",502, the one differing from the other but three-thou
 sandths of a second.
     Hook, in searching for parallax, was misled         byhis instrument.
 Bradley, in   detecting it, was unsuccessful, but discovered aberration.
 Hook's instrument was the work of his own hands          ;  Bradley's was
 the work of Graham.       Sensible that much of his astronomical glory
 was referable to the accuracy of his instrument, the amateur astrons-
 mer of Wanstead was ever rendy to acknowledge           it   and when we
                                                              ;

consider that one hundred years' improvement in astronomical mani
pulations can alter the constant of aberration as determined by him
but one half second*, we are almost led to exclaim
                                                           " Quando ullura
                        "
inveniemus parem ?
    Our Graham is amongst us ; to him we are indebted for the instru
ments with which results thus important have been obtained, and also
for the mode of using them, through which the maximum of accuracy
has been acquired.         One of them was made with his own hands, the
other under his direction ; and it is not too much to say, that the
disciple has shown himself worthy of his master.         The benefits which
Edward Troughton has conferred on science, are too well known to
need enumeration.          His Majesty the King of Denmark, not insensi
ble to the importance of science, and feeling that for much of the
accuracy to which astronomy and navigation have arrived, we are
indebted to the genius of our revered member, has recently acknow
ledged his gratitude to him, by the presentation of his gold medal,
inscribed with the word " MEKITO."             Never was inscription more
appropriate.       May he live long to enjoy this token of respect ! alike
honourable to himself and to the princely feelings of its royal donor.
    On looking over the constant as determined by each star, nothing
definitive, as Mr. Richardson justly observes, can be concluded, as to
whether light emitted from different stars is propagated to us with
different degrees of velocity : the idea is not irrational, but its validity
future astronomers must determine.
  (The President then, addressing Mr. Richardson, continued thus : — )
    Mr. Richardson, — Brought up to an employment little allied to
astronomy — residing in a part of the country remote from the metro
 polis—cut off from the society of scientific men, which operates so
powerfully in stimulating to scientific exertions, — we see you quitting
the place of your birth, — leaving the roof of your respected parents,
— and presenting yourself in this great city, known only to a single
individual ; abandoning every sordid pursuit to follow that which,
however noble, too often leads, in this country, to neglect and poverty,
 — we find you, in August 1822, at the Royal Observatory as an as
 sistant.    Here you soon distinguished yourself by your punctuality
 — your attention — and your zeal ; accustomed to the business of an
 observatory-)-, you required to be instructed only in the established
 routine of that to which you were appointed.         Soon did you gain the
 confidence of the Astronomer Royal ; and whether he \vished to esta
 blish the place of a star in the heavens, or of a spot on the earth, to
 no one could he intrust the one or the other with more confidence
than to you, whom he emphatically styled " his right hand." Attached
to astronomy, but unable to maintain your family upon the miserable
pittance allowed you by the Government, we see you observing all
day and computing all night.          As an assistant of the Royal Obser
vatory,    I have  only to  say, — Go on as you have begun.    But if a trust
higher    in the  scale of  importance  awaits you, remember,  sir, that you

                                                             disappear when

                a

throughout Europe ; and that too by your own exertions.        Receive
this medal, sir, as a pledge of our esteem — as, indeed, the highest
honour we have to offer.     May it stimulate you to fresh exertions in
the cause of your favourite science ; and on your return from India
to your native home, may the Astronomer of Madras be as honour
ably distinguished, as is this day the Assistant of the lloyal Obser
vatory.
   ( The President then resumed his address to the Members as fol
lows : — )
  The second medal    has been adjudged to Professor Encke, for the
Berlin Ephemeriswhich   bears his name.    Experience has long shown,
that an astronomical ephemeris is almost as necessary an appendage
to an observatory as are the instruments themselves ; accordingly we
find that some one, more or less perfect, has been in the hands of
every astronomer, since astronomy has been pursued in a systematic
manner. The first which appears in this country at nil deserving the
name of an astronomical ephemeris was that of Vincent Wing, and
was used by Flamsteed :         it,
                             however, was very imperfect, and Flam-
steed, whilst at Derby, transmitted  to the Royal Society supplements
to     containing notices of phenomena not inserted
     it,                                               in Wing's Ephe
meris, and which were published from time to time in the Philoso
phical Transactions.      La Caille, about the year 1755, proposed one
upon      larger
           a      scale;   but     1767, on the recommendation of Dr.
                                  in
Maskelyne, the Board of Longitude of Great Britain published the
Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris, Dr. Maskelyne him
self taking the superintendence of it. Its object was evidently two
fold, since contained, even when first published, much information not
               it
wanted         by
             the astronomer, and still more not required    by
                                                             the seaman.
The Connoisiance des Terns also was published much    in  the same style,
and was, as well as the Nautical Almanac, a manual not only for the
seaman, but also for the astronomer. The Berlin Ephemeris wan
purely astronomical, but, like the Connoissance des Terns, contained,
in  the shape of additions, much valuable astronomical information,
inserted       its highly respected editor, the much-lamented Bode.
                by
But the Connoissance des Terns, compared with the Nautical Almanac,
had so fallen into disrepute, that, in the year 1795, Gregoire, now
 Evfique deBlois.in the name of the Committees of Marine, of Finance,
and of Public Instruction, proposed to the National Convention the
establishment of       Board of Longitude,
                         a                     inimitation of the British
Board, and to which should be confided the publication of the Con
noissance des Terns.     From that time to the present it  has been pub
lished with greater regularity, and in general about the same time as
the Nautical Almanac; for, from some cause or other, the latter has
not appeared so many years            in
                                    advance as inthe times of Maskelyne.
Considering that the work          sometimes wanted for long voyages of
                                  is
discovery, its publication three or four years in advance, instead of
two years and      quarter, as at present, would certainly be desirable.

   On the death of Maskelyne, the superintendence of        passed into          it
the hands of " irresponsible" persons, and the character which      had                         it
so long sustained was lost.    Compared with corresponding produc
tions of other countries,      was not only inaccurate but incomplete.

Astronomical knowledge was progressive but the Nautical Almanac

remained not only stationary, bur retrograded. To restore             to its                  it
former rank,     new Board of Longitude was formed, and the super
                  a
intendence of the Almanac was confided to the Secretary of the Board.
To retrieve the character of a work which, from holding the highest
rank     the ephemerides of Europe, had descended below mediocrity,
        in
was no easy task      but ;     due to the memory of that eminent per
                                      it   is
son to acknowledge, that the first volumes published under his super
intendence did much to restore its character for accuracy. Other
ephemerides, however, having, in an astronomical point of view, got
the start of     in it,
                  sustained their superiority; and there       scarcely an       is

circumstances, so injurious to the astronomical character of the coun
try, many have been the discussions relative to the Nautical Almanac,
and the individual who has the honour to address you has not been
unconcerned       them. His animadversions may have been occasionally
                   in
severe, but he hopes never unjust; — they were intended to convince,
not unnecessarily to wound.        For the individual with whom he had
the misfortune to differ, he entertained the highest respect        and                   ;            by
no one even of his scientific friends, was his premature removal more
keenly fell than           by
                      him, who never differed from him but with regret.
His acquirements were of no common order and whatever may be ;
our opinions of his superintendence of the Nautical Almanac, all
suffrages will unite     pronouncing him an ornament to his country.

   Since the decease of Dr. Young, the superintendence of the Al
manac has been transferred to the Astronomer Royal, and the volume
for 1832 has just been published under his direction.       No important
alteration distinguishes    from its predecessors.

Great Britain, rising like a phoenix from its ashes, shall be as much
superior to Encke's, as Encke's is now superior to it. That, however,
will be no easy task : Encke, whose name stands already in the list
of those to whom our inedul has been before adjudged, is no ordinary
rival. Well knowing what is wanted in an observatory — skilled in
practice — profound in theory — and living under a Government by
which science is eminently encouraged — he has given to us an ephe-
meris, which is invaluable. To enter into its individual merils would
far exceed the time allowed me ; suffice it to say, that for every pur
pose of astronomical investigation, its materials are sterling, and its
arrangement excellent. With                 it,
                                     an observatory scarcely wants               a

  [As the subject of the following controversy appears to       be  exciting
    much attention upon the Continent, we think our zoological readers
    will be pleased with our devoting a few pages to it. We have
    only to add that it has been suggested to us that Mr. W. S. Mac-
     Leay's* views respecting the osculant position of the Cephalopoda
    between the Mollusca and the Vertebrata, will probably be found
     to reconcile M. Cuvier's statement with that of his opponent,
    * A writer in the
                        Quarterly Review, instead of fairly investigating or
 combating the views of Mr. MilcLeay has, it is alleged, greatly misrepre
 sented them. That our readers may the better judge for themselves, we
  shall probably in some future Number confront the representations of the
  Reviewer with the original.

    existing in the animal kingdom. See Horee Entomologiece, p. 248
    to '260, &c. EDIT.]
          the 15th of February last MM. Geoffroy- Saint Hilaire and
ONLatreille      made a report on the Memoir of MM. Meyraux and
Laurencet, iui itlrd " Considerations on the Organization of Mol
luscs," &c. The authors have devoted themselves for some time
past to considerable anatomical labours; they have prepared for
early publication plates of more than three thousand new facts of
anatomy, relating to all the difficulties of the science.     These de
signs give the zootomy of a number of animals of the middle and
lower ranks of the zoological series, such as reptiles, tortoises, sa
lamanders, fish, Crustacea, insects, and mollusca of different orders.
 MM. Meyraux and Laurencet, thinking themselves sufficiently pre
pared by the labours of which we have just spoken, have adopted
as general facts the following propositions:
     1st, Every molluscum presents, under an envelope more or less
destitute of solid parts and of sensitive apparatus attached to them, a
vegetative system resembling that of one or more superior animals.
2nd, The viscera which compose these apparatuses are placed in
 the Mollusca in the same connections as in the superior animals, and
their functions are exercised in them by a similar mechanism and
 moving organs. 3rd, The connections designated as disturbed are
only so in appearance; the key for discovering their undeviating
 constancy is furnished by the consideration that the mollusca,
 whose trunk, keeping in other respects a longitudinal position,
 is found on the contrary bent towards its half, and that the two
 portions returning on each other, soldered the one to the other,
 are reversed sometimes on what is called the ventral face, some
 times on the face called dorsal. 4-th, The folds in question discover
 themselves externally by the respective position of the orifices.
5th, Lastly, in the case of parts resisting and fixed in the skin, these
 enrthy masses are also comparable to certain bony portions in ver-
 tebrated animals. Desirous of supplying the justification of these
theoretic views, MM. Meyraux and Laurencet make an application
of it to the order Cephalopoda, and indeed to explain their idea
 more clearly, to one of the species in particular ; viz. the cuttle-fi>h
(Sepia qfficinalis\    After following the authors in their anatomical
labours upon this molluscous animal, aind the remarks by which they
accompany them, the reporter, M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, proceeds
with the following reflections suggested to him by the organization
of the cuttle-fish : " If we find inclosed in the same integuments,
organs so elevated by their structure as are two venous hearts and
one arterial heart, a perfectly regular set of branchiae, medullary
matter chicflv concentrated at the nape of the neck, a very large
liver, a scries of vessels secreting urine; if in like manner we find
associated and placed together an entire intestinal apparatus, a
                                                                    beak

beak constructed like that of the parrot, the oesophagus, all the
organs of generation very nearly repetitions of those of fish,— can it
be said of so many things that it is a whole quite differently put to
gether, quite differently combined?        In order to prove this propo
sition, and find in it a text in favour of the most surprising of ano
malies, there would be more to be done than in order to sustain the
contrary-position.     For it would be necessary to admit that these
organs, which can exist only as produced by each other (eitgendri's
lesntisparksautres), and in consequence of the reciprocal congruity
of the nervous and circulatory action, would cease to be connected,
or to accord with each other.       Now such an hypothesis is not ad
missible : from the moment that the harmony between the organs
no longer exists, life ceases : then there is an end of the animal, it
is not an animal.     But        if,
                              on the contrary, life goes on,      because       it   is
all these organs have remained in their habitual and invariable re
lations, that they act on one another as usual — then, following up
                                                                  ;
the reasoning — this      because they are linked together by the same
                            is
order of format ion, subjected to the same rule, and because, like every
thing in animal composition, they are unable to escape from the con
sequences of the universal law of nature, the unity of organic com
position.    MM. Meyrnux and Laurence! have known how to appre
ciate the wants of science, since they have endeavoured to lessen the
hiatus observed between the Cephalopoda and the higher animals.
Doubtless, they have not hoped to arrive all at once at             result                a
completely satisfactory       but we owe them at least the justice to
                                 ;
say, that theirs       huppy attempt at opening the way, and that
                       is
                       a
they have already trodden some of its paths."
    M. Cuvier remarked upon         passage of the above Report, that
                                               a

 years ago, after having made the Mollusca better known than they
 had before been, proved the necessity of no longer leaving animals
 so richly provided with organs, confounded               single class along
                                                                  in   a
 with the polypi and other zoophytes; and that his views on this sub
 ject have been admitted         some way or other by all naturalists.
                                     in
     But, in showing how the organization of the Mollusca approached
 in the abundance and diversity of its parts to that of the Vertebrata,
  M. Cuvier was far from thinking this organization composed in the
 same way, or arranged on the same plan           his opinion, on the con
                                                         :
  trary, had always    been,  that the plan, which  up to    certain point a                    is
  common to the Vertebrata,          not continued
                                          is           the Mollusca.

the time which perhaps might be occupied more usefully in study,
M. Cuvier first states the circumstances which have brought on
this discussion.
    Two young and ingenious observers studying the respective
position of the viscera of the Cephalopoda, thought that perhaps
among these viscera might be found an arrangement resembling
that which exists among the Vertebral a, if we represented to our
selves the cephalopodous animal as a vertebrated one, whose trunk
was folded on itself backwards at the height of the navel, in such a
way that the pelvis should fall on the neck.
                                                     " One of our learned
colleagues," continues M. Cuvier, "eagerly seizing this novel view,
has announced that it completely refutes all that I had said respect
ing the distance which separate* the Mollusca from the Vertebrata.
Going even much further than the authors of the memoir, he has
concluded from it that zoology has not had until now any solid
basis ; that it has been nothing but an edifice constructed on the
sand ; and that its only indestructible base for the future is a cer
tain principle which he calls unity of composition, and which he
asserts to be capable of an universal application."
    M. Cuvier, being determined to discuss the reality of this princi
ple, began by examining the question in its particular relation to
the Mollusca.
    Now first of all it is best clearly to define the terms, and to Jeter-
mine what we are to understand by the expressions ' unity of com
           '
position? unity of plan.'       If the words wore taken in their most ri
gorous acceptation, it could not be said that there is unity of com
position in two kinds of animals, only except in so far as they are
composed of the same organs: so likewise to prove that there is
unity of plan in their organization, it would be necessary to show
that these identical organs are disposed in the same order in both.
    But it is impossible to suppose that the naturalists who speak
of unity of composition, of unity of plan, in the whole of the animal
kingdom, should have understood things thus, or that they should
have wished to maintain that all animals are composed of the same
 organs, arranged in the same manner.
    Now the terms being thus defined, the principle of unity, re
 stricted as it ought to be, appears incontestably true ; but it is very
far from being new. It forms, on the contrary, one of the bases
 upon which zoology has reposed ever since its origin, — one of the
 principles upon which Aristotle, its creator, has placed      it,— basis
                                                                     a
 which all zoologists worthy of that name have sought to enlarge,
 and to the confirmation of which all the efforts of anatomy have
 been devoted.
     Thus every day mi^ht be discovered in an animal some part which
 was not before known to exist in    it,  and which enables us to seize on
 some additional analogy between that animal and those of different
 generaand classes. The same may be the case with respect to connec
 tions of newly-perceived relations. Labours undertaken in this direc
 tion are eminently useful, and those of M. Geoft'roy-St.-Hilaire        in
 particular are worthy of all the esteem of naturalists.        When, for
                                                                  instance.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                383
instance, he discovered that in comparing the head of a foetus of a
 quadruped with that of a reptile or of an oviparous animal in ge
neral, relations were remarked in the number and the arrangement
of the pieces, which were not to be perceived in adult heads, — when
he proved that the os quadratum in birds, is analogous to the tym
panum in the (Veins of the Mammiferae, lie made discoveries quite
 real and very important, to which M. Cuvier was the first to render
justice in the report which he made on them to the Academy.          These
are additional traits which he has added to resemblances of different
degrees which exist among the composition of different animals ;
but he has only added to the old and known bases of zoology, he
has in no respect changed them.          He has not at all proved either
 the unity or the identity of this composition, nor indeed any thing
 that can afford ground for the establishment of a new principle.
     Thus all naturalists have long known that the Cctacea have on
 the sides of the anus two litlle bones called the rudiments of the
 pelvis.     There is then here, and it has been known for ages, a
 slight resemblance of composition; but nothing can lead to the
 belief that there is unity of composition, since this rudiment of a
 pelvis supports none of the bones of the lower extremity.
     In one word, if by unity of composition be meant identity, a
 thing is affirmed conirary to the plainest testimony of the senses.
     If by it be meant resemblance, analogy, a thing is affirmed which
 is true within certain limits, but which is as old in its principle as
 zoology itself, and to which the newest discoveries have only added,
 in certain cases, features more or less important, without altering
 any thing in its nature.
     Moreover, M. Cuvier (and it is in this especially that he differs
 from the naturalists whom he combats) is far from regarding this
 principle, so important and so long established, as a single principle ;
 on the contrary, he sees in it only a principle subordinate to another,
 much more elevated and much more fruitful — namely, certain con
 ditions of existence, of the suitability of parts, of their adaptation for
 the part which the animal is to perform in nature.       Such is the true
 philosophic principle     from which    the possibility of  certain resem
  blances may flow, and the impossibility of certain others.           Such
  is the rational principle whence that of analogies of plan and of com
  position is deduced, and in which, at the same time, it finds limits
  which it would be vain to attempt to overlook.
      The reality of a certain analogy of composition and of plan be
  ing recognised, naturalists have nothing else to do, (and they do in
 fact nothing else,) but to examine how far this resemblance extends ;
  in what cases and on what points it stops; and if there are beings
  in which it is reduced to such a trifle that it may be said to be no
  thing. It is the especial object of comparative anatomy, which is
  far from being a modern science, since its first author was Aristolle.
      M. Cuvier announces that- in the new edition of his " Lessons of
   Comparative Anatomy," which he is preparing, excited by a desire to
  reduce to just bounds what has been vaguely said on this subject, he
  will consider animals particularly under this point of view, taking care
                                                                          to

 to avail himself of all new discoveries, in order to mark as much as
 possible the extent and limits of the analogies that exist among
 animals.      At present he is to attend especially to the Cephalopoda.
 a subject which he remarked had been happily chosen by his learned
 colleague, since there is none that can better show what truth there
 may be in the principles under discussion, and how far they are
 vague and exaggerated.
    M. Cuvier here enters into the details of the discussion of the
point of view set forth by MM. Laurencet and Meyraux, a point
of view that consists in considering the Mollusca as species of ver
 tebrated animals, bent backwards at the navel, so that the two por
 tions of the spine of the back come in contact.             To appreciate the
justice of this view, M. Cuvier took, in the first place, a vertebrated
animal, which he bent back, as was required, with the pelvis towards
 the nape of the neck, and removed all the integuments of one side,
 in order to show the interior parts well in situ. He then took a
 cuttle-fish, placed it by the side of the vertebrated animal, and ex
amined the respective situation of the parts.
    Passing in review successively the respective position of the head
 and of the different parts which compose             it,
                                                        the large vessels, and
 the organs of generation, the author concludes, from              very detailed
                                                                      a
 comparative examination of these parts, that the analogy which the
authors of the Memoir had thought that they observed,                    illusory
                                                                                is
nearly throughout.
    He even thinks that      it    would be more easy to establish some
 analogy of situation, by supposing the animal to be bent                   direc
                                                                            in

 tion the reverse of that of the hypothesis       ;   then, indeed, the brain,
the liver, oesophagus, stomachs, and the great artery, would remain
 in the same respective position as in vertebrated animals                but the
                                                                            ;
hearts, veins, branchiae, and organs of generation, would still be dif
ferently placed, and the problem would not !>r solved and further     ;
still, M. Cuvier thinks he may affirm that                  it impossible that
                                                                 is
it   ever should be, entirely. Those important organs, the heart
and the branchia?,         always  in   connection with the oesophagus in
vertebrated animals, are here at         a  great distance from           it,
                                                                      and with
out any connection; and from this circumstance necessarily results
an entirely different direction         in the vessels.    Now since the plan
of an animal essentially depends upon the distribution of -the vessels
which convoy nutrition and life to its organs,               may, a priori, be
                                                             it
asserted that the identity of plan of the Cephalopoda and the Ver-
tebrata will never be demonstrated except                 very partial manner.

mass (cheek pouches), then an expansion which occupies the side
of the cartilaginous ring, and supplies the nerves of the great tcnta-

   the nerves of the sac divide and radiate; a third, joined to the cor
   responding one, descends into the abdomen, and is distributed
   among the viscera; a small thread goes to the ear.          There is not
   the slightest trace of a spinal marrow, or of those numerous pairs
   of nerves which spring from it so regularly in vertebrated animals.
   So, likewise, there is neither spine of the back, nor any of tlie limb
  pairs or side pairs which are attached to it.
      That which has misled the authors of the Memoir is the position
  of the ear on the side of the cartilaginous ring opposite to the brain :
  as in the Vertebrata the ear is towards the back of the head, they
  have supposed that it denoted the nape of the neck ; but the ear
  in the Vertebrata is not only at the back of the head, it is also under
  that part, under the brain : in the cuttle-fish it is the same, because
  that part of the ring is the lower; only the two ears, instead of
  resting simply on the sides of the oesophagus, descend lower down,
  and embrace it on the lower side; but they are always underneath.
      Thus, in short, tlie Cephalopoda have a brain inclosed in a sepa^
  rate cavity, eyes, ears in the form of two mandibles, a tongue,
  salivary glands, an oesophagus, a gizzard, a second stomach, an
 intestinal canal, a liver, branchiae, hearts, arteries, veins, nerves,
 organs of the two SCXPS, ovaries, testicles, oviducts, epididyuiin,
 penis, all things which arc common to them with certain Vertebrata;
  but all these differently disposed; nearly always dili'en ntly or
 ganized.
     At the same time they want all the bones of the cranium, all those
 of the face, true jaws, all the bones of the Hyoidian apparatus, and
 of the branchial apparatus ; all the vertebrae, all the bones of the
 extremities, the sides of the sternum, the muscles attached to all
 these parts, the spinal marrow, afl thy nerves which sp1ing from                 it,
 the pancreas, the kidneys, and the bladder.
     At the same time, too, they have many parts, of which there                   i»
 no trace in vertebrated animals;    a    muscular apparatus quite <litt'er-
 ent and adapted to  a    form so extraordinary; frequently       shell, of
                                                                     a             a
structure truly remarkable, and of which no vertebrated animal pre
 sents the slightest vestige; an excrementitial organ which produces
 that black liquor known under the name of encre de seiche or sepia;
a    spongy or glandulous apparatus, which communicates directly
 with their veins by  a    multitude of orifices.
     The tentacula themselves, which     it   has been wished to compare
to the cirrhi of    fish, neither   resemble  them in organization nor in
their connections.        Their complication   is   prodigious: nerves en
larged    from  space  to  space  into  numerous   ganglions, furnish innu
merable threads; very distinct vessels, divided also into innumerable
branches, pass through them and animate them; suckers of an admi
rable structure supply them with an armour of an unique kind?
lastly, the principal cirrhus of fishes   is   but
                                                a    prolongation of their
maxillary bone, while the tentacula of the Cephalopoda are not even
attached to the beak, which, without absolutely representing the
jaws, nevertheless performs their functions.

differences, — how can it be said that between the Cephalopoda and
the Vertebrata there is an identity of composition, a unity of compo
sition, without perverting the terms of language from their most
obvious sense ? 1 shall bring back these facts to their true expression,
when I siiy that the Cephalopoda have many organs which are com
mon to them with the Vertebrata, and which in them perform simi
lar functions ; but that these organs are differently arranged with
relation to each other, and are often constructed in another manner; —
that in them they are accompanied by several other organs which
the Vertebrata have not ; — while the latter have also on their part
several which are wanting in the Cephalopoda."
    M. Cuvier announces to the Academy other communications in
 which he will examine various other principles, various other laws
 set forth by different naturalist*.   But in order that these readings
 may   not be  confined  to  idle  metaphysical questions, he will take
 care always to connect them, like the present one, with some ascer
 tainment of facts from which the science may derive advantage.
    M. Geoffroy-Snint-Hilaire heard the Memoir of M. Cuvier with
 the greatest pleasure : he was delighted to see the discussion opened
 upon the grand principle whose existence he asserts. He will reply,
 and will state precisely what he means by unity of organic composi
tion. In the mean time he thought it necessary to remark, that it
 was not he who had sought to apply this principle to the Mollusca,
 but MM. Laurencet and Meyraux ; it is therefore for them to sup
 port their views against the observations of M. Cuvier.         For him

   According to the latest researches of M. Berzelius, and those of
M. Rose, kermes mineral    is  merely common sulphuret of antimony,
the colour of which  is  owing to its state of minute division.
   Not being perfectly satisfied with the proofs adduced        support
                                                                in
of this composition,I     made some experiments, which have induced
me to form  a  different opinion, and which approximates the idea that
the greater number of chemists have entertained, particularly since
the researches of M. Robiquet.     These experiments are very ancient      ;
                                                                   and

and I should content myself with the publicity which I have given to
them in my lectures, if M. Henry, jun., who has lately published an
interesting memoir on kermes, had not left me some observations to
add.    1 shall distinguish the precipitates formed by sulphuretted hy
drogen in a solution of antimony from kermes, properly so called, be
cause their natures are very different.
   The orange red precipitate, obtained by passing sulphuretted hy
drogen into a solution of emetic tartar, is an hydrated protosulphuret
of antimony. In fact, neither weak muriatic acid nor tartar separates
any oxide from it ; and when solution is effected, it is always accom
panied with the disengagement of sulphuretted hydrogen.
   This sulphuret when dried at 212° Fahr. contains some water, but
not in quantity sufficient to form an hydrosulphuret j it is gradually
expelled up to 446° ; at this point it contains no more, and becomes
black ; when rubbed on paper it gives black marks. It appears to
me analogous to hydrated peroxide of iron, which loses its water gra
dually, becoming more and more brown, as the temperature rises, and
assuming a red colour only when it has lost all its water.
   Sulphuretted hydrogen produces also a red precipitate in the solu
tion of pa-muriate of antimony, but it differs from that obtained from
emetic tartar or the protomuriate ; it is an hydrated persulphuret,
which heat decomposes       into sulphur, which is volatihzed and black
protosulphuret, similar to the preceding.       It is to be observed, that
the black sulphuret obtained by calcining the orange-red sulphuret,
is less fusible than the native black sulphuret ; it resists the action of
a spirit-lamp.
  It is well known that kermes varies in colour, at least, according
to the mode adopted in preparing it.    It is that obtained by the pro
cess of Cluzel (Annales de Cliimie, torn- ixiii. p. |'22), upon which my
observations will be made.   We shall be greatly deceived if we sup
pose  that because kermes  still yields something to water, after nu
merous washings, it is pure only when it ceases to do so ; for if we
were   to wash the subacetate of copper, and many other salts, till
water ceased to dissolve any portion of them, they would be com
pletely decomposed.        The fact is the same with kermes, too much
washing alters its nature. At what point then ought we to stop ?
This is readily discovered by employing the smallest possible quantity
of water in the washings, and in continuing them only until the resi
due, supposing the water to have no chemical action upon              it,
                                                                      contains
only  one-thousandth     or a ten-thousandth   of foreign   matter.
   Kermes mineral, thus washed, has the following properties: — dilute

tion of the hydrated orange sulphuret.           If a current of hydrogen be
passed     at a  low  red heat  over  kermes   deprived of moisture by heat,
much water and sulphuretted hydrogen are obtained, and the anti
mony is reduced ; but, as already observed, the residue possesses an
alkaline re-action.        After these various experiments, it is unquestion
able that kermes contains oxide and sulphuret of antimony, and it
ought to be considered as an oxisulphuret.              The quantity of water
 obtained by decomposing it with hydrogen is variable ;. but it may be
 considered as composed of one proportion of protoxide of antimony
 and two proportions of protosulphuret.          In fact, I obtained 0'9 of the
 proportion of protoxide ; and M. Henry by another process found
 the difference still less.
     It is equally certain that kermes mineral precipitated from the al
 kaline sulphurets which held it in solution, is an hydrate.             It loses
 water gradually as the temperature is raised, and appears black when
 deprived of it ; but in my experiments I did not obtain a definite pro
 portion.
     When potash, soda, or their carbonates act upon black sulphuret of
 antimony, their oxygen goes to the antimony, with which it forms
 protoxide, and the sulphur of the antimony takes the place of the
 oxygen of the alkali : thus it is that no kermes is obtained by boiling
 sulphuret of antimony with sulphuret of potassium saturated with
 sulphur; but by means of iicid, a yellowish orange precipitate is
 formed in the solution, which when heated yields sulphur and becomes
 black. The golden sulphuret gives a similar result. — Ann. de Chim. et

                THORINA AND THOIUNUM.             BY BERZELIUS.
     In the Phil. Mag. for November last, we noticed Berzelius's dis
 covery of a new earth or rather metallic oxide, to which he gave the
 name of Thorina : we add the following particulars respecting it.
 Thorina hardens in the 6re, and it becomes difficult to powder it. Its
 specific gravity is greater than that of any other earth, and almost
 equal to that of oxide of lead, being 9-402. It is infusible and un
 alterable by the blowpipe per se. With borax it dissolves extremely
 slowly and the resulting glass is not transparent, but it may be so
 saturated as to become milky on cooling.              It dissolves slowly with
 gait of phosphorus, and carbonate of soda does not dissolve it at all.
     One hundred parts of thorina appear to consist of
                        Thorina                       88- 1 6
                        Oxygen                          1 |-84
and one hundred parts of hydrate of thorina of
                        Thorina                        88-25
                        Water                          11-75
The weight of its atom, according to Berzelius, is 884'9 ; hydrogen
being unity, we may perhaps assume it to be 70.
    Thorina is distinguished from other earths principally by its com
bination with sulphuric acid ; in this combination, heat precipitates a
salt, which by cooling slowly, but completely, redissolves.          It is, how
ever, to be observed with respect to this re-action, that it does not oc
                                                                              cur

cur when those bases are present, with which thorina forms double salts;
the latter are but little precipitated by heat.     It differs from alumina
and glucina, because it is insoluble in caustic potash, which dissolves
those substances ; from ytlrhi, because it forms a double salt with sul
phate of potash, which is insoluble in a saturated solution of sulphate
of potash : this circumstance furnishes a method of separating it from
yttria.   It differs from zirconia, because the latter, after having been
precipitated hot by sulphate of potash, is for the most part insoluble
in water and the acids, and because thorina is precipitated by ferro-
cyanate of potash, and zirconia is not.        It differs from the oxide of
cerium, in not assuming the same colour when it is dried and burnt,
and also in not giving with the blowpipe a coloured compound with
salt of phosphorus, or borax, either hot or cold, provided it be not at
all mixed with iron.
   From titanic acid it is distinguished by its precipitation with sulphate
of potash, or by the characteristic manner of that acid with the blow
pipe.
    From the metallic oxides, properly so called, and with which there
is some inducement to place it on account of its great specific gravity,
it is distinguished by not being precipitated with sulphuretted hy
drogen. — Bibliotheque Universeue, Dec. 1829.
                      PREPARATION OF MAGNESIUM.
    M. Bussy    has announced to the French Academy, that he has ob
tained magnesium or the metallic base of magnesia, and he sent a
specimen of the metal ; it was procured by the decomposition of the
chloride by a process similar to that employed by M. Wohler.
    Magnesium has the following properties: — it is brilliant, silvery
white, perfectly ductile and malleable, fusible at a moderate tempera
ture, like zinc, volatilized at a temperature a little higher than that
of its melting point, and. like that metal condenses into small glo
bules. It does not decompose water at common temperatures ; it
oxidizes at a high temperature, and is slowly converted into mag
 nesia, when in small masses ; but when in filings, it burns with great
 splendour, throwing out sparks, like iron in oxygen.          .
    M. Bussy is of opinion, that magnesium may be usefully employed
 in the arts ; and he is occupied with endeavouring to find means of
 procuring it in a simple and oeconomical manner. — Le Globe.
 NEW NATIVE COMPOUND OF CARBONATE OF LIME AND CARBO
                                NATE OF SODA.
    This mineral differs from Gay-Lussite, which is a compound of
the same salts ; it was procured by M. Barruel at a mineral dealer's,
 who did not know its origin.         The structure of this substance is
 laminated, has an easy threefold cleavage, and gives a rhomboid
 similar to that of carbonate of lime, as nearly as could be discovered
 by comparing the crystals of these two substances.
    The fragments are perfectly transparent ; the lustre is vitreous,
 resembling that of arragonite. It scratches carbonate of lime readily,
 and arragonite with difficulty.      Its sp. gr. is 2921, and the double

 refraction similar to that of Iceland spar. It dissolves entirely and
with effervescence in nitric acid ; before the blowpipe, per se, it first
decrepitates a little, then becomes brown, and is eventually reduced
 to lime, but with more difficulty than pure limestone.
    In order to analyse     M. Barruel heated       it,

  BAROMETRICAL PRESSURE. — The mean pressure this year is
ofan inch higher than the mean of the last fourteen year* ; but the
number of changes is less than in any former year of that period.
  The mean pressure for December is high, but that for April,
 which was a very wet and stormy month, was remarkably low.
    The mean of the pressures at 8, 2, and 8 o'clock, coincides with
 the annual mean.
    TEMPERATURE. — The mean temperature of the external air this
year, is lower than that of any year since 1 .'•!(>: it     however, only
                                                                   is,
 T-Jr ofa   degree lower than that of 1820, and 4-43 degrees lower
 than that of 1828, which   is the greatest difference that has yet oc
 curred here between any two consecutive years.
    The mean temperatures of January and December were low, and
 they exactly agree with each other: the only remarkable anomaly
 that happened is, that the mean of March was one- hundredth of                a
 degree lower than the mean of February.
  It  may be seen by the table that the yearly maximum tempera
ture of the external air did not exceed summer heat, which is the
least that has occurred since the year 1823, and that the minimum
was fourteen degrees below the freezing point          December
                                                          in        but  ;     a
thermometer that was exposed on          bed of snow the same night
                                          a
receded four degrees lower.
    The mean yearly temperatures at         A.M. and P.M. coincide
                                               8                   8

    The mean yearly temperature of four observations each day;
namely, the maximum, minimum, at            A.M. and

49'14 degrees.      This should  be considered the   truest  yearly mean
temperature, because the mean of the greatest number of thermo-
metrical observations made every twenty-four hours, must unques
tionably approach nearest to the true mean temperature of any
place where  a   meteorological journal    kept, — circumstance that
                                               is         a
has not been duly considered, nor practically applied by those who
have written extensively on meteorology in this country, to obtain
the annual mean temperature.        By this method of ascertaining the
mean temperature of the external air here for the last fourteen
years, it appears to be seven-eighths of degree lower than the mean
                                               a
of the maxima and minima or daily extremes, for the same period
of time.
   The yearly mean state of De Luc's whalebone hygrometer indi
cates that the atmosphere was three-tenths of          degree drier than
                                                             a

   WINDS. — The scale of the prevailing winds shows that their con
tinuance from the eastern side of the meridian           nearly equal to
                                                              is
those  from   the  western side.   This sometimes   happens in compa
ratively  cold  years, unless the  North-west  wind    be of long dura
tion.
   The continuance of the North-east wind            beyond all former
                                                        is
observations, which appears to have lessened the duration of the
wind from the opposite point. This circumstance may have caused
the deficiency in the mean yearly depth of rain, and the- slow eva-

 poration ; as the North-east winds, except those in May, were
 mostly humid.
   The number of strong gales of wind, or the days on which they
 have prevailed this year, is as in the following scale :
           N.  N.E.    E.  S.E.    s.   S.W.   w.   N.W.  Gales.

    The year   1828 was unprecedented in its high annual mean tem
 perature, and 1829 was the coldest since the memorable year 1816.
    January was seasonably cold, mostly frosty, and rather dry, with
 a dark atmosphere and frequent gales of wind.
    February was also dry, calm, remarkably cloudy and humid, in
 somuch that the sun, moon and stars were seen only a few days, and
 was equal to March in its mean temperature.
    March was generally dry, particularly the first fortnight, rather
 cold, with prevailing winds from the N.E. and E., which kept back
 the spring considerably.
    April was cold, boisterous, and very wet throughout, which in
many shaded places injured the bloom of the fruit trees.
   May was very dry, warm, and a fine spring month, attended with
a great evaporation towards the end.
    The first part of June was also dry and fine, and the maximum
temperature of the external air for the year occurred on the 3rd !
The latter part was distinguished by very seasonable showers of
rain, and intervals of strong sunshine, which produced
                                                             astonishing
effects in the growth and maturation of the corn and fruits ; but the
frequency of rain was inconvenient for the making of hay, conse
quently much of it was spoiled in this and the following month be
fore it could be put in ricks.
   July was very wet and stormy, there being only six days without
rain.   The month altogether was appalling to the grower, and fur
nished a bad omen for the fate of the corn harvest.
   The first part of August being fine, the wheat harvest was in
many places got in tolerably well ; but in places where it was not
sufficiently ripe, and where every advantage was not taken of inter
vening fine weather, the greatest difficulties were experienced from
the rains and heavy gales of wind, in securing even average
                                                                   crops
from most abundant ones.        This furnished an instructive lesson to
those agriculturists who were careless about the precariousness
                                                                       of
the harvest weather, and remunerated the forethought and industry
of others.

   September was also wet and stormy, and unusually cold, with the
exception of a few days, which afforded good opportunities for
getting in the barley, oats, &c. More abundant crops of almost
every description of fruit, except wall fruit, had not occurred for
many years, notwithstanding much was blown off the trees before it
                                                                     was

was ripe.    The second crops of grass were good and plentiful, but
they were very generally spoiled by the continual rains.
   October was tolerably fine, with frequent light showers of rain and
hail, accompanied with heavy gales of wind.             Ice and snow ap*
peared on the ground on the 8th in several parts of Hampshire, —
a very early beginning of wintry weather.
    November was rather dry and fine, and alternately mild and cold,
with great changes in the temperature of the atmosphere, and blus
terous winds towards the end. In the night of the 23rd, and on the
24th, three inches in depth of snow fell here, which was unusually
early for so great a quantity.
   December was rather dry, cold and cloudy, except a few days ;
the piercing N.E. winds closed the year by an induction of hard
frosts, and thus gave an early advantage to skaters and sliders to
pursue a pleasant exercise on the ice-bound marshes, moats and
ponds.

     General Observations. — This has been a fine and very dry month; indeed
 so small a quantity of rain has not fallen here in any March for the last
 ten years. The March of 1820 was also fine and dry, but the inean tem
 perature of that period was three degrees lower than that of the present
 month.       A finer time for agricultural purposes could not be desired, as no
 interruption occurred to field labour; and so far as the leafing of the trees
 and the bloom have advanced, every thing bears a promising aspect.
     Ifthere be any truth in the moon's influence over the weather when her*
 phases happen at certain hours, we may anticipate fine growing weather
 till the end of July.        In August it mnv probably be changeable, in which
 case some good may be derived by agriculturists who are acquainted with
 the principles of the barometer, and will regulate their harvest-work by its
 indications, in connection with the state of the hygrometer, and the pre
 vailing modifications of clouds.
     Lunar halos appeared in the evenings of the 4th and 6th, and were ex
 actly 45 degrees in diameter to their interior edges.
                                                                                On

             Meteorological Observationsjbf                   March 1830.             399
   On the 16th, 17th and 18th, the equinoctial gales blew fresh from the
Westward. In the evening of the 19th, at sunset, the clouds cirri, cirro-
cumuli, and cirrostrali passed through a gradation of prismatic colours, par
ticularly the last modification.
   The mean temperature of the air this month is one degree above the
average of March for many years past : and a high atmospheric pressure has
prevailed during the last fortnight.
   Spring water was brought to its minimum temperature for this year so
early as the 20th of February, and remained stationary till the middle of
March, when it began to increase.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are, three solar and three lunar hatos; six meteors;
and four gales of wind, namely, three from the South-west, and one from
the West.
   A very low ebbing of the Tide at Porttmoulh, March 27th, 1830.— On the
information of an active Portsmouth pilot, and others interested in the
unusually low ebbing of the tide this morning, it was found at least six feet
lower at Hamilton's Bank on the western side, and near the mouth of
Portsmouth harbour, than they ever saw it before at the same age of the
moon.     Thirty years ago it is said to have been about as low.
   The Bank on this occasion was completely dry for 160 feet, and on which
a few hours before vessels of large tonnage passed over, persons were seen
walking. His Majesty's ship Victory grounded in Portsmouth harbour ; and
the wreck of the old Boyne, which blew up about thirty-five years ago near
Southsea Castle, made its appearance above water.                  This singular phceno-
menon in the reflux or ebbing of the tide, scarcely three days after the
new moon, may probably turn out a prognostic of some distant convulsion
of nature.

 L I II.  Chemical Examination of a Crystalline Substance from
    the Zinc-foundry at Filisur,- together with an Account of
    some ancient Glass Beads coloured by Oxide of Copper.                By
    the Rev. WM. V. VERNON, F.R.S.*
            substance of which I propose to give an account was
 •*•
        obtained, by my friend Mr. Marshall, from a zinc-foundry
belonging to M. Hitz, at Filisur in the Canton of the Orisons.
It is said to occur oozing out of the crucibles while the metal
is in a state of fusion ; and yet the specimen resembles a natural
mineral so much in its general appearance, that, without this
information, it might have been supposed to have come from
the cavity of a rock or the interstice of a mineral vein.               The
structure    is crystalline,   and   a few  of the crystals  in the  hollow
parts of the specimen are extremely perfect ; they are regular
hexagonal prisms, terminated by similar pyramids +, transpa
rent, amber-coloured, splendent, yielding with difficulty to the
knife: the specific gravity of the more perfectly crystallized
parts is 6*0, but that of inferior pieces is as low as 5*6.
    I  placed a grain of the crystals, in powder, on platinum foil,
and heated it to redness.           There was no loss of weight ; the
powder grew yellow when hot, and whitened again on cooling.
When a crystal was exposed to the reducing flame of the
blowpipe, it evaporated by degrees, and a white film spread

   f  The pyramidal summit is replaced in some of the crystals by a plane
at right angles to the axis of the prism.      The angles which the lateral
planes of the prism make with each other were measured by Mr. John
Phillips with the reflective goniometer, and found to be 120°.

over the     platinum; when ignited with carbonate of soda in the
exterior name of a candle, the globule remained uncoloured*.
    Acids dissolved the powder entirely and without efferves
cence, though with a perceptible smell of sulphuretted hydro
gen. The excess of acid being driven off) water redissolved
the wholef. The solution was precipitated white by ammonia,
an excess of which again took up the precipitate ; it was also
precipitated white by the ferro-prussiate of potash, and by the
sulphuret of ammonia. A solution of a grain, from which the
sulphuret had been thrown down, was evaporated and ignited,
and when the ammoniacal salt was driven off, there was no
residue.
                                   I
    From these experiments was led to conclude that the sub
 stance is oxide of zinc in a state of purity, and uncombined
with any of those substances with which as a mineral it has
been hitherto found united, excepting only a minute and inap
preciable quantity of sulphur ; and I was confirmed in that con
clusion by the following experiment with which                  I terminated
my    examination.        I      a
                            put crystal     into  a solution   of  bisulphate
 of potash ; it dissolved quietly and entirely ; I left the solution
to crystallize, and found all the crystals that were formed to be
right rhombic prisms, which I recognised as the compound
sulphate of potash and zinc.
    It is worth while to observe how nearly this substance and
the natural ore of zinc, in which the oxide, though not abso
lutely pure:):, has been found in the simplest state, resemble
one another in specific gravity and in crystalline form.                   The
specific gravity      of the  red  oxide   of  zinc  found   at  New    Jersey
 in America, is stated to be 6'2; and the late Mr. William
 Phillips has deduced from the cleavage of this mineral, (as it is
met with in an incompletely crystallized state,) the form of a
 regular hexagonal prism.            So that the mineral-laboratory of
 nature    seems   to  have  been  employed in forming the same cry
 stal which the crucible has here produced in a more perfect
form ; and thus the substance before us adds another instance
lo those already known, of the mineralogical presumption, that
 the agency of fire may have been concerned in the formation of
 mineral veins, or in the structure of at least some of the rocks.
    I  will take this opportunity         of communicating also to the
 Society the result of some experiments which have made on I
 the ancient glass beads, lately presented by the Rev. Mr. Stil-
   * It contained therefore no manganese.

      Crystalline Substance from the Zinc-foundry at Filisur.       403

lingfleet — have found the colouring matter of these beads to
be copper.       At the present day cobalt, I believe, is exclusively
employed to produce every shade of blue glass, copper being
only used in staining it red or green ; and I imagine that a
modern artist would be much at a loss to obtain the fine azure
of these beads from copper.           I  find that a blue glass may be
obtained from copper by employing a large proportion of car
bonate of soda in the composition, and I suppose that the blue
colour in this case is given by the carbonate of copper, as the
red is by the protoxide.        I did not succeed, however, in ob
taining  a good   permanent     glass,   and have reason to think that
considerable nicety is required in the proportions, to bring the
process to perfection.        Now we know that the Romans pos
sessed the art of making a blue glass coloured by copper.
 Among the most curious remains found at Pompeii were the
contents of a colour-shop, which were analysed by Sir Hum
phry Davy ; and in the blue frit which he examined, that la
mented philosopher found the colouring matter to be copper.
 I have lately had occasion to show in another instance, that
 antiquarian pursuits, however far they may appear to be dis
joined from experimental philosophy, may sometimes derive
 aid from an alliance with it.      I  pointed out, in a piece of black
 pottery, angular and unaltered fragments of calcareous spar
 forming a part of its constituent ingredients, and inferred
 from hence that this pottery could not have been baked in the
 usual degree ; and     I stated that this was thai black pottery of
 the  Romans      which   we meet with at many of their stations,
 and which a German chemist has shown to have been pro
bably made of clay kneaded with bitumen or pitch, and after
wards charred in a moderate heat.               Now it is obvious that
wherever an antiquary should discover the fragments of a
 pottery manufactured in so peculiar a manner, he would not
 require to know the form of the vessel, or to decypher the
 name of the artist, but could pronounce at once that the arts
 of Rome had penetrated to that place. An inference of the
 same kind     I am disposed to draw from the colouring of these
 i
 glass beads.     The date of the tumuli in which the beads were
 found is in question. The peculiar manner in which the glass
 is coloured, determines me to believe that the tumuli, to
 gether with the implements which they contain of a more
 equivocal character, and with whatever peculiarities in the mode
 of sepulture we may discover in them, are of a date posterior
 to the introduction of the Roman arts into Britain.
    Since this paper was read,         I   have found among the ashes
 contained in a Roman cinerary urn, of black pottery, a frag
 ment of a blue glass bead precisely similar to those which
 were discovered in the tumuli by Mr. Stillingfleet.            I have

divinities of Egypt, which seem to be of the same manufacture.
It is probable that this blue glass was originally an Egyptian
invention, for Pliny ascribes the discovery of a mode of fabri
cating a factitious lapis lazuli to a king of Egypt*.
LI V.     On the Detection of 'Baryta or Strontia when in union
                  with Lime. By Mr. J. ANDREWS-}-.
            best method which has yet been proposed to distin-
r|"'HE
       guish strontia when combined with lime, is perhaps that
  •*•
by    which   Stromeyer first succeeded in determining the com
position    of  arragonite ; and I believe, it alone has been em
ployed in the analyses that have been made by different che
 mists of the varieties of that mineral.              It is founded upon the
insolubility    of   nitrate    of strontia  in  pure   alcohol, which at the
 same time dissolves with facility the nitrate of lime. In theory
 the process is absolutely perfect; and when properly con
 ducted, it seems susceptible in practice of very great precision ;
 but it must at the same time be confessed that its failure in
 the hands of some of the most expert chemists proves it to
 be a far from satisfactory mode of analysis.                   As nitrate of
 baryta is insoluble in alcohol, baryta may likewise in this man
 ner be separated from lime.
    Bucholz having endeavoured unsuccessfully to verify the ana
lysis of Stromeyer, suggested another process, which, though
 he failed himself in executing, was afterwards performed by
 Gehlen. It consisted in separating the strontia from the greater
part of the lime (the mixture being previously reduced to the
pure state) by solution in boiling water, and afterwards distin
 guishing the presence of the former by the crystallization of
 its hydrate on allowing the solution to cool. It is evident that
 although in this way considerable quantities of strontia may
 be detected, yet when it exists in small proportion, the process
 will entirely fail, in consequence of the solubility of strontia in
 cold water.       If baryta be substituted for strontia, this method
 will be still more defective, since that earth is much more so
 luble in water than slrontia.

 King Psamrais : The blue is what most deserves attention ; it is a smalt or
glass powder,   but  its tingeing matter is not cobalt, but copper. Many years
 ago 1 examined the blue glass with which was painted a small figure of Isis
 brought to me from Egypt, and found its colouring matter to be copper.
 I am informed that a fine blue glass cannot at present be obtained by means
 of copper : — what its advantages would be above that from cobalt it is for
artists to decide.''          f  Communicated hy the Author.
                                                                          phate

          of Baryta   or Strontia when  in union with Lime,        405
phate of strontia from a solution of the earths in nitric acid,
and after washing it with repeated affusions of boiling water
to determine its weight.      This mode of analysis appears to me,
with much deference to so high an authority, to be much more
exceptionable than any that has yet been proposed.             I  have
in vain endeavoured to throw down sulphate         of strontia in  this
manner, although present to the amount of 5 per cent; for
when the solution was made so dilute that no precipitate at
first appeared on the addition of sulphate of soda, a volu
minous deposit of crystallized sulphate of lime slowly formed,
without any previous precipitation of sulphate of strontia.
 Nor will boiling water effect a separation of the sulphates
of lime and strontia, as it is nearly impossible to wash away
any considerable quantity of the former sulphate by means of
that liquid, while the latter is at the same time sensibly soluble
in it. It is possible, however, that there may be some circum
 stance on which the success of this experiment depends, of
 which I have not been aware ; for Mr. Brande obtained by
 this means a precipitate which upon examination proved to be
 pure sulphate of strontia, and the weight of which corresponded
 exactly with the original quantity of carbonate of strontia that
 he employed.       It will certainly be less liable to objection in
 the case of baryta; but it appears to me very doubtful whether
 it will effect a complete separation, or distinguish a small quan
 tity, even of that earth.
     The following method, which is merely an extension of that
 proposed by Bucholz, will be found not less sensible in its in
 dications, while it is at the same time more easy of execution,
 and more certain in its results, than the process of Stromeyer.
     Dissolve the carbonates of lime and baryta or strontia in
 nitric acid, evaporate the solution to dryness, and decompose
 the nitrates by heat ; to the dry mass add boiling water (pure
 in the case of baryta, but saturated in the cold with sulphate
 of strontia in the case of that earth), and boil it for a few mi
  nutes, keeping the crucible at the same time loosely covered
  with its lid.    Throw the whole on a covered filter ; and to
  the liquid which passes through add sulphuric acid or a so
  luble sulphate: awhile powder will precipitate if either ba
  ryta or strontia be present ; but if not, the liquid will retain
  its transparency.
     I  decomposed in this manner 99'75 grains of nitrate of lime
  and -25 grain of nitrate of baryta ; a white precipitate immedi
  ately appeared on the addition of sulphuric acid to the filtered
  liquid.    A similar experiment made with equal proportions of
  the nitrates of lime and strontia was attended with the same
  result; the precipitate, however, did not appear quite so soon
  as before.     Hence it appears, that Tfl0dth part at least of ba
                                                                    ryta

406 On the Detection         of Baryta or Strontia in union with Lime.
ryta or strontia united to lime may be in this way rendered
evident. It is almost unnecessary to add, that when pure lime
was treated in a similar manner, no precipitate fell, since sul
phate of lime is nearly four times ns soluble in boiling water
as lime itself.         If
                       however the liquid be raised to the boil
ing point   after  the  addition of the sulphuric acid, one or two
crystals of sulphate of lime will sometimes form ; but, as these
are transparent and of a distinctly crystalline appearance, it is
impossible to mistake them for the sulphate either of baryta or
strontia*.                                 I
               In these experiments, have in general preierred
the employment of sulphuric acid to that of a sulphate, as
I  have found it to be a rather more delicate test, particularly
of the presence of strontia. It must of course be carefully
purified from sulphate of lead.
    It is generally believed, on the authority of Dr. Hope, that
sulphate of strontia is sensibly soluble in water, so that the
addition of a barytic salt or an alkaline carbonate to a solu
tion of      will indicate the presence of both its constituents;
             it,
and this circumstance has been proposed as a distinguishing
test between the sulphates of baryta and strontia.          On the
other hand, the late Mr. Smithson states that " water or so
lution of sulphate of soda, in which sulphate of strontia had
long lain, did not produce the least cloud on the addition of
what    iscommonly called subcarbonate of soda;" and Dr. Thom
son was unable to detect any trace of strontia in the superna
tant liquid which remained after the mutual decomposition of
solutions of sulphate of soda and chloride of strontium.        di  I
gested for some hours sulphate of strontia, obtained by preci
pitation, in pure water, in a solution of sulphate of soda, and
in water acidulated with sulphuric acid carbonate of soda was
                                               ;
added to each liquid, and heat applied a precipitate appeared
                                               ;
in all of them      :  was most considerable in the first, while in
                        it
the last the opalescence was scarcely perceptible 900 grains ;
of the solution in pure water were evaporated to dryness, and
left a residue of sulphate of strontia which weighed -25 grain             ;
from which        follows that one part of sulphate of strontia re
                   it
quires about 3600 parts of water, at the temperature of 60°, for
solution. It also appears that the presence of sulphate of soda
and sulphuric acid (in small quantity) diminishes its solubility.
I  have not examined whether chloride of sodium would pro
duce a similar effect; but the experiments of Dr. Thomson
would lead to this conclusion.
    *
    I  added to three different portions of lime-water saturated at 60°, sul
phate of soda, sulphate of ammonia, and sulphuric acid :   no precipitate ap
peared at the end of some weeks in the first two liquids; but a large quan
tity of gypseous crystals was slowly deposited in the latter in the course of
some days.

LV.        On a simple Method of exhibiting the Combustion    of the
                 Diamond.    By Mr. W. HERAPATH.
      To the Editors of-the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
         Gentlemen,
 I     AM not aware that any simple method of exhibiting the
•*
       combustion of the diamond has been published ; I there
fore send you a description of an apparatus by which it may
readily be effected in oxygen gas.
      Provide a wide-mouthed gas receiver for the oxygen, with
a ground upper surface so as to be closed by a glass plate ; fit
it with a cork, in which make two holes to pass tubes through ;
one to convey hydrogen gas from a bladder, the other to al
low a passage to the carbonic acid. — Perhaps the hasty sketch
which accompanies this will explain better what I mean.
      A is the bladder of hydrogen gas capable of transmitting
a stream upon the diamond by means of a bent jet at the end
 of the glass tube.      The diamond is supported by a fine pla
tinum      wire passed over it as a running noose, the ends be
 ing left an inch long to twist round the flattened end of a stout
 platinum wire, B, stuck in the cork. By holding the diamond
 thus it may readily be detached after the experiment, and the
 fine wire will not conduct away so much caloric as to prevent
 the combustion from continuing.           C, a recurved tube with a
 stopcock attached, to permit the transmission of the carbonic
 acid gas into lime-water.
      Bring the diamond up to a fine white heat by directing a
 stream of the ignited gas upon it (pressing the bladder under
 the arm) ; plunge it while at this heat into the oxygen gas, taking
  care to turn off the hydrogen when in the act of introducing it.

 408                Mr. E. Galloway          on a new Paddle- Wieel.
     The most strange part of the experiment          that althoughis,
it    a simple solution of carbon in oxygen, the gas not being
     is
condensed,    consequently the solid carbon must expand to
become gaseous      yet caloric
                             ;     liberated not only
                                              is           sufficient         in
quantity to maintain the combustion, but also to fuse the sup
porting platinum wire, many times the weight of the diamond.
I generally use flat or rose diamonds, as they are more readily
secured in the wire; one of the value of two or three shillings
is quite large enough. In some instances in which           have in           I
terrupted the experiment to examine the gem, its surface was
dull, retaining traces of the original facets       the edges were
                                                               ;
rounded, and elevated ribs were observed where the platinum
wire had prevented the free access of the gas. When the ex
periment     allowed to terminate, and the oxygen
                  is                                       pure, all          is
the diamond      consumed, except
                        is             particle as large as
                                                    a           pin's              a
point which remains imbedded in the fused platinum.
    Iconceive this experiment goes some way to account for
animal heat for     ;solid carbon,
                             if                      by
                                        merely dissolving in oxy
gen to form carbonic acid, gives out so much caloric, there                            is
no difficulty in supposing carbon, in the liquid form of blood,
to give out caloric under the same circumstances.

410 Dr. Schmidt's Determination        of the Dimensions of the Earth,
application of the formulae derived from this assumption, to the
different measurements which have been executed, has proved
 that every combination of any two of them gives a different
 result for those dimensions.        Jt became, therefore, necessary
 to apply to the whole mass of the best measurements, a prin
 ciple accordant with the nature of the subject, by which the
most probable figure of the earth's surface, resulting from
all of them, might be elicited. This has partly been done
 in an unfinished paper by Walbeck, entitled " Dissertatio
 de forma et magnitudinc telluris, ex dimensis arcubus meri-
 diani definiendis." Walbeck has founded his researches on
 the principle that the sum of the squares of die differences be
 tween the measured and calculated arcs should be a minimum.
 But he neglected in these calculations the second power of the
 ellipticity, and likewise the partial arcs determined between
 the extreme points of a measurement; and his results were
 therefore susceptible of some improvements by a more accu
 rate investigation.
     Having been induced by Professor Gauss to take up this
 subject, I have taken into account the second power of the
 ellipticity, and have so far changed the above-mentioned prin
 ciple, as to make the sum of the squares of the differences
 of the calculated and observed latitudes a minimum, instead
 of that of the squares of the differences of the measured and
 computed arcs of the meridian.           The results of my calcula
 tion have been published by Prof. Gauss in his book entitled
 " Determination of the Difference of Latitude of the Observa
 tories of Gottingen and Altona."           But on a revision, a small
 error in calculation was discovered; and          I became acquainted
 with a small correction which is to be applied to the English
 and East Indian measurements (see Phil. Trans., where Capt
  Kater has proved that the lengths of the arcs in the East Indies
 are to be multiplied by 1 — Q'000018, and those in England by
  1 + G'000007).     A new calculation therefore became necessary,
 which    I here communicate.
     Lety denote the length of the mean degree (the three-hun-
 dred-and-sixtieth part of the terrestrial meridian), « its ellipti
 city; so that if a represent the semiaxis major, and b the semi-
 axis minor, we have b = (1 —a.) a. Let it be assumed, that
    f   =         — toises, and
               10OO
                                  a.  =
                                               ^
                                                 ;   then the following
 measurements       give these final equations for determining         u
 andy:            72-13   = 2100-90 M + 1763-16^

 earth by M. Biot, who has had so great a share in the ex
 perimental researches relating to that subject,     Accompanied
 with his son and assisted         him, M. Biot determined in
                                            by
  1824 the lengths of the pendulum at Milan, Padua, and
 Fiume, upon the parallel of 45° and as the same parallel
                                                     ;
 passes through the old stations of Bourdeaux, Figeac, and
 Clermont, we are thus made acquainted with the lengths of
 the pendulum at the six principal stations of the great arc
 perpendicular to the meridian, extending from Bourdeaux to
 Fiume, which has lately been measured geodetically with so
 much ability and exactness.     We are indebted to the same
 observers for the pendulums at the two new stations of Lipari
 and Barcelona     and for
                      ;      remeasurement of the pendulum at

Metrique being for some reasons deemed exceptionable. Ac

 entertain new notions concerning the figure of the earth, it
 seems important to examine the grounds of it with attention.
    In what follows   I  shall use the lengths of the pendulum in
 M. Biot's paper    without   reducing them to English measures.
 This will save  calculation,   and besides it has this advantage,
 that all the pendulums are reduced to the level of the sea oy
 one uniform rule.     If   A denote the length of the equatorial
 pendulum,    and  I the  length at any latitude A, we shall have,
 by the usual  formula,
                     I = A x      (1  +/  sin '•'*);
 from which we get,
                                   '~A
                          »f=    A sint A
 Now, having assumed some known value for A, if we begin
 at the greatest north latitude, and substitute for / the succes
 sive observed pendulums, we shall obtain a series of values of
f,  which will show whether that coefficient is constant or vari
 able in the supposition of the assumed equatorial pendulum.
 The formula must not be applied to latitudes less than 45°:
 for in such cases, the difference of the pendulums in the nu
 merator is sensibly affected by the errors of observation ; and,
 the effect of these being increased by the small divisor sin sA,
 the results would be too irregular to lead to any certain con
 clusion.    But we shall be able to form an opinion respecting
 the new system advanced by M. Biot without going to lati
 tudes less than 45° ; because the whole decrease of the coeffi
 cient,/ from the pole to the equator attains half its magnitude
 at the parallel of 45°.

the equatorial pendulum is L, it is a necessary consequence
that/ will be variable, and will decrease from the pole to the
equator when we assume an equatorial pendulum greater than
                                        f
L. On the other hand, when we assume an equatorial pen
dulum less than L, the value of will be variable and will in
crease from the pole to the equator.            All this readily follows
from the formula        for/
     In the 5th column, answering to the equatorial pendulum
observed at Rawak, the mean of the first three numbers is
•00524, the value       of/  at the latitude of 75° ; the mean of all
the numbers in the column is -00522, the value               of/   at the
latitude of 60° ; and the mean of the last six numbers is -00519,
              of/

the value          at the latitude of 45°.    In this case it can hardly
be said that         either increases or decreases, the variation of
the equatorial pendulum being too small to produce a sensible
effect.
     By taking the like mean numbers as before in the 6th column,
 which is computed from the equatorial pendulum adopted
 by M. Hint, it will be found that the values            of/  at the lati
 tudes of 75°, 60°, and 45°, are respectively -005 15, "'00510, and
 •00503.      Here there is a regular decrease amounting to -00012
 between the latitudes of 75° and 45°.             This quantity is how
 ever very     small,  and within   the limits  of the discrepancies ob
 servable in the table; and it might be reduced to zero, or
 greatly altered in magnitude, by small variations in the pen
 dulums at the extreme latitudes.           Besides, even if its magni
 tude were well ascertained, we could safely draw no conclu
 sion from it respecting the physical constitution of the globe,
 because it might be occasioned merely by the supposed length
 of the equatorial pendulum.
      In the last column the values       of/   at the latitudes of 75°,
  60°,    and 45°,   are -00506,   -00497,   and    -00486, the decrease
 between the extreme latitudes being -00020.             The greater de
  crease    of/  is caused solely by assuming an equatorial pendu
  lum of a greater length.
       It is therefore very possible that the inference M. Biot
  has drawn respecting the variability         of/   from the pole to the
  equator, is no more than a consequence of small unavoidable
  errors or anomalies in the experiments, and of the equatorial
  pendulum he has assumed.
       It seems clearly to follow from what has been said, that
  the experiments with the pendulum, numerous as they are,
   leave the question of the figure of the earth, and the quantity
  of its oblateness, in some degree indeterminate ; and that this
   will continue to be the case until the precise length of the
  equatorial pendulum is decisively ascertained. Various equa
                                                                     torial

   tonal pendulums represent all the experiments nearly equally
   well; but every individual length gives to the earth a different
   degree of oblateness.
       But if we review the experiments that have already been
   made on or near the equator, what notion can we have of an
   equatorial pendulum, which seems to vary irregularly at every
  different station ? The difference in the pendulums observed.
  at Maranham and St. Thomas answers to about nine vibra
  tions a-day ; and if we compare the pendulum at Maranham
  with the experiments at the Isles of France and Guam, the
  difference amounts to twelve vibrations a-day. To ascertain
  the exact quantity of such anomalies, and to detect their cause,
  is assuredly at present the most important and interesting part
  of this research. Until this be done, the theoretical question
  can never be placed on a sure foundation.

        population renders it much to be regretted that we possess
  so few data for their solution.      The bills of mortality are now

 fear, kept with sufficient accuracy. TheActofthe52ndGeo. III.
 for the better regulating and preserving parish and other re
 gisters of births, baptisms, marriages and burials in England,
 provides many excellent regulations, but attaches no penalties
 to the non-performance of them.
     If we refer to the censuses of the population, we find anomalies
 which it is by no means easy to account for. It seems doubtful
 whether censuses made at such distant intervals of time as once
 in ten years can be accurate, as the experience furnished by one
 must in many cases be lost before a second is commenced. I
hope that something may be done to remedy these defects, and
to give to these researches an accuracy equal to that which has
been attained in almost every other branch of science.
     Two methods present themselves of ascertaining the ratio of
the births and the deaths to the population.           The first, which
is the more obvious, is by comparing the actual numbers of
the living, found by any enumeration or census, with that of the
births and deaths as deduced from registers of baptisms and
burials.
     But these ratios can also be found when the law of mortality

    According to the Population Report 1821, the baptisms in
 England in 1820 were 328,230, and their mean annual rate
 of increase 1-0149; this would give 332,820 for the baptisms
 in 1821, and adding 20,696 for the unentered baptisms, ac
cording to Mr. Rickman, we have 353,516 for the births in
 1821.     The burials in 1820, according to the same Report,
were 198,634; supposing their mean annual rate of increase to
have been also 1-0140, we have 201,410 for the burials in
 1821, and adding 8770, according to Mr. Rickman, for the
 unentered burials, we have 210,180 for the deaths in 1821.
 The population of England according to the census of 1821
 was 11,261,437.
                      353,516                I    = -031392.

    But the population, according to the census, of 1811 was
9,538,827, which gives the annual rate of increase = 1-0167
instead of 1-0127, as given above.                 This error is not consider
able ; it must be recollected that the equation of line 4 is only
rigorously true for the actual rate of increase in 1821.
    The small proportion of births and deaths to the population
is very remarkable.        I  have found by calculation that in a popu
lation, of which the annual rate of increase is 1*015, according
to a table of mortality which I deduced from Dr. Haygarth's
observations at Chester, and which is published in the last
volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society *, the ratio of the births to the population is                      660

   In these calculations I supposed the rate of increase to be

increase of the baptisms (which may be considered the same
as that of the births) as given in each year, by the Report be

     The result of theory agrees pretty well with observation.
It  may be observed that the age from 20 to 30 appears de
cidedly the favourite with females ; for while the error of
theory between 30 and 40 is only + -00005, the error between
20 and 30 is — -00193; the error for males at the same epoch
is + -00039.
    Considering the limits of the errors of which these calcula
tions are susceptible,            I
                         do not think the ratio of the deaths to
the population can differ much from 7*7 or '027;        therefore,               if,
we take the census to be correct, and that 1,26 1,437 was the     1
number of the population in 1821, we have for the deaths in
1821,304,350, instead of 201,410, making the unentered bu
rials amount to 102,940, or nearly a third of the total number.
   Some writers, and particularly Dr. Hawkins in his valuable
work on medical statistics, have inferred from the small pro
portion of the deaths to the population given         the parlia             by
mentary report, and from its being so much less than what ob
                                                                                           tains

try. However consolatory this opinion may be, I fear it will
not stand the test of examination.        The disagreement of the
results given by the census with those given by the best tables
of mortality is so great, that either the one or the other must be
grossly inaccurate : this assertion, however, rests upon my own
calculations, which I shall be very glad to see verified or dis
proved. Considering the manner in which these tables have
been formed, the error will not, I think, be found in them.
The table of Mr. Finlaison does not differ widely from Mr.
Milne's; and this, which can hardly be suspected of being un
favourable, particularly when applied to the population ge
nerally, would give    a ratio far greater than -— .

   In France   the ratio of the legitimate male births to legiti
mate    female  births is about 1-068, the ratio of illegitimate
male births to illegitimate female births is about 1-0-1-S; this
difference has been also remarked in other countries : see a
paper by Professor Babbage, in Dr. Brewster's Journal of
Science, New Series, No. 1. But we have no means, as far as
I know, of ascertaining whether it exists in England; the par
liamentary reports do not separate legitimate and illegitimate
births, nor do the bills of mortality. It would be interesting
to observe the differences presented by different counties with
regard to the number of illegitimate births; and it is much to
be regretted that no information on this subject is to be found.
   In a pamphlet entitled " A Statement of the Principles and
 Objects of a National Colonization Society," it is supposed,
p. 17, that in a population which increases at the rate of four
per cent, per annum, the number of couples who attain the age
of puberty is as one to one hundred in proportion to the whole
 population ; and hence that in Britain, taking the population
 to be twenty millions, " the procreative power every year
 brought into action would be 200,000 couples."
    According to the Chester table of mortality, to which I have
 before referred,       Of  1 0,000 males born,     5765 1          ,
                                                           "'!IUI, llie

                                If we suppose the population to be
 increasing annually in a geometrical progression, of which the
 common ratio is PO 10 (according to the comparison of the
 censuses of 1810 and 1820), the males aged 20 are to the
 male births at present                       ' T"e  ma'e births are

420                  Mr. Lubbock       on the Census.
   With these data it is easy to find that the males of the age
of 20 now, are to the total number of births now, as 25*8 to
10,000, and the females of the age of 20 now, are to the total
number of births now, as 25,53 to 10,000; hence, if the total
number of births annually be to the population as 1 : 31 '854
(see p. 417, line 17), the number of males aged 20 now,
is to the whole population as 80,000 : 10,000,000 nearly, and
the number of females aged 20 now, is to the whole popula
tion as 80,180: 10,000,000 nearly; hence in a population of
twenty millions there are about 160,000 couples aged 20.
    If the total number of births annually be to the population
as 1 : 24-660 (see p. 4-17, line 31), the number of males of the
age of 20 is to the population as 103,360: 10,000,000; and
the number of females of the age of 20 is to the population as
 103,560: 10,000,000 ; hence in a population of twenty millions
there are about 206,720 couples aged 20.              According to the
census of 1821, p. xv. there are 988 males between 15 and 20 to
a population of 10,000 males. Dividing this by 5 we have 197*6;
the ratio of males to females in the population is -95754: 1.
Therefore                x ^~    - = 94'6     according to these data
               (l97'6                       )
there are about       1 89,200 couples aged 20 in a population of
 twenty millions.
    The   rate   of increase   in England has never amounted to
 1-01,  nor do    I think it has ever exceeded 1-017; during the
greater part of the last century it was about 1 -004.            I nave
found that the ratio of the deaths to the population is very
little affected by the rate of increase of the population ; while
the ratio of the births to the population varies very much. If
the population increased at the rate of four per cent, annually,
this ratio would be greater than        — , and  the number  of couples
 aged 20 in the population         of 20,000,000 would exceed consi
 derably 200,000.
    As the census is now under the consideration of Parliament,
it is to be hoped that some means may be devised of obtain.
ing more extensive intbrmation than has hitherto been given:
 the bills of mortality ought to be published for the whole em
pire every year ; the ages at which deaths take place being
distinguished for at least every five years. This is done, be      I
lieve, in almost every other country in Europe but our own,
not excepting Russia ; for I have the bill of mortality before
me for that empire for the year 1827, including thirty-eight
provinces, which are kept distinct, and which present alto
gether a total of more than 600,000 deaths.
    It would be desirable also that the diseases should be stated,
                                                                   from

               on the Improvements ofSteam-Engines            inCornioall.421
from which the deaths have originated, as is done in the Lon
don bills of mortality, distinguishing the sexes.
    It seems necessary that a general registry of births, marriages
and deaths should be established and enforced throughout the
empire, including persons of all religious persuasions: if this
were done and the results published, tables of mortality would
furnish the means of deducing the actual number of the popula
tion more accurately than any census or direct enumeration,
and at all events one method would be a check upon the other.
    The following example will serve to show how a table of
mortality might be deduced, if the number of persons alive in
the population at every age were known.                     According to the
table, page xv. of the Report of the Census of 1821, there are
 147O males between the ages 20 and 30, and 1155 between
 the ages 30 and 40, in a population of 10,000 males, since the
 tenth of these numbers will be very nearly the number of males
 between 25 & 26, and 35 & 36 ;
     147 : 1 15'5 : : male births 25 years previously multiplied by
 the probability of a male at birth living 25 years : male births
 35 years previously multiplied by the probability of a male at
 birth living 35 years; therefore
             probability of a male at birth living 35 years
            probability of a male at birth living 25 years
        = probability of a male aged 25 living 10 years

        ~~

              1470 x male baptisms in 1786'
  The male baptisms in 1796 were               1 17,100 and in 1786, 100,895 :
 with these numbers we get -82971 for the probability of a male
  aged 25 living 10 years. The same probability, according to the
  table of mortality before referred to, p. 417, line 28, is -8882;
  and according to the table of mortality given by Mr. Finlaison
  in the Parliamentary Report on Friendly Societies, 1 827, p. 28,
  is -8777.      Similarly if the number living at each age were
  known, the probability of an individual at every age living one
  year, might be found, and hence a complete table of mortality.
   LX.      On the Origin of the Improvements -which have been made
     in the Performance of Steam- Engines in Cornwall, within tht
     last seventeen Years. By Mr. FAREY.
                             To Richard Taylor, Esq.
         Dear Sir,
                                                                  of your last
   ITNumber,
         is asserted in a communication at p. 323
                    that in my evidence on the patent laws,           there nre
                                                                    statements

422    Mr. Farey      on the  Origin of the Improvements which have
statements     injurious to some improvers and builders of steam-
engines;     and    three passages, marked with inverted commas,
are put    forth  as  the substance of the objectionable statement.
    In the evidence printed by the Committee, those passages
are in the following words, respecting Woolf's patent:
     " Mr. Woolf's invention of "working steam-engines by high
pressure steam, acting expansively (either in one or in two cy
linders)-" at your page 323, the words in parentheses are
omitted.       Again, in the printed evidence, speaking of deep
mining in Cornwall, my words are, " The difference in cost, be
tween the quantity of coals consumed by the engines now in use
 (which are all on Mr. Woolf's system) and by an equal force of
engines, such as were in use before he went into Cornwall in
 1813, would absorb the profit of all the deep mining that is now
carried on in Cornwall,-" this passage is altered at your p. 323,
 so as to become very indefinite.
     What your correspondent calls the substance of my state--
ment, is made the basis of an insinuation, — that in speaking to
the Committee, I ascribed to Mr. Woolf the invention of ex
pansive working, although in writing my treatise on the steam-
 engine, I had before ascribed it to Mr. Watt.
     The true quotation, as above, shows what I really did
ascribe to Mr. Woolf as his invention, for which he had a
patent, four years after Mr. Watt had retired from business
 altogether; and it was not until after having made my defini
 tion, as above, that I stated the engines now in use for deep
mining in Cornwall, to be all on Mr. Woolf's system.                        The
 meaning of the words I used, admits of no mistake, and the.
 statement they convey is true and exact.               If it be intended to
deny    that   Mr.  Woolf    wns   the first who    invented   the system of
 working steam-engines by high pressure                steam   acting expan
sively, either in one or in two cylinders *, or to deny that lie
was the first person who put that system in execution, with
engines of both kinds, first in London for turning machinery,
 and then in Cornwall for draining minesf, the origin of that
system, with particulars of the person, time and place, should
 be stated by the objector.
     The engines now in use for deep mining in Cornwall, are
 strictly within the terms of my definition of Mr. Woolf's in
vention ; for they are worked by high pressure steam, acting
expansively in one cylinder. The engines Mr. Woolf first made
in Cornwall, with two cylinders, have gone out of use, not to
resume Mr. Watt's system of working by low pressure steam
acting expansively, but because engines with one cylinder

                                                                        worked

worked on Mr. Woolf's system (that                is,   by
                                                    high pressure steam
acting expansively),     are  iound  better  for  draining deep mines,
than those   with two   cylinders.    Mr.  Woolf's     engines with two
cylinders, for turning machinery, continue in use in London,
and are very common in France they execute their work with
                                        ;
 less fuel than any engines used for turning machinery.
  It     asserted at p. 324-, that variation in the elasticity of the
        is
steam employed          by
                         no means affects the invention, meaning
Mr. Watt's invention of expansive working also that evidence ;
seems to preponderate against the use of steam of very high
tension. And yet the column there entitled Highest of Watt's,
beginning with 40'6 millions in 1823, and ending with 79' mil
lions in 1829, relates solely to engines which are worked on
Mr. Woolf's system that  ;        is,   byhigh pressure steam acting
expansively.      Let   it be shown when and where any engines,
not strictly within the meaning of those words, ever raised any
thing like l-o-ti millions, which        the least in the column en
                                        is
titled Highest of Watt's; or when and where Mr. Watt ever
worked, or proposed to work, his engines by high pressure
steam acting expansively.
    Mr. Watt's engines are said at p. 32* to have done about
25 millions average duty, whilst superintended by his own
agents.     All the water-works in London are now served by
 Mr. Watt's engines, made by his successors in business at Soho,
and good specimens of execution              they are worked
                                             :                        by
                                                                     low
pressure    steam,  acting expansively      in   one  cylinder, and   the
performance of the best of them             about 25 millions; hence
                                             is
no improvement has been made in the performance of what
are really Mr. Watt's engines since his time.
     Notwithstanding this, your correspondent has put the title
 Highest of Watt's, to performances increasing each year from
40'6 to 79' millions, without explaining to your readers how
such    agreat increase has been effected in the performance of
what he calls Watt's engines. Any explanation that could have
been given, must have brought out the fact which              kept back,
                                                                 is
viz. that they are worked by high pressure steam acting ex
pansively in one cylinder; a system which Mr. Watt never did
propose or execute      ; but as Mr. Woolfdid both propose and
execute      it,
               and brought   it  into common use in Cornwall, how
can my evidence, that those engines are on Mr. Woolf's sy
 stem, be objected to? Or with what propriety can they still be
 called Watt's engines, when they are worked on such a dif
 ferent system as high pressure steam, and low pressure steam,
 and with such a very great advantage in cost of fuel, beyond
 all that Mr. Watt ever did accomplish              ?

    424                Mr. John Taylor       on the   Duty of
   Tcntion of expansive working, why is high pressure steam used
   in Cornwall? explosions have been frequent enough* to deter
   the miners from continuing the use of such a dangerous agent,
   if they could carry on deep mining without its aid.
       The obvious intention of the communication at p. 324 is to
   lead your readers to conclude that Mr. WoolPs patent was
  for no invention at all, and that the system of working steam-
  engines by high pressure steam acting expansively (which he
  alone introduced into use) has had nothing to do with the
  remarkable improvement of the performance of engines in
   Cornwall, within the last seventeen years.
      The mention I made of Mr. Woolf's invention, arose inci
  dentally in answering the various questions put by the Com
  mittee.       I cited Mr. Woolf as an example of the case that has
  so often occurred, where an inventor who has rendered im
  portant service to the public, has derived no benefit from his
  patent, because it expired before the invention came into use;
  and I also cited Mr. Watt, as an example of the rare case of
  an inventor who did derive an adequate recompense for his
  public services, by the operation of an Act of Parliament, which
  prolonged the term of his patent.
      If  any member of the Committee had felt doubtful of the
 accuracy of my statement, further questions would certainly
 have been put, either to me or to others.              I  was fully prepared
 to substantiate all I advanced; and if you think it will prove
 interesting to your readers, you can reprint from the evidence
 reported by the Committee all that relates to Mr. Woolf, and
  I will supply you with the explanation which I should have
 given in support of my statement, if it had been called for.

 LXI.      On the Duty of Steam-Engines in Corn-wall.                By JOHN

                                                                            tain

tain King, superintendant of the packets at Falmouth, and in
consequence Mr. Rennie has been desired to investigate the
facts.
   This gentleman lately visited Cornwall, and            selected for ex
periment Wilson's engine at Wheal Towan, erected by Capt.
Samuel Grose, which has for two years past stood highest in the
monthly reports, and which is so justly celebrated for its per
formance and for its general excellence as a pumping-engine.
   The following are the particulars and dimensions of the
most important parts, as noted by parties present at the mine
at the time of the experiment

   The water contained in this column is HSl'7 cubic feet;
weight 70731 pounds; being at the rate of 11'15 pounds per
square inch of the piston.
   During the experiment made by Mr. Rennie, the engine
made 979 strokes and consumed 6 bushels of coal, which
gives for duty, according to the preceding data, 92,327,000
pounds lifted one foot by each bushel.
   A former experiment on this same engine was made in 1828,
in the presence of several mine agents and engineers, to which
 I alluded in my paper on the duty of steam-engines,                       pub
lished in the " Records of Mining*," and in which the result
was 87,210,000 pounds lifted one foot by each bushel.                    I  find
that the duty reported monthly in the printed duty papers for
 1829, is on an average 76,234,307; and it was 77,290,000 in
the preceding year, as appears from the statements in the pub
lication to which     I  have referred.
    It is satisfactory to perceive that at length this subject seems
likely to receive the attention, and undergo the investigation
it deserves. The facts have been long before the public, but
 they have been much controverted, and rather treated as 'the
statements of visionary or interested persons, than as substan-

     N.  S.  Vol. 7. No. 42. June 1830.                  3  I                tive

426            Mr. John Taylor       on the   Duly of
live results which merited examination.         It has been preferred
 to suppose all kinds of error in the mode of computation or
 in the data rather than admit their consequences; and this
 I have reason to think has been done very often where a little
 inquiry would have produced a satisfactory explanation.
     I  published my paper in the " Records of Mining," with a
 view to promote such inquiry : I traced the history of the duty
 of steam-engines from the earliest period of their application ;
I   endeavoured to show that the standard of comparison, as
 between one pumping-engine and another, was a fair one, not
  withstanding some unimportant imperfections ; and that it was
  to this standard that Messrs. Boulton and Watt appealed for
  proof of the superiority of their engines when engaged in legal
  disputes respecting their patent rights, or in claiming their
  allowance for the use of them.
      I attempted to correct a misapprehension that      I   believed to
  exist as to the purpose of the monthly reports of Duty of En
  gines in Cornwall, and as to the parties by whom they are
  caused to be made. I had often heard, and I continue to hear,
  that they are published by persons concerned in making en
  gines, and that the object might therefore be to exaggerate
  the value of particular improvements: it has sometimes on the
  other hand been stated, that they are carelessly or ignorantly
  done. I showed, in reply to this, that these reports are pro
  cured by the adventurers in the Cornish mines, who use en
  gines so extensively as to render them especially concerned
  in finding out who make them the best, and whose only par
  tiality that I know of, to any construction of an engine        is, to
  that   which  will do their work  at  the least   expense.    The  hi
  story of the steam-engine will exhibit the same fact and hence
                                                         ;
it    has been that Newcomen, Smeaton, Watt, Bull, Horn-
  blower, Woolf, Grose, and others, have found in Cornwall the
  principal field for their first efforts.
     The adventurers   in  deep mines in Cornwall may well desire
  to know accurately the value of the different applications of
  steam power their interest in that question
               ;                                   is  perhaps greater
  than that of any other individuals.        One concern with which
I    am connected, employs       8   engines for drawing water, of
  which   4  have cylinders of 90 inches in diameter; the monthly
  consumption of coal       is about 14,000 bushels, and the ex
  penses    near 12,000/.  a-year.   But if   we take all the mines in
  the county into consideration, there will appear abundance of
  reason for great interest in this matter; and the fact being so,
  how absurd would    it  be to permit any mode of self-deceit and
                                                                 !
  how much more absurd to pay liberally for information, on
  which, according to some, no reliance       is  to be placed
                                                             !
                                                                     But

                      Steam-Engines in Cornwall.                  427
   But are all the adventurers in Cornwall likely to be so ig
norant ? and are they not in a situation to have acquired more
experience in engines than most other persons?            They have
witnessed each step of improvement, they have been parties
to the strifes and contentions respecting them, and they can
certainly tell by their cost-books whether their saving in coal
and in money corresponds or not with the calculations of duty
which they receive from the agents whom they employ and pay
to furnish them with this information ; and they or their ma
nagers can judge whether such agents are competent to the
task, and perform it correctly.        It has been suggested also, as
I hear, that the data are taken in a negligent manner, that
pumps are not correctly gauged, that the coal is not measured,
and that all is vague and indefinite.        Now I have already en
deavoured to show how important it is thought by the owners
of these engines to have a very correct account of their duty.
I have stated that they pay liberally for such an account, and
that their agents at least are competent to judge of the man
ner in which it is furnished by the parties specially appointed
for the purpose.     It is therefore rather too much to suppose
gratuitously   that the   means of obtaining correctness are to
tally neglected.
   I assert, however, that the greatest possible care is taken in
all the steps of the process ; and this I will endeavour to ex
plain more fully.      The duty of the Cornish engines is taken
and computed by Messrs.Thomas and John Lean, who publish
separate lists of the engines which they respectively have the
charge of; the counters are carefully under lock, and no one
has access to them but themselves.            At some mines other
counters are attached     for the   inspection of the agents, and at
the Consolidated Mines a daily computation of duty is made
from them, which is posted up in every engine-house on the
concern.     The average of these, I may observe, is compared
with the monthly report, and found generally to coincide as
nearly as possible.
   The calibre of the pumps is taken occasionally by the re
porter ; and I have been assured by Captain Thomas Lean,
that he does not rely upon any account given to him, but on
his own measurements ; they are subject to some alteration by
wear, which is attended to from time to time.           The experi
ment upon Wheal Towan furnishes some evidence on this
point ; the diameters of the pumps which I have given above
were taken, I presume, to satisfy Mr. Rennie, and they are
stated to eighths of an inch ; they agree very nearly with those
in the report of March by Mr. John Lean.                The shortest
way, however, of comparing, is by taking' the computed weight
                               3  I  2                              of

428             Mr. John Taylor      on the Duly of
of water by each method, which, calculated for Mr. Rennie's
experiment, was                                      70,734 pounds.
                 Stated in duty paper for March 70,605
 So that taking diameters and lengths together, they were found
 rather to exceed the printed account, but differ only by 129
 pounds in the whole.
     Those who are acquainted with the management of the mines
 know that the coal is very accurately measured to each engine;
 both that the duty of the engine may be ascertained, and that
 the drawback allowed by the Custom-House may be obtained,
 which is granted on the oath of the parties that the measure
  ments are correct.
     I will explain with how much precision this is conducted
  nt the Consolidated Mines.        In each engine-house a paper,
  printed  in columns   to  serve for  one month, is placed, called
  The Engine-men     and   Coal-measurer^   List. The engine-men
  are required to place in the column, No. 1, a statement of the
 quantity of coal wanted for the next 24 hours, which is to be
  done between the hours of 7 and 8 in the morning for every
  respective day of the month, and where the coal-measurer
  may refer to know the quantity required.          This person de
  livers the quantity required daily, by accurate measurement,
  and places the account of what he actually delivers in column,
  No. 2; and further, one of the engine-men on duty must see
  the coal delivered into the sheds, keep an account of the mea
  surement, and certify the quantity by marking it in column,
  No. 3. A penalty is imposed for any neglect of this order.
     The engine-men, being to a certain extent responsible for
  the duty of their engine, ought to see, as they do by this regula
  tion, that they have their proper quantity of coal ; and it is the
  express purpose of the coal-measurer's office that no more than
  what is accurately registered be delivered.
      But here, again, the experiment on Wheal Towan engine
  may be quoted; the duty was found to be 92,331,899.           The
   experiment in 1828 gave a result of 87,000,000, and the aver
   age duty of 12 reports published last year was 76,234,307.
   Now as the performance of any engine under experiment will
   be free from those stoppages or hindrances which we know
   diminish duty, and which cannot be avoided in the work of a
  month, we may expect that what would be found in the one
   case would exceed that of the other; and so it proves to be.
   Now as doubtless Mr. Rennie, and the gentlemen who were
   with him, took care to see the coal properly measured and ap
  plied, it follows that the measurement for the 1 2 months, of
  which the duty was reported, was very nearly correct also.
      Wheal Towan is a mine which was in full work previous to
                                                               1814,

deeper than before, and the engines are more loaded in that
proportion.      As greater steam power must therefore be re
quired   than  in 1813;   isthat obtained by the use of a smaller
quantity   of fuel?  and  ifso,   the diminution in quantity pro
                                    is
portionate to the improvement in engines, which we say has
taken place and has that improvement been correctly repre
                ;
sented in the duty papers       ?    If
                                      should appear to be so, then
                                          it
the measurement of coal, the diameter of the pumps, and all
other data, have been correctly assumed and used, and for a
long series of years.
    1 have given in the " Records of Mining" several instances to
 show that the actual quantities of coal used                by
                                                     different mines
 have diminished proportionately with the reported improve
 ment in the engines and
                      ;         I presume      will not be supposed
                                                   it
 that the account books are incorrect, which show the quantity
 of coals bought and paid for.       will repeat the case of Wheal
                                     I
 Towan, as appears to me decisive, and as
               it                                    one with which
                                                        it   is
I   am, personally, totally unconnected, and can have therefore
 no partialities to bias me.
     When the mine ceased to work in 1814, the average monthly
 consumption of coal had been for some time 9360 bushels the                ;
 average duty of engines in Cornwall was then about 20,000,000,
 according to the tables which have given, and which we may
                                     I
 assume as the performance of those engines for this calcula
tion.
        When
           I   wrote my paper in the latter part of 1828, the
monthly consumption of coal at Wheal Towan was but about
2600 bushels, and the average duty of the two engines working
was 66,000,000, as reported in the duty papers.
    Now 66,000,000    is  to 20,000,000 as 9360     to 2830, which
                                                             is
is  sufficiently near to prove the case and in taking a larger
                                               :
average of the coal, and since my paper was published,         find         I
the monthly quantity       is increased to 2900 bushels, the time
including winter months, when there          more water to draw,
                                                   is
and the depth of the mine        somewhat increased. The average
                                is
duty of the engines has in the same time advanced to near
 70*000,000; and calculating as before, 70,000,000       to 20,000 is
as 9360         to 2674, which shows a very near approximation
               is
 to what would be inferred from the actual quantity of coal
supplied.
    There       therefore every kind of proof that the application
               is

wall, and that the rate of improvement has been well expressed
by the printed reports.    The same system and the same mode
of estimating duty have been adopted in the lead-mines in Flint
shire, and the advantages are sufficiently manifest. I can add
that I now receive a regular duty paper from Mexico, show
ing the great advantage that the steam-engines at Real del
Monte have derived from the application of the later improve
ments to them.
   The evidence has been long before the public ; and your
predecessor Dr. Tilloch, who indeed was interested with Mr.
Woolf, repeatedly published statements in the early numbers
of the Philosophical Magazine. Mr. Farey visited Cornwall
with a view to investigate this subject, and this he did as long
ago as 1818.    He conducted an experiment on one of WoolPs
engines,  then   working at Wheal Abraham, and the result
was in his opinion conclusive.      The learned President of the
Royal Society, who has had longer acquaintance with the
progress of improvement of steam-engines in Cornwall than
almost any other person, and who was in the year 1798 one
of five individuals to whom disputes relative to the real per
formance of Mr. Watt's engines were referred, has illustrated
the subject in two papers read before the Royal Society: one
printed in the Transactions for 1827; and the second in the
present session, just published.    He quotes in both the duty
papers as authorities to be  relied on ; and in the latter, states
that the best engine, which is the same that Mr. Renuie hns
taken for experiment, performed a duty in the whole mouth
of December 1829, exceeding the average of 17 engines on
Mr. Watt's construction in 1793, by a proportion of nearly

     My paper in                                was published in
the early part of last year ; and as it was noticed in your fifth
volume, 1 shall only say that I considered the account there
given of the progress of improvement from year to year as the
most interesting part of     it,
                              particularly as a great portion      is
taken from documents which are not in the hands of many.
The results are quoted in your pages.
 I   trust and hope Mr. Rennie's opinion and conclusions on
this interesting subject may also be communicated in some
manner to the public, and that      may be strictly investigated
                                     it
by those  who  may   continue to doubt.
   As much has been said about the motives of .those who
publish statements on this subject,     must be allowed to re
                                          I
peat  for myself and  other  adventurers  in the mines in Corn
wall, that we have no interest whatever in inducing others to
give credit to those statements.    We know that we are reap
                                                                 ing

ing great advantage from the use of certain improvements, and
we might be content to keep this knowledge to ourselves.
    We are not the manufacturers of the engines, but the pur
chasers of them ; we have no monoply to maintain, or any other
advantage to enjoy, but what may be shared by every indivi
dual who may wish to employ similar machines ; but we do
feel it to be an act of justice to those ingenious men, by whose
labours we have benefited, to bear testimony to the success of
their efforts : and as, since the time of Boulton and Watt, no
one who has improved our engines has reaped pecuniary re
ward, it is at least fair that they should have credit for their
skill and exertion.      We are not the partisans of any indivi
dual   artist, we  avail ourselves of the assistance of many ; and
the great scale upon which we have to experiment, makes the
result most interesting to us.
    In the last year, besides many smaller engines for winding
and stamping, the mines in which I am interested in Corn
 wall and Wales, employed 25 steam-engines for pumping, of
which 17 have cylinders from 60 to 90 inches in diameter:
their consumption of coal was 495,4-34 bushels; and a due re
gard to the ceconomy of the application of so vast a power is
 sufficient to interest me in every thing by which it may be
promoted.

 LXII.     On the Dying Struggle of the Dichotomous System. By
    W.   S. MACL.EAY, Esq. M.A.. In a Letter to N. A. VIGORS,
    Esq.  F.R.S.*
       My Dear Vigors,
 COME years have now elapsed since a gentleman, the sable
 ^ hue of whose vesture, if not the smile on his countenance,
 betokened that he should be in peace with all men, came up
 from the North to London, and announced himself to me as
 the Rev. John Fleming, D.D., Minister of Flisk, N. B. Con
 sidering him to be entitled to my services, as being a labourer
 in the same vineyard with myself, I of course showed him all
 the attention in my power. I knew him indeed at the time
 only by two or three articles in the Supplement to the Ency
 clopaedia Britannica, which, if they be not fair specimens of a
 Scotch D.D.'s usual quantum of Greek, will at least remain a
 monument of his talent for writing on animals that he not
 only never saw, but would not even now know if he saw them.
 In addition to these truly novel specimens of Entomological

                                 by N. A. Vigors, Esq.
                                                         knowledge,

    *32         Mr. W.        S.    MacLeay on the Dying Struggle
    knowledge, 1 knew him also by a subsequent compilation,
    called with much modesty "The Philosophy of Zoology;" the
    first volume of which contains nothing new but some miser
    able plates, and the second, little original except a genus termed
    Homea, and some names which have been framed in a proper
    independent spirit, and with a noble contempt of Priscian*.
    These works indeed have been somehow or other praised in
    certain journals ; but as, I repeat,             I
                                                 thought our Reverend
    Doctor to be an industrious man whose love of natural history
    was struggling with various obstacles,                I
                                                   left the development
    of his true merits to time. As his works were seldom or never
    quoted by naturalists, it mattered little to me how they were
    lauded ; and a learned Oxford Professor having stript him
    of some of his borrowed plumes, I thought that small credit
    was to be acquired by plucking him of his last feather, while
    at all events there was charity in the forbearance.      Since I left
    England,     however,  I have  been  informed    that he has written
    some book on British Animals, in which he has distributed
    them, as proposed in his former work, hi double Indian file ;
    that  is,    two and two; or in short, in some way that he fancies
                by
    will render him immortal.        Now two or three years before
    the publication of "The Philosophy of Zoology,"and before my
    having any idea of Dr. Fleming's splitting on this rock,         had  I
    exposed the absurdity of a system which           termed "Dichoto-
                                                          I
    nious."     I  pointed out its deficiencies in the Horcc Entomo-
    locricce, p. 188, and afterwards in a paper read before the
    Linnsean Society in 1826, and since printed in their Transac
    tions. Ignorant apparently of these hints of mine, that might
    have saved him from much disgrace, and chuckling over nis
    discovery of a mare's nest, Dr. Fleming unadvisedly staked
    his reputation on the Dichotomous System. 'Hinc illce la-
    chrynue! Some good-natured friend seems lately to haveshown
    him that his system was annihilated by anticipation; when
    what does this worthy clergyman do, but in the most orthodox
    spirit of theological hate vent his rage, through the medium of
    the Quarterly Review, on me, who never so much as thought
-   of him  !   How he got his article inserted there know not;   I
      * Thus we have Trochiuida;, Gordiusidce,and Pliinaidts      ; Gyrmeiio;, Cicm-
    dt'/Hdic, and Scirteridce, cum multis aliis in dee   ofsimilar calibre.   Having
    two l)s tacked to the end of his own name, the worthy minister doubtless
    thinks that he has    aright to clap one to the tail of any thing. On the other
    hand, there     no end to old friends disguised under such appellations as
                     is
    T/uiphoziu, Ornilhorinchut, or Ophitthocomus, &c.         which might pass for
                                                              ;
    slovenly printing, were they not accompanied         by
                                                          such new words as Aluco,
    C'ittuda, Coriudo, and some hundred of equally classical value.         Luckily,
    however.no great harm        done for few naturalists place the Doctor's names
                                   is   ;
    even in their list of synonyms.
                                                                               but

but, I suppose, that, trusting to his universally applicable
binary system, he knew that editors must be either asleep or
awake, and with cautious modesty preferred to catch the King
of the Quarterly napping. So far in this respect he seems to
have succeeded, that a considerable part of his article is com
posed of verbatim extracts from "The Philosophy of Zoology."
As for me, I certainly would have consigned the author of
this Review to the contempt he deserves, if he had not con
trived to get it inserted in so respectable a periodical. But now
I must confess, that the minister's venom becomes more likely
to poison the minds of persons not versed in natural history,
than it could have done if conveyed through the pages of" The
Philosophy of Zoology."
   Dr. Fleming's scientific history seems to be this : — Confined
to his parish. in a remote part of the kingdom, he took up
zoology to be a resource against ennui, as many others have
done-before him ; and measuring Nature by his own capability
of observing her, he stumbled on the Binary System, probably
because the ins and outs of the pulpit appeared to him to be
the most interesting division of his flock ; and because the
minister and his precentor furnished him with the most obvious
subdivision of the contents of the pulpit. With the scanty
museum afforded by his glebe, he came in due process of time,
as may be seen from the Quarterly, to distinguish accurately the
hare from the rabbit, and the dwarf from the common elder.
Practical knowledge being thus acquired, and some theory
from such rare authors as Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck, our
naturalist set up as a contributor of Natural History articles to
the Edinburgh Encyclopedias; a class of works, that, so far as
we have yet seen, has presented us with nothing in zoology but
stale compilations miserably travestied. Flattered by a success
in this drudgery, which few naturalists would have contested
with him, he then compiled his "Philosophy of Zoology;" a
book which rests its sole claim to distinction on the Doctor's
formerly supposed discovery of the Dichotomous System. It
so happened, as before mentioned, that by two or three words
I  had previously demolished this system ; and now the " phi
losophy" of our zoologist, on finding it out, will not allow him
to forgive me. Had this man more depth, my task in quench
ing him might have been a difficult one; for you know I have
no extensive libraries to refer to: but as no part of his attack
that is not marked with the stamp of ignorance claims a more
respectable character than that of superficial ribaldry, I am
not afraid to take up the gauntlet he has so foolishly thrown
down.
    In the first place I must inform him, that it is a matter of
N. S. Vol. 7. No. 42. June 1830.                3 K            the

4-34        Mr. W. S. MacLeay           on the    Dying Stmggle
the most perfect indifference to me, whether he advocates the
binary, the quinary, or the centenary system.               I
                                                write not, and
1 have never written, but to amuse myself.              I
                                               have never de
graded natural history into book-making, nor considered the
science as a mode of making money by puffing.                   If I
                                                              had, the
HOTCE Entomologiece, the principal part of the copies of which
was burnt in the bookseller's hands, with his house, almost
immediately after the publication, would long ago have been
reprinted.      My work, therefore, has remained in few hands;
and if it has attained public notice, it is certainly not owing to
any extraordinary trouble having been taken by its author for
that purpose.     I    cannot indeed be blind to the changes it has
effected in the English school of zoology.          These are evident
on the slightest comparison of the zoological works published
in England previous and subsequent to 1822.                 But     can I
assure Dr. Fleming 1 never puffed the work : I have neither
unblushingly reviewed       it,  nor attempted to burnish      brighter
                                                                  it
by detracting      from    the  just merits of other works. And, in
 short, although repeatedly called upon by my bookseller,- as
 well as by eminent naturalists, to republish,         Ihave left     toit
its fate on the strength of some 80 or 100 copies, which            be  I
lieve are all that exist, in the hands of naturalists.       This con
 duct, however, which in a great measure has resulted from the
 irksomeness of going twice over the same ground,             now per
                                                                I
 ceive to be attended with the great inconvenience, that                     it
 allows any malicious or dishonest person to misquote me as he
 pleases;    for few have the ineaus of detecting the crime.        To
 those   who   have   seen my    work,  Iappeal whether the author of
 this article in the Quarterly has not written in malice. This
is  evident from his mode of quoting; from his disgracefully
 pirating some of my observations and making them pass for
 Lis own; and, lastly, from the. obvious desire he has to distin
 guish between MM. Lamarck and Macleay, by the former
 being the
              " Author" of the system Progressive Developement,
                                          of
 and the latter only the "Advocate" of the system              Circular
                                                                  of
 Affinities.    While    on  this head, I  must remind  him,  that not
 withstanding      his  once supposed    " discovery," the minister of
 Flisk is  himself only the advocate of the Dichotomous System               ;
 with this difference indeed, that when every other person has
 taken it  up, tried  it,   and spurned       he alone remains to ad
                                            it,
 mire the beauties of this stale mode of division.        Indeed, Dr.
 Fleming now says,        "  As the dichotomous method          the ex
                                                                   is
 hibition of a process of thought universally practised by the
human mind, we may well be surprised that any other mode of
arrangement for establishing a distinction among species ever
usurped its place.          We"   (i. e. Dr. Fleming) " disclaim all

                   of the   Dichotomous     System.           435
idea of regarding it as a modern invention, or that Peter
Ramus has the merit of its establishment." Now be it ob
served, that I  never said that Peter Ramus had the merit of
its establishment.    My words are, " Those divisions so much
insisted on by Peter Ramus, which consist of two members,
one of which is contradictory of the other, are sure to be
complete ; but, unfortunately, one or both are always too com
prehensive."     Dr. Fleming adds, " In the earliest writings of
the world, those of the Jewish legislator, positive and negative
characters are used in classifying organized beings, exhibiting
not indistinctly the rudiments of the dichotomous method."
No doubt.       It is precisely because his writings are the
earliest in the world, that positive and negative characters
are used by Moses.        But, observe, he does not use them
always ; and, therefore, if it be Scripture that is to afford us
rules for natural history, no absolute rule is laid down on
this particular subject. It is really surprising how this eleventh
chapter of Leviticus is shovelled into our faces by various
writers.    Another clerical naturalist has supported the qua
ternary division, because in this very chapter grasshoppers
are divided into four kinds, the word translated " beetle"
in the Bible being considered by Hebrew scholars to allude
to a kind of locust.     Dr. Harris, on the other hand, in his
" Natural History of the Bible," gives the Mosaic arrangement
of natural history as into triads, thus.

Another clergyman afterwards, looking also to Scripture, de
clared seven to be the correct number.     Where Doctors
differ, who shall decide?    Clergymen,       must be allowed,

American divine, quoting Scripture against each other, each
for his favourite number, seven, two, or three.         Solomon
moreover distributes animals by      quaternary" division.

4>36       Mr. W. S. MacLeay       on the Dying Struggle
I   not therefore, unlearned layman as I am, permitted to
doubt that Scripture has laid down any positive rule on the
subject?     I suspect indeed, that, whatever Moses may have
himself   known,   he was aware that he was writing the Penta
 teuch for men who were neither chemists, astronomers, or
naturalists; and that if he had addressed the Israelites in
 the language of science, his laws on the subject of clean
 and unclean animals would have remained incomprehensible
 to them. In the very chapter which we are now told exhibits
 not indistinctly the rudiments of the dicbotomous method,
 we find the following law : " And these are they which ye
 shall have in abomination among the fowls; the eagle, &c.
 and the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
 the bat."    Are we then, upon the authority of Moses, to place
 the bat among fowls ?       For heaven's sake, if clergymen be
 anxious, and properly anxious, not to forget their profession,
 let them at the same time bear in mind that the cause of
 religion is more hurt than aided by absurd and inconsiderate
 zeal. The Bible was intended to direct our moral conduct
 and religious belief.   No one but a madman, a fanatic, or an
 interested knave, can pretend to tell us that it is an encyclo
 paedia of science.     But Dr. Fleming, not content with the
 Mosaic authority, says, " In the writings of Aristotle equally
 obvious traces of this method may be perceived, not only in
 the construction of his different classes, but in the numerous
 accurate subdivisions which he announced."        Let us here di
 chotomize. Either Dr. Fleming has read Aristotle or he has
 not. If he has readhim, hehas stated what he knew to be not true ;
 since the Stagyrite has not, as may be seen from the synopsis
 I  have given of his System in the Linnaean Transactions,
 considered it more necessary to divide animals into twos,
 than Lamarck, Cuvier, or Linnaeus : and if the Doctor has
 not read him, what shall we say to the modest assurance of
 this minister of Flisk? Although Aristotle, however, has not
 deemed it requisite to construct his different classes and nu
 merous subdivisions necessarily on this method, he was per
 fectly aware of its merits and defects, as has been shown in the
 Linnaean Transactions, from which         I quote the following
 words: " Secondly, Aristotle says, Organs may be arranged
 according to their excess and defect (naff inrepoxyv x«| eXAEi\f*iv).
 This being entirely a consideration of quantity and not of form,
 his mathematical axiom comes into play.        His opinion is ac
 cordingly   correct, that animals  are capable of a binary distri
 bution, depending entirely on the excess or defect of particular
  organs; as where he instances birds being divisible into those
 with long and those with short beaks, into those with crests
 and those without crests, &c. &c. This is the most arbitrary,
                                                                and

and therefore, I suppose, the oldest of all modes of arrange
ment : and, as Aristotle expressly says, so easy that any one
may adopt it. I have said a few words on its merits in the
Horec Entomologiece ; but the truth                      is,
                                           that, proceed ing entirely
on the notion of division, and not of affinity,            a method   it   is
which     applicable
            is        to  all sciences  whatsoever    as much   as to
zoology. It has nothing to do with the Natural System, which
must of course depend upon affinities." In fact,            the prin      it   is
ciple ofdistinction carried to the extreme and Aristotle there ;
fore was perfectly aware that       must completely fail when our

   Dr. Fleming boldly adds " More recently, in the writings
                                        :
of Lister, Willoiighby, and Ray, the dichotomous system
occupied the situation which        merited."  it Now Willoughby
have   I not got with me in the Havana to refer to; but his
arrangement ought to be that of Ray; and both Ray and
Lister have given the binary method the situation            merited,          it
that     they have disregarded it; and nothing but the most
          is,
consummate courage could ever have induced Dr. Fleming to
bolster up the child of his adoption by such equivocal assertions.
 Oh but Aristotle has TOC JJcoa and T« <£UT«, &c., and Ray his
      !
Metamorphota and Ametamorphota, &c. No doubt they have.
 Every naturalist has thought        proper to divide some group
                                                it
 or other into two parts but      ;    quite another thing to have
                                            it      is
no other method of dividing groups, and this              which our   it   is
D.D.       is    driving at.
   Immediately on the publication of my work,         respectable         a
naturalist, Mr. Haworth, took up this method in the Philo
sophical Magazine, and even gave afterwards, in the same
periodical,   division of Crustacea founded upon it; so that the
                   a
minister of Flisk has not even the credit of reviving dichotomy.
Indeed     may myself lay claim to its revival, although
           I                                                raised                  I
it from the dead only for the purpose of pointing out its de
fects. Mr. Haworth,       believe, like every naturalist of sense,
                                I
soon abandoned it; and Dr. Fleming, as has been said, remains
its sole admirer.
   This dichotomizing Doctor takes the " Divisio Naturalis
Animalium" of Linnaeus and exclaiming no doubt with his
brother Dominie, " Prodigious .'.'.'" he transforms

         method, either Dr. Fleming believes this to be a correct mode
         of distributing animals, or an incorrect one. If he thinks it
         correct, he by means of his binary system makes the notable
         discovery, that insects and worms have all a heart and white
         blood ! And if he thinks it incorrect, it surely is as little a
         proof of the beauty of the binary system as of the brightness
         of his brains, that it should chime so readily in with error.
            A similar dichotomous dilemma may be applied to the
         Doctor's botany : for in the same way this frisky and " frolick-
         some" minister "makes a great leap" to plants ; and, to prove
         his intimate acquaintance with natural orders, chooses, HOT
         ef-oxyv, the I .imia-un class Diandria and order Monogynia, a
         group which most naturally lumps the ash, the speedwell,
         the sage, and the duckweed, all together. The duckweed how
         ever running rather restive, our botanist very conveniently
         leaves it out, and then divides his " Assemblage of approxima
         tions" thus, in what he calls " their proper subordination."

         two groups " or inferior divisions, the first distinguished by a
         positive character, and the second       a negative     and who  by                      ;"
         may not thus ultimately make out John Fleming, Doctor of
         Divinity and Dominie of Flisk, to be a breecheu Scotchman,
                                                                                                                 or

or any thing else, provided always that the said lout does not
fall into " the error which Linnaeus committed, in neglecting
to arrange his groups so as to preserve their subordinate
relations."       This evil Dr. Fleming thinks not likely to be
removed "until distinct conceptions shall prevail respecting
positive and negative characters."          Although there be too
much reason to fear that his own distinct conceptions are de
ferred ad Grcecas calendas, I still indulge some hope of his
granting that in the above "dichotomous arrangement" a
very distinct conception of positive and negative characters
has been shown.          Man in this system may be compared to
 the trunk of a tree, Dominies and D.D.s to the branches, and
 John Fleming to the bud or leaf on the spray.
       But jesting apart, it is almost incredible that any person
 pretending to be a naturalist should at this time of day palm
 such stuff upon us as the summum bonum of natural history.
  " How different," cries the Reverend D.D. in the very ecstasy
 of self-approbation, " How different is this mode of aiding
  the student, from those cumbrous methods in common use !
  But there are obvious reasons why it is so generally neglected.
  The labour of an author who pursues the dichotomous method
  is greatly increased."      Increased indeed the labour is by the
  distinction of yes and no on every possible point of habit and
  structure being manifestly infinite ; and nevertheless such is
  the degrading nature of this useless toil that it can be under
  taken by every person who can count his five fingers.         But if
  the labour be thus greatly increased, according to the Doctor's
  confession, how is the Dichotomous method less cumbrous than
   the methods in common use ?          " Aye, that is a question," as
   his countrymen say.
       I  never have had the sleepiness of knowing whether Dr.
   Fleming be one of the tribe of spin-texts, but he now gives
   ample proofs of his being a very able Twist-text. He excells
   even his Joe Miller brother of die cloth, who extinguished
   ladies' top-knots by the well-selected text "Top not come
   down."       Our D.D. deserves credit certainly for lugging me
    in, of all persons in the world, to favour, by hook and by crook,
    his dichotomous system.       As he had so preposterously cited
    Aristotle, Lister, and Ray, he might certainly as well throw
    me in to swell his lump of authorities.       " Instead of having
    discovered the circular arrangement in the organized king
    dom" (here by the way is another new kingdom) "as a whole,
     and accomplished a quinary distribution at the very commence
     ment of the scheme — the author has found it necessary to con
     sider animals and vegetables as constituting only two distinct
     circles."   To be sure I found it necessary, because Nature
                                                                 points

440        Mr. W. S. MacLeay                    on the      Dying Struggle
points out those divisions as two out of five.      Nothing would
have surprised me more than to have discovered organized
matter forming a circular group as a whole, or to have ac
complished a quinary distribution of it at the outset.         This
worthy, therefore, according to his favourite dichotomy, must
either not have read the following passage of my work, or,
having read, have been too dull to understand it.        My words
are as follow   :
                  " We    have two  natural,  but I fear  somewhat
arbitrary, divisions of matter, into organic and inorganic.      No
person denies the existence of this division in nature, still less
is the use of it to be despised.      The truth however        that           is,
the   first great division  of matter    not  yet ascertained,
                                                       is       and
the knowledge of            it,
                         to say nothing   of  the celestial bodies,
must in a great measure depend on the labours of the che
mist, who has hitherto so little elucidated the nature of heat,
light, and many other of those subtle substances which are
possibly forms of matter." Who does not see that           was here   I
hinting at the quinary division    of matter,  as much as       had          if
                                                                             I

   If   the ReverendDoctor be still in doubt that this was my
meaning, let him turn to vol. xiv. of the Linnaean Transactions,
p. 60.  There, speaking of M. Fries, say, " Consequently in
                                                       I
every circle he admits the existence of two central groups,
and three radial; that is, in all five natural groups.     Thus
organized matter    the centrum
                       is           of  matter, and    composed       is
of animals and vegetables.     And so on, we shall ever find                         a
natural group to be a circle of five minor groups, and that
two of these minor groups form what M. Fries would call a
centrum, or, more correctly, have some character in common
which distinguishes them from the other three."        So much
for the first citation from the Horcc Entomologicce in favour of
Dichotomy.
   Next he says    :   " Even
                           animals themselves are considered as
having been created   on two distinct plans."     This, a quinarian
may be allowed to say,      the very quintessence of quoting.
                                  is                                                I
shall give the whole passage as        occurs in the Horce Ento-
                                                it
mologicte :  " Animals   appear   to  have   been created on two
distinct plans;  or, to  make  use  of an  idea frequently adopted
in this work, Nature seems         the Animal Kingdom to have
                                           in
set out from inorganic            matter by two different routes, which
                                                                                  meet

meet together, and complete the circle among the Annelida
and Crustacea" In short, the two routes form the circle; — but
the latter part of the sentence did not suit the Doctor's pur
pose.   So much then for his second quotation to prove me
adopting his binary division in opposition to the circular
arrangement.
   " The distinction between these two plans is strangely in
accurate," adds the Dominie, "since among the Annidosa of
the second division, organs of circulation and respiration are
exhibited as perfect as among the Mollusca of the first division."
Indeed ! Who told him so ? One would really think that he
had caught me tripping; but, unfortunately, our worthy has
here, with his usual fairness, appropriated to himself the
discovery ofmy inaccuracy; when, after stating the above two
plans, I myself immediately say,
                                         " This difference of con
struction may be thus represented, although speaking properly,
the rule only applies to the greatest part of the Ammlosa, and
not to the Crustacea and Arachnida." And yet, pretending
to detect my strange inaccuracy, he kindly offers to overlook
it, althoughI    verily believe he would never have been aware
of the objection        had not laid
                    if Iif               before him.
                                         it
    The truth   is,    our worthy D.D. had been wise, he would
never have stirred up this puddle, for no better proof can be
given of the absurd inutility of his Dichotomous System.                   I
pointed out as above       binary distinction, and at the same time
                             a
showed its inaccuracy.        The Dominie most honourably states
this inaccuracy as a discovery of his own; most Christianly
charges the fault on me; and, nevertheless, in spite of all in
accuracies, having      a strong stomach for number two, and an
inordinate love of number one, he greedily swallows this very

 He cannot omit the occasion of falsely charging me with
 inaccuracy, but      isat the same time too blind to see that he
 thus defiles his beloved mare's nest.       He ought to have re
 collected his country's definition of an ill-bird.
    " In the course of the efforts which have been made to
 establish the Quinarian System," the Doctor says, " we have
 witnessed a classification of animals founded on the characters
 of their circulating and respiringorgans saciificed, with scarcely
 the shadow of apology, to hypothetical views." This imagine      I
 indeed to be the whole secret of the Review. Dr. Fleming has
    N. S. Vol. 7.   No. 42. June 1830.           3L

442         Mr. W. S. MacLeay               on the   Dying Struggle
witnessed    his dichotomy of British animals founded on their
circulation spurned, scoffed at, and sacrificed to that quinary
system, which takes notice of circulation and every thing else,
and which in the vexation of his soul he is pleased to call hy
pothetical views.      Not a shadow of apology has been vouch
safed on the occasion.         " Even the division of animals into
vertebral and invertebral has been rejected, because it does not
state enough ; and that the young naturalist, placing full re
liance on   it, may be led to conceive that animals have been
formed on only two distinct plans."          Thus have declared I
that the Vertebrata form one natural group, and that so far
all other animals may be correctly called Invertebrata but                  ;         it
is  said that these Invertebrata do not present one natural group
of equal degree with the Vertebrata, but four. " This state
ment however," says the Dominie, "exhibits a very inaccurate
view of the subject for while the vertebral group
                         ;                                  declared   is
as formed on a Plan (and this no one will deny), the inverte
bral group       distinguished only by the negative mark, being
             a is
destitute of vertebral column and concomitant characters."
This means, in plain English, that the above statement            in             is
accurate, because what         not vertebral must be invertebral, —
                                  is
because Dr. Fleming          not the Pope.

                             is                                  not             is
very difficult to be believed. But        does not therefore follow
                                                it
that no animal out of the natural group called Vertebrata can
possess vertebrae.      Such     notion,
                                   a          to be hoped,
                                                it   is        not a        is
good test of the state of zoological knowledge on the north
side of the Tweed.        Here        D.D. who has been for years
                                       is   a
manufacturing      books  on  Natural  History, and he appears not
yet   to  know   what  every zoologist since Aristotle could have-
told him, namely, that Annulosa possess         vertebrated column,

Perhaps he will say that he knows this also, and has therefore
grouped the Annulosa with the Vertebrata under the common
title of Articulata * in his late work on British Animals.                            I
know not whether he has done this but           ; so, how comes he
                                                          if
in another part of his article to be angry at the Mollusca being
proved inferior to the Annulosa             ?
    But proceed with his quotations from myself in favour of
      I
number two. It seems that Mr. MacLeay "acknowledges
that the Vertebrata are the perfection of one plan of organi
zation, as the Annulosa may be of another."            do indeed acI
knowledge     it, and much more my surprise, that this most
brilliant genius has not also scraped up in his own behalf

                                                                            passages

passages out of my works to much greater purpose.                      For in
stance,    in Hor. Ent. p. 1 34, he     will find  " En,    naturae     arboris
dichotomi corpora omnia proferentis terrestria organica ex ra-
musculis extremis nspicias unum !" In page 200 he will find
that " the great object of my essay is to trace the ramifications
of this dichotomous tree* to its extreme fibres," &c. &c. The
Doctor indeed, as usual, appropriates to himself this last idea,
and clothing it in his own milk-and-water language passes
it off on the poor editor of the Quarterly as his own.                      But
the strongest argument in his own favour that he could pos
sibly have taken from my works, he has most unaccountably
altogether omitted ; to wit, that to this day I always dicho
tomize a group of five into two Normal and three Aberrant
groups., which two divisions are distinguished from each other
by a positive and negative character.           " Ah ! " says the Do
                                I
minie, "after all, at last have caught you; you remain bi
nary to the backbone."            So far indeed I do, and that for a
very simple reason, which will show him how he and all other
admirers of positives and negatives fall so invariably on the
number two.
    Linnaeus said, " Scias characterem non constituere genus,
sed genus characterem."            This rule indeed is in direct oppo
sition to the Dichotomous System, which first fixes on some
positive character, and so forms the second group by antithe
sis.    Nevertheless I .adopt the above Linnaean maxim, and
having followed my circle of affinities, and found two out of
five groups to be what Fries called a centrum,             I  then seek for
some character that will insulate this centrum.                 Having ills-
covered this, I find then, without the aid of the least magic,
that the other three of the five groups must remain in the o/v
posite category.                                         I
                      And this is precisely what have over and
over again said: "No person denies the existence of the bi
nary division, still less is the use of it to be despised." Dr.
Fleming may therefore make what use of the above quotations
from me he pleases.          If he thinks I now deny the binary di
visions there stated, he is mistaken. They are sound, they
are solid, with the one exception I have stated; but really                    I
did not think that they deserved to be set forth with such mag
nificent solemnity, or that the wonderful, thrice-wonderful
conviction of the author of the Horee Entomologicce, as to " the
existence of only two plans in the animal kingdom," required
   * The expression "dichotomous tree" alludes here to thut
                                                                binary division
of organized matter into animals and vegetables which is explained Nor. Ent.

analogies.

the word two to be printed in italics. The little word only is,
it may be observed, foisted in here with his usual honesty by
Dr. Fleming ; and as these four letters involve the whole of
the question, I shall cite the passage from which this worthy
quotes, at full length.
                             " Animals have been divided into ver-
tebrated and unverteb rated. Now this division, as M. Cuvier
perceived, errs more in its nature, of which we have already
exposed the defects, than in its particular relation to zoology.
The objection to it is not that it is contrary to truth, but that
it does not state enough, and that the young naturalist,
placing full reliance on  it,   may be led to conceive that animals
have been formed on only two distinct plans.        Had the animal
kingdom however been divided into radiated and not radiated,
or into annulose and not annulose, both of these methods would
have been equally applicable with that proposed by the cele
brated author of the Histoire Naturelle des Animaux sans Ver-
tebres," (p. 208).      repeat that our D.D.       most able Twist-
                 I                           is
                                             a
text.
    But animals are only vertebral and invertebral, says the
Dominie; and the proof     is,  that you, Mr. MacLeay, are " con
vinced of the existence of only two plans in the animal king
dom, because you acknowledge that the Vertebrata are the
perfection of one plan of organization, as the Annulosa may be
of another."      Now granting this to be   a   perfectly legitimate
Scotch sequitur why may not the two plans
               ;                                I   am thus proved
to be convinced of, be ANNULOSE and NOT ANNULOSE, as well
as vertebral and invertebral     ?  Let the Reverend Padre tell me
why. To talk therefore of there being only two certain divisions
in the animal kingdom, however convenient for the dichoto
mizing Minister of Flisk,       isrank nonsense when we can just
                                                ;
as truly and as easily divide animals into asses and not asses.
    The editor of the Quarterly indeed seems to have been
bewildered by Dr. Fleming's positives and negatives, and the
                            "
high-sounding title of The Dichotomous System." Yet the
secret of this wonderful discovery lies in the compass of a nut
shell, as this editor will perhaps comprehend when he happens
to consider, that   if   a law were passed extinguishing all quar
terly publications, those that would remain would not be
 quarterly.
     Discriminate objects this method manifestly does        but Dr.
 Fleming says, moreover, " that
                                                         ;
                                     it  accomplishes as much" in
the way of exhibiting the affinities of objects, as one system can
 effect.   He might with equal reason have said that       itaccom
 plishes   more;   for can any man in his senses honestly state
 his belief, that
                a    system proceeding entirely and essentially on
 the plan of division can favour conjunctions at all? Why the
                                                                 very

                       of the    Dichotomous       System.                       445
very object of it is to break up natural affinities, and as far as
it lies in the power of art to effect, to destroy them.      Surely
here is a naturalist, to use his own words, who has "con
founded two objects which ought to be regarded as perfectly
distinct, — the classification of organized beings so as to di
stinguish them, and their classification with the view of exhi
biting their affinities."
    In the " Philosophy of Zoology" it is said, that " the em
ployment of the twofold method of division by positive and
negative characters is so easy of application, that the reluctance
which many naturalists seem to display in using it may well
excite our surprise." The fact               is,
                                      that the system     so trifling
                                                                   is
and easy, that    it excites their contempt.     Jn other words, to
use a colloquial expression,      will not take.
                                        it          What therefore
does the D.D. do; but now, perceiving that he was formerly
on the wrong scent, and could not get his twos into notice by
calling them easy, he adroitly changes ground, and, as           for         a
lorn hope, states in the Quarterly Review, that " the labour
of an author who pursues the dichotomous method              greatly    is
increased" He might have remembered, that of old, whether
he flogged the urchins of his parish-school high or low, he
never could make his labours perfectly agreeable to them.
 I    shall now endeavour to precipitate a little of the mud that
 clouds the Doctor's cranium on another subject.        It is, as we
 have seen, clear, that animals may be primarily divided into
 viviparous and not viviparous, oviparous and not oviparous,
 vertebrated and not vertebrated, winged and apterous, or, in
 short, in as many different ways as they present points of
 structure and habits.          therefore equally clear, that
                                 It   is                             a       it   is
 matter of mere option on our parts, to select any one of these
 modes of division, — such as, for instance, "viviparous and not
 viviparous  ;"  and having so selected             it,
                                             we find each of these
 two primary groups to be dichotomous again, in as many
 different ways as       presents points of structure and habits.
                        it
 Selecting again one of these new divisions, the same thing
 occurs, ana so on. Dichotomous systems may therefore be
 considered as almost infinite in number and, consequently,
 to talk of " The Dichotomous System" means, in fact, nothing
                                                          ;
 else than that one Dichotomous system which Dr. Fleming has
 been pleased to decorate with Fliskian-Greek names.             Our
 worthy apparently has some indistinct perception of this ab
 surdity of his system for, taking the bull boldly by the horns,
                             ;
 he denies — and, be      remarked, this denial
                         it                        the most original
                                                              is
 of all his cyclopaedia or non-cyclopaedia manoeuvres, — the ex
 istence of  a single natural method.

     The places of the comet given by Mr. Wartmann are
only approximated ones, he not having reduced his observa
tions as yet.           The comet was visible to the naked eye, and
appeared        like  a star of the fifth magnitude, with a nebulous and
circular nucleus of from 9" to 10" diameter, and a tail of about
 1} degree.          After the 10th April the comet diminished gra
dually in magnitude and splendour, although still visible to the
naked eye. The nucleus measured but 4' or 5' diameter, and
the tail only £ of a degree.                On the 6th May the nucleus
could no longer be distinguished, and barely some traces of
the tail.

but remember that at the meeting in question the eligibility
of the several persons proposed by yourself was canvassed ;
that some of those actually nominated were suggested by other
members of that Council ; and that, in filling up the last va
cancy, their choice lay between Captain Beaufort and Sir John
Franklin ; it being perfectly agreed upon that either the one
or the other of these two gentlemen should be placed upon
the list of those who were to be recommended for election at
the anniversary.       The sense of the Council having been so
clearly and unequivocally manifested in favour of placing the
name of Sir John Franklin on that list, in preference to any
other except that of Captain Beaufort, it became my duty,
upon being verbally informed by yourself that Captain Beau
fort had declined the honour intended him, to make out the
       I
list as did ; that   is,  conformably to the views of the meeting,
substituting     for his  name   that of Sir John Franklin; more
especially as you, at 'the    same   time, intimated to me that you
did not consider    it    worth while (even had there been time,
during the two days which intervened previous to the anni
versary on the 30th, and one of which days was Sunday,) to
go through all the formalities of issuing notices to all the
members of the Council, and of holding another meeting, in
order to ascertain what, upon this particular contingency, had
already been sufficiently ascertained.       I   am warranted, tnere-
fore, in maintaining that the minute as       it  stands was substan
 tially correct and that in ordering
              ;                          it   to be so entered     have
                                                                    I
on this, as on all other occasions, faithfully discharged the
dutyI      owe to yourself and the Council, of representing the
 real sense of that body as expressed at their meetings.
    That any minute of the proceeding was made at all, ac           I
 knowledge to be my own act, and              am willing to bear the
 whole responsibility attaching to it.  I I    conceived      to be my
                                                              it
 duty   to  put upon  record   the result of  the deliberations  of the
 Council upon that occasion, which      it   seems   had  not  hitherto
 been done.       This reference to the Council of the selection of
members to compose the future Council              is,indeed, the very
 measure strongly recommended by Mr. Babbage in the scheme
 which he has proposed for reforming the Society.

they are always read at the following Council ; and as a further
precaution against the occurrence of mistakes, and against the
improper use that might be made of them, I usually defer
having them entered by the Assistant Secretary until just be
fore the meeting at which they are to be read. This practice
also is blamed by the very person who professes such extra
ordinary regard to the most punctilious accuracy, and who,
in the eagerness of his zeal to discover faults, complains that
the minutes of the Council of the llth of February were not
sooner entered.       Had he chosen to take the slightest pains to
inquire into the truth of the accusation before he made        it, he
might have learned that the simple reason why there exist no
records of that Council,  is    that no Council was held on that day,
but only a Committee, the minutes of which were duly entered
in their proper place.
   Such being the only instances which the author of these
statements, after the immense time he has spent in ransacking
the records of the Society, with an industry worthy of a better
cause, for materials of accusation, has been able to adduce in
support of his charge of inaccuracy in the minutes; and such
being the data whence he draws the sweeping conclusion that
the whole of the minutes are unworthy of the least confidence,
and can never hereafter be appealed to as authentic docu
ments, — may  it   not, with greater fairness, be inferred, now that
their accuracy has been established in these very instances,
that they are accurate throughout    ?      His own arguments, in
deed, might well be retorted upon himself with reference to
his own statements: but, however strong the temptation,              it
would perhaps be ungenerous further to turn against himself
the same weapons which he has been so little scrupulous in
employing to impugn the conduct of the Officers of the Royal
Society.    I    remain, Dear Sir,

              following are abstracts  of papers which havebeen read before
THE      the Royal Society during     the present session.
      Feb. 4. — " Remarks on several Icebergs which have been met with
in considerably low latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere." By Capt.
Horsburgh, hydrographer to the East India Company.
      The journals of the ships belonging to the East India Company, the
author observes, during the whole of the last century, contain no ac
counts of icebergs having been seen in the course of their navigation
in the southern hemisphere, although several of these ships proceeded
into the parallels of latitude 40°, 4 1 °, and 42°.        But, during the last
two years, it appears that icebergs have occasionally been met witli
by several ships in their passage, very near the Cape of Good Hope,
 between the latitudes of 36° and 39°. The particulars relating to
 these observations are detailed in the paper.          The most remarkable
 occurred in the voyage of the brig Eliza from Antwerp, bound to Ba-
 tavia, which on the 28th of April, 1828, fell in with five icebergs in
 latitude 37° 31' S., longitude 18° 17' E. of Greenwich. They had the
 appearance of church steeples, of a height from 250 to 300 feet; and
 the sea broke so violently against these enormous masses, that it was
 at first suspected they might be fixed on some unknown shoal, until,
  on sounding, no bottom could be discovered.
       It is remarkable, that, in general, icebergs seem to be met with in
  low latitudes nearly at the same period of the year, namely, in April
  or May, in both the northern and southern hemispheres,              although
  the seasons are reversed in these two divisions of the globe.        In order
  to account for the origin and accretion of the southern icebergs, the
  author thinks it probable, that there exists a large tract of land near
  the antarctic circle, somewhere between the meridian of London and
  the 20th degree of east longitude, whence these icebergs have been
  carried in a N. and N.E. direction, by the united forces of current,
   winds, and waves, prevailing from S.S.W. and S.W.              Bouvet's and
  Thompson's islands are not of sufficient magnitude ; and Sandwich
   land and Kesgnelin's island are too remote to be the source of the
   icebergs lately observed in the vicinity of the Cape. From their un
   precedented descent during the last two years, it is most probable
   that the disruption of these masses of ice from the places of their for
    mation, was the effect of some powerful cause, of rare occurrence,
   such as an earthquake or volcano, which has burst forth and convulsed
   the inaccessible regions of the south, leaving no other testimonials of
    the event, than some few fragments of ice, scattered at a distance in
    the Indian Ocean.
       March 4.— " On the progressive improvements made in the efficiency
    of steam-engines in Cornwall ; with investigations of the methods
    best adapted for imparting great angular velocities."            By Davies
    Gilbert, Esq.
        The practical adaptation of the steam-engine to mechanical purposes
     is considered by the author as due to Mr. Newcomen, whose inquiries
         N. S. Vol. 7. No. 4.2. June 1830.                 3 M             were

450                           Royal Society.
were introduced into Cornwall very early in the last century, and soon
superseded the rude machinery which had, till then, been employed
for raising water from the mines by the labour of men and of horses.
The terms of Mr. Watt's patent in 1769, which secured to him, until
the year 1800, the receipts of one-third of all the savings in fuel, re
sulting from the adoption of his improvements in the construction of
the engine, rendered it necessary to institute an accurate compari
son between the efficiency of his with former engines. A copy of the
report drawn up on this occasion, in October 1778, is given in the
paper ; but as the dynamic unit of one pound avoirdupois, raised
through a height of one foot, by the consumption of one bushel of coal,
had not yet been established as the measure of efficiency, the author,
proceeding upon the data furnished by that report, calculates that the
duty performed by Watt's engine on that occasion was 7,037,800.
In the year 1793 an account was taken of the work performed by
seventeen engines on Mr.Watt's construction, then working in Corn
wall. Their average duty was 19,569,000, which exceeds the perform
ances of the former atmospheric engines in the standard experiment
in the proportion of 2*78 to 1 . Some years afterwards, disputes having
arisen as to the real performance of Mr. Watt's engines, the matter
was referred to five arbiters, of whom the author was one ; and their
report, dated in May 1798, is given, as far as relates to the duties
of the engines. The general average of twenty-three engines was
17,671,000.     Since that period, so great have been the improvements
in the economy of fuel, and other parts of the machinery, that in De
cember 1 829, the duty of the best engine, with a cylinder of eighty
inches, was 75,628,000, exceeding the duty performed in 1795 in the
proportion of 3-865 to 1, and that of the atmospheric engine of 1778
in the proportion of 1 075 to 1 .
   The remainder of the paper relates to the friction in machinery,
and the different modes of obviating its effects.     With a view of re
ducing the amount of friction, the author is led to consider what are
the most proper forms for the teeth and cogs of wheels, and through
what intermediate steps a given increase of angular velocity may be
most advantageously communicated.          Equability of velocity is ob
tained, though at the expense of some degree of sliding friction, when
the outline of the teeth of the wheels are involutes of circles. Friction,
on the other hand, is wholly prevented when their form is logarithmetic
spiral j but the angular velocities will then be variable. Hence these
two advantages are incompatible with one another ; but, on the whole,
the author gives the preference to the involute, which produces an
equability of angular motion. The most advantageous mode of in
creasing velocity by a series of wheels, \s to adjust them so that the
multiplication of velocity shull proceed in a geometrical progression.

   April I. — Statement of the principal circumstances respecting the
united Siamese Twins, now exhibiting in London." By George Buck
ley Bolton, Esq. member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Commu
nicated by the President.
   The twin brothers, of whom an account is given in this paper, were
born of Chinese parents, in 1811, at a small village in Siam, distant
                                                                    about

                                 Royal Society.
about sixty miles from Bankok, the capital of the kingdom.            When
 the intelligence of their birth reached the ears of the King of Slam,
he gave orders that they should be destroyed, as portending evil to
his government; but he changed his intention, and suffered them to
live, on being assured that they were harmless, and would be capable
of supporting themselves by their own labour. About six years ago,
Mr. Robert Hunter, a British merchant resident at Siam, saw them for
the first time in a fishing-boat on the river, in the dusk of the evening,
and mistook them for some strange animal.         It was only in the spring
of last year that permission could be obtained from the Siamese Go
vernment to bring them to England. They were taken to Boston in the
United States, where they landed in August last, and six weeks after
wards embarked for England, and arrived in London in November.
    They are both of the same height, namely, five feet two inches ;
and their united weight is ISOlbs. They have not the broad and flat
forehead so characteristic of the Chinese race j but they resemble the
lower class of the people of Canton in the colour of their skins and
the form of their features.      Their bodies and limbs are well made.
The band of union is formed by the prolongation and junction of the
ensiform cartilages of each, which meet in the middle of the upper
part of the band, and form movable joints with each other, connected
by ligamentous structures.        Underneath the cartilages there appear
to be large hernial sacs opening into each abdomen ; into which, on
coughing, portions of the intestine are propelled as Jar as the middle
of the band ; though, in ordinary circumstances, these herniae are not
apparent. The entire band is covered with common integument ; and
when the boys face each other, its length at the apex is one inch and
three quarters, and at the lower edge not quite three inches.             Its
breadth from above downwards is four inches, and its greatest thick
ness nearly two inches.      In the centre of the lower edge there is a
cicatrix of a single navel. It possesses little sensibility, and is of great
strength ; for upon a rope being fastened to         it, the twins may be
pulled along     without  occasioning pain     and
                                               ;     when   one of them    is
lifted from the ground, the other will hang by the band alone, without
sensible inconvenience.      For the space of about half an inch from the
medial line of the band, the sensibility of the skin appears to be com
mon to both.      The following experiment was tried upon them        by Dr.
Roget.   A    silver tea-spoon being placed on the tongue of one of the
twins, and a   disk of zinc on the tongue of the other, the moment the
two metals were brought into contact, both the boys exclaimed " Sour,
sour:" thus proving that the galvanic influence passed from the one to
the other through the connecting band.          Another simple but clever
experiment (which we need not detail, as all philosophical inquiries are
not fit for publication) proved that the sanguineous inter-communion
was not common to the two.
    Their strength and activity are very remarkable. They can throw
down with perfect ease        powerful man.     They run with great swift
                          in a
ness, bend their bodies      all directions, and in their sports often tum
ble head over heels without the least difficulty or inconvenience.         In

all the bodily actions in. which the concurrence of both is required, such
as running, jumping, playing at battledore and shuttlecock, they ex
hibit a wonderful consent, or agreement, without the appearance of
any previous communication of their intentions.          The intellectual
powers of each are nearly equal ; and they have both attained the
same degree of proficiency in the games of chess, draughts, and whist.
They both possess great powers of imitation. In their respective phy
sical constitutions, however, several differences are observable. Chang,
as the boy on the left is named, has more vigorous health, and greater
regularity of functions, than his brother, whose name is Eng. In ge
neral they take their meals, and obey the calls of nature, at the same
time. The author details the circumstances of a catarrhal complaint
which attacked both of them in December last, the symptoms and pro
gress of which were similar in each ; and from which they both reco
vered in the same manner and at the same time.            In their healthy
state their pulses are generally alike, and are easily excited; but that
of the one may be accelerated, while that of his brother continues
calm.
    In their habits they are very cleanly and delicate ; in their disposi
tions affectionate and grateful for every kindness shown to them.
There exists between them the most perfect harmony. They always
fall asleep at the same moment ; and it is impossible to wake the one
 without also waking the other. The author adverts in the course of
 the paper to the question, whether they were the produce of a single
or double ovum, and also to the possibility at some future time of ef
fecting their separation with safety to themselves j and he concludes,
by bearing testimony to the uniformly kind treatment they have re
 ceived from Captain Coffin, Mr. Hunter, and Mr. Hall, who have
 evinced on all occasions the. greatest anxiety for their welfare and hap
 piness ; and to the liberal manuer in which they have always afforded
 access to men of science, for promoting any object of philosophical
 inquiry*.

    March 19th. — Henry Rowland Brandreth, Esq. of the Royal
 Engineers, Woolwich ; Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart- of Middle Hill,
 Worcestershire ; and Robert Alfred Cloyne Austen, Esq. of Lin

    Extracts were read from a paper entitled " Reference to a Geo
 logical Map and Section of Pembrokeshire, " by Alfred Thomas,
 Esq., Mineral Surveyor, Haverfordwest.
     The author accompanies the map and section with geological
 and economical remarks.         The map comprehends all that north
 ern part of Pembrokeshire not described by Mr. De la Beche, and
 the section is drawn from St. Gowan's Head on the south to Car
 digan on the north.       The alternations of the different formations
 in the county are detailed in a series of descriptive sections : the
 chief masses are coal measures, including culm and coal grits,
 mountain limestone,       old red sandstone and conglomerate,        tran
                                                                     sition

sition limestone, grauwacke, grauwacke slate. All these, in tbe cen
tral and southern parts of the county, are traversed by, or alternate
with trap rocks which are of various kinds, some being syenitic,
others hornblendic and amygdaloidal, whilst near Fishguard they
are columnar and basaltic.      The beds of the stratified deposits are
frequently contorted, and their nature altered in contact with the
intrusive rocks.    The transition limestone contains trilobites.
    The first of two letters addressed to R. I. Murchison, Esq., Sec.
G.S. F.R.S. &c. " On the Lacustrine Basins of Baza and Alhama in
the province of Granada, and similar deposits in other parts of
Spain," by Col. Charles Silvertop, F G.S., was then read.
    The Sierra Nevada, rising to the height of 1 1 ,000 and 12,000 feet
above the sea, is the culminating point of a number of subordinate
mountain groups which form a lofty chain stretching from Anda
lusia on the W.S.W. to Murcia on the E.N.E. and bisecting in its
range the kingdom of Granada.
    This chain is composed of a central axis of gneiss and mica schist,
 with successively overlying zones on each flank of transition and
secondary rocks, which on the south and along the shores of the
 Mediterranean are, here and there, covered with patches of tertiary
marine deposits containing Sub-Apennine         shells ; whilst on the
northern flank of the chain, or towards the interior of Spain, the
secondary rocks are succeeded by formations of lacustrine origin,
which in the kingdom of Granada occupy two .large and separate
basins, one near Baza, the other near Alhama. These great and
elevated depressions in the secondary rocks, though at little dis
tances from the Mediterranean, are so cut oft' from that sea by the
Sierra Nevada, that their drainage is effected in a north-westerly
direction, into the Guadalquivir, and thence into the more distant
Atlantic. The author describes in detail the basin of Baza, which,
traversed by an insignificant stream called the Rio Baza, is sur
rounded upon three of its sides by a secondary nummulite-limestone ;
the precise age of which he does not pretend to determine, although
he states that it very much resembles certain varieties of the younger
Alpine limestone.
    Unconformably deposited on this and other older rocks, within
a district the average diameter of which         is about thirty-five
miles, there are spread out formations of considerable thick
ness, the organic remains of which are exclusively           lacustrine
and tertiary. These in the immediate neighbourhood of Baza are
divided into two principal groups ; the lowest, consisting of marls
with laminated gypsum, sulphur and brine springs, is zoologically
distinguished by the presence of cypris ; the uppermost is a com
pact, cream-coloured limestone, charged with many small Paludinac
of a species identical with one which is found in the lacustrine for
mations of Central France.      The united thickness of these fresh
water groups in the neighbourhood of Baza cannot be estimated at
less than 300 and 400 feet ; they are generally horizontal, but the
face of the country everywhere exhibits striking proofs of immense

degradation, the gypsiferous marls being denuded throughout the
greater part of the centre of the basin, and but rarely exhibiting-
caps of the compact paludina-limestone.             On the southern,
eastern and south-western flauKS of the basin, particularly near
Gaudix, there are vast accumulations of pebble beds, conglomerate,
&c., the exact relations of which to the marls and limestone the
author could not satisfactorily determine, owing to the obscurity of
the sections ; although he is of opinion that there are conglomerates
which in some places pass under the marls, whilst in others they
are decidedly overlying.
    The reading of the letter on the Basin of Alhama was deferred
until another evening.

    The reading of a paper on the Geology of Weymouth, and the
 adjacent parts of the coast of Dorsetshire, by the Rev. Dr. Buck-
land, and Henry Thomas De la Beche, Esq., begun at the last
 Meeting, was concluded.
    The Authors take up the history of the Geology of the Coast of
 Dorset at the point where Mr. Webster terminates, viz. at the
 chalky promontory of White Nore, about eight miles E.N.E. of
 Weymouth, and continue their account of the coast thence
 westwards to the lias at Charmouth.         The Memoir is accom
panied by a map and many sections both of the cliffs and of the
adjacent inland district, including the space intermediate between
the escarpment of the chalk downs of Dorsetshire and the sea. The
authors divide this district into two compartments, viz. the Vale of
Weymouth and the Vale of Bredy.
    The structure of the Vale of Bredy is comparatively simple, being
chiefly composed of chalk, greensand, Kimmeridge clay, Oxford
oolite, forest marble, and inferior oolite, dipping for the most part
to the E. and N.E. and divided by thick beds of clay.
    The Valley of Weymouth is more complicated, comprehending

 meridge sand and clay, Oxford oolite, Oxford clay, cornbrash and
forest marble.      To the forest marble belong the lowest strata that
form the axis of this district.     Nearly all these strata are highly
 inclined, and dip respectively in two opposite directions from an
anticlinal line which runs through a saddle of forest marble from E.
 to W.
    The uppermost of these strata on the N. side constitute the chalk
 escarpment of the ridgeway, capped with patches of plastic clay;
 whilst on the S. no strata appear above the sea more recent than
 those which form the Isle of Portland.
     Between the ridgeway-chalk- escarpment and the Isle of Portland,
the strata are disposed in a succession of long and narrow belts
of clay and stone, the clay constituting valleys, and the stone
 rising into ridges between the valleys ; all these belts are terminated
 eastward by the bay of Weymouth, and westward by the Chesil
 Bank.
    The formations composing this district are described in the fol
lowing order.
     1. Plastic clay and sands, with blocks of puddingstone, and beds
of angular flints forming a breccia in place, occur on the surface of
the chalk.
    2. Chalk presenting no remarkable peculiarities.
    3. Greensand formation exhibiting no distinct traces of gault.
The Wealden formation terminates a little W. of Lulworth Cove.
    4. Purbeck beds appearing in two long insulated patches at Os-
m ing ton and Up way.
    5. Portland stone occurring not only throughout the island of that
name, but forming a high and narrow ridge parallel and immedi
ately subjacent to the escarpment of the chalk along nearly the
whole north frontier of the Vale of Weymouth.
    6. Between the Purbeck and Portland formations there is a very
remarkable bed of black earth called the " Dirt Bed," already de
scribed by Mr. Webster as being mixed with slightly rolled pebbles
of Portland stone*, and containing, in a silicin'ed state, long pros
trate trunks of coniferous trees and stems of Cycadeoideae.        These
trunks lie, partly sunk into the black earth, like fallen trees on the
surface of a peat bog, and partly covered by the incumbent lime
stone. Many stumps of trees also remain erect, with their roots
attached to the black soil in which they grew, and their upper part
in the limestone ; and show that the surface of the subjacent Port
land stone was for some time dry land, and covered with a forest,
and probably in a climate such as admits the growth of the modern
Zamia and Cycas.       This forest has been submerged ; first beneath
the fresh waters of a lake or estuary, in which were deposited the
Purbeck beds and sands and clays of the Wealden formation,
 (amounting together to nearly 1000 feet), and subsequently beneath
the salt water of an ocean of sufficient depth to accumulate all the
great marine formations of greensand and chalk.

  7. Below the Portland stone, and dividing it from the Kimtneridge
clay, the authors establish a deposit, hitherto unnoticed, of sand and
sandstone 80 feet thick, which they call the Kimmeridge sandstone ;
it is full of grains of green earth, and scarcely distinguishable, ex
cept by its fossils, from the greensands immediately below the
chalk : they also have ascertained that the pseudo-volcano still burn
ing 'on the north of VVey mouth is in the bituminous beds of the
Kimmeridge clay, and that there has been at some unknown former
period a similar combustion of the same clay on the shore near
Portland ferry.
    8. The Oxford oolite is very fully developed near Weymouth, as
it is near Scarborough, passing into beds of sand, sandstone, and
clay at its upper and lower extremities; containing Ostrea deltdi-
 deu in the upper, and Gryphaea dilatata in the lower beds ; and
 gradually passing into Kimmeridge clay above, and into Oxford clay
 below : its thickness exceeds 150 feet. The history and character of
 this oolite formation at Weymouth have been fully described in all
 their details, and accompanied by a valuable list of its fossils, in a
 paper on the strata of the Yorkshire coast, by Professor Sedgwick ;
Ann. Phil., May 1826.
  9. The Oxford clay       is about 300 feet thick, and contains large
septaria,  which  are  cut   into beautiful tables, under the name of
Turtle Marble. Thig clay abounds throughout with shells of Gry-
pheea dilatata.
    10. The cornbrash and forest marble form the axis of the Valley
of Weymouth, and occupy much of the Valley of Bredy. The forest
marble formation abounds in beds of clay, and is often -composed
of clay without the marble. The Bradford Encrinite (Apiocrinites
rotundus) is found in several parts of         it,
                                                 e. g. at Abbotsbury, at
Bothenhampton, and in the cliff west of Bridport Harbour.
    11. There is no Bath oolite stone in Dorsetshire, but the inferior
oolite occupies    alarge extent near Bridport, affording coarse lime
stone, like that of Dundry in its upper, and micaceous sand with
beds and concretions of calcareous sandstone in its lower part. Its
total thickness    about 300 feet. Near its middle region are masses
                   is
of breccia, containing slightly rolled fragments of the lower strata,
and having the entire circumference of these fragments drilled all
over by some small lithodomous shells      ;  these fragments attest the
 consolidation of the lower strata before the deposition of the
 central beds, and mark an interval in the formation sufficient for
 the fragments to have been rounded and perforated.
    12. The lowest strata, within the district described, are the upper
 marl beds of the lias formation on the east of Charrnouth     ;   these
 are loaded with belemnites, and may represent the Calcaire          d
 Belemnite of the French geologists    ;    as the lower stony beds of
 lias at Lyme are equivalent to their Calcaire       <)
                                                       Gryphite.  On the
 shore east of Charmouth the marl beds- present an almost continu
 ous pavement of belemnites, and also contain saurians.
    13. The elevation which has raised all the component formations
  of the Valley of Weymouth towards an anticlinal axis, has been ac
                                                               companied

                            Geological Society.                   457
companied by extensive faults, the most remarkable of which are
parallel to the anticlinal axis, and appear to have been contempo
raneous with the general elevation of the district.     One of these
faults is continuous nearly 15 miles along the escarpment of the
chalk of the ridgeway, on the north of Weymouth, and at various
places brings up strata of oolite, Portland stone, and Purbeck
stone into contact with chalk and greensand ; many sections are
given illustrating the effects of these faults, not one of which ap
pears to be anterior to the deposition of the most recent strata in
the district.
    1 i. Subsequently   to, or perhaps contemporaneously with the
elevation of the strata and production of the faults, the surface has
been .ravaged by a tremendous inundation which has swept away
all the ruins and rubbish of the elevated masses, and has exca
vated valleys of many hundred feet in depth on the surface of
the strata that remain.     Outlying summits, composed of residuary
portions   of strata  which  are continuous along the escarpments on
the north and east of the Vale of Bredy, indicate the original con
tinuity of these strata over large portions of that district, from
which they have been removed.
    15. Small deposits of diluvium are scattered over many of the
hills as well as the valleys, but there are no very thick and con.
nected accumulations of gravel ; the force of the water that could
produce such enormous excavations must have been far too great
to allow the excavated materials to subside so near the rocks from
which they were torn, and must have drifted them far away into
the continuation of these valleys, in the bottom of the English
Channel.
    The authors conclude that they have sufficient evidence to es
tablish the following succession of changes, in the state of that
small portion of England which occupies the coast of Dorsetshire
and Hants.
    1st. There is a continuous succession of marine deposits from the
lias upwards through the oolites, terminating in the deposition of
 the Portland stone : — during the period of all these formations the
 district must have been the bottom of an ancient sea.
    2ndly. Some part of the bottom of this sea appears for a certain
 time to have become dry land, and whilst in that state, to have
 been covered with a forest of large coniferous trees and cycadeoi-
 deous plants which indicate a warm climate. We have a measure
 of the duration of this forest in the black earth which is accu
 mulated to the thickness of more than a foot from the wreck of
 its vegetation : the regular and uniform preservation of this thin
 bed of black earth over a distance of many miles, shows that the
 change to the next state of things was not accompanied by any vio
 lent denudation or rush of waters, since the trees that lie prostrate
 on this black earth would have been swept away by any such vio
  lent catastrophe.    Dr. Buckland has found this same black earth
 on the surface of the Portland stone near Thame in Oxfordshire.
 It has also been found by Dr. Fitton in the Boulonnois.

  Srdly. The dry land on which this forest grew, in Dorsetshire, be
came converted to something like an estuary, in which the lowest
                                                     a thick bed of
deposits contain freshwater shells, succeeded by
                                                                   an ad
oyster shells ; and above the oyster bed, by strata containing
mixture of freshwater shells with shells that are marine. This fresh
water formation,including both the Purbeck and the Wealden strata,
extends with certain interruptions from Upway on the N. of Wey-
mouth to the E. extremity of Purbeck, and reappears in the Isle of
Wight and the Weald of Sussex and Kent ; but of the boundaries
of the estuary or estuaries in which these fresh-water strata were
                                                                 the area
deposited we nave no indications beyond those afforded by
of the strata themselves.    Its breadth  probably  extended   about   SO
miles from Purbeck     to  Tisbury   on the  west  of Salisbury,   across
the intermediate portion of Dorset and Wilts, which is now covered
up with chalk.
                                                                   m this
   4thly. We have a return of the sea over the estuary, and
sea an accumulation of the successive and thick marine deposits
which constitute the greensand and chalk formations.
   5thly. Although no fresh-water formations occur in the tertiary
strata above the chalk on the coast of Dorset, we have on the
adjacent coast of Hants and the Isle of Wight, a re-appearance of
fresh-water deposits above the chalk, mixed and alternating with
others that are marine.
   6thly. All these deposits appear to have been succeeded by
powerful convulsions, producing elevation and depression of the
strata, intersecting them with tremendous faults, and followed by an
inundation competent to excavate deep valleys of denudation, and
to overspread the country with diluvial gravel.
   Tthly. This inundation has been succeeded by a state of tran
 quillity, which has continued to the present hour.
    A paper entitled "Description of a New Species of Ichthyosau
 rus," by Daniel Sharpe, Esq., F.G.S., was then read.
    This specimen of Ichthyosaurus was found in a quarry of lias lime
 stone about four miles from Stratford-upon- Avon. The whole length
 of the animal must probably have     been about seven feet   ;the parts
 of it which remain exhibit the upper portion        of the   head from
 the nostrils backwards, in a very crushed   state, a continuous  series
 of 52 vertebra, from the atlas to the commencement of the tail,
 with nearly all the spinous processes ; one scapula, and nearly the
 whole of one fore paddle.      The teeth (by which the four species
 formerly   described  have  been chiefly distinguished) are entirely
 wanting in this individual; the author, however, considers it to be a
 new species, from the following peculiarities of character.
    1. The length of each vertebra is uniformly three-fifths of its
 breadth, a proportion not found to exist in any hitherto described
 species.
   2. The paddle is of great size, and including the humerus must
 have been equal to one-fifth of the length of the whole animal.
 In the ulna or radius  (it difficult to say which) there
                              is                            notch

    On account of the large size of its paddle, the author names this
species " Ichthyosaurus grandipes."

 light with the white light of the moon's limb; and I think that the
 observation of the emersion is as accurate as that of the immersion.
  I devoted all my attention to the observation, with a view to the well-
 known phenomenon of the star's remaining visible some seconds on
 the moon's disc, which has been repeatedly observed in this star, and
 which I have myself seen several times. T remained, at the immer

of investigation dependent upon the velocity of sound in the different

passed through the air ; and M. Dulong, by examining and comparing
the sounds produced by different gases, has endeavoured to ascertain
whether this element is the same in all of them.               He arrives at this
general   law, remarkable    for its simplicity,  1 . That  equal volumes of all

pressed or expanded by a fraction of their volume, disengage or absorb
the same absolute quantity of heat.          2. That the variations of tem

            EXPERIMENTS ON GOLD.                BY DR. THOMSON.
    Berzelius and Javal have determined from their experiments that
peroxide of gold contains 3 atoms of oxygen.               To ascertain the cor
rectness of this statement, Dr. Thomson dissolved 25 grains of gold
in nitro-muriatic acid, and to the solution was added one of 104*25
grains of crystallized sulphate of iron ; the distilled water was boiled
for half an hour before it was used, and the protosulphate of iron crystals
 were thrown into the boiling hot liquid, which was added to the solu
tion of gold as quickly as possible : the gold obtained weighed 12-1-1)
 grains ; so that the loss was only 0- 1 grain.
    As six times 4'5 grains of protoxide of iron which the 104-25 of
protosulphate contained were converted into peroxide, by uniting with
 3 grains of oxygen, Dr. Thomson considers it as demonstrated that per
 oxide of gold is composed of
                      1 atom of gold                        25
                      3 atoms of oxygen                      3

    Dr. Thomson, from the facts stated in his " Attempt," vol. i. p. 440 •
 considered it as extremely probable that muriate of gold is a compound
 of 2 atoms muriatic acid, and 1 atom peroxide of gold. To determine
 this by experiment, a solution of gold in nitro-muriatic acid was evapo
 rated to dryness, and 24'2 grains of the metal yielded 42 grains of dry
 muriate.
     To determine the quantity of muriatic acid, it was necessary first to
 get rid of the gold ; for nitrate of silver being dropt into the undecom-
 posed salt, both the gold and muriatic acid precipitate along with the
 silver ; the gold was therefore thrown down by copper, the copper by
 potash, and the excess of potash WHS neutralized by nitric acid, and
                                                                             then

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              461
then the muriatic acid precipitated by silver : the chloride of silver
weighed 34'65 grains, equivalent to 8-453 grains of chlorine, or 878
grains of muriatic acid. "Thus it appears," says Dr. Thomson, "that
24-2 grains of gold, in the state of peroxide, had been combined with
8,87 grains of muriatic acid.      Consequently 25 grains of gold in the
state of peroxide must be united with 9M 1 grains of muriatic acid.
This is only 0'14 grain less than 9'25, the equivalent for 2 atoms of
muriatic acid.      From this result it is obvious, that muriate of gold is
a compound of 2 atoms muriatic acid, and 1 atom peroxide of gold :
the weight of the dry salt having been 42'8 grains, it is clear that it
must have contained 5 atoms of water, and that muriate of gold is
composed as follows :
                   2 atoms muriatic acid               9'25
                   1 atom peroxide of gold            28'
                   5 atoms water                       5'625
                                                      42-875
    " The   precipitation of the gold by protosulphate of iron seems to
show, that the gold in this salt is in the state of oxide, and conse
quently combined, not with chlorine, but with muriatic acid. It is
equally clear that, in the sodium chloride of gold, the metal is not
oxidized but in the metallic state, and united to chlorine.     Hence the
reason why it is so difficult to reduce the gold from the sodium chloride
by heat, while it is so easy, by a very moderate heat, to reduce the
gold from the muriate.
    " Gold furnishes a striking example of the want of coincidence in
the proportions of oxygen and chlorine, which unite with bodies, and
of the danger of being misled, when we infer the composition of a
chloride from that of an oxide. The peroxide of gold, containing 3
atoms of oxygen, one would have been disposed to infer, that the
chloride would also contain 3 atoms of chlorine ; yet it contains only 2
atoms.      This want of coincidence between the peroxide and chloride
of gold, is probably the reason why the muriate of gold cannot be con
verted into a chloride by heat ; at least all my attempts to obtain a
chloride by this process have ended in disappointment.       In what man
ner the change takes place in the atomic proportions, when common
salt is added to the muriate, it is not easy to conceive ; but the ex
 periments which I have related in this paper, and in my "Attempt,"
 leave, I conceive, no doubt that the conversion from muriate to chloride
actually takes place." — Trans. Royal Soc. Edinburgh, vol. xi. p. 23.
           SUPPOSED NEW VEGETO-ALKALI — CHINIO1DIA.
    In the last Number but one of the Phil. Mag. we noticed Dr.
 Serturner's supposed discovery of a new vegeto-alkali, to which he
 gave the name of Chinioi'dia.      MM. Henry, jun. and Delondre have
 made numerous experiments to determine whether such an alkali
  really exists, and they have arrived at the following conclusions : —
     1st. That there remains little doubt as to the non-existence of chi-
 nio'idia, and that it appears demonstrated that it is only a modification
 of quina and cinchonia combined and rendered uncrystallizable by a
 peculiar yellow matter. These modifications cease, when after a long

    2nd. That the yellow resinous matter which accompaniesquina more
 than cinchonia, appears to change its properties much ; this yellow
 matter the authors succeeded in destroying, but without being able to
 collect it separately in a perfect state.    It appears to differ from the
 yellow colouring   matter  of the bark, which   is fixed by alumina, oxide
 of lead and of tin.

  The presence of organic matters, such as gum, starch, sugar, alcohol,
&c. greatly increases the action of light in solutions of gold and silver.

                           AURORA    BOKEAL1S.
    In the evening of the 19th, soon after sunset, as bright a light
appeared in the horizon about the magnetic north as the crepuscule

4-6*           Difference in the Height       of Spring Tides.
immediately above the sun ; and as the twilight withdrew, the aurora
increased in brightness. At 9 P.M. it showed a steady flame colour,
and was comprised between the N.W. and N. by E. points of the ho
rizon, and about nine or ten degrees in altitude.
     At 1 1 o'clock a vertical line of light, whose bearing was N. by
     f
E. E. emanated from the aurora, and in a few minutes afterwards
other coruscations emanated from it between the N.W. and N., but
they often disappeared, and rose again to an altitude exceeding that
of e Cassiopeiee.       At a quarter before 12, seven columns of light of
various widths appeared at once, and continued several minutes : the
wind blowing fresh from the westward seemed to give them a slight
inclination from a perpendicular towards the East, and they did not
finally disappear till between one and two A.M. In the course of the
 evening several bright meteors descended from over the aurora, and in
 a few hours afterwards a heavy gale came on from the S.W. and con
 tinued nearly four days.       This meteoric phenomenon was also seen
 in Scotland, but from the interposition of clouds it did not display any
 vertical columns there, only faint coruscations in the horizon.       What
 ever gaseous quality an aurora      borealis  may possess,    whether hydro
 genous, electric, or magnetic, or a mixture of any of these, here it is
 very generally, if not the cause, a prognostic of a strong gale of wind
 from some quarter.
      ON THE DIFFERENCE          IN THE HEIGHT OF SPRING TIDES.
     The first, second and third tides after the new moon on the 24th
 of April were considerably higher in Portsmouth Harbour than the
 first three tides after the new moon on the 24th of March; yet the
  new moon in March was nearer to the earth's equator than the new
  moon in April, and of course her attraction of the water was greater
 in the former month : the sun in March was also nearer the earth
  than he was in April, and his attraction proportionably greater.        The
  moon's horizontal parallaxes in the Nautical Almanac at the time of
  these new moons, are the same within one second, and the greatest
  for the year till the last day of October ; yet the difference in the height
  of the spring tides at these times was fifteen inches greater imme
  diately after the last new moon.        It would be difficult under these
  nearly coinciding circumstances to account for this unusual swell of
  the tides, without referring to, and taking into consideration the state
 of the weather, and the position and strength of the wind which in
  fluenced it. In March only three-fifths of rain fell here j and the eva
 poration was nearly as great as that of the present month, and the
 weather remarkably calm. In April between three and four inches
 of rain fell, and a S.W. gale from over the Atlantic blew strong two
 days before and two days after the last new moon, which in connection
 with this depth of rain, must have caused the swell and comparative
  difference in the last spring tides on our shores. A remarkably low
  ebbing of the tide, six feet lower than is usual at the same age of the
  moon, occurred here the third day after the new moon in March.

466          Meteorological Observations             for April      1830.
     General Obtervations.— This month has been alternately fine and showery,
 with frequent gales of wind; and although the cold nights, with hoar frost
 in the first part, gave a check to vegetation, the warm rains, followed by
 clear sunny days in the latter part, caused a rapid growth.
    After a fruitful year and a severe winter, Nature has spread out her gifts
 more profusely in the bloom of the trees than could be expected : in
 sheltered situations the blooming and the formation of the fruits have
 prospered; but in open situations in the country they have been much
 blighted by the cold winds and prevailing frosts; nor have the easterly
 winds been pure and favourable to the human constitution.
    On the 1st instant we had a snow-storm from 6 till nearly 10 A.M., which
 covered Portsdown Hill, although it was mixed with heavy rain.                    In the
 neighbourhood of London the snow is said to have been four inches deep,
 and in Shropshire six inches deep at the beginning of the month.                    The
 sudden change of temperature which brought on the snow at this late
 period, was occasioned by opposite winds from S.W. and N.E., and the
 cold increased till the morning of the 5th, when the moats of the fortifi
cations were frozen over.
    In the afternoon of the 8th, vivid flashes of lightning emanated from
black clouds from the S.E., accompanied with loud claps of thunder.                    In
the morning of the 18th, the first pair of swallows made their appearance
here.
    The mean temperature of the external air this month is about equal
to the mean of April for many years past.
    The atmospheric and meteoric phenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are five parhelia, four paraselenoe, one lunar and
three solar halos, one rainbow, four meteors, an aurora borealis, and twelve
gales of wind, or days on which they have prevailed, namely, two from the
North-east, one from the East, seven from the South-west, and two from
the North-west.
