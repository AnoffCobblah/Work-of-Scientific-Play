      I. On the Composition and Explosion of Gun-Cotton.
                  By Thomas RANsoME, Esq.”
    INCE the announcement by Prof. Otto of the process for
     preparing gun-cotton, many experiments have been tried
both with reference to improvement in its manufacture and
also to its explosive force, but the only explanation of its
composition has been derived from the quantity of nitric acid
taken up by the cotton. The following experiments were
made to ascertain the quantities of carbon and hydrogen it
actually contains.                                     -
   The gun-cotton that I have analysed was prepared with
carded cotton, and nitric acid of specific gravity 1.514 mixed
with half its bulk of sulphuric acid, in the proportion of an
ounce and a half of nitric acid to each 100 grs. cotton. Thus
prepared it was quite white, and the fibre appeared unaltered;
it left not the smallest residue upon ignition, and was quite in
soluble in aether.                                                   -
   The carbon and hydrogen were estimated, as is usual in
substances containing nitrogen, the cotton being mixed with
oxide of copper, and the last few inches of the combustion
tube filled with metallic copper. It decomposed quite tran
quilly, not giving out more gas at once than could conve
niently pass through the potash apparatus.
   In the first analysis 2.35 grs. gave 2.255 grs. of carbonic
acid and 665 gr. of water. In the second 2:07.5 grs. gave
2.01 grs. of carbonic acid and '59 gr. of water.
    Calculated to 100 parts—

2             Mr. T. Ransome on the Composition
   The mean of three experiments to ascertain the increase in
weight in converting cotton-wool into gun-cotton was 64.1
upon each 100 parts of cotton: if this increase was anhydrous
nitric acid, the gun-cotton would contain 10:20 per cent. of
nitrogen.
   Composition in 100 parts, taking the mean of the analyses
of carbon and hydrogen,
                   Carbon............... 26:28
                   Hydrogen ......... 3-16
                  Oxygen ............ 60-36
                  Nitrogen ............ 10:20
                                        1 OO-OO
   These numbers nearly represent the formula C12HsOzoN,
which would contain in 100 parts—
                   Carbon............... 26'82
                   Hydrogen ......... 2.94
                  Oxygen ............ 59-70
                  Nitrogen ............ 10'54
                                        100'00
   The cotton used was also analysed, being burnt with chro
mate of lead instead of oxide of copper.
   1-435 gr, gave 2.325 grs. of carbonic acid and '91 gr. of
Water.
   In 100 parts—
                  Carbon............... 44'20
                  Hydrogen ......... 7'04
                  Oxygen ............ 48.76
                                        100.00
   Theoretical composition of Cha Hio Olo—
                  Carbon ............... 44'44
                  Hydrogen ......... 6'17
                  Oxygen ............ 49'39
                                        100'00
   From these formulae, it appears that gun-cotton is formed
from ordinary cotton by the abstraction of two atoms of hy
drogen and the addition of two atoms of nitric acid. If this
is the case, 100 parts of cotton ought to increase to 1654; by
experiment they increase to 164’i. The abstraction of two
atoms of hydrogen will make the nitrogen '18 per cent. more,
which brings it nearer to the theoretical composition.
   If this formula be correct, the cotton in exploding without
the presence of oxygen would be converted entirely into car
bonic oxide, water and nitrogen, thus:-

   To ascertain whether carbonic oxide was produced, and if
the cotton would explode without air, the following experiment
was tried, the object being to explode the cotton either in
vacuo, or in some indifferent gas which could afterwards
easily be removed. I selected carbonic acid as being easily
obtained and readily removed by a caustic alkali, and also be
cause the air was more completely excluded than in the partial
vacuum of an air-pump.
   The gas was generated in a Woolfe's bottle, and dried by
passing through a tube filled with chloride of calcium; it was
then conducted into a rather wide tube in which the cotton
was placed (about the tenth of a grain for each explosion); to
this a small bent tube was attached, the end of which was
under the water of the pneumatic trough. The carbonic acid
was allowed to escape until a small quantity collected in a
test-tube was entirely absorbed by caustic soda; the cotton
was then exploded by placing a spirit-lamp under the part of
the tube containing it, at the same time the gas given out at the
small tube was collected in an inverted jar: this was repeated
several times until a sufficient quantity of gas was obtained;
the carbonic acid was then absorbed by caustic soda.
   The residual gas was inflammable, and when mixed with
oxygen and exploded by an electric shock was partially ab
sorbed by caustic potash.
   Red vapours were not formed when the gas was mixed with
oxygen, showing that nitric oxide had not been formed.
   After the explosion not the slightest residue was left in the
tube.
   This experiment proves that gun-cotton will explode with
out the presence of oxygen, and also under the same circum
stances that carbonic oxide is formed, but no nitric oxide.

   Since the above paper was read, I have estimated the nitro
  * Messrs. Porrett and Teschemacher have proved, in a paper read to the
Chemical Society, that cyanogen is a product of the explosion of gun
cotton. . As this is the case, the gases actually produced will not be exactly
as described in the above diagram. It is possible that the gases would be
produced in the proportion indicated above, if the gun-cotton exploded at
a temperature lower than that requisite to cause the combination of the
nitrogen with the carbon.—ED.         B

 to nitrogen 46 cubic in. or as 6 to 1; therefore taking the
 carbon as the mean of the two former analyses, or 26-28, the
 nitrogen would amount to 10:33 per cent. I also endeavoured          .
 to ascertain the amount of nitrogen by measuring the volume
 of gas given out by a known weight of gun-cotton, and sub
 tracting the carbonic acid as calculated from the previous
estimation of carbon; but the quantity of nitrogen obtained
was always too small, owing to the air in the tube taking part
in the combustion, the largest amount obtained being 8:20
 per cent.

      GENTLEMEN,
AS      I happened accidentally to witness the extraordinary
      phaenomenon which occurred on the 25th of September
last f, and as it does not seem to have formed the subject of
any other communication to your Journal, I address the fol
lowing remarks, well-aware how imperfect unfortunately they
must appear.
   I happened to be walking just outside the house at a quarter
before 10 P.M., when suddenly the whole scene was illuminated
with a light, as it seemed to me, equal to that of the sun at
noonday: certainly all objects became much more clearly
visible than I ever saw them in the brightest moonlight. But
contrast might lead to an exaggeration in this estimate. As
the light proceeded from behind me, I immediately turned
round, and I saw in Ursa Minor, and, as nearly as I can
guess, occupying the place I have assigned to it in the inclosed
sketch, a most brilliant meteor. I scarcely saw it before it
faded, and in a <U+017F>ew seconds it had entirely disappeared. As
it disappeared the stars became again visible, and as I took
particular note of its position I cannot be far out in my esti
mate. But the occurrence came so suddenly, never having
before heard of any such apparition, and feeling confident that
it would be observed by persons more competent than myself,
that I neglected at the instant to observe by my watch the num
ber of seconds it remained visible.      Instrumental observation
under any circumstances would have been impossible. I do not

extreme rapidity of its motion left the impression upon the
retina, but this can only be a matter of conjecture. It is much
to be wished that any observation could be recorded of its

blance in external character to the bolide of the 21st March

about two hours.

III.   Remarks on the Rev. B. Bronwin's Method for Differ
         ential Equations. By GEORGE BoolE, Esq.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
 I  DESIRE very briefly to notice an error into which the
      Rev. B. Bronwin has fallen, in a paper on the Integration
and Transformation of certain Differential Equations, pub
lished in the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine.
   In doing this I shall adopt a notation which I have before
employed in a similar description of analysis, and which has
the advantages of brevity and simplicity. Changing for con
venience p into m and y into u, we may observe that Mr.
Bronwin's transformations depend in all cases on the proper
ties of two compound factors, which we shall designate by ºrn
and e, and which, upon whatever subject they may operate,
combine in subjection to the relation
                     7m P-P ºn—is . . . . . . . . (1.)
the equation to be solved being
                          ºrm u = 0. . . . . . . . (2)
   Thus, in Mr. Bronwin's first equation, D standing for    #.
          Tm =w (D’--k”)+2 m D, p=D*-i-k”;          . . .    (3.)
in the second,
          Tm = D*-i-ka, D–m k, p=D+k w; .          .  . .   (4.)
in the third,
          wn =w (Dº-i-kº) + 3 m D, p= D*-i-k”; . . . (5.)
and so on for the rest.

    Mr. G. Boole on a Method for Differential Equations.         7
   Now (1.) gives           7mp U-p ºrm-10,
whatever v may be ; let p v-u, then v-p-'u, and we have
                        Tnu=p win-1 p" u ;
so that the symbol win is equivalent in operation to the com
pound symbol pºrn-i pº'; writing then ºn-1=p ºn-spºº we
have                   wnu=P**m-2p*;
and finally,            wnu-p” trop-"u.
Hence the equation w, u-0 gives
                          p"Top-"u=0;
                        ... u-p” p-”0. . . . . . (6.)
This equation is unquestionably true, whatever may be the
interpretation of the symbols ºrn, and p, provided that they
satisfy the combination law (1).
   Now taking Mr. Bronwin's first equation, viz.
                   a (D24-kº) u + 2 m Du-0,
and making       ºn =w (D’--k”)+2 m D, p = D*4-k”,
we have                  wo-w (D24-k”),
whence (6.) gives
           u-(D-4-kº)" (w(Dº 4-kº))-(D-4-kº)-mo.
But             (a (D24-4*)}- =(D°4-kº)- wº,
therefore      u-(D-4-kº)”- w- (D4+kº)-mo.
    Without entering into any special examination of the above
result, and merely resting on the analogy of many similar
cases, I should at once assert that, when m is greater than 0,
we ought to retain two of the constants which arise from the
performance of the inverse operation (D4+k”)-”0, and that
it is not necessary that we should retain more than two. Thus
one form of solution is unquestionably
            w- (D*-i-k”)*-* will (c cos ka--c' sin kar);
and there are, I believe, many equivalent forms. The nature
of Mr. Bronwin's error consists in his virtually rejecting the
factors wº" and cos ka:--c' sin kar, and his result is accordingly
nugatory whenever m > 0. Similar remarks apply to the
other equations in his paper, of which however I have only
examined a small number in detail.
    Perhaps, in connexion with this subject, it may not be quite
irrelevant to mention, that about two years since I obtained
the solution of the purely symbolical equation
                        Tm ºrn u + q p u-0,

8.            Mr. C. J. Hargreave on the Integration
in which, beside the law of combination,
                     7mp=p ºn 4-1, ºn p =? Thi-1,
the further condition was imposed,
                      wn ºrn = tra wºn – a (m-m) p.
This solution, which will appear in the Cambridge and Dub
lin Mathematical Journal for January 1847, involves the so
lution of a class of differential equations of which that of La
place's functions is only a very particular case. Such methods,
limited in their individual application, and apparently indefi
nite in their number, seem however to be chiefly valuable as
exercises in symbolical algebra. Linear differential equa
tions, and linear equations in finite differences, may, as I have
elsewhere shown, be reduced to the general form
                     u-H pl(w)F u +?, (a) pºu... = U,
in which w and p satisfy the relations f(x) p use f(x + 1)u and
j (T) p” = f(m)p”; and additional experience confirms my be
lief, that the methods which are founded on the employment
of this form are sufficient for every case. Mr. Bronwin's
equations, when thus treated, are at once seen to be inte
grable.
    It is but justice to add, that Mr. Bronwin's method displays
considerable ingenuity.
                              I remain, Gentlemen,
                                       Your obedient Servant,

IV. Observations on the Rev. B. Bronwin’s Paper on the In
    tegration and Transformation of certain Differential Equa
    tions. By CHARLEs JAMES HARGREAVE, F.R.S.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
      TAKE the liberty of drawing your attention to an error
       which appears to exist in the paper contained in your
 December Number on the Integration and Transformation of
certain Differential Equations.
    I confine my observations in the first place to the first of
 the equations discussed by the author; but it will be seen
 that the same or similar remarks are applicable to the other
 equations.
    The solution of the equation
                       dº y                 d
                    *(#4 ºv)+2p} = 0                 .  .  .  . (1.)

    and Transformation of certain Differential Equations. 9
is given as being          y=(D°+k”)” u,
where                      (D*4 k”) u-0,
a result which is evidently identical with y=0, which is in
deed a solution of (1.), but not the solution of which the author
is in quest.
    The error consists in inferring the equation             -
                D° a u + (2p–4)D u + k” a u-0
from
           (D°4-k”) (Dºw u + (2p–4) D u-Ek” a u)=0.
The deduced equation ought to have been
D°wu-H (2p–4) Du + k” a u-(D*--k”)-'0=a sin ka H-bcoska,
 which will lead to the result                                     -
    y=(Dºr- (; (D*+k”)-(p-1)(a sink r+b cos k *}.
 more conveniently written
            y=(Dºr-4(D'ºro).                         .  .  .   (2.)
    In solving differential equations by successive operations of
 this nature, a difficulty frequently occurs with reference to the
 introduction of constants. Thus every operation denoted by
 (D*+k”)-' introduces two constants; and in many cases all
 the constants thus introduced except two, which are arbitrary,
 must be determined in terms of these two arbitrary constants
 by reference to the original differential equation.
    This difficulty does not occur in the above equation (2.),
 which may be written in the simpler form,
                               1 .  .
            y=(D-4 ey-(; (asinº rºcosº)}.
 If     p=1, y=}(a sin ka + b cos ka).
 If     p=2, y   =# (a sinka:--bcoska) + *: (bsink v-acoska),
                   &c.                  &c.
    It will be found, in like manner, that the solution of the
 second of the equations given by Mr. Bronwin, viz.
                               d
                    d°y
                    da”   +k+}-pky = 0,
 is            y= (D+k wy” {D-(D4++)-p+90),

10                        Mr. Nicholson on the
subject to the difficulty above adverted to as to the determi
nation of the constants introduced by the operations.
   Similarly, the solution of the third example,
                     dº y        )        dº y_
is            y=(D+ey-4 (D8+ k) -ro),
which will be found to be
           y=(D***)-          {} (a s—** + ****)},
a and 3 being the imaginary cube roots of –1.
   The solution of the fourth equation, viz.
                  d?                      d
                *#+(2p42ns)(# my) = 0,        +
will be found to be
          g=(D°--2m D        +2m)-(+ (a," bº),
where a and 3 are the roots of tº--2m t +2m”=0.
    A similar correction may be applied without difficulty to
the other equations discussed by the author of the paper in
question.

     V. On the Compounds of Phosphoric Acid with Aniline.
          By Edward CHAMBERs NICHOLson, Esq.”
OF the inorganic acids there is none so remarkable for the
       number and variety of the compounds it forms with bases
as phosphoric acid. The peculiar and complex reactions of
the salts of this acid were first satisfactorily explained by Prof.
Graham, in his well-known paper published in 1833f. The

University of Glasgow.

           Compounds of Phosphoric Acid with Aniline.               11
modifications of phosphoric acid by its amount of water of
hydration, giving rise to pyrophosphoric and metaphosphoric
acid, beautifully explained all that was enigmatical in the ob
served reactions.
    Prof. Graham’s excellent experiments have added a great
deal to our knowledge of phosphoric acid; the study, how
ever, of this acid and its salts is by no means exhausted. I
consequently hope that any contribution to the subject will
be accepted.
    The following experiments, which were instituted in the
laboratory of the Royal College of Chemistry, relate to the
combination of phosphoric acid with a large and interesting
group of bodies, viz. the organic alkaloids. It is curious that
this class of salts has not been hitherto examined; indeed the
composition of scarcely any phosphate of an organic base has
been satisfactorily ascertained.
    It was a very interesting question, whether these bases,
which with monobasic acids comport themselves exactly the
same as mineral oxides, were capable of combining with poly
basic acids in the same remarkable proportions. In the
absence of experiments, the only points which were known from
whence we might, by way of analogy, have inferred any simi
larity in these compounds with the inorganic phosphates, are
the salts of ammonia with phosphoric acid; ammonia being as
it were the type of all the organic bases. A phosphate of
ammonia indeed is known, containing two equivalents of the
volatile alkali; but it still remained to be decided whether
any true organic alkaloid unites in the proportions of two or
more equivalents with one equivalent of phosphoric acid.
    The only analysis of a phosphate with an organic alkali is
published by Regnault.*. This chemist determined the carbon
and hydrogen in phosphate of strychnine. Regnault con
sidered the salt which he analysed as a compound of 1 equiv.
of phosphoric acid, l equiv. of strychnine and water,
                      HO, Cº, Has N2O4, POs.
However, Regnault's formula of strychnine has been corrected
by Professor Liebigt, who showed that this base contains
one equivalent of carbon more, i. e.
                              Ca H23N2 O4;
it is therefore evident that the composition of Regnault’s phos
phate is to be expressed by the formula
                  HO, Cai Has N2O4, 2HO, POs,
   * Liebig’s Annalen, vol. xxvi. p. 37.  f Ibid. vol. xxvi. p. 58.

 12         … .... .     Mr. Nicholsom on the
 as Professor Liebig” already remarks, and, as may be seen
 from the following comparison of the per-centages correspond
 ing to this formula with his analytical results, which I have
 calculated with the new atomic weights of carbon —
 44 eqs. Carbon . . .               .  . 3300-00        59.23         59'85

  1   ... Phosphate of strychnine 5571-28              100.00
    It is evident from these numbers that the phosphate of
 strychnine analysed by Regnault is a common phosphate,
corresponding to the phosphate of soda with l equiv. of fixed
 base.
    Besides this, Dr. A. T. Thomson f relates an analysis of
phosphate of morphine by Dr. Gilbert, from which however
no conclusion relative to the composition of this salt can be
deduced, the analysis being incomplete.
    It being a matter of indifference whether the base which I
took for experiment was a natural alkaloid or one prepared
artificially in the laboratory, I selected aniline, deeming it
especially suited to my purpose, as this base generally forms
with acids readily crystallizable compounds.

    On adding aniline in excess to a strong solution of tribasic
phosphoric acid, the whole instantly solidified to a white cry
stalline mass, which was drained, pressed, dissolved in a large
quantity of boiling dilute alcohol, and filtered through a warm
funnel; on cooling, the whole became a mass of crystals; after
pressing these between folds of bibulous paper, I finally dried
them on a warm porous tile.
   When dry, this salt appears as beautiful flesh-coloured
nacreous plates, which might be readily taken for thionurate
of ammonia, quite inodorous, slightly acid to test paper. They
are very soluble in aether and water, sparingly soluble in cold
alcohol, but very soluble in hot, so that upon cooling the whole

          1  ... Phosphate of aniline 3558-88        100.00
Therefore   the salt corresponds to the common phosphate of
soda,                    2NaO, HO, POs,
and also to an ammonia salt of the same constitution.
   It is anhydrous, like this ammonia salt; but, unlike these
salts, possesses, as before remarked, an acid reaction, like all
the other salts of aniline, this base being incapable of destroy
ing the properties of an acid.
2. Phosphate with 1 equiv. of Aniline and 2 equivs. of Water.
   This compound is obtained by adding tribasic phosphoric
acid to the salt mentioned before until it ceases to produce a
precipitate with chloride of barium, and concentrating in the
water-bath. In the course of a few hours the salt crystallizes
in beautiful silky needles; these are to be washed with aether
and dried on a warm tile.
   When dry the salt is quite white, but by exposure to the

14                    Mr. Nicholson on the
air becomes rose-red; it is very soluble in aether, alcohol, and
water; in the latter with decomposition, the common phos
phate being produced.

   When burnt with oxide of copper—
   I. 0:456 grim. of the substance gave 0.633 grm. of carbonic
acid and 0.223 grim. of water.
   II. 0.403 grm. neutralized with ammonia and precipitated
with nitrate of silver, gave 0.880 grim. of tribasic phosphate
of silver.
   These numbers correspond to the following per-cents. :—

    1 ... Phosphate of aniline 2394.33         100.00
   This salt corresponds to the biphosphate of soda,
                         NaO, 2HO, PO.
   Mitscherlich has analysed an ammonia compound of the
same constitution.
   I did not succeed in forming a phosphate in which the
three equivalents of water in the hydrate are replaced by three
equivalents of aniline. On adding aniline in excess to an al
coholic solution of the common phosphate, the base did not
combine, and the common phosphate remained. I also tried
to produce it by decomposing the phosphate with three equi
valents of soda by oxalate of aniline; aniline however was in
stantly set free in the form of oily globules, and the common
phosphate was produced with oxalate of soda.
   I have not been more successful in endeavouring to prepare
phosphates, into which aniline enters beside fixed bases. I
have tried to obtain a salt corresponding to phosphorus salt,
                    NaO, NH,O, HO, PO,
by dissolving aniline in a solution of phosphate of soda with
one equivalent of fixed base. The crystals, however, which

         Compounds of Phosphoric Acid with Aniline.           15
were formed did not contain soda, and were similar in appear
ance to the salt first-described. Similar results were obtained
by neutralizing the acid phosphate of aniline with carbonate
of soda. The salt produced did likewise not contain soda,
the common phosphate appearing to be produced.
              II. PYRoPHosphaTE of ANILINE.
   There are two pyrophosphates of aniline, acid and neutral,
which are always formed together when aniline is added in
excess to pyrophosphoric acid. The precipitate produced by
addition of aniline to pyrophosphoric acid is gelatinous, and
becomes quite hard when exposed to the air.
   Several combustions showed me that the compound ob
tained in this way consists of a mixture of the neutral and the
acid pyrophosphate. I have not yet been able to obtain the
neutral salt in a state of purity, but I found that by keeping
the pyrophosphoric acid in great excess, the acid salt may be
procured. The best way of forming it is to add aniline to
rather concentrated pyrophosphoric acid (obtained by decom
posing pyrophosphate of lead by hydrosulphuric acid), when
the acid salt is precipitated along with the neutral compound;
the mixture is then to be heated until the whole is dissolved,
an excess of acid added, and the solution evaporated in the
water-bath; upon cooling, the whole solidifies to a mass of
beautiful white needles, which are to be pressed in bibulous
paper, washed with aether, and finally dried in vacuo. This
salt appears as white silky needles, very similar to the com
mon basic sulphate of quinine; they are very acid, soluble
in water, and almost insoluble in alcohol and aether; the cry
stals and their aqueous solution, like all other aniline salts,
 become red when exposed to the air.
                             Analysis.
   When burnt with oxide of copper—
    I. 0.223 grim. of the substance gave 0.333 grm. of carbonic
 acid and 0.117 grim. of water.
    II. O-269 grim. of the substance gave 0.389 grim. of carbonic
 acid and 0.132 grim. of water.
    III. O-350 grim. of substance, neutralized by ammonia and
 precipitated by nitrate of silver, gave 0.578 grim. of pyrophos
 phate of silver.

     I obtained this salt by adding a great excess of aniline to a
very strong solution of metaphosphoric acid (glacial acid per
fectly pure), or by adding metaphosphoric acid<U+017F> to a solution
of aniline in alcohol or aether; in both cases the salt precipi
tates as a gelatinous white mass; this is to be placed on a
filter and well-washed with aether, until the excess of aniline
is removed and no smell of this body perceived, pressed and
dried over sulphuric acid in vacuo.                                                     -      -
     When dry the salt appears as an amorphous white mass,
which changes rose-red in the air, becoming glutinous. It is
acid to litmus paper, soluble in water, and almost insoluble
in alcohol and aether.
     Its solution dissolves metaphosphate of silver, which pro
perty belongs, also to metaphosphate of soda; upon boiling,
it changes red, and partly reduces the silver salt. When an
aqueous solution is boiled for a long time it is transformed
into common phosphate of aniline.

tate of lead in great excess and boiling for along time; the
metaphosphate of lead is completely changed into the tribasic
salt. This is a very advantageous method of determining
metaphosphoric acid. 0-5785 grm. of the substance gave

18    Mr. W. R. Birt on a remarkable Barometric      Depression.
    The aniline salt, corresponding to the latter, however exists,
 but could as yet not be obtained in a state of purity.
    All the compounds of aniline with phosphoric acid are
 anhydrous, like the other salts of this base which have been
 examined by Professor Hofmann. In this respect they differ
from the corresponding soda salts, which nearly all contain a
larger or smaller amount of water of crystallization. The two
ammonia salts of phosphoric acid which we know, are how
 ever likewise anhydrous.
    From the results of the preceding investigation we may
conclude that the organic bases comport themselves also with
polybasic acids like mineral oxides. I intend, however, to
analyse the phosphates of some other organic alkaloids, par
ticularly of those which occur in nature, and are frequently
employed in medicine.
VI. On the remarkable Barometric Depression of the 25th
               December 1821.    By W. R. BIRT.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
     N the 26th of November last the barometric depression,
       noticed at the close of my letter on the Great Symmetri
cal Barometric Wave, returned, making the sixteenth instance
in eighteen years. The value of the depression at this station
was 29-268 (unreduced): the observation was taken at 10
minutes past 8 in the morning. The value is about a tenth
higher than the depression at Dublin on the 26th of Novem
ber 1843. In that year the barometer commenced a decided
rise on the 27th, which it also did at this station in the pre
sent year.
   My friend E. W. Brayley, Jun., Esq., has suggested that
this depression is somewhat allied to the great depression
which occurred on the 25th of December 1821, and which has
been made the subject of an investigation by Prof. Brandes of
Breslau, and since by Prof. Dove of Berlin. The reader will
find Prof. Brandes' paper in the Annals of Philosophy, N. S.
vol. iv. p. 263, and Prof. Dove's in the American Journal of
Science and Art, vol. xliv. p. 319.      A paper on the same
subject by Luke Howard is inserted in the Philosophical
Transactions, vol. cxii. p. 113.
   There can be no question that the depression of the latter end
of November is periodical: the following interesting question
consequently suggests itself._ Is the depression of the 25th of
December also periodical ? To answer this question I selected
all the readings given in Howard’s Climate of London from

  Mr. W. R. Birt on a remarkable Barometric Depression. 19
1806 to 1830 inclusive, on the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th and
27th of December. These readings, which consist of the
maxima and minima, I have made the subject of a very care
ful discussion, the result of which forms the subject of this
communication.

  20 Mr. W. R. Birt on a remarkable Barometric Depression.
     This table gives the principal features of the depression of
  1810. It will immediately be seen from a comparison of the
  numbers of 1810 and 1821, that the depressions are essentially
  distinct.

     Rejecting on each day the readings of 1821 on the ground
  of the depression being so distinctly marked, and the readings
  being so considerably below any other of the series, and also
  rejecting on the 25th the readings for 1810 as evidently indi
  cating a depression, and being nearly 5 below the lowest of
  the remaining readings, this table gives the means of the
  maxima and minima for the respective days; from which it
 appears that, on the average, the barometer passes a maximum
 on or about the 25th of December.

     From this table we learn that the years 1826 and 1827 were
  characterized by considerable elevations of the barometer from
  the 23rd to the 27th of December; and that in the years 1810,
  1814, 1815, 1819 and 1824, the barometer sank to 29 inches
  or below, on the 23rd, 25th, 26th or 27th. In no instance
  except 1821 did the barometer fall below 29:25 on the 24th.

   In this table the highest readings of the maxima show the
absolute altitude which the mercurial column attained on the
respective days in the years named in the third column.
   The lowest readings of the maxima show that the barometer
attained a greater elevation than 29:25 on each day, from the
23rd to the 27th of December inclusive, in each year from
1806 to 1830 also inclusive, 1821 and 1810 only excepted;
the exception of the year 1810 extends only to the 25th.
   The reply which this examination furnishes to the question
proposed is this—that the depressions of 1810 and 1821 were
accidental, that is, they did not form portions of a periodical
series of depressions, such as the depression of the latter end
of November (see table on p. 359 in the last volume). Mr.
Brayley however suggests that they may be instances of a
longer series. May they not result from annual movements,
which from some cause or other are displaced? The usual
epoch of the crest of the great wave is about the middle of
November; on some occasions it occurs as early as the latter
end of October, and on others as late as the latter end of No
vember, having a range of about a month.
   This result conducts us to another of a very interesting
character: we have just noticed that the great symmetrical
wave is to a certain extent erratic as to the period of its
transit. The depression of the latter end of November is to
a certain extent constant, the period of its transit being con
fined to about four days: this has been determined from
a consideration of the barometric curves of the last four days
of November.        Mr. Howard's observations do not furnish
sufficient data for projecting the curves; still the readings
lead to the conclusion, that some time during the five days,
from the 23rd to the 27th of December                  j the baro
meter passes a maximum. We have an elevation of the mer
curial column about this time.
   From this it appears highly probable that we have two

22 Mr. W. R. Birt on a remarkable Barometric Depresion.
points approximately fixed in our annual barometric curve,
the depression on or about the 28th of November, and the
elevation on or about the 25th of December. It also appears
that we have two kinds of atmospheric movements that affect
the barometer; those of an erratic character as to their
period—the great symmetrical wave being an instance—and
those of a more constant character, as the depression and
elevation just noticed.                                        -
   We now pass on to the evidence which the Greenwich ob
servations afford as to the elevation of the 25th of December.

    From this table we find that the barometric readings on
 the 25th are strictly in accordance with the foregoing deduc
 tions, being considerably above 29'500; and we further learn
 that the maximum of this elevation occurred on the 26th at
 10 at night; the readings of the 25th were therefore those of
 the anterior slope of the elevation.            The maximum of the
 26th was also the maximum of the month.

    The readings of the 25th are still in accordance with the re
 sults already arrived at. The trough between the two maxima
 occurred at 10 P.M. of the 25th, so that the readings of the
 25th were those of the posterior slope of the first elevation.

deduced from the observations as given in Howard's Climate

   By the kindness of Captain Childers, who has placed in my
hands the hourly observations which he communicated to the
British Association at its last meeting, I am enabled to ascer
tain the state of the barometer at St. Helier's, Jersey, for the
above-named days in the years 1844 and 1845: it is strictly
in accordance with all that has preceded.

   Notice of some Mechanical Productions of Abraham Sharp. 25
    Upon the whole, I apprehend we may fairly conclude, from
the observations of thirty-one years, that on or about the 25th
of December the barometer passes a maximum, and that this
maximum is above 29'500. This conclusion is strengthened
by the fact, that only two exceptions have been observed: a
low barometer on the 25th will consequently demand close
attention, and observations under such circumstances cannot
fail of possessing great interest. . . .                    . .

mechanical productions of Abraham Sharp, the once cele
brated assistant of Flamsteed, are still in existence and in
good preservation. My attention was directed to this subject
in consequence of observing his name mentioned in the review
 of the Rev. W. Whewell's Flamsteed and Newton. Feeling
 interested in everything which related to one so eminent in
 his day, I endeavoured, while on a visit at Bradford (York
 shire), to obtain whatever information I could respecting the
 papers and “reliques” of the once “indefatigable calculator,”
 and sought to procure some memento of him who is described
 by his biographer as having “had a clear head for contriving
 and a skilful hand for executing” any of the mechanical or
 philosophical
 inquiries           apparatus which he required. The

                                                                     result of my
     The lathe, mentioned in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (article

  26 The Rev. N. S. Heineken on the Mechanical Productions
  * Sharp') for turning, rose-work, eccentric, swash-work, geo
  metrical solids, &c., was sold some few years since at Bradford
 to Godfrey Wright, Esq., in the neighbourhood of Doncaster.
  It had for many years been used by its former possessor
  (W. Goodchild), and when I saw it was in excellent working
 condition; and many are the elaborate and beautiful speci
 mens which I have seen of its efficiency, even at a period of
 upwards of a century since it was first constructed. Another
 smaller lathe, of a somewhat similar description, for turning
 ovals, and ovals combined with rose-work, which exhibits some
 ingenious contrivances of the same “master mind,” was pur
 chased by a person whose name is “Murgy,” residing at Hea
 ton near Bradford.     The double sector mentioned in his bio
 graphy and sculptured on his monument, is, I understand, in
 the possession of J. Bottomley, Esq. of Bradford, or his re
 lative Miss Bamforth, of Manor Row, Bradford. The large
 (18-inch) elaborate ring dial, and also the set of calculating
 rods in a walking-stick, were purchased by Mr. Muff, music
 seller, Leeds. A beautifully divided plate for calculating, I was
 informed, was in the possession of — Skelton, Esq. of Brad
 ford. A large equatorial (with the hour circle about thirty
 inches diameter) in complete preservation, was purchased at
the sale at Bradford, and is now at the observatory of the
York Philosophical Institution. A very ingenious and com
plete perambulator, measuring from part of an inch to 100
miles, together with some geometrical solids, turned in the
first-mentioned lathe, now belong to my friend J. Water
house, Esq., of Well Head near Halifax. Of this peram
bulator I may observe, that it has only one toothed wheel in
the whole of the machinery: all the intermediate measures
are given from the inch to the last inder, which moves once in
 100 miles; and yet the disc of the dial is not more than about
six inches in diameter and not a quarter of an inch in thick
ness. Of this perambulator I have made a model, which (with
the consent of my friend) I will submit to you should you
desire it. A mural quadrant of 54 feet radius, diagonally di
vided, &c., I have in my own possession, and shall feel plea
sure in showing it to any who may feel an interest about it.
A spirit thermometer, the scale of which I am certain was the
work of Abraham Sharp, from the punches used for the
figures, was fixed in the wainscot of the hall at Horton (his
residence). If the tube is the original one, this might be va
luable for reference in a meteorological point of view; for I
remember having seen many meteorological journals, which
had been kept by Abraham Sharp, and which were among
the papers left at Horton : these I believe are now in the

                       of Abraham Sharp.       . .               27
possession of — Giles, Esq., the representative of the family.
Two planispheres were also among these papers, drawn by pen
and ink; but so exquisitely, that until I examined them with
a magnifying lens, I could not but believe them to be engra
vings. A vice which was made to turn on its axis, and which
had the contrivance of a second pair of chaps near the screw,
for pressing, I imagine, horn into moulds for bultons, was used
by the before-named Mr. Goodchild as his working vice, and
I dare say is still retained by some part of the family; and
as I have mentioned the contrivance for horn-pressing, I may
state, that even one set of these identical buttons is still in ex
istence | | They are ornamented with every variety of rose
work patterns, and were probably intended by the philosopher
for his holiday suit ! ! They are now, together with some
lenses, regarded by their owner, Mr. Fearnley of Shipley, as
precious relics, though I believe within a few years they have
decorated modern broadcloth. The steel punches for figu
ring his instruments were constantly used by Mr. Goodchild
for the same purpose; as were also several chisels, which, sin
gularly enough, were made of remarkably soft iron, case-har
 dened at the cutting part. I remember also to have seen a
 “shutter micrometer’ of brass at the Hall. This, I suppose,
 not having been sold, is retained by — Giles, Esq. It is
 much to be regretted that the ingenious and laborious pro
 ductions of such men should be thus scattered abroad, and in
 too many instances allowed to decay or be wantonly destroyed.
 Two lamentable examples of this are, I learn from a paper in
 the Magazine of Science, exhibited even at the Royal Society,
 where the reflectors of Newton and Hadley are in a state of
 complete dilapidation.    In the case of Abraham Sharp, it was
 by chance only that I was fortunate enough to save the large
 mural quadrant from the hands of an ignorant brazier, who
 was anxious to purchase it for the purpose of mending ket
 tles | | I was given to understand with respect to his MSS.,
 that many years since, when they had been neglected by the
 owner of the house and left in a closet, the cook was in the
 habit of supplying herself from the ample store for the purpose
 of lighting fires and singeing fowls! what remained have since,
 I believe, been carefully preserved by — Giles, Esq., but they
 are now the mere membra disjecta—the Sibyl's scattered leaves.

I observe that, in this paper, I have not had occasion to use
the foregoing notation for the roofs of equations. But the
above may be considered to suggest the following permanent
notation; viz. that a, should represent a root, and a tº the
coefficient of the (r-i-1)th term of an equation in X; , X a
quantity composed of symmetric functions of, and homogeneous
and of the 7th degree with respect to, an a 2, . wa; that § should
denote the disposable quantities which enter (explicitly) into
the equation for y and E, the disposable quantities implicitly
contained in that equation. When r is given as a number, we
may, however, as above, express the coefficients by accents if
r be small, or by Roman numerals if it be large. For facility
of reference I have termed “last’ volume what was in fact the
current one at the time of writing this paper.
    IX. On the Solvent Action of Drainage-Water on Soils.
                      By John WILsoN, Esq.f
IN the autumn         of 1844, being a resident in East Lothian,
     where the system of thorough draining is very extensively
carried out, it occurred to me that the drainage-water during
its percolation of the soil must necessarily dissolve out and
carry away a great portion of the soluble constituents of it,
which, by the practice as at present followed, are carried off
the land and entirely lost to the farmer. I therefore took
advantage of the first fall of rain sufficient to set the drains

running after the dry weather of the autumn, and collected
some of the drainage-water, which I subjected to a partial
analysis, the particulars of which were described in a paper
read by Dr. W. Gregory at a meeting of the Royal Society,
Edinburgh, in the early part of last year. The results I then
obtained, though very incomplete, were quite sufficient to
show me that they had a very important bearing on agricul
ture, and to induce me to go on with their further investiga
tion.
   About the usual quantity of rain had fallen during the time
between November, when I collected the first sample, and
April 29th, when I obtained the second, and during the whole
of that period the land had laid ploughed as a winter fallow.
   Immediately after the second sample was taken the field
was prepared for seed and sown with guano and barley. In
a few days after (May 16th) I was enabled to collect a third
sample (of course from the same drains), and having sub
mitted them to analysis, the following are the results:—

   I should here observe that the first sample, collected in

32         Solvent Action of Drainage-Water on Soils.
November, after the drains had been dry for many weeks
previous, contained 2.25 grs. of solid residue to the pound;
whereas that collected in the following April (No. 2), after
the land had been continually drenched by the winter’s rains,
only gave '844 gr. to the pound.
   On adding a quantity of easily soluble manure (guano) to
the soil, the first waters (No. 3) that passed through not only
brought with them an increased quantity (1525 gr. to the
pound), but they contained many of the very ingredients that
constituted the value of the manure itself.
   At the time the paper referred to was read at the Royal
Society, Edinburgh, it was suggested that possibly the turbid
portion first discharged from the drains after heavy rains
might contain matter also very valuable to the soil; but on
comparing the subjoined analysis with that of the drained soil,
it appears to be composed of the same ingredients, with a
decrease in the proportion of silica and an increase in the lime,
both of which may be readily accounted for.

   I do not for a moment wish to question the value of the
principle of thorough draining; that is now I believe univer
sally admitted; but if its results are deemed so beneficial to
the farmer under the present practice, how much more so
would they not become, if some remedy were devised either
to prevent as much as possible this great abstraction, or else
to render the enriched drainage-water again available to the
soil
   This subject has not, I find, escaped the observant mind of
Liebig, and in fact forms the basis of the ‘Patent Manure,”
according to his specification in October last. He has argued
theoretically to the same end, and has proffered a remedy in
the shape of a manure, by his patent process rendered much
less soluble than before, which of course would not be acted
upon so readily by the percolating rain-water, and would

      Mr. Smith of Deanston, a man to whom practical agricul

  dering the drainage-water again available, it ºf ºil
    , But should the farmer object to take advantage of either
  plan, it would appear expedient to avoid using as much as
  possible the very soluble manures, and instead of giving his
  land the usual good dose of manure that is expected to suffice
  for two or three seasons, to divide the quantity, and to apply

senate, I considered it to be my duty at once to comply with
 this request. A new body of the solar system has been dis
 covered, by means depending on the furthest advances hitherto
 made in theoretical and practical astronomy, and confirming
 in a most remarkable manner the theory of universal gravita
 tion. It is therefore on every account desirable that the
 members of the senate should be made fully acquainted with
 the part which has been taken by the Cambridge Observatory
 relatively to this important extension of astronomical science.
 The observations I shall have to speak of, and the reasons
 for undertaking them, are so closely connected with theore
 tical calculations performed by a member of this university
 to account for anomalies in the motion of the planet Uranus,
 that the history of the former necessarily involves that of the
 latter. I hope that for this reason, and because of the pecu
 liar nature of the circumstances, I may be allowed to make a
 communication less formal and restricted in its character than
 a mere report of observatory proceedings.
    The tables with which the observations of the planet Uranus
 have been uniformly compared were published by A. Bouvard
 in 1821. They are founded on a continued series of obser
 vations extending from 1781, the year of its discovery, to
 1821. Previous to 1781, it had been accidentally observed
 seventeen times as a fixed star, the earliest observation of this
 kind being one by Flamsteed in 1690. Bouvard met with a
difficulty in forming his tables. On an attempt to found them
 upon the ancient as well as the modern observations, it ap
peared that the theoretical did not agree with the observed
course of the planet. He thought this might be attributed to
the imperfection of the ancient observations, and consequently
rejected all previous to 1781 in the formation of the tables
finally published. These tables represent well enough the
observations in the forty years from 1781 to 1821; but very
soon after the latter year new errors began to show them
selves, which have gone on increasing to the present time. It
was now evident that the ancient observations had been re
jected on insufficient grounds, and that from some unknown
cause the theory was in fault. Were the tables calculated
inaccurately 2 The difference between observation and theory
 (amounting in 1841 to 96" of geocentric longitude) was too
great, and Bouvard’s calculations were made with too much
care to allow of this explanation.    The effect of small terms
neglected in the calculation of the perturbations caused by
Jupiter, and Saturn, could not be supposed to bear any con
siderable proportion to the observed amount of error.       This
state of the theory suggested to several astronomers the idea

    Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet. 35
  of disturbances caused by an undiscovered planet more distant
  than Uranus. But there is no evidence of this hypothesis
  having been put to the test of calculation previous to 1843.
  The usual problem of perturbations is to find the disturbing
  action of one body on another by knowing the positions of
  both. Here an inverse problem, hitherto untried, was to be
  solved; viz. from known disturbances of a planet in known
  positions, to find the place of the disturbing body at a given
  time. Mr. Adams, Fellow of St. John's College, showed me
 a memorandum made in 1841, recording his intention of at
 tempting to solve this problem as soon as he had taken his
 degree of B.A. Accordingly, after graduating in January
  1843, he obtained an approximate solution by supposing the
 disturbing body to move in a circle at twice the distance of
  Uranus from the sun. The result so far satisfied the ob
 served anomalies in the motion of Uranus as to induce him to
 enter upon an exact solution. For this purpose he required
 reduced observations made in the years 1818–26, and re
 quested my intervention to obtain them from Greenwich. The
 Astronomer Royal, on my application, immediately supplied
 (Feb. 15, 1844) all the heliocentric errors of Uranus in lon
 º,       and latitude, from 1754 to 1880, completely reduced.
    r. Adams was now furnished with ample data from obser
 vation, and his next care was to ascertain whether Bouvard's
 theoretical calculations were correct enough for his purpose.
 He tested the accuracy of the principal terms of the pertur
 bations caused by Jupiter and Saturn, and concluded that the
small terms which Bouvard had not taken into account would
 not sensibly affect the final results, the chief of them being
either of long period, or of a period nearly equal to that of
 Uranus. Besides which he introduced into the theory several
corrections which had been derived from observation and cal
 culation by different astronomers since 1821. The calcula
tions were completed in 1845. In September of that year,
 Mr. Adams placed in my hands a paper containing numerical
values of the mean longitude at a given epoch, longitude of
perihelion, eccentricity of orbit, mass, and geocentric longitude,
Sept. 30, of the supposed disturbing planet, which he calls by
anticipation “the new planet,” evidently showing the convic
tion in his own mind of the reality of its existence. Towards
the end of the next month, a communication of results slightly
different was made to the Astronomer Royal, with the addition
of what was far more important, viz. a list of the residual
errors of the mean longitude of Uranus, for a period extend
ing from 1690 to 1840, after taking account of the disturbing
effect of the supposed planet. This comparison of observation
                                D 2º

36    Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet.
with the theory implied the determination of all the unknown
quantities of the problem, both the corrections of the elements
of Uranus, and the elements of the disturbing body. The
smallness of the residual errors proved that the new theory
was adequate to the explanation of the observed anomalies in
the motion of Uranus; and that as the error of longitude was
corrected for a period of at least 130 years, the error of radius
vector was also corrected.     As the calculations rested on an
assumption made according to Bode's law, that the mean di
stance of the disturbing planet was double that of Uranus,
without the above-mentioned numerical verification, no proof
was given that the problem was solved, or that the elements
of the supposed planet were not mere speculative results. The
earliest evidence of the complete solution of an inverse pro
blem of perturbations is to be dated from October 1845.
   Although the comparison of the theory with observation
proved synthetically that the assumed mean distance was not
very far from the truth, it was yet desirable to try the effect
of an alteration of the mean distance.      Mr. Adams accord
ingly went through the same calculations as before, assuming
a mean distance something less than the double of that of
Uranus, and obtained results which indicated a better accord
ance of the theory with observation; and led him to the con
clusion, which has since been confirmed by observation, that
the mean distance should be still further diminished.       This
second solution, taken in conjunction with the first, may be
considered to relieve the question of every kind of assumption.
The new elements of the disturbing body, and the results of
comparing the observed with the theoretical mean longitudes
of Uranus, were communicated to the Astronomer Royal at the
beginning of September 1846. These were accompanied by
numerical values of errors of the radius vector, the Astronomer
Royal having inquired after the reception of the first solution,
whether the error of radius vector, known to exist from ob
servation, was explained by this theory. It would be wrong
to infer that Mr. Adams was not prepared to answer this
question till he had gone through the second solution. Errors
of radius vector were as readily deducible from the first solu
tion as from the other.
   The preceding details are intended to point out the circum
stances which led astronomers to suspect the existence of an
additional body of the solar system, and the theoretical reasons
there were for undertaking to search for it. No one could
have anticipated that the place of the unknown body was in
dicated with any degree of exactness by a theory of this kind.
It might reasonably be supposed, without at all mistrusting

  Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet.    87
the evidence which the theory gave of the earistence of the
planet, that its position was determined but roughly, and that
a search for it must necessarily be long and laborious. This
was the view I took, and consequently I had no thought of
commencing the search in 1845, the planet being considerably
past opposition at the time Mr. Adams completed his calcu
lations. The succeeding interval to midsummer of 1846
was a period of great astronomical activity, the planet Astraea,
Biela’s double comet, and several other comets successively
demanding attention. During this time I had little commu
nication with Mr. Adams respecting the new planet. Atten
tion was again called to the subject by the publication of M.
Le Verrier's first researches in the Comptes Rendus for June 1,
1846. At a meeting of the Greenwich Board of Visitors held
on June 29, at which I was present, Mr. Airy announced that
M. Le Verrier had obtained very nearly the same longitude of
the supposed planet as that given by Mr. Adams. On July 9
I received a letter from Mr. Airy, in which he suggested em
ploying the Northumberland telescope in a systematic search
for the planet, offering at the same time to send an assistant
from Greenwich in case I declined undertaking the observa
tions. This letter was followed by another dated July 13,
containing suggestions respecting the mode of conducting the
observations, and an estimation of the amount of work they
might be expected to require. In my answer, dated July 18,
I signified the determination I had come to of undertaking
the search.     Various reasons led me to this conclusion.      I
had already, as Mr. Adams can testify, entertained the idea
of making these observations; the most convenient time for
commencing them was now approaching; and the confirma
tion of Mr. Adams's theoretical position, by the calculations
 of M. Le Verrier, appeared to add very greatly to the proba
bility of success. I had no answer to make to Mr. Airy's
offer of sending an assistant, as I understood the acceptance
of it to imply the relinquishing on my part of the undertaking.
    I have now to speak of the observations. The plan of
 operations was formed mainly on the suggestions contained
 in Mr. Airy's note of July 13. It was recommended to sweep
 over three times at least, a zodiacal belt 30° long and 10°
 broad, having the theoretical place of the planet at its centre;
 to complete one sweep before commencing the next; and to
 map the positions of the stars. The three sweeps, it was cal
 culated, would take 300 hours of observing. This extent of
 work, which will serve to show the idea entertained of the
 difficulty of the undertaking before the planet was discovered,
 did not appear to me greater than the case required. It will

38    Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet.
be seen that the plan did not contemplate the use of hour xxi.
of the Berlin star-maps, the publication of which was equally
unknown at that time to Mr. Airy and myself. It may be
proper here to explain, that the construction of a good star
map requires a great amount of time and labour both in ob
serving and calculating, and that precisely this sort of labour
must be gone through to conduct a search of the kind I had
undertaken. The stars must first be mapped before the search
can properly be said to begin. With a map ready made, the
detection of a moving body, as it happened in this instance,
might be effected on a comparison of the heavens with the
map by mere inspection. ... Not having the advantage of such
a map, I proceeded as follows. I noted down very approxi
mately the positions of all the stars to the 11th magnitude,
that could be conveniently taken as they passed through the
field of view of the telescope, the breadth of the field with a
magnifying power of 166 being 9', and the telescope being in
a fixed position. When the stars came thickly, some were
necessarily allowed to pass without recording their places.
Wishing to include all stars to the 11th magnitude, I pro
posed in going over the same region a second time, to avail
myself of an arrangement peculiar to the Northumberland
equatoreal, the merit of inventing which is due to Mr. Airy.
The hour-circle, telescope and polar frame, are moveable by
clock-work, which may be regulated to sidereal time nearly.
While this motion is going on, the telescope and polar frame
are moveable relatively to the hour circle, by a tangent-screw
apparatus, and a handle extending to the observer's seat. This
contrivance enables the observer to measure at his leisure dif.
ferences of right ascension however small, and therefore meets
the case of stars coming in groups.     The observations made
by this method might include all the stars it was thought de
sirable to take, and therefore might include all the stars taken in
the first sweep. The discovery of the planet would result from
finding that any star in the first sweep was not in its position in
the second sweep. If two sweeps failed in detecting the planet
among the stars of the first sweep, it might be among the stars
of the second, which would be decided by taking a third sweep
of the same kind as the second. It will appear that this plan
carried out, would not only detect the planet if it were in the
region explored, but would also, in case of failure, enable the
observer to pronounce that it was not in that region. The
second mode of observing required the aid of my two assist
ants, Mr. Morgan and Mr.       i. in reading off and record
ing the observations.
   I commenced observing July 29, employing on that day

   Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet.     39
the first method, with telescope fixed. The next day I ob
served according to the second method, with telescope moving.
On Aug. 4, the telescope was fixed as to right ascension, but
was moved in declination in a zone of about 70' breadth, the
intention of the observations of that day being to record points
of reference for the zones of 9' breadth. On Aug. 12, the
fourth day of observing, I went over the same zone, telescope
fixed, as on July 30 with telescope moving. Soon after,
Aug. 12, I compared to a certain extent, the observations of
that day with the observations of July 30, taken with telescope
moving ; and finding, as far as I carried the comparison, that
the positions of July 30 included all those of Aug. 12, I felt
convinced of the adequacy of the method of search I had
adopted. The observations were continued with diligence to
Sept. 29, chiefly with telescope fixed, and were made early in
right ascension for the purpose of exploring as large a space
as possible before I should be compelled to desist by the ap
proach of daylight. On Oct. 1, I heard that the planet was
discovered by Dr. Galle at Berlin, on Sept. 23. I had then
recorded 3150 positions of stars, and was making preparations
for mapping them. The following results were obtained by
a discussion of the observations after the announcement of the
discovery.
   On continuing the comparison of the observations of July
30 and Aug. 12, I found that No. 49, a star of the 8th mag
nitude in the series of Aug. 12, was wanting in the series of
July 30. According to the principle of the search, this was
the planet. It had wandered into the zone in the interval
between July 30 and Aug. 12. I had not continued the for
mer comparison beyond No. 89, probably from the accidental
circumstance that a line was there drawn in the memorandum
book in consequence of the interruption of the observations
by a cloud. After ascertaining the place of the planet on
Aug. 12, I readily inferred that it was also among the refer
ence stars taken on Aug. 4. Thus, after four days of obser
ving two positions of the planet were obtained. This is en
tirely to be attributed to my having on those days directed
the telescope towards the planet's theoretical place, according
to instructions given in a paper Mr. Adams had the kindness
to draw up for me. I would also beg to call attention to the
fact, that, after Aug. 12, the planet was discoverable by a closet
comparison of the observations; a method of observing, de
pending on novel and ingenious mechanism, having been
adopted, by which I could say of each star, to No. 48, “This
is not a planet,’ and of No. 49, ‘This is a planet.’ I lost the
opportunity of announcing the discovery by deferring the dis

40    Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet.
cussion of the observations, being much occupied with reduc
tions of comet observations, and little suspecting that the in
dications of theory were accurate enough to give a chance of
discovery in so short a time. On Sept. 29, I saw for the first
time the communication presented by M. Le Verrier to the
Paris Academy on Aug. 31. I was much struck with the
manner in which the author limits the field of observation,
and with his recommending the endeavour to detect the planet
by its disc. Mr. Adams had already told me, that, according
to his estimation, the planet would not be less bright than a
star of the ninth magnitude. On the same evening I swept a
considerable breadth in declination, between the limits of
right ascension marked out by M. Le Verrier, and I paid par
ticular attention to the physical appearance of the brighter
stars. Out of 300 stars, whose positions I recorded that
night, I fixed on one which appeared to have a disc, and which
proved to be the planet. This was the third time it was ob
served before the announcement of the discovery reached me.
This last observation may be regarded as a discovery of the
planet, due to the good definition of the noble instrument
which we owe to the munificence of our Chancellor.
    From the reduced places of the planet on Aug. 4 and Aug.
 12, and from observations since its discovery extending to
 Oct. 13, Mr. Adams calculated, at my request, values of its
heliocentric longitude at a given epoch, its actual distance
from the sun, longitude of the node, and inclination of the
 orbit, which were published as early as Oct. 17. I am now
 diligently observing the planet with the meridian instruments;
 and when daylight prevents its being seen on the meridian, I
 propose carrying on the observations as long as possible with
 the Northumberland equatoreal, for the purpose of obtaining
 data for a further approximation to the elements of the orbit.
    My report of proceedings relating to the planet here termi
 nates. I beg permission to add a few remarks, which the
 facts I have stated seem to call for. It will appear by the
 above account that my success might have been complete if I
 had trusted more implicitly to the indications of the theory.
 It must however be remembered that I was in quite a novel
 position: the history of astronomy does not afford a parallel
 instance of observations undertaken entirely in reliance upon
 deductions from theoretical calculations, and those too of a
 kind before untried. As the case stands, a very prominent
 part has been taken in the University of Cambridge, with re
 ference to this extension of the boundaries of astronomical
 science. We may certainly assert to be facts, for which there
 is documentary evidence, that the problem of determining

from perturbations the unknown place of the disturbing body
was first solved here; that the planet was here first sought
for; that places of it were here first recorded; and that ap
proximate elements of its orbit were here first deduced from
observation. And that all this may be said is entirely due to
the talents and labours of one individual among us, who has
at once done honour to the University and maintained the
scientific reputation of the country. It is to be regretted that
Mr. Adams was more intent upon bringing his calculations to
perfection, than on establishing his claims to priority by early
publication. Some may be of opinion, that in placing before
the first astronomer of the kingdom results which showed that
he had completed the solution of the problem, and by which
he was, in a manner, pledged to the production of his calcu
lations, there was as much publication as was justifiable on the
part of a mathematician whose name was not yet before the
world, the theory being one by which it was possible the prac
tical astronomer might be misled. Now that success has
attended a different course, this will probably not be the ge
neral opinion. I should consider myself to be hardly doing
justice to Mr. Adams, if I did not take this opportunity of
stating, from the means I have had of judging, that it was
impossible for any one to have comprehended more fully and
clearly all the parts of this intricate problem; that he care
fully considered all that was necessary for its exact solution;
and that he had a firm conviction, from the results of his cal
culations, that a planet was to be found.                        -
            XI. On the Marimum Density of Water.
   By JAMES P. Joule, Esq. and Dr. Lyon PLAYFAIR*.
 IN all researches on specific gravity the selection of a pro
     per standard of comparison is a matter of great importance.
 For obvious reasons water has been universally selected as
this standard; but a diversity of opinion has been enter
tained as to the temperature at which the gravity of water
should be called unity. Hence, whilst our continental neigh
bours have adopted the freezing temperature, our own coun
trymen have generally chosen the temperature of 60°Fahr.
Water at 60° cannot be a desirable standard, on account of
its high rate of expansion at that temperature; and for the
 same and other reasons the temperature of 32° is not at all
more convenient.      We conceive that it would be much more
philosophical, and lead to many practical advantages, if water

1846.

 42                Messrs. Playfair and Joule on º
 at its maximum density were taken as the unit *. In that
 case, calculations would often be greatly facilitated; and if
 the temperature of the water should happen to be a degree
 under or over the maximum point in any experiment, the ex
treme slowness of the expansion would avert the possibility
 of a grave error.
    Intending to give still greater accuracy to our future ex
periments, we deem the present a favourable opportunity for
fixing upon a good unit of comparison. We propose there
fore to occupy the present series with a brief discussion as to
the point of temperature at which water arrives at its state of
greatest density.                            -      . . . . . .
   Although a variety of methods have been employed in the
investigation of this subject, they may be classified under two
general heads. The first of these embraces all the methods
involving the necessity of an accurate acquaintance with the
rate of the expansion of some solid body by heat. The in
quiry, when made in this way, is one of great difficulty, and
has occupied the attention of many of our most accurate ex
perimenters. The Florentine Academicians, Croune, Delue,
Dalton, and others, compared the indications of a thermometer
filled with water with one filled with mercury; Lefevre
Gineau and Hallström weighed a solid body in water at dif
ferent temperatures; and Blagden and Gilpin measured the
variation of volume by the variation of the weight of water
contained in the same vessel at different temperatures. . . .”
   The other general method does not require a previous ac-1
quaintance with the expansion of a solid by heat: it consists
virtually in weighing water in water—the heavier water de
scending, while the lighter ascends to replace it. This prin
ciple was introduced by Dr. Hope, who applied it in the
following elegant manner:—He filled with water at different
temperatures tall glass jars having thermometers at top,
middle and bottom. In this way he observed that when
water was cooled down to 40° at the surface, it sank to the
bottom; and when cooled below 40° at the bottom, it rose
again to the surface. Trallés, Count Rumford, Ekstrand and
Despretz have repeated Hope’s experiment with a similar
apparatus.
   Believing that the second general method is susceptible of
a far greater degree of accuracy than the first, we at once de
termined to employ it in our own experiments. The particular
   * Since this paper was communicated to the Society we have seen the
Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes for 1845, in which, under the high au
thority of Arago, water at its point of maximum density is assumed as the
unit for comparison.

apparatus of Dr. Hope did not however appear to us to pre
sent the method in a form calculated to give results of great
accuracy; and hence we have found it necessary to devise a
new instrument combining all the theoretical advantages with
the requisite facilities for exact observation. . . . . . .
   Our instrument is represented in the
accompanying sketch... a a are two up

high and 6 inches in diameter: they are

   The vessels were supported in two places by means of the
wooden brackets d d, and in order to prevent the greater than
desired effect of the atmosphere in raising or depressing their
temperature, they were completely covered with haybands.
During the experiments the instrument was placed upon a
tripod stool resting upon a support quite independent of the
floor of the laboratory, in order to keep it entirely free from
vibration.
   Now, if the two vessels be filled with water and made to
communicate with one another by opening the stop-cock and
removing the slide, it is evident that a current will tend to ,
flow through the trough connecting the tops of the vessels,
if the density of the water in one of the vessels be in the least
degree greater than that of the water in the other vessel,
Although the changes in density are very minute near the
maximum point, the extreme mobility of fluids led us to
expect that we might in this way arrive at an exact and in-,
controvertible result.                         ... . . . .. . .     ..... . .
   The thermometers employed by us were of extreme accu
racy, having been calibrated throughout their whole length,
and their delicacy was such as to indicate a change of tempe
rature considerably less than Tägth of a degree Fahrenheit.

The freezing-points of the ºthermometers were carefully de
termined within a few hours of the experiments. Each vessel
was furnished with a stirrer, consisting of a disc of tinned
iron 4 inches in diameter attached to the end of a slender rod
of iron, by means of which the water was thoroughly stirred
before each determination of temperature.
    In order to measure the motion of the water in the trough
connecting the tops of the vessels, a hollow glass ball of
about three-eighths of an inch diameter was placed in it. The
weight of this glass ball was carefully adjusted so as only
just to float: a matter of great importance, as the slightest
buoyancy is accompanied by a certain degree of capillary at
traction, and makes the ball liable to adhere to the sides of
the trough.
    The water employed in the experiments was distilled by
 ourselves in clean vessels of tinned iron; and the additional
 precaution was taken to prevent, as far as possible, the solu
tion of air.
    Our method of experimenting was as follows:—Having
 filled the vessel with distilled water at a temperature of about
37°, we increased the temperature of one of the vessels to
41°5 by the addition of a small quantity of hot distilled water.
 We then placed two delicate thermometers upon a proper
 stand, so that their bulbs dipped in the water to the depth of
6 inches. Having then closed the stop-cock and adjusted the
slide, we stirred the water in each vessel thoroughly, and
noted the temperatures indicated by the thermometers. The
stop-cock was then opened and the slide carefully removed
from the trough. After waiting three minutes the glass ball
was put into the trough, and its motion watched for two or
three minutes with the help of a graduated rule placed at the
top of the trough. In conclusion, the stop-cock was again
turned, the slide readjusted, the water stirred, and the tem
peratures again noted. The mean of the temperatures thus
observed before and after each trial of the velocity of the cur
rent was taken as the temperature of the observation.
    The following table contains the results of a series of ob
servations taken in the above manner. The temperature of
the laboratory being about 38°, the water in the warmer
vessel cooled down more rapidly than the water in the other
vessel increased in temperature; and therefore after two or
three hours had elapsed, the water in the cooler vessel was
found to have acquired greater buoyancy than that in the
warmer vessel, although at the commencement of the experi
ments the current indicated a greater degree of buoyancy in
the warmer water.                -

  We could hardly have anticipated more satisfactory results
than those of the above table. They show clearly that while
water at a temperature of 40°-905 is lighter than water at a
temperature of 37°368, water at 40°711 is heavier than water
at 37°317: in other words, that 39° 136 is above, whilst
39°014 is below the maximum point. By drawing a curve
from the results, we find that the exact point of maximum
density indicated by the above series of observations is
39°-102.
   During the next series of observations the temperature of
the laboratory was about 41°, which occasioned a gradual in
crease of the temperatures of both vessels.

    We now proceeded to apply a severer test to our method.
 In the next series of experiments we arranged matters so that
 the temperature of the water in one vessel was only a degree
and a half higher than that of the other vessel. The expan
 sion of water increasing as the square of the temperature from
that of the maximum density, it was obvious that the current
in the trough would be much more feeble than in the former
experiments. We therefore allowed the vessels to be in per
fect repose for six minutes before we introduced the glass
ball, and we afterwards watched its motion for four or five
minutes.

   Although in the different series of observations there are
several irregular results, there is on the whole sufficient con
sistency among them to enable us to receive 39°1, the mean
of the four sets of observations, as the actual point of maxi
mum density. We think it highly probable that this tem
  erature is within one-hundredth of a degree of the truth:
it º            cannot be more than one-twentieth of a degree in
error. We were prevented by the mildness of the season
from extending the experiments further, but we doubt not
that by repeating them more frequently we should be able to
bring the determination of the point to any required degree
of accuracy. . The result arrived at by Despretz from a very
extensive series of experiments, with an apparatus similar to
that employed by Hope, is 39°176*, which agrees very well

   We believe that our new method may be applied with great
advantage to a variety of interesting problems. , One of the
most important of these applications is the determination
of the dilatation of glass bulbs by heat, which, though for
merly presenting great practical difficulties, can now be ac
complished in the most simple and decisive manner. The
bulb has only to be filled with pure water and reduced suc
cessively to two temperatures, one as much above as the
other is below the point of maximum density—the rise of the
liquid in the stem of course indicates the contraction of the
glass in passing from the higher to the lower temperature.
The expansion of the glass bulbs being thus accurately ascer
tained, they may be advantageously applied in determining
the dilatations of solutions and other liquids.
    XII. On a peculiar Organ found in the Rays (Raia, Cuv.).
        *- : *      By M. LE DR. C.H. Robin *.                  -            -
THERE exists upon each side of the tail of the Rays an
     organ which is not mentioned in any of the works which I
have hitherto been able to consult. This apparatus however de
serves, on more than one account, to attract the attention of
physiologists, and probably of physicists also.                     *
   The two organs united form nearly the third of the entire bulk
of the tail of the Rays. The bulk of each, at its largest part, is in
one of these fishes of an average size, nearly that of the index-finger.
Their origin is towards the union of the first and second quarter
of the caudal appendage of the Rays, and they terminate in a point.
at the extremity of the latter. Their anterior extremity is soft
and more or less slender, according to different individuals: it
swells gradually as far as the middle of the tail of these fishes i.
the volume remains the same as far as the origin of the posterior
quarter, whence it diminishes finally to the end.         This organ is
at first almost cylindrical, though a little flattened on the sides.
(to about the extent of the anterior quarter); in the whole of
that part it is enveloped by several thin and concentric muscular
layers. These muscles soon terminate in as many aponeurotic
layers; the organ then becomes subcutaneous, and at the same
time its form changes, becoming round externally and flattened

it adheres, presents the form-of an elongated fusiform body,
swollen in the centre, more or lessiblunt at the extremity, and
always flattened upon its internal'surface. Tº coºl,

    The tissue of this organ has the semitransparency of gelatine,
but more consistence, and its colour is a clear translucid gray.
It is furnished with a general fibrous envelope, which adheres to -
the adjoining tissues by aponeurotic membranous layers ranged '<U+017F>

    I have already said that its anterior portion was completely
surrounded by some concentric muscular layers, and then that lº
it became subcutaneous in its three posterior quarters, for theº
greatest part of its surface. I add, by way of more detail, that its :
internal surface alone is not subcutaneous, and is separated from -
the vertebral column by the two long muscular and tendmous a
bundles intended to move the caudal vertebrae. Its upper mar-i-
 gin is traversed by a large subcutaneous vein, a branch of theº
lateral vessel; its external surface is traversed by the lateral vessel º
itself, which is accompanied by the lateral nerve. This nerve is a
 situated betweeen the organ and the skin, throughout the wholes
 length of the subcutaneous portion.                            p   :      * tº ºf
    After these details on the relations of this apparatus with the
 adjacent organs,—relations, moreover, common to all the species
 of Rays, I proceed to make known the teature of the tissues
 peculiar to this organ and the distribution of its vessels and its
 nerves. For this purpose I shall adopt a comparative course,'
 that is to say, at each step I shall refer to the relations of this ºn
 organ with those which most resemble it in other fishes.               - ºn
    On examining attentively the apparatus in question, we ob-tº
 serve that its substance does not constitute an uniform gelatinous"
 mass, but that it is divided into a large number of polygonal
flattened discs by the partitions of cellular tissue. These discs
 have consequently two surfaces larger than the rest, one turned
 forwards, the other backwards. With respect to the faces of the
 circumference, they are in number three, four or five, which gives
 the discs atriangular, tetragonal or pentagonal form; their small- ºr
 est diameter measures the thickness of the dise, which is 1 mil
 limetre in nearly all the species. The diameter of the large sur
 faces, which measures the height of the disc, is 2 mill., one more
 in the Raia rubus and R. batis, and 3 to 4 mill. in the Raia cla
 vata.        -                                 , ºr
    From this difference it follows, in the greatest diameter of the

          M. Robin on a peculiar Organ found in the Rays.         49
 discs according to the species, that in a transverse section of
 the organ, from eleven to fifteen discs are counted in a R, clavata,
 and twenty to twenty-five in the R. rubus and the R. batis. The
 volume of the discs increases with age and the size of the indivi
 duals, but their number does not appear to increase.
    These gelatinous discs are piled up one upon another, in the
 direction of the length of the apparatus, by the adherence of
 their broad faces, with the interposition nevertheless of a thin
 cellular partition. These longitudinal rows of discs are arranged
 side by side, reunited by a cellular partition thicker than that
 which separates each disc from that which follows or precedes it.
 The kinds of longitudinal columns represented by the piled-up
 discs are not rectilinear and do not all follow the length of one
 of the faces of the apparatus; but they are more or less contorted,
 and are interrupted at intervals. The interruptions proceed from
 the discs becoming at intervals irregular, more narrow, and the
 series of discs terminates ordinarily in a very small, triangular
one. It follows from these anatomical arrangements, that on the
 surface of the organ we may perceive one of the small faces of
each of the superficial discs, and study very regularly the elon
 gated, quadrilateral or lozenge-shaped polygonal, sometimes hex
agonal form which it assumes in consequence of the reciprocal
pressure which it undergoes from the adjoining discs. We may
 moreover very easily perceive that when the discs of a series
begin to lose their form and are interrupted, there exist at the
 side other irregular discs which commence a new series. It is to
be remarked also that the discs are ranged more regularly on the
internal surface of the apparatus in the Raia rubus and R. batis
than in the Raia clavata; in the first two species we also observe
on the internal surface of the organ, that one of the partitions
which separates the series of discs on the internal surface, follows
its whole length and is of greater thickness than the rest: it is
formed by glistening aponeurotic fibres, and it forms a sort of
longitudinal pile into which the vessels and the nerves penetrate.
    With respect to the gelatinous substance of the discs, mag
nified 400 diameters, it is seen to be hollowed out by cavities,
and the walls of the latter are hollowed by cavities gradually
lessening in size. The substance too which circumscribes these
areolae (to which we shall recur hereafter) is hyaline, homogeneous
and transparent; it is studded with extremely fine molecular
granules. From one spot to another are very regular granular
spheres of Omill:0050, surrounded by a very pale circular mass of
granules similar to the preceding. It is impossible to recognise
veritable cellules with walls and nuclei, and it is easy to see that
the preceding areolae are not cellules; we shall soon speak of
their uses. On the margins of the discs, the homogeneous gela

tinous substance presents regularly undulated striae which it
would be impossible to take for fibres.
   At the point at which we are arrived, it is impossible not to
recognise a great analogy between the semitransparent gelatinous
substance which essentially constitutes the discs of the peculiar
organ of the Rays, and that of the prisms of the apparatus of the
Torpedo, the rhomboidal meshes of the Silurus electricus, and
those interrupted ones between the transversal and vertical fibrous
laminae of the Gymnotus.
   Although there may be differences in form between the discs
of the organ of the tail of the Rays and those which constitute
the prisms of the electrical apparatus of the Torpedo, these dif
ferences are certainly less considerable than those of the portions
of gelatinous substance circumscribed by the partitions and
areolae of the apparatus in the Silurus and Gymnotus, which
however produce similar effects to those of the Torpedo.
   The mode of arrangement of these discs is as regular in the
Ray as in the Torpedo, and approximate much nearer to the
latter than to that of the same parts in the apparatus of the
Silurus and Gymnotus.
   The nerves of this apparatus originate in the portion of the
spinal marrow which is prolonged into the caudal vertebrae. I
have an object in view in remarking that this portion of the
spinal marrow must be composed of sensitive and motive nervous
fibres, for it corresponds to the portion called cauda equina in the
higher animals.
   The nervous roots which originate from this organ do not take
their rise together at the same level, but there springs alternately
an anterior and a posterior root. It is always from the anterior
one (before its anastomosis with the posterior) that the greatest
number of nerves which exist in the apparatus proceed; lastly,
 some issue from the ganglion and the lowest branch of the two
which proceed from it. These nerves are of the number of four
to seven for each nervous pair. They are, as is seen, very nume
rous, and their diameter is from 3 to 4 millimetre. These nerves
are finally distributed in the thickness of the partitions which
separate the lateral muscles from the tail, when they penetrate
into the organ, after being more or less subdivided. In the Raia
rubus and R. batis the greatest number penetrate into the longi
tudinal pile of the internal surface; in the Raia clavata they pe
netrate into some one of the partitions of that surface. In these
three species several branches wind round the superior and infe
rior margins of the apparatus to penetrate into one of the parti
tions of its subcutaneous portion. In the first two species these
superficial branches freely amastomose before penetrating.
   It results from these facts that a considerable number of nerves

           M. Robin on a peculiar Organ found in the Rays.         51
  extend into the partitions of each series of discs infinitely subdi
  viding. From these subdivisions part the filaments which pene
  trate between the partition which separates each disc from that
  with which it is in contact. This filament expands opposite to
  the anterior face of each disc, but never does a single one pene
  trate into the substance of the disc. The nerves spread out on
  the internal surface of the partition between it and the disc. No
  single thread ever ramifies against the posterior face of the disc;
  we shall soon see that this surface receives only vessels,
     The elementary fibres of the nervous filaments have a double
  character; that is, they are true elementary nervous tubes tra
  versed by a semifluid substance which escapes in drops of variable
• forms from their extremities when torn across. [These observa
  tions however would require to be verified upon animals fresh
  captured. J
      The elementary tubes which spread out against the prism are
  from 0"-01 to 0:013, that is to say, half the diameter of the ele
  mentary tubes measured on the nerves at the point of their pe
  netration into the apparatus. The elementary nervous tubes do
  not terminate in a net-work, but actually in very large meshes,
  to effect which they fork out several times into two or three
  branches and anastomose by inosculation.                  -
      These facts rest on the clearest evidence, being easily proved
  even with a magnifying power of 100 diameters. The semifluid
   mervous substance contained in these elementary tubes may be
  made to flow out, and be seen to penetrate into each of their sub
  divisions and amastomoses.      These amastomotic terminations of
  the elementary nervous tubes have already been proved to exist
  by Savi, in his “Anatomical Investigation of the Torpedo (1844).”
   He has also proved this fact in the partitions which separate the
   discs of gelatinous substance of the electric apparatus of this
  fish.
      The last facts which I have just established exhibit a still
   greater analogy between the organ in question and the apparatus
   of the electric fishes. It is true that these nerves proceed from
   the termination of the spinal marrow, that is to say, from the
   cauda equina, but the same fact takes place in the Gymnotus, the
   most potent in its discharges of the electrical fishes, whose elec
   trical organs however, according to Hunter, do not receive a mass
   of nerves proportionably so considerable as those of the Torpedo.
   In the Ray, as in the Gymnotus, the mass of the nerves sent to
   the electric apparatus by each nervous pair, is at least as consi
   derable as those which they transmit to the skin and the muscles.
   The lateral nerve does not in the Ray, any more than in the
    Gymnotus, send any filament to the organ in question.

 52      M. Robin on a peculiar Organ found in the Rays.
 by Geoffroy St. Hilaire, M. Valenciennes, Rudolphi and Peters,
 proceed from the lateral nerve, a branch of the eighth pair.
     Thus there is nothing constant in the origin of the nerves of
 the electrical apparatus, as they proceed sometimes from the
 eighth and ninth pair (Torpedo), sometimes from the eighth pair
 alone (Silurus), sometimes from the pairs which arise from the
 spinal marrow (Gymnotus and Raia). Their situation has also
 no constancy, as they are sometimes situated towards the head
 (Torpedo), around the body (Silurus), and on each side of the
 tail (Gymnotus and Raia).
    The vessels of this organ are numerous and curiously arranged.
 Between the articulation of each vertebra there passes a vessel,
 alternately an artery and a vein, proceeding from the principal
 artery and vein of the tail. These two vessels never pass together
 to reach their foramina, and they never traverse the inferior spi
 mal apophyses, like the nerves, to issue from the spinal canal.
Beyond the vertebrae, the vessels follow the course of the nerves,
 and penetrate with them into the apparatus. Several branches
 ramify on its surface, surround it with their anastomoses, and
from the plexus which they form, some branches are detached,
destined either for the skin or the adjoining muscles.
    Those vessels which penetrate the thickness of the organ are
there subdivided infinitely in the partitions of connective tissue
which separate the discs from one another.
    From the plexus formed by the arterial and venous ramifica
tions capillaries are given off, which are directed towards the pos
terior face of the disc which is in front of them, and penetrate
into its substance. A capillary vessel never penetrates into the
anterior surface of a prism; but we have stated that the nerves -
ramify opposite to or against that surface. The capillaries which
penetrate the discs are very elegantly arranged in flexuous loops,
and are sometimes agglomerated in the form of tufts. These
loops and tufts are lodged and buried in the cavities by which
the disc is hollowed out; these excavations exist only on the pos
terior face of the discs, whilst the anterior face against which
the nerves are arranged is smooth. The capillaries which are
buried in the discs are from <U+017F>º to ºr of a millimetre in dia
meter.
    To sum up the matter, there exists in the Rays a pretty volu
minous organ, situated in the tail of that fish, as in that of the
Gymnotus. [From a letter which I have received from Prof. J.
Müller, Rüppell would appear to have described an organ ana
logous to the former in the tail of the fishes of the genus Mor
myrus.] This organ of the Rays receives fine but very numerous
nerves. It is formed of a gelatinous semitransparent and firm
matter, as in all the electrical organs known. This substance is,

                    Notices respecting New Books. "                        53
as in all these fishes, divided into polygonal discs, regularly piled
together, against which nerves ramify that terminate by succes
sive bifurcations and anastomoses supplied from their elementary
fibres. How can we help seeing in this an electrical apparatus?
It is true that its position is not the same as in the Torpedo, but
in the Gymnotus and the Silurus the organ is also situated in the
tail or around the body. These conclusions are further confirmed
by the following facts: I have proved that this apparatus is
wanting in the tail of the Torpedo and the genera Mustelus,
Scyllium, Squatina, Zygaena, Acanthias and Carcharias.
   The presence of this apparatus in the tail of the Rays explains
the immoderate proportional length of this organ, its flattened
form beneath, and the absence of the inferior lobe on the caudal
fin, which scarcely exists in the Rays. The anal fin is also want
ing in the Rays, it is also wanting in the Torpedos; but all these
fishes have a complete caudal fin, whereas it is wanting in the
Rays, as I have just observed.
   I am indebted to the kindness of M. Bibron for being enabled
to ascertain that the other fishes allied to the Rays (Cephaloptera,
Myliobates and Pastinacus) whose tail is terminated by a thin
and extended whip or prolongation, do not possess this apparatus.
The whip is formed .# a portion of the tail, which the electrical
apparatus would occupy if it existed.
   As we have just seen, this organ cannot be regarded as a
gland, for it has not the structure of one; it does not possess an
excretory duct, it does not communicate in any part with the in
side, and no gland receives so many nerves of animal life”.

Alºgº.               the idea embodied in the publication before us is
       not here met with for the first time, yet it will probably have
all the attraction of novelty for the general public, since we believe
that the work on which it is founded is not very extensively known
in this country. To those who know the Physische Atlas of Dr.
Berghaus, it will be a great gratification to find that the design has
been appreciated by the able editor of the National Atlas, and that
he has succeeded in obtaining the assistance, not only of Dr. Berg

   * Nevertheless the proof of its being an electrical organ must depend
upon its power of giving electric shocks. Such a property, in our common

after their capture.—Ed.

the results of which it comprehends, in the endeavour to produce a
British Physical Atlas the execution of which shall be worthy of
the grand generalizations on which it is based.
   The advantages which attend this mode of conveying information it
is scarcely necessary to enlarge upon ; it has all the simplicity of a ta
bular arrangement, without that bare abstract quality which leaves to
the mind no connecting links, no means of association, and demands
a distinct effort of memory for every fact; while with the majority of
persons the pictorial form of a map makes a peculiar kind of impres
sion, which can be reproduced at pleasure in the consciousness, and
becomes a ground on which the several facts may be retraced. The
good effect that must result from the more accurate knowledge thus
attainable by the “uninitiated" of the vast extent of the complex
details which are necessary to the evolution of the simplest genera
lizations, will be at once admitted on looking abroad upon the crude
speculations which are so hastily grasped in the daily increasing
desire for knowledge of the deeper mysteries of mature.      A man who
has carefully and patiently studied these maps and pondered over
the multitude of “experimental truths” on which the simplest of
them depends, will probably pause ere he accepts cosmical theories
which find their materials in popular “abstracts.”          Not that we
undervalue the speculative faculty; but it is evident that the depart
ment of observation and experiment is that to which those inquirers
should restrict themselves, whose opportunities or inclinations pre
vent their acquiring a comprehensive knowledge of the subjects by
which they are attracted.
   To such persons this Atlas will be exceedingly valuable, as indi
cating the precise state of our information in regard to the facts, and
thus pointing out to them where their labours may be most usefully
directed. To the general student it will convey clearly and agree
ably a mass of that knowledge which is daily becoming more neces
sary to him. To the rising generation, in whose education these
subjects cannot well be neglected, where any pretension is made to
keep pace with the intellectual progress of the times, these maps will
throw new and powerful interest into the study of geography, lead
ing not merely to the knowledge of relative position and political or
other artificial divisions, but to an appreciation of the natural rela
tions, regarded either in a scientific or occonomic point of view, of the
various regions to each other, and a comprehension of the grand
unity of this our terrestrial world, where each part is, as it were,
complementary to all the rest.
   In the execution of this design the various subjects are arranged
under the two general heads of the phaenomena of Inorganic and
Organic nature; the former comprehending three subdivisions,—1.
Meteorology and Magnetism; 2. Hydrology, and 3. Geology; the
latter nominally two, viz. Phytology and Zoology; but apparently
under the latter head we must include Ethnology, since among
the maps already published we find an Ethnographic map of the
British Islands.
   Five parts of the work are now before us, which, according to the

                    Notices respecting New Books.                    55
prospectus, form half of the contemplated series. Each part con
tains three maps; and as these are not published in any regular ar
rangement, they are sufficiently varied to give a good idea of the
intentions of the editors. The following is a summary view of the
published maps.
   Part I.-1. A Physical Chart of the Atlantic Ocean; 2. a map of
the Mountain Systems of Europe; 3. map and elevations illustra
ting the Distribution of Plants.    In the first will be found, in addi
tion to the usual peculiarities of charts, such as distances, currents,
&c., the temperature at different points, the situation and form of
Fucus banks and the appearances of volcanic action, with the exist
ing statistics of icebergs and doubtful islands, and the tracks com
monly followed by navigators. The various phaenomena are briefly
described in the accompanying letter-press, as much as possible of
the information being tabulated. The most striking feature of the
second map is the application of the system of contour lines, with
out which indeed all plane representations of elevated tracts are but
very vague. In the third map are embodied Schouw's phyto-geo
graphic labours, together with statistical information of Humboldt
and other travellers.
   Part II.-1. The distribution of part of the Mammalia; 2. a
Hyetographic map of the world; 3. the River systems of Europe
and Asia. The first includes a view of the range of four mammife
rous families, viz. the Quadrumana, Marsupialia, Edentata and Pa
chydermata; the types of these families being represented pictorially
for the benefit of those unacquainted with scientific classification.
The Hyetographic or Rain map is an attempt to indicate, by various
degrees of shading, the relative amount of rain falling in different
districts; it is accompanied by a quantity of statistical tables of
great value. This map has a peculiarly novel appearance; and the
contrasts obtained by means of the shading are very striking; the
great deserts and the rainless districts of South America, so graphi
cally described by Mr. Darwin in his journal, standing out strangely
in their whiteness from the dark regions near the equator. The
River systems are arranged so as to display the great basins of the
two continents and course of the rivers, thus forming a kind of Sup
plement to the view of the mountain chains. The description in
cludes hydrographic tables, &c.
   Part III.-1. Glaciers and glacial phaenomena; 2. distribution
of Carnivora; 3. Physical Chart of the Pacific. The first map has
been compiled from the researches of Forbes, Raymond, Charpentier,
Weiss, &c. This is accompanied by a descriptive treatise by Prof.
J. D. Forbes, giving a detailed account of the European glaciers,
founded on his own extensive researches.       Those of South America,
described by Captain King and Mr. Darwin, are also noticed, and
the glaciers of Sir James Ross's great south polar continent. In
addition to the general distribution of the Carnivora, the second
sheet contains a map of the regions of the northern whale and seal
fisheries, and those inhabited by fur-bearing animals. The Chart of
the Pacific resembles that of the Atlantic, containing of course many
peculiar points of interest.

56                     Notices respecting New Books.
   Part IV.-1. Phaenomena of Volcanic action; 2. Rain map of
Europe; 3. distribution of Reptiles. The first of these is enriched
by a collection of small but very important special maps of the most
celebrated volcanic districts. On the general chart are given the
lines of direction of the most important earthquakes of which we
have records, and a view of the various volcanic regions. Among
the small maps are Iower Italy and the Greek islands, according to
Von Buch; the Sandwich Islands, &c., by Fitzroy; Iceland after
Krug von Nidda, &c. The accompanying table gives the various
statistics of height, date of eruption, &c. of all the volcanoes of
which these particulars have been obtained. In the Hyetographic
map the points receiving equal annual amounts of rain are united by
a system of curved lines called Isohyetoses, analogous to the isother
mal lines of Humboldt; also isotherombroses or curves indicating
the distribution of summer rains; the annual number of rainy or
snowy days, depth of fall, &c., and the direction of the rain winds.
In this map Europe is divided into three regions:—the province of
winter rains, comprehending part of the southern portion; of autumn
rains, including the remainder of the southern and western portions;
the summer rains belong to the whole interior of the continent.
The limits of these regions are of course only approximative.                      In the
distribution of reptiles there are separate sections for the Testudines,
 Sauria and Batrachia; the Ophidians have two, one for the innocuous
 species, and another for the venomous.                                     -
    Part V.—1. Distribution of Birds; 2. mountain chains of North
America; 3, Ethnographic map of Great Britain and Ireland. The
distribution of Birds includes a general map of the world divided into
sixteen provinces, and a map for Europe regarded as a single pro
vince. The second map contains, besides the mountain chains of the
North American continent, a map of the Island of Trinidad and
Humboldt's plan of the volcano of Jorulla. The Ethnographic map
is the result of an endeavour to lay down, as far as the present con
dition of our knowledge will admit, the distribution of the various
races by which our islands have been peopled. This is an attempt
of acknowledged difficulty, since in a country which has attained a
high degree of civilization, the intermixture of the elements which
must have taken place necessarily leads to great uncertainty. The
general conclusions to which the author of the map (the late Dr.
Gustav Kombst) had arrived are as follows: there are five sub
varieties of the Celtic variety, and eight of the Teutonic; and the
following is a probable average calculation of the ethnographic blood
of the population of Great Britain and Ireland.

   The Physical Atlas contains all the elements of success, high in
terest in the subject matter, as we have shown, and this brought
forward in a manner well-worthy of it. The size of the maps is
imperial folio, each of the maps occupying a sheet; the engraving and
colouring are beyond all praise for their beauty and clearness. The
enterprize which has produced this work at such a moderate price
calls for extensive patronage, and the care of its execution fully de
serves it. We feel bound, both in justice to the editors and our
readers, to give it our warmest recommendations.                                        -
Introduction to Zoology for the Use of Schools. By R. PATTERson,
    Vice-Pres, of the Nat. Hist. Soc. of Belfast. 12mo. London 1846.
   We cordially recommend to the notice of our readers this valuable
little work by Mr. Patterson, who is well known to have long and
energetically endeavoured to introduce the study of natural history
into the ordinary course of general education. His great attain
ments as a naturalist well qualify him for the task which he has un
dertaken; and we feel sure that the publication of this volume will
greatly tend to promote his highly desirable object.
   In the present publication, which is profusely illustrated by wood
engravings, he treats of the Invertebrate animals, but proposes to
continue the subject in a future volume on the Vertebrata. We have
here in small space a very complete introduction to the study of the
interesting tribes upon which it treats detailed in simple and popular
language, so as to be intelligible to persons who have not made na
tural history a study; but at the same time there is nothing in it of
what is vulgarly called “popular science,” every part being of a truly
scientific character.   It is well fitted to be placed in the hands of
the young, and highly deserving of perusal by the accomplished
naturalist.
   We wish him every success in his laudable endeavour.

   The author enters into fuller details than he had done in his
former communication to the Society, which was read on the 18th
of June, respecting the construction of the instrument, the prepa
ration of the highly sensitive photographic paper employed in the
process, and the minute adjustments necessary for ensuring accuracy
in registering the results.

additions to the same apparatus which registers the magnetic varia
tions.
   W. R. Grove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., delivered the Bakerian Lecture
—“On certain Phenomena of Voltaic Ignition, and on the Decompo
sition of Water into its constituent Gases by heat.”
   The author refers to an eudiometer, an account of which was
published by him in the “Philosophical Magazine’ for 1840, formed
of a glass tube, into the closed extremity of which a loop of plati
num wire was sealed. The gases to be analysed were mixed in this
tube with a given volume of oxygen and hydrogen, and detonated
or slowly combined by the voltaic ignition of the platinum wire.
He was thence led to try a further set of experiments on the analysis,
by this instrument, of such gases and vapours as are decomposable
by heat; the process being capable of much greater exactness than
the received one of passing them through ignited tubes. The re
sults of the analyses of several gases by this means are given in the
paper. When carbonic acid and hydrogen are mixed in equal
volumes and exposed to the ignited wire, the hydrogen abstracts
oxygen from the carbonic acid, and leaves carbonic oxide. Con
versely, when carbonic oxide is exposed over water to the ignited
wire, it abstracts oxygen from the aqueous vapour, and forms car
bonic acid.
   It thus appeared, that provided there were bodies present capable
 of absorbing by affinity the elements of water, ignited platinum
would either compose or decompose water. The author was thence
led to hope that he might by ignited platinum decompose water into
its constituents, without absorption by other bodies, and thus pro
duce converse effects to those already known. In this he ultimately
succeeded by various methods, in some of which the ignition was
produced by electrical means; in others by ordinary calorific pro
cesses, such as the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, &c.
   A platinum wire is ignited at the closed extremity of a species of
tube retort, full of pure water, and having a narrowed neck close
above the wire; as soon as the wire becomes incandescent, it forms
around itself an atmosphere of vapour which it immediately decom
poses; a natural valve being formed by the conflict of ascending
gas and descending water, the bubbles of mixed gas are cut off by
an intermittent action, and thus, as their recombination is prevented,
a volume of gas collects in the bend of the tube and is ultimately

expelled at its orifice. If, again, a button of platinum be fully ignited
by the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and plunged into water previously
heated to nearly its boiling-point, bubbles of mixed gas ascend and
may be collected by an inverted tube. The electrical spark is shown
to be capable of decomposing aqueous vapour, and various other
modes of producing the same results are given.
   Some theoretical views are then advanced as to the spheroidal
state which appears to the author to be intermediate between that
of ebullition and decomposition; as to the probable non-existence
of water or steam in the interior of the earth, and as to the antago
mism between physical repulsion and chemical affinity.
   In a supplementary paper, the author considers how far catalysis
affects the phenomenon, and regards the decomposition thus pro
duced as presenting a parallel effect produced by the force of heat,
to that known to be produced by electricity; he considers it expla
natory of the decomposition of water by the electrical spark as in
the experiments of Pearson and Wollaston. Some further expe
riments are given, in which iridium and osmium and silica are sub
stituted for platinum; and also some experiments on the liquids
bromine and chloride of iodine, both of which yield pure oxygen
when exposed to the ignited wire in Mr. Grove's apparatus. These
last experiments cannot however be long continued in consequence
of these liquids ultimately attacking both the glass and the platinum.
In conclusion, the author calls attention to the general evolution of
permanent gas from all liquids, except the metals, when exposed to
intense heat,

and Primitive Formation of the Earth. By Henry Hennessy, Esq.
Communicated by Major North Ludlow Beamish, K.H., F.R.S.
   The author's investigations of the figure of the earth proceed on
the hypothesis of its having, originally been a heterogeneous fluid
mass, possessing only such general properties as those which have
been established for fluids; and independently of the supposition,
with which the theory has generally been complicated, that the vo
lume of the entire mass, and the law of the density of the fluid, have
suffered no change in consequence of the solidification of a part of
that fluid. ' Assuming the figure of the mass to be an ellipsoid of
revolution, the author obtains general analytical expressions for its
ellipticity, and for the variation of gravity at its surface. He gives
a general sketch of the consequences that may result from the im
proved hypothesis of the primitive figure of the earth, to physical
geology, that is, to the changes occurring upon the external crust of
the earth during the process of its solidification, resulting both from
calorific and chemical changes taking place among its different parts,
and giving rise to a process of circulation throughout the fluid por
tions of the mass.
   The present memoir is only the first of a series which the author
announces it is his intention to communicate to the Society on the
same subject.

              Note on the First Comet of Brorsen, by Mr. Hind.
      “The comet discovered by Mr. Brorsen at Kiel, on the 26th of
 February last, has been found to have an elliptical orbit with a pe
  riod of 5% years only. Independent calculations by Dr. Brünnow,
  M. Goujon, and myself, have led to nearly the same results as
  regards the short time of revolution. This circumstance induced
 me to examine the path of the comet through our system more mi
 nutely.         Assuming the last set of elements calculated by Dr.
 Brünnow, and published in No. 557 of the Astronomische Nach

                          Royal Astronomical Society.                                             61
richten, I soon found that a very close approach to the planet Ju
piter must have occurred about the 20th of May 1842: the comet
at this time would be hardly further distant from Jupiter than the
mean distance of his fourth satellite. The action of the planet
would be more than ten times greater than that of the Sun; and it
is very possible that a complete change might be produced in the
elements of the comet's orbit.                  This encounter took place rather
to the south of the plane of the ecliptic, in about 283}” heliocentric
longitude.”
                        Peters's Comet (26th June 1846).
   On the 26th of June, Dr. C. H. F. Peters, of the Observatory
of Capodimonte, found a very small comet in the constellation
Scorpius, near 595 Mayer, and about one degree to the south of
the nebula H. vi. 19, or 535 of Smyth's Cycle. The new object
was quite as pale as the nebula, and somewhat rounder.                              The mo
tion was perceptible at the end of an hour, when Dr. Peters com
menced his observations with the equatorial of Reichenbach. These
were continued on following nights till stopped by moonlight. The
following are the results corrected for refraction:—                              a<U+017F>

Peters believes them to be near the truth; still they give from day.
to day considerable anomalies, when compared with the observations.

   “A few minutes before 4 o'clock on the morning of October 19,
a very faint telescopic comet was discovered here, with the large re
fractor. It was just bright enough to bear a slight illumination
sufficient to render visible the thick wires of the micrometer.    By
observations extending over rather more than one hour, or until day
break put a stop to them, the comet was found to have a direct mo
tion in right ascension, of about four minutes in time daily, and a
southerly motion in declination of about eleven minutes. Every
night for three weeks afterwards was cloudy when the comet was
above our horizon, and the observations of October 18 are, there
fore, all we have been able to procure. Mr. Petersen, M. Rümker,
and Mr. Brorsen, though immediately apprised of the discovery by
Prof. Schumacher, have had no better success, owing to the overcast
sky. The comet was compared instrumentally with 3 Leonis, for an
approximate position, and subsequently, by means of a wire micro
meter, with a star of the 9th magnitude.

   The telescope is by Dollond, 5 feet focal length, and mounted on
an universal equatorial stand, which mounting is not, however, so well
adapted to high as to low latitudes. The telescope is a pretty good
one, but shows rather large discs; hence Capt. Jacob has found no
advantage in employing a higher power than 152. With this power
he can generally measure angles of position when the stars are 1".5
apart. The distances are not to be much relied upon, as “little can
be done in that department without clockwork.” More than half
the stars are taken from Smyth's Cycle, the remainder are such as
are too far south to be seen in England. Many of these, though
discovered by Capt. Jacob, will probably be found in the forthcoming

on Bisulphu RET, TERSULPHURET, AND SULPHocyANURET OF
               METHYLE.        B.Y. M. AUGUSTE CAHOURS.
   The first-named compound is obtained with equal facility by pass
ing a current of chloromethylic gas into an alcoholic solution of bi
sulphuret of potassium, or by distilling a mixture of the concentrated
solutions of bisulphuret of potassium and sulphomethylate of lime. In
both cases a slightly yellow limpid liquid is obtained, which begins
to boil at 230° to about 234°F., its boiling-point reaching from 320°
to 338° F.
   If the alkaline sulphuret employed be very pure, the greater part of
the liquid distils between 230° and 248° F. By separating this
product, drying it over chloride of calcium and submitting it to one
or two rectifications, a definite liquid is obtained which boils between
 241° and 245°F. : this is the bisulphuret of methyle. When pure it
is a colourless liquid, perfectly limpid, refracting light powerfully,
and possessing an intolerable and persistent odour of onions. Its
density is 1.046 at 64°4 F. It is scarcely soluble in water, but
nevertheless imparts to it its peculiar smell: alcohol and aether com
bine with it in all proportions. On the approach of an ignited body
it inflames and burns with a blue flame, yielding a strong smell of
sulphurous acid.                                                      -
   Chlorine acts powerfully on this compound: there is at first

formed an amber-coloured substance, which crystallizes in rhombic
tables possessing much lustre. These crystals are soon destroyed,
and are replaced by a yellowish liquid, which eventually becomes of
a ruby-red colour; by continuing the action there are obtained
chloride of sulphur S Cl”, and perchloride of sulphuret of methyle
 C4 C15 S.
    Bromine also acts, upon this body, forming products derived from
substitution.                                 -
    Very dilute nitric acid has no sensible action in the cold on bisul
phuret of methyle; but it is different when it is moderately dilute. In
this case the action is extremely vivid; sulphuric acid is produced,
and also a peculiar acid, which forms with potash a salt that cry
stallizes in long asbestiform needles, and with barytes a salt which
crystallizes in colourless tables and possessing much splendour. It
 also forms with strontia, lime, and the oxide of lead salts which are
soluble and crystallizable. Sulphuric acid when concentrated com
bines with it in the cold, and decomposes it when heated. .
    When heated in a retort with a concentrated solution of potash, it
distils without appearing to undergo any alteration;, when submitted
 to analysis it appeared to be composed of—

    The density of the vapour of this substance, taking the mean of
two experiments, was found to be 3:298; and the author observes
that, supposing the molecule of this compound to give two volumes
of vapour, the density would be 3-259.                                 1. * * *
    Tersulphuret of Methyle.--When bisulphuret of potassium is re
placed by the persulphuret in forming the above compound, a con

towards the end, and at the temperature of about 396°F., an amber
coloured product distils, which contains more sulphur, and which
acts with chlorine and nitric acid in the same manner.
  The high boiling-point of this substance, and the slight alteration
which it undergoes by heat, prevented the author from ascertaining
the density of its vapour. Analysis showed that it was a tersul
phuret of methyle.

       The preparation of this product is difficult on account of the
  bumping of the liquid, which sometimes comes over.” It must be
  heated slowly, and the retort should be ten times larger than required
  to contain the liquid.                             -                        -
       Sulphocyanuret of methyle, after it has been purified by digestion
  over chloride of calcium and rectification, has the following proper
 ties: it is a colourless and very limpid liquid; it has an alliaceous
 odour; its vapouris unpleasant and it stupefies; it boils steadily at
 about 270°F. Its density is 1*115 at about 61°F. Water dissolves
  a very small portion, but it nevertheless acquires its odour; it com
 bines with alcohol and aether in all proportions.                                        -
       In diffused light chlorine acts very slowly upon it, producing fine
 crystals of chloride of cyanogen; and at the same time there is
 formed a large quantity of a heavy yellow oil, which solidifies when
 in contact with ammonia.                                                -        -
       Potash scarcely acts upon it in the cold. A solution when heated
 decomposes it, and there are formed ammonia and bisulphuret of
 methyle; the residue contains cyanuret of potassium and carbonate
 of potash.                     ** * *
      Solution of ammonia alters it readily, giving rise to a brown sub

of this mineral from them.
   The method of analysis which he adopted was the following:—he
reduced the mineral to fine powder, calcined it to determine the
water, and fused the residue with four times its weight of soda at a
red heat; it was then treated with boiling water, and the remaining
oxide of copper was weighed after heating to redness. The phos
phoric acid was afterwards ascertained by deficiency, after having
ascertained the absence of the oxides of iron and manganese in the
oxide of copper, as well as of alumina and manganic acid in the alka
line solution.                                                       -
   The libethenite of Tagilsk yielded 65.89 oxide of copper, 28-61
phosphoric acid, 5:50 water. These results differ a little from those
obtained by M. Kühn, 66.94 oxide of copper, 29:44 phosphoric
acid, 4-01 water; and also from those of Berthier,-63-9 oxide of
copper, 28.7 phosphoric acid, and 7.4 water.
   Dihydrite (prismatic phosphate of copper) yielded 68.2 oxide of
copper, 25.3 phosphoric acid, 6'28–6:69 water.                      Arfwedson ob
tained nearly the same results with a phosphate from Rheinbreiten
bach.                              -

   The analyses of Klaproth, Kühn and Lunn differ much from those
of M. Hermann; it would appear that Lunn analysed a different
mineral.                        -
    Under the name of ellite another phosphate of copper has been
described; it is found at Ehl, near Rheinbreitenbach.                    M. Hermann
found a specimen from Tagilsk to consist of oxide of copper 66'86,
phosphoric acid 23:14, water 10:00; he describes, under the name
of tagilithe, an earthy phosphate of copper found at Tagilsk, on hy
 drate of iron, in the form of mammillated or spongy deposits.                       Its
specific gravity is about 3:50.             It dissolves in acids without giving
out any gas.
    The trombolite is another phosphate of copper found at Tagilsk;
it has already been described by M. Plattner; it is remarkable for
its conchoidal fracture; it was found to consist of 39-2 oxide of
copper, 41.0 phosphoric acid, 16-8 water. M. Hermann has disco
vered the phenakite in granite to the west of Lake Ilmen, at some
versts from Miask, accompanied with topaze and bluish stilbite.—

     Its hardness is that of fluor spar; its lustre is between vitreous
 and greasy. Its density is 2:72. It fuses below the melting-point
 of glass, without yielding a trace of water. Heated in an open
 tube, it evinces the action of hydrofluoric acid. It fuses readily with
 borax and a phosphate, giving colourless glasses. When mixed with
 sulphuric acid, the powdered mineral disengages much hydrofluoric
 acid. 'Carbonate of ammonia precipitates pure alumina from the so

             PURIFICATION of MERCURY.                 By M. MILLON. . . . .
    Mercury may be perfectly purified by agitating it for a consider
able time with weak nitric acid. With two pounds of the metal,
about an ounce and a half of the acid diluted with twice its volume
of water may be employed. The mercury freed from the nitrate thus
formed is to be boiled with pure nitric acid sufficient to dissolve
about nine-tenths of the metal; the resulting nitrate of mercury is
to be reduced to red oxide by heat, and this is to be calcined in a
porcelain retort to reduce it.
    By the action of the first portion of nitric acid the more oxidable
metals are acted upon; the second portion of acid leaves the metals"
less oxidable than mercury in the undissolved portion.                      *    :          tº 4
    As the mercury reduced by this process dissolves a notable quan-º
tity of oxide, this last is to be separated by agitation with sulphuric
acid ; it is afterwards to be washed with a very large quantity of
water, and dried in the receiver of the air-pump over sulphuric acid.
Mercury thus purified was employed by M. Regnault in his third
determination of its density. tº                     z º.º.º.º. º. ºr
   M. Millon states that when a saline solution, such as chloride of

calcium, hydrochlorate of ammonia,          Fº           of potash, &c. is added
to mercury in a bottle, the mercury is always divided into rounded
globules, which remain separated from each otherifor<U+017F>ailong time;
but what is very striking is, that the size of the globules, which
varies enormously, is always connected with the nature of the aqueous
solution. Some solutions immediately cause extreme division in the
mercury; others, on the contrary, produce only very large globules,
to whatever extent, the agitation may have been carried; and the
same effect is always produced with the same solution. It is to this
influence of saline solutions that is due the difficulty often witnessed
in collecting mercury when it has been reduced in the moist way.

       GENTLEMEN,
                          Royal Observatory, Greenwich, Jan. 15, 1847.
  IN the Notes    to the second edition of the History of the
     Inductive Sciences, Dr. Whewell has (with my consent)
 referred to experiments, made by me and described by me at
 a meeting of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, tending to
 invalidate the conclusions drawn by Sir David Brewster in a
 paper headed “On a New Analysis of Solar Light, indicating
 three Primary Colours, forming Coincident Spectra of equal
 length,” which is printed in the twelfth volume of the Edin
 burgh Transactions. I think it therefore incumbent on me
 to give to the public the best account that I am now able to
 give of these experiments. The reason of the partial imper
 fection of the account is the following. I never drew up in
 writing any orderly statement either of the experiments or of
 the reasoning connected with them. I had the pencil notes,
 written each at the instant of making an experiment; and from
 these notes, or rather from the strong recollection of every
 experiment detailed in the notes, I made my oral statement
 (as far as the mere experimental facts were concerned) to the
 Cambridge Philosophical Society. These notes I have mis
 laid, and in consequence I am unable to give details on the
 names and combinations of the different absorbing substances
 which I employed. But upon the method, upon the results,
and upon the reasonings, my recollection is as perfect as it
was on the days on which the experiments were made. Ha
ving premised this, I shall give my statement in the same order
in which I gave it (in the year 1833, I believe) to the Cam
bridge Philosophical Society.

74.     The Astronomer Royal on Sir David Brewster's
    First, then, I remark that, supposing Sir David Brewster's
alleged experimental facts to be placed beyond doubt, the infer
ence as to the three colours is exceedingly doubtful. It appears
certain that combinations of other colours might be made to
produce the apparent colours of the spectrum; and there
seems therefore to be no sufficient reason for selecting those
adopted by Sir David Brewster. It is quite proper that the
reader's attention should be called to this; for in consequence
of Sir David Brewster having given the details of his theory
in considerable extent before he gives the experiments, the
reader may be led to suppose that the experiments do actually
exhibit three such spectra as are implied in the title of the
paper. Those, however, who will enter into the minutiae of
the paper, will see that the experiments exhibit no such thing,
The simple facts which the experiments are supposed to ex
hibit are, that by the use of different absorbing media, certain
portions of the spectra undergo certain changes of colour.
And the only question which I am disposed to entertain is
this: Is it established that the colour of any portion of the
spectrum is changed by the use of any absorbing medium?
    My second remark applies to what I conceive to be one
possible cause of error in Sir David Brewster's experiment.
It does not appear from his paper that the spectrum in its
modified state was compared immediately with an unmodified
spectrum. Now I state unhesitatingly as my own belief, that
the eye has no memory for colours; and I have no confidence
in any evidence upon the change of colour, unless the colour
which is not altered and the colour in which change is sus
pected are placed side by side.
    Thirdly, I remark that it does not appear that care was
taken to exclude light coming to the eye from other sources.
Indeed, in an experiment of Sir William Herschel's, to which
Sir David Brewster refers, it is certain that there was a mix
ture of other light. When the spectrum was thrown upon clean
brass, “the colour of the brass made the red rays appear like
orange, and the orange colour was likewise different from what
it ought to be.” But on referring to Sir William Herschel's
paper, it will be seen that the spectrum was formed by a prism
placed in the upper part of an open window; and it is not
difficult to predict what must be the effect of the light coming
from all other parts of the window.
    I now proceed to describe the form in which my own ex
periments were made.
    The windows of my lecture-room were darkened by closing
all the shutters, the joints of which were almost absolutely
impervious to light. Through a hole in one shutter, a beam

                 New Analysis of Solar Light.            - -     75
of sun-light was thrown in a convenient direction by means of
an external reflector.    In front of this hole, but at a distance
sufficient to leave room for the insertion of any of my absorb
ing substances, was placed a metallic plate with a narrow slit
about two inches long and adjustable in width. The sun-light
passing through this slit was received upon a very good prism
placed with its axis parallel to the slit, at the distance of about
a foot; a large lens was placed in front of the prism, and by
means of this the rays diverging from the slit and falling on
the prism were made to converge, so as to form upon a paper
screen a very good spectrum, sufficiently pure to exhibit se
veral of the stronger Fraunhofer's lines. Care was taken to
prevent any other light from falling directly on the screen.
    In order to exhibit the effect of any absorbing medium, it
was only necessary to place it behind the slit, in such a man
ner as to receive and transmit the light which was to pass
through a portion of the slit. The corresponding portion of
the spectrum underwent the modification produced by the
absorption: but the modified portion of the spectrum was in
no degree dislocated from the unmodified part (Fraunhofer's
lines running without dislocation through both), and the modi
fied portion was separated from the unmodified portion only
by the small interruption which is usually occasioned by the
edges of any refracting substance. It is impossible to conceive
circumstances more favourable than these for the comparison
of the modified and unmodified spectra.
    Of the absorptive media which I used, I am unable (as I
 have already stated) to give a complete catalogue. I had
 however several specimens of smalt-blue glass, all the varieties
 of coloured glass which I had been able at different times to
 procure from a glazier, and all the strikingly coloured fluids
 which I could obtain from a chemist, as well as port wine,
 porter, &c. The fluids were used in flat perfume-bottles: it
 would have been better to use them in slightly prismatic ves
 sels, which would admit of the use of different thicknesses of
 the fluids.
    Of the results of these experiments I can give little more
 than the single negative one,—that no change was produced
 in the qualities of the colours. After the most patient exami
 nation, I could not even suspect a change except in two or
 three instances, when I imagined that the blue colour was
 extended both ways, so as to trench upon the green on one
 side and upon the violet on the other side: but even these
 suspicions were removed when I closed with greater care the
 openings by which a little stray light entered between the
shutter-hole and the slit in   º   plate of metal.

76        Mr. J. P. Joule on the Effects of Magnetism
   The evidence which I am able to offer upon this subject is
necessarily, from the nature of the subject, only negative; and
the conclusion to which it leads will be destroyed by the
establishment of any one fact in opposition to it. But such a
fact must be established beyond doubt: and I have no hesi
tation in saying that no form of experiment anterior to my
own has been such as to place its conclusions beyond doubt.
I insist upon the two points—of juxtaposition of the modified
and unmodified spectra, and of exclusion of other light—as
indispensably necessary for accuracy.
   The experimenter must also be on his guard against the
apparent effects of mere intensification or dilution of light in
modifying its quality. Every one knows, for instance, that
when the setting sun is beginning to assume a slightly yellow
colour, its light received on a white plaster wall appears of a
full blush red, although there is not the smallest reason to
think that the quality of the light is really altered.

XVII. On the Effects of Magnetism upon the Dimensions of
         Iron and Steel Bars. By J. P. Joule, Esq.”
ABOUT the close of the year 1841, Mr. F. D. Arstall, an
      ingenious machinist of this town, suggested to me a new
form of electro-magnetic engine. He was of opinion that a
bar of iron experienced an increase of bulk by receiving the
magnetic condition; and that, by reversing its polarity rapidly
by means of alternating currents of electricity, an available
and useful motive power might be realized. At Mr. Arstall's
request I undertook some experiments in order to decide how
far his opinions were well-founded.                         -
   The results of my inquiries were brought before the public
on the occasion of a conversazione held at the Royal Victoria
Gallery of Manchester on the 16th of February 1842, and are
printed in the eighth volume of Sturgeon's Annals of Elec
tricity, p. 219. As many of my readers may not have access
to that work, I will, with the permission of the Editors of the
Philosophical Magazine, quote a small portion of the paper,
which is necessary to complete the history of this interesting
branch of investigation.
   “A length of thirty feet of copper wire, one-twentieth of an
inch thick, and covered with cotton thread, was formed into a
                  * Communicated by the Author.

          upon the Dimensions of Iron and Steel Bars,         77
coil twenty-two inches long and one-third of an inch in interior
diameter. This coil was secured in a perpendicular position;
and the rod of iron, of which I wished to ascertain the incre
ment, was suspended in its axis so as to receive the magnetic
influence whenever a current of electricity was passed through
the coil. Lastly, the upper extremity of the rod was fixed,
and the lower extremity was attached to a system of levers
which multiplied its motion three thousand times.               -
   “A bar of rectangular iron wire, two feet long, one quarter
of an inch broad, and one-eighth of an inch thick, caused the
index of the multiplying apparatus to spring from its position
and vibrate about a point one-tenth of an inch in advance, when
the coil was made to complete the circuit of a battery capable
of magnetizing the iron to saturation, or nearly so. After a
short interval of time, the index ceased to vibrate, and began
to advance very gradually in consequence of the expansion of
the bar from the heat which was radiated from the coil.      On
breaking the circuit, the index immediately began to vibrate
about a point, exactly one-tenth of an inch lower than that to
which it had attained.
   “By multiplying the advance of the index by the power of
the levers, we have rºboth of an inch, the increment of the
bar, which may be otherwise stated as rathrowth of its whole
length. --
   “Similar results were obtained by the use of an iron wire,
two feet long and one-twelfth of an inch in diameter. Five
pairs of the nitric acid battery produced an increment of the
thirty-thousandth part of an inch ; and when only one pair
of the battery was employed, I had an increment very slightly
less, viz., the thirty-three thousandth part of an inch.
    “This increment does not appear to depend upon the thick
ness of the bar; for an electro-magnet made of iron, three feet
long and one inch square, was found to expand under the mag
netic influence to nearly the same extent, compared with its
 length, as the wires did in the previous experiments.
    * I made some experiments in order to ascertain the law of
 the increment. Their results proved it to be very nearly pro
portional to the intensity of the magnetism and the length of the
 bar.
    “Trial was made whether any effect could be produced by
 using a copper wire, two feet long and about one-tenth of an
 inch in diameter; but I need scarcely observe that the attempt
 was unattended with the slightest success.
    “A very good way of observing the above phaenomena is
to examine one end of an electro-magnet with a powerful mi
croscope while the other end is fixed. The increment is then

78         Mr. J. P. Joule on the Effects of Magnetism
observed to take place with extreme suddenness, as if it had
been occasioned by a blow at the other extremity. The ex
pansion, though very minute, is indeed so very rapid that it
may be felt by the touch; and if the electro-magnet be placed
perpendicularly on a hard elastic body, such as glass, the ear
 can readily detect the fact that it makes a slight jump every
time that contact is made with the battery.
    “When one end of the electro-magnet is applied to the ear,
 a distinct musical sound is heard every time that contact is
 made with, or broken from, the battery; another proof of the
 suddenness with which the particles of iron are disturbed.”
     In another part of the lecture I stated my reasons for sup
 posing that whilst the bar of iron was increased in length by
 the magnetic influence, it experienced a contraction at right
 angles to the magnetic axis, so as to prevent any change taking
 place in the bulk of the bar. I intended as soon as possible
 to bring this conjecture to the test of experiment, and I pre
 pared some apparatus for the purpose; but owing to other
 occupations I was obliged to relinquish the experiments until
 the beginning of last summer. In the meantime the inquiry
 has been taken up by De la Rive, Matteucci, Wertheim,
  Wartmann, Marrian, Beatson and others, whose ingenious
 experiments have invested the subject with additional interest.
 The researches of Beatson have taken a similar direction to
 mine; and he appears also to have employed a somewhat
 similar apparatus to that which I shall presently describe. I
  have confirmed several of the results at which this gentleman
  has arrived, and have added new facts, which I hope will
  throw further light upon this rather obscure department of
  physics.                                                -
     In order to ascertain how far my opinion as to the invaria
  bility of the bulk of a bar of iron under magnetic influence was
  well-founded, I devised the following apparatus. Ten copper
  wires, each 110 yards long and one-twentieth of an inch in
  diameter, were bound together by tape so as to form a good,
  and at the same time very flexible conductor. The bundle of
  wires thus formed was coiled upon a glass tube 40 inches long
  and 1% inch in diameter. One end of the tube was herme
  tically sealed, and the other end was furnished with a glass
  stopper, which was itself perforated so as to admit of the in
  sertion of a graduated capillary tube. In making the experi
  ments, a bar of annealed iron, one yard long and half an inch
  square, was placed in the tube, which was then filled up with
  water. The stopper was then adjusted, and the capillary tube
  inserted so as to force the water to a convenient height within it.
•     The bulk of the iron bar was about 4,500,000 times the

           upon the Dimensions of Iron and Steel Bars.         79
capacity of each division of the graduated tube; consequently
a very minute expansion of the former would have produced
a perceptible motion of the water in the capillary tube: but, on
connecting the coil with a Daniell's battery of five or six cells
(a voltaic apparatus quite adequate to saturate the iron), no
perceptible effect whatever was produced either in making or
breaking contact with the battery, whether the water was sta
tionary in the stem, or gradually rising or falling from a change
of temperature. Now had the usual increase of length been
unaccompanied by a corresponding diminution of the diameter
of the bar, the water would have been forced through twenty
divisions of the capillary tube every time that contact was made
with the battery.
    Having thus ascertained that the bulk of the bar was in
variable, I proceeded to repeat my first experiments with a
more delicate apparatus, in order, by a more careful inves
tigation of the laws of the increment of length, to ascend to
the probable cause of the phaenomenon.
    A coiled glass tube, similar to that already described, was
fixed vertically in a wooden frame. Its length was such that
when a bar one yard long was introduced so as to rest on
the sealed end, each extremity of the bar was a full inch
 within the corresponding extremity of the coil. The appa
 ratus for observing the increment of length consisted of two
 levers of the first order, and a powerful microscope situated
 at the extremity of the second lever. These levers were
 furnished with brass knife edges resting upon glass. The
 connexion between the free extremity of the bar of iron and
 the first lever, and that between the two levers, were esta
 blished by means of exceedingly fine platinum wires.
    The first lever multiplied the motion of the extremity of
 the bar 7-8 times, the second multiplied the motion of the
 first 8 times, and the microscope was furnished with a micro
 meter divided into parts each corresponding to gºnth of an
 inch. Consequently each division of the micrometer passed
 over by the index indicated an increment of the length of the
 bar amounting to Tºrgath of an inch.
    The quantities of electricity passing through the coil were
 measured by an accurate galvanometer of tangents, consisting
 of a circle of thick copper wire one foot in diameter, and a
 needle half an inch long furnished with a suitable index.
    The quantities of magnetic polarity communicated to the
 iron bar were measured by a finely suspended magnet 18
 inches long, placed at the distance of one foot from the centre
 of the coil. This magnetic bar was furnished with scales
 precisely in the manner of an ordinary balance, and the weight

80        Mr. J. P. Joule on the Effects of Magnetism.
required to bring it to a horizontal position indicated the in
tensity of the magnetism of the iron bar under examination.
   After a few preliminary trials, a great advantage was found
to result from filling the tube with water. The effect of the
water was, as De la Rive had already remarked, to prevent the
sound. It also checked the oscillations of the index, and had
the important effect of preventing any considerable irregu
larities in the temperature of the bar.
   The first experiment which I shall record was made with
a bar consisting of two pieces of very well-annealed rectan
gular iron wire, each one yard long, a quarter of an inch broad,
and about one-eighth of an inch thick. The pieces were
fastened together so as to form a bar of nearly a quarter of
an inch square. The coil was placed in connexion with a
single constant cell, the resistance being further increased by
the addition of a few feet of fine wire.    The instant that the
circuit was closed, the index passed over one division of the
micrometer. The needle of the galvanometer was then ob
served to stand at 7°20', while the magnetic balance required
0.52 of a grain to bring it to an equilibrium. It had been
found by proper experiments that a current of 7°20' passing
through the coil was itself capable of exerting a force of
 0.03 of a grain upon the balance; consequently the magnetic
intensity of the bar was represented by 0:49 of a grain. On
breaking the circuit, the index was observed to retire 0.3 of a
division, leaving a permanent elongation of 0-7, and a per
manent polarity of 0.42 of a grain. More powerful currents
were now passed through the coil, and the observations re
peated as before, with the results tabulated below.

    Everything being left in the same position, the electricity
was now transmitted in the + or contrary direction, so as
first to remove the polarity acquired by the – current, and
then to induce the opposite polarity. The total elongation
of 10.9, acquired in the last experiment, is carried forward
in the 4th column of the following second table of results.

exactly the same size and temper as the preceding. To
avoid an unnecessary occupation of space, I shall omit the
fresh heading of the table for a change in the direction of the
current, and simply designate the commencement of a new

   The next experiment was with a bar of well-annealed iron,
one yard long and about half an inch square. Its weight was
45} oz. I have introduced an additional column into the table,
in order to reduce the action on the magnetic balance to the
section of the former bars, the weight of each of which was
8 oz.

   From the last column of each of the preceding tables we
may, I think, safely infer that the elongation is in the duplicate
ratio of the magnetic intensity of the bar, both when the mag
netism is maintained by the influence of the coil, and in the
case of the permanent magnetism after the current has been
cut off. The discrepancies observable will, I think, be satis
factorily accounted for when we consider the nature of the
magnetic actions taking place. When a bar experiences the
inductive influence of a coil traversed by an electrical current,
the particles near its axis do not receive as much polarity as
those near its surface, because the former have to withstand
the opposing inductive influence of a greater number of mag
netic particles than the latter. This phaenomenon will be
diminished in the extent of its manifestation with an increase
of the electrical force, and will finally disappear when the cur
rent is sufficiently powerful to saturate the iron. Again, when
the iron, after having been magnetized by the coil, is aban
doned to its own retentive powers by cutting off the electrical
current, the magnetism of the interior particles will suffer a
greater amount of deterioration than that of the exterior par
ticles. The polarity of the former may indeed be sometimes
actually reversed, as Dr. Scoresby found it to be in some ex
tensive combinations of steel bars. Now whenever such influ
ences as the above occur, so as to make the different parts of
the bar magnetic to a various extent, the elongation will neces
sarily bear a greater proportion to the square of the magnetic
intensity measured by the balance than would otherwise be
the case.

84             Mr. J. P. Joule on the Effects of Magnetism
     For similar causes the interior of the bar will in general
receive the neutralization and reversion of its polarity before
the exterior, and hence we see in the tables that there is a
considerable elongation of the bar after the reversion of the
current; even when the effect upon the balance has become
imperceptible, owing to the opposite effects of the interior and
exterior magnetic particles.
    The bars employed in the preceding experiments were an
nealed as perfectly as possible. The next series was made
with a bar of exactly the same dimensions and quality as the
bars employed in Experiments 1 and 2, excepting that it was
not annealed.

   In the foregoing series the discrepancies before adverted to
do not make their appearance to any considerable extent,
except in the case of the reversion of the magnetic polarity.
Taken altogether the series is strikingly confirmatory of the
law of elongation already announced.
   The next series of observations was obtained with a piece
of soft steel wire one yard long and a quarter of an inch in
diameter. Its weight being exactly 8 oz., no reduction of
magnetic intensity É. to be made for unity of section.

    The uniformity of the numbers in the last columns of the
preceding tables shows that where the metal possesses a con
siderable degree of retentive power the anomalies occasioned
by the reaction of the magnetic particles upon one another,
which have been already adverted to, do not exist to any con
siderable extent, and presents an additional confirmation of
the law I have stated, viz. the elongation is proportional, in a
given bar, to the square of the magnetic intensity.
    I now made trial of a bar of steel one yard long, half an
inch broad, and a quarter of an inch thick, weighing 23 oz. It
was hardened to a certain extent throughout its whole length,
but not to such a degree as entirely to resist the action of the

   In the above table it will be observed that the hard steel
bar was slightly increased in length every time that contact
with the battery was broken, although a considerable dimi
mution of the magnetism of the bar took place at the same
time. I am disposed to attribute this effect to the state of
tension in the hardened steel, for I find that soft iron wire
presents a similar anomaly when stretched tightly.
   On inspecting the tables, it will be remarked that the elon
gation is, for the same intensity of magnetism, greater in pro
portion to the softness of the metal. It is greatest of all in
the well-annealed iron bars, and least in the hardened steel.
This circumstance appears to me to favour the hypothesis that
the phaenomena are produced by the attractions taking place
between the magnetic particles of the bar, an hypothesis in
perfect accordance with the law of elongation which I have
pointed out.

XVIII. Remarks on the Earistence and Mechanism of the Ne
   gative or Protecting Rays of the Sun. By JoHN WILLIAM
   DRAPER, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of
   New York K.
IN a letter published in    the Philosophical Magazine, Nov.
    1842, I had occasion to make some incidental remarks
respecting a class of rays existing in the sun-light, which have
the quality of exerting a negative or antagonizing action upon
those engaged in producing Daguerreotype results.
   In October last, MM. Foucault and Fizeau having made a
communication to the French Academy of Sciences to a similar
effect, and M. Edmond Becquerel, in criticising their results,
having referred to me as the original author of the fact, I may
on this occasion be excused for offering a few observations
on this, which perhaps is destined to become one of the most
important phaenomena in relation to the chemical action of
 the sun-light.
   That the opposite ends of the solar spectrum possess oppo
site qualities is an idea which, far from originating with me,
has been floating anong chemists for many years. The first
distinct statement with which I am acquainted in relation to
it occurs in a work published by Mr. B. Wilson, the second
edition of which dates as early as 1776. It is entitled “A
 Series of Experiments on Phosphori.” He shows that it is
the more refrangible rays which excite the phosphorescence
of sulphuret of lime, but the less réfrangible ones eatinguish it
when shining.
                   * Communicated by the Author.

 88       Prof. Draper on the Eristence and Mechanism
    In 1801 Ritter found that chloride of silver which had been
blackened in the violet rays, had its colour partially restored
when placed in the red. He states also that phosphorus,
which is oxidized with the production of fumes in the invisible
red, is instantly extinguished in the violet.
   The well-known experiments of Wollaston with guaiacum
served to show the opposite relations of the red and violet
rays. It is remarkable, that he subsequently abandoned this
interpretation of the phaenomenon, on discovering that green
guaiacum changed its colour by the application of a hot silver
spoon.
   In 1839 Sir J. Herschel encountered the same action in the
case of some of the preparations of silver. His first idea was
that of a positive and negative polarity of the spectrum; but
this was subsequently modified for the reasons set forth in his
memoir%.
   From the time when I examined the Daguerreotype spec
trum in Virginia in 1842, I have never doubted the actual ex
istence of these negative or protecting rays; and on this oc
casion, when that existence is re-asserted by Lerebours, Fizeau
and Foucault, I will make known certain new facts, premising
that I do not think the views taken by M. Becquerel are cor
rect. They are founded on what seems to me to be a misap
prehension of the phaenomenon of the Daguerreotype.
   A Daguerreotype plate can exhibit three different varieties
of surface;—1st, a black aspect on those regions where it has
been unaffected by light; 2nd, various shades of white; 3rd,
a coloured blackness, the tint of which may be of a deep
watch-spring, or sometimes of an olive shade. Persons familiar
with the process will understand completely what I mean.
The first of these conditions is represented in the deep sha
dows of such a photograph, the places where the light never
acted; the second is exhibited in the various intensities of
whiteness, which constitute the figures of the picture, the
whiteness varying in intensity according to the intensity of the
light; the third is the solarized or overdone condition, which
arises from too long an exposure to the rays. Like the first
this may be spoken of as a blackness, but in reality it is a dark
green, or blue, or tawny tint. It is this solarized condition of
surface which M. Becquerel confounds with the first, the
blackness arising from the unchanged state; and it is pre
cisely on this point that the whole argument turns. For the
sake of having distinctive words to mark out these three con
ditions, I will call the first the unaffected state, the second the
white state, and the third the solarized state.
                     * Phil. Trans. 1840, § 60, &c.

         of the Negative or Protecting Rays of the Sun.       89
   The observations I made in Virginia were as follows. That
if a solar spectrum was received on a Daguerreotype plate on
which a weak daylight was simultaneously acting, the red,
orange, yellow, green, and part of the blue rays, arrested the
action of the daylight on that portion of the plate on which
they fell, and maintained it in the unaffected state; whilst the
residue of the blue, the indigo and violet, carried their part of
the plate to a completely solarized condition. This therefore
seemed to justify the assertion, that the less refrangible rays
{jDaguerre's preparation from the action of a diffused
  aVlight.
   }. É. also found that if the plate was exposed to the day
light for a few seconds, so that had it been then mercurialized
it would have whitened uniformly all over, on being made to
receive the spectrum the less refrangible rays actually carried
it back to the unaffected condition, reversing what had been
already done. Whilst the more refrangible rays were forcing
it on to the solarized state, these were returning it into the
condition of shadow : they therefore not only protect, but seem
even to exert a negative or antagonistic action.
   The following observation appears to me to be in contrast
with the beautiful explanation which Sir J. Herschel gives of
the phaenomena of one of these specimens, and moreover to
have a very significant meaning. I found that it was perfectly
immaterial whether the exposure to the spectrum was for thirty
seconds or one hour—the result was the same.          The final
action had been produced, the less refrangible rays had car
ried their region to the unaffected state, while the more re
frangible had solarized theirs. Now if the phaenomenon was
due, as M. Becquerel supposes, to an unequal action of the
same kind in the different rays, it is obvious that the final re
sult ought to depend on the time of exposure; the red ray,
aided by the daylight, should carry its portion through the
various shades of white, and solarize it at last.   But this in
the longest exposure never takes place; that part of the plate
remains as though a ray of light had never fallen upon it.
    Such are the facts I observed, and they seem to have been
reproduced by MM. Foucault and Fizeau; but there are also
others of a much more singular nature. In these Virginia
specimens the same protecting action reappears beyond the
violet.
    The only impressions in which I have ever seen this pro
tecting action beyond the violet, are those made in Virginia in
 1842; they were made in the month of July. Struck with this
peculiarity, on my return to New York the following August I
made many attempts to obtain similar specimens, but in no in
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 30. No. 199, Feb. 1847.         H

90       Prof. Draper on the Eristence and Mechanism
stance could the extra-violet protecting action be traced, though
the analogous action of the red, orange, yellow, green and blue,
was perfectly given. Supposing, therefore, that the difference
must be due either to impurities in the iodine or to differences
in the method of conducting the experiment, I tried it again
and again in every possible way. To my surprise I soon found
that the negative effect was gradually disappearing; and on
Sept. 29 it could no longer be traced, except at the highest
part corresponding to the yellow and green rays. In De
cember it had become still more imperfect, but on the 19th of
the following March the red and orange rays had recovered
their original protective power. It seemed, therefore, that in
the early part of the year a protective action had made its
appearance in the red ray, and about July extended over all
the less refrangible regions, and as the year went on it had
retreated upwards.
   Are there then periodic changes in the nature of the sun’s
light? The absorptive action of the earth's atmosphere is out
of the question: if that were the cause, the character of these
spectrum impressions should vary with the hour of the day.
 Or is it not more probable that these singular phaenomena
rather depend on incidental changes in the experiment, such
as external temperature, variations of moisture, the colour of
the sky, &c.?
    Under proper circumstances there is no difficulty in exhi
biting the power which the less refrangible rays exert in ar
resting the action of the daylight: under such circumstances
a Daguerreotype impression of the sun's spectrum yields all
three of the varieties of surface before alluded to. The plate
in the less refrangible and extreme violet region is unaffected;
a narrow space of white separates these unaffected portions
from the indigo and violet spaces, which are in a highly so
larized state.
    But a totally different result is obtained when the daylight
is not allowed to fall on the plate, either before or during its
 exposure to the spectrum. Under these circumstances the
 rays which would otherwise protect now act on the plate and
 slowly whiten it. A Daguerreotype spectrum formed in dark
 ness and without previous exposure to the light, exhibits a
 white stain over all the less refrangible regions, and bears a
 marked contrast to one formed under the simultaneous action
 of a weak daylight. For brevity I will call the former the
 spectrum of darkness, and the latter the spectrum of daylight.
 The following are some additional observations.
    In the spectrum of darkness there is in the white stain a

         of the Negative or Protecting Rays of the Sun.           91
point of maximum action. This corresponds with the maxi
mum of protection in the spectrum of daylight,
   The white stain of the spectrum of darkness is apparently
narrower than the protected space in the spectrum of daylight.
   Rays of luminous or of non-luminous heat projected on the
darkness or daylight spectra during their formation appear to
exert no kind of special influence on the result.
   The white fringe which borders the solarized portion is not
due to anything analogous to conduction. These chemical
changes, unlike thermal changes, cannot be conducted.
   By interposing between the prism and the Daguerreotype
plate a convex lens of short focus, so as to intercept in suc
cession each of the coloured rays, I threw all over the plate,
while the spectrum was in the act of being impressed upon it,
red, orange, yellow, &c. lights in succession; the object being
to ascertain how far the impressed spectrum would change
when these monochromatic rays were used along with day
light, Sir J. Herschel having previously showed in similar
experiments that new phaenomena arise during the conjoint
action of rays *. The following are some of the observations
I made; their date is Sept. 24, 1842.
   The red ray when projected increases the length of the so
larized portion, and also of its white extremities.
    The yellow ray shortens the solarized portion.
    The green ray exerts a greater action of the same kind.
    The indigo ray gives a most remarkable result: . It totally
 inverts the action of the less refrangible rays; and they solar
ize the plate, acting precisely in the same way that the more
refrangible rays commonly do, causing it to exhibit a watch
spring lustre.
    I further found that when different rays are brought to act
 upon each other, the result does not alone depend upon their
 intrinsic differences, but also on their relative intensities. Thus
 the green and lower half of the blue rays, when of a certain
 intensity, protect the plate from the action of the daylight;
 but if of a less intensity, they aid the daylight.
    The red and orange rays, when of a certain intensity, in
 crease the action of daylight on the plate; but if of a less in
 tensity, they restrain it.
    These facts seem to be connected with the circumstance
 that there is often to be traced on Daguerreotype plates a
 remarkable difference between the central and lateral parts of
 a spectrum. Thus if a line be drawn through the centre of
 such a spectrum and a parallel to it on one of the edges, the
 action at any point on the central line is the reverse of that at
                        • Phil. Trans. 1840, § 64.

the corresponding point on the edge. A similar remark, as
respects impressions on paper, has been previously made by
Sir J. Herschel.
   Such are the chief facts I have observed in relation to the
Daguerreotype spectrum.       It would seem at first sight that
their diversity is so great that we can have but little hope of
reducing them to a common system of results originating in
the same cause. I have however been long led to believe that
the explanation is to be met with in the great and fertile prin
ciple of interference.   From this point of view I regard the
action of rays of every kind as being essentially positive, and
that action mainly consists in impressing a vibratory move
ment on the atoms of the decomposing substance. It is to
my mind a fact of no common significance, that in those Vir
ginia specimens the places of maximum protection in the less
and more refrangible regions fall where the lengths of the
luminous waves have the extraordinary relation of 2:1. Then,
when we also see that, before a perfect neutralization of action
between two rays ensues, those rays must be adjusted in in
tensity to each other, does it not show that interference of
some kind is going on ? Again, the yellow ray is in number
less instances the ray which most completely antagonizes those
at the red and violet extremes of the spectrum: to use the
language of Sir J. Herschel, “this ray may be considered as
marking a sort of chemical centre, a point of equilibrium, or
rather a change of action in the spectrum.” I cannot avoid
seeing that these phaenomena are connected with the remark
able fact, that the waves of red, yellow and violet light, are of
lengths which correspond to 2, 1 }, 1.
   If then a powerful yellow ray can hold in check a feeble
violet one, and prevent it from decomposing iodide of silver,
merely because their relation of length is in the proportion of
1# to 1, it should follow on the same principles, that a red
ray acting conjointly with a violet should give rise to an in
creased effect, because the lengths have now become 2: 1.
And that this in reality is the case I found by direct experi
ment; for on projecting the red upon the violet, so that the
colours should half overlap each other, I found that at the
point of concourse the plate instantly solarized, and assumed
a splendid green metallic colour.
   I have now explained the acceptation in which I receive the
term negative ray as a synonym (in this instance of iodide of
silver) for the yellow ray, and alluded to the mechanism which
seems to be the cause of protecting action generally. Per
haps on a review of his own experiments M. Becquerel may
find reason to believe that there are in reality antagonizing

    Prof. Powell on the Theory of the Aberration of Light,      93
 actions in different parts of the spectrum; actions not limited
 to the Daguerreotype, but occurring in all kinds of cases.
 They have been met with by every one who has examined the
 spectrum with sensitive papers, and, in a totally different
 series of phaenomena, M. Becquerel has himself furnished a
 most conclusive illustration. He shows that when sulphuret
 of lime and other phosphorescent bodies in a shining state are
 exposed to the spectrum, the more refrangible rays increase
 the glow, but the less extinguish it at once. What is to be
 made of a fact like that?
    It is proper to observe, that some of the phaenomena re
corded in this communication which seem to be in opposition
to the principle set forth are not so in reality. All reasonings
 founded on the decomposition of light by the prism, and the
action of the prismatic spectrum on changeable surfaces, are
liable to error. In a memoir which I shall soon publish “On
the Production of Light by Heat,” this point will be particu
larly dwelt on ; for the present it is sufficient to say, that the
only method free from these difficulties is to employ the inter
 ference spectrum formed by a ruled surface or a grate; a
 method which was proposed eight years ago by Sir J. Her
schel with a view of getting rid of the disturbing agencies
arising from the ideal coloration of glass, and which I first
 carried into effect in 1844 with so much success, that the re
sulting Daguerreotype impressions contained Fraunhofer's
lines, even with microscopic minuteness. With this spectrum
we avoid a far more serious difficulty than that of the ideal
coloration of glass, a difficulty arising from the magnitude of
the refracting faces of the prism. It is this which makes a
prismatic spectrum blacken paper, made sensitive with the
bromide of silver, from the red to the violet end; whereas the
interference spectrum shows that the true action is confined to
the more refrangible side, and stops short of the centre of the
yellow space.

XIX. Note to a former paper on the Theory of the Aberration
            of Light. By the Rev. Professor Powell.
SINCE        the publication of my paper, in a late Number of
     this Journal+, I have been favoured with several commu
nications from the distinguished individuals on whose opinions
I have there commented; and their friendly criticisms seem
to call for a brief supplementary remark.

94     Prof. Powell on the Theory of the Aberration of Light.
   In the view which I gave in that paper of the explanation
of the aberration, my object was to put the principle proposed
by Prof. Challis in such a form as I conceived might divest it
of certain difficulties which had appeared to some to attach
to it.
   I had in fact attempted to combine Prof. Challis's principle
with what seemed necessary for explaining the direction of
vision. But that principle is in itself quite independent of this
last consideration; and the whole may thus be more distinctly
expressed by keeping them separate as follows:
   Supposing the same construction as in my former paper,

which proceeds in the direc

respect coincide with it; and
they will arrive together at
the bottom of d at the same
time as that at which the ob
server's eye arrives there.               e
Both objects will conse
quently be referred to the same direction, though the wire
has really moved into a new position, viz. to the top of la:
   This is all that is essential to the idea of aberration accord
ing to Prof. Challis's view.      It is the angular difference &
between these two directions which is defined to be aberration.
   (2.) What the direction is, to which the eye actually refers
the star and the wire, is a distinct question. By some it may
be regarded as altogether needless; and so I admit it is as
far as the above abstract idea of aberration is concerned: yet
it seems to me at least desirable to take it into account; and
it may, I conceive, be best put as follows:—
   While the rays come down d the telescope has moved
along e parallel to itself, into the position l, independently of
the ray which had started from the wire down d: yet at every

   Prof. Powell on the Theory of the Aberration of Light. 95
instant of its course that ray has one point coinciding with a
point in the axis of the tube in motion. Thus by composi
tion of the two motions, this ray, though by a different modus
operandi, comes down the axis of the telescope: whether this
will, in theory, be the direction in which the eye sees both
the star and wire, will depend on the consideration of a simi
lar question to that stated in p. 433.
   But there can be no doubt that in point of fact the axis of
the telescope is the direction to which the eye (by whatever
means) is led to refer the two objects seen together by rays
pursuing a different route, relatively to space.
   Prof. Challis has favoured me with the following additional
illustration.
   “Suppose two ships to be sailing due north at the same
rate, and one to be due east of the other: a boat is despatched
from the eastern ship to the western, and goes in a rectilinear
course from the one to the other.     If the crew of the western
ship, seeing the other ship due east, and knowing that the
boat came from her, concluded that the course of the boat had
been exactly from east towards west, they would plainly be
mistaken. It is precisely this error that the astronomer com
mits.”
   Among some valuable remarks on the entire subject which
I have received from Mr. Stokes, I learn that the very cursory
statement I made as to the difference between the theoretical
investigations of that gentleman and Prof. Challis, does not
convey a perfectly accurate idea of the point at issue; I am
therefore anxious to represent it more correctly as follows:—
   Mr. Stokes at first contended that it was necessary to sup
pose the expression (u d a +&c.) to be an exact differential,
while Prof. Challis rejected that restriction. Subsequently
however Prof. Challis agreed in Mr. Stokes's view : but he
showed that, on that supposition, the expression for the change
in the direction of the normal is such as to allow us to sup
pose the motion of the aether at the surface of the earth rela
tively to the earth to be of any amount. But Mr. Stokes
differs in opinion as to the fact ; conceiving it most probable
that the aether within the earth and close to its surface is at
rest relatively to it.                            -
   In my paper however I professedly avoided entering on
this part of the question; and the remark just made in no
way affects the other parts of my observations.

      GENTLEMEN,
THE following may be deemed                a proper supplement to
      the remarks, offered in common by Mr. Hargreave and
myself, in the January Number of the Philosophical Magazine
on the subject of the Rev. B. Bronwin’s differential equations.
   In the greater number of those equations, the independent
variable a only entered in the first degree. All linear equa
tions which possess this character, whether in differentials or
in finite differences, admit of a complete symbolical solution,
from which the particular solutions assigned in the papers
referred to, may be regarded as deductions.
   Every equation, indeed, to which this characteristic belongs,
may be expressed in the form

   The analogy which exists between the above solution and
that of the linear differential equation of the first order, it is
scarcely necessary to notice. It belongs to a class of subjects
which have been considered in a paper on the Theory of

XXI. Observations and Experiments respecting the Origin
    of the Voltaic Current. By Professor GIANALEssanDRo
    MAJocCHI*.
AFTER the discussion which took place in the last sittings,
      and principally in that of yesterday, respecting the origin
of voltaic electricity, among some of our distinguished phy
sicists, and particularly between the illustrious president of
the section Prof. Orioli and Prof. Botto, I have been induced
to extract the following paper from an essay of mine on the
same subject.
    At the Turin Congress in 1840, the question of the two
theories, the chemical and that of contact, was agitated, with a
view to explain the origin of voltaic electricity. There is no
doubt that where a chemical action takes place, there is also a
development of electricity; but the fluid which becomes free
requires certain conditions to form a current. In like manner
it is certain that, on placing two heterogeneous bodies in con
tact, there is a development of electricity; and in this precisely
consist the fundamental facts which led Volta to the discovery
of his pile; and on the same principle is founded the in
É.          apparatus of insulating plates, armed with leaves of
  eterogeneous metals, which our colleague Prof. Marianini
 exhibited at the Congress of Turin, and which, variously
arranged, he yesterday showed to this assemblyf. The che
mico-electricians maintain that the fundamental facts of Volta
 depend on the chemical action upon the metal, produced by
 the moisture of the hand, of the air, &c.; but the careful ex
 periments instituted by Marianini, Pfaff, Belli, Peltier, and
 some other physicists, appear, in the development of electri

 city by Volta's two dissimilar metals, to exclude any cause
 foreign to that which arises from the contact of the two bodies.
 Moreover, the period of thirty-three years, for which Prof.
 Zamboni’s dry pile has now existed, confirms such a mode of
 electrical disturbance”.
    How then does electricity by contact take place? Contact
 is not a force; it is the simple indication of the mode in which
 metals arrange themselves in the case of the voltaic experi
 ment; and no fluid whatever, the electric for instance, can be
 put in motion without an agent. At the Turin Congress in
 1840 I expressed my opinion, that in the so-called contact,
 although the action cannot be considered chemical, there is a
 force of attraction which is the principle of the action itself, I
 mean that force recognised and admitted by all, investigated
 by many at the close of the last century and the beginning of
 the present, that force, namely, which is called adhesion or
 attraction of simple surfaces. I shall not repeat here what I
said on that occasion+ ; but will rather observe, that such
facts have confirmed me in my opinion concerning the phae
nomenon of electricity in the fundamental experiments of
 Volta.
    My purpose here is to examine the conditions necessary in
the pile to the generation of the current, which is quite di
stinct from the simple electrical disturbance in the fundamental
experiments of Volta. In a circuit, in order to give birth to the
electric current, it is necessary that there ii be two forces;
one to emit the electric fluid in a given direction, the other to
carry it on from the place where it is lodged : these two forces
in Volta's pile are, the one, adhesion, by which the direction
of the current is determined; the other, the chemical action
which takes place in electrolization, or in other terms, in the
decomposition of the intermediate liquid by which the electri
city is evolved. It matters little whether this decomposition
is perceptible or imperceptible; since the polarization of two
platinum electrodes intended to complete the circuit with
the intermediate electrolyte, proves that, if there is no percep
tible separation in the components of the liquid, there is an
imperceptible one; for the polarity of the electrodes them
selves cannot happen without the decomposition of the liquid
in which they are immersed. The above-named conditions
are verified in any voltaic arrangement, both in the original
piles of Volta, and in those of Wollaston, Novellucci, Miche
lotti, Daniell, Grove, &c. In the fundamental experiments

of Volta, there is no chemical decomposition, there being no
intermediate electrolyte ; and thence an electrical disturb
ance only is shown, an electricity of tension, which to be
formed into a current requires the circuit to be completed
with a liquid. For if this liquid does not exert any che
mical action in any of the metals placed in contact, then no
current is manifested on the galvanometer. Gold and plati
num show an electrical disturbance on the condenser, but no
current when they are immersed in nitric acid, and united with
one another metallically by means of the wire of the galvano
meter. But if some drops of hydrochloric acid are added
to the nitric acid, the gold only is attacked, and immediately
an electric current is manifested on the galvanometer. In
the chemical action of the acid upon gold or on the zinc
of the common voltaic pair, electricity is evolved; or this
fluid, by virtue of that force, is separated and set free from the
ponderable molecules which undergo a decomposition to form
a new compound, and the adhesion between the two bodies in
contact, which would produce a simple electrical disturbance,
gives the discharge and determines the course in which the
current of the fluid is directed precisely according to the che
mical action. In the circuit of the battery between every pair,
where the electricity is simply disturbed and would show only
a tension, an electrolyte is placed, which is decomposed by the
affinity which one of the metals of the pair exerts upon it : by
this decomposition the electricity of the ponderable matter is
developed and becomes free, and is emitted from the electro
negative metal into that of the electro-positive. This discharge
proceeds from one pair to another, and the electric fluid set
free by the chemical action is put into a continuous current
along the circuit. From the first experiments of Volta, and
from those which have been since instituted in various ways, it
is known that the chemical action alone occasions a develop
ment of electricity, and a second force is necessary to put this
fluid in motion.     Moreover we know that, if this chemical
action is impeded without taking away the conductibility from
the circuit, the current is weakened, and is sometimes in the
end entirely destroyed, not being perceptible by the most deli
cate galvanometers. In a voltaic circuit, where two platinum
electrodes are interposed, immersed at a distance from each
other in acidulated water, the hydrogen gas is deposited upon
one of these, polarizes it, and generates a contrary current,
which weakens or annuls the primary current, because, whilst
the chemical action evolving the electric fluid still exists in the
pairs of the pile, there is opposed to the impelling force, by
which the current is determined, another contrary one, arising

 100     Prof. Majocchi on the Origin of the Voltaic Current.
 with the polarization of the platinum electrode, which weakens
 or entirely annuls the effect of the first. For if the liquid is
 placed together with the two platinum electrodes, by which the
 voltaic circuit is completed, under the receiver of the air-pump
 where a vacuum is effected, the hydrogen gas is forced to dif
 fuse itself by its expansibility in the same receiver, whereby
 the negative electrode is not polarized, and the electric cur
 rent continues its course, until the gas can in such manner se
 parate itself from the surface of the platinum, and diffuse itself
 in the vacuum of the air-pump.
    With a view to ascertain whether this mode of explaining
 the phaenomenon of the current in the battery has any pro
 bability and contains the cause of the same, it occurred to me
 to form an entirely metallic circuit, without any intermediate
 electrolyte, to examine if the simple chemical action was able
 of itself to generate a current. I shall first observe, that an
 homogeneous metallic wire, forming a continuous circuit and
 returning into itself, and perfectly identical throughout its whole
 extension, if heated in any part, gives rise to no electrical
 current; because the propagation of the caloric, proceeding
 uniformly from the two sides of the portion heated, gives rise
 to two electrical currents in an opposite direction, which be
 come perfectly equal, and thence counteract one another, and
obstruct the continuous circulation of the fluid itself.      And if
any obstacle, as a knot or a defect of homogeneity in the wire,
renders the propagation of the caloric more difficult in one
direction than in another, then one of the electrical currents
which arise prevails over the other, and one results of in
tensity equal to the difference of the two unequal elements,
which shows itself precisely on the galvanometer. In the
same way, if the homogeneous metallic wire, forming the
closed and re-entering circuit, is afterwards touched by a cold
body in a point near the heated part, an electrical current is
generated, which is indicated by the galvanometer. It seems
then that the cooling-produced on one side of the heated part
weakens the cause from which the electric current springs, and
thence gives room to the other to circulate in the wire and
make its effects perceptible on the galvanometer. This case
is very different from that in which the thermo-electric circuit
is composed of two metals; the one positively electric and the
other negatively electric; since then there are two forces
from which the electric current springs in a given direction.
   Following this principle, applied to the development of
electricity by chemical action, I reasoned thus:—If the che
mical action were able of itself to generate a current without
the aid of another force, it is clear that, on forming a wholly

   Prof. Majocchi on the Origin of the Voltaic Current.     101
metallic circuit in one part of which a chemical action is by
any matter produced, there ought to arise, in the same cir
cumstances of the wire above described, an electric current,
Before entering on experiments on this point, I foresaw that
no current would be caused in that entirely metallic circuit,
notwithstanding that from one side of the place where the
chemical action would be exerted, an obstacle should be inter
posed by any heterogeneity in the conductor forming the cir
Cult.
   First experiment.—A strip of copper of the length of 1:30
metre, and 2 centimetres wide, is united by its extremities
to the terminals of a long wire-galvanometer; afterwards
with those of another with a short wire, and successively
with my universal galvanometer disposed as a duplicator. By
means of nitric, sulphuric, or hydrochloric acid, solutions of
potass, soda or of ammonia, a chemical action was succes
sively exerted in one part of this metallic band; but no in
dication of current appeared in the needle of these instruments.
The experiment was made in a like manner with a similar
strip of iron, zinc, and any other metal, and no current ap
peared which caused the needle to deviate on either of the
galvanometers. In this experiment therefore the circuit was
quite homogeneous, proving that the thermo-electric current
originated from the different conditions of the wire.
   Second ea<U+017F>periment.—The metallic strip is compressed by
means of a clamp in one place, then it bends again upon itself
in many folds, being held by a clamp; then it is subjected in
that place again to tempering, and then it is also ham
mered in a cold state: in each of these cases, operating in
the same manner, a chemical action was exerted with one of
the above-named materials in a portion of the strip without
obtaining any indication of current on the needle of one of the
galvanometers. The strip was divided into two parts, which
were joined, bending back upon one another, and held fast
together by the clamp : exciting afterwards a chemical ac
tion with one of the acids or the alkalies above-mentioned,
there resulted no current perceptible by the galvanometer.
    Third experiment.—The preceding copper strip is connected
by means of the clamp with a similar one of zinc. These two
strips thus united, by one of their extremities placed beneath,
formed a continuous and wholly metallic circuit with the wire
of the galvanometer. On causing a chemical action upon one
of the strips, no current was manifested. The effect was null
upon producing a chemical action on one of the metallic lists
with an acid and on the other with an alkali, and also upon
alternating this double action.

102      Prof. Majocchi on the Origin of the Voltaic Current.
    This third experiment shows that, although there may be
disengagement of electricity in the chemical action of liquids
upon metals, no current is manifested; because the other
force necessary to the production of this exists indeed in the
contact of the copper with the zinc.; but it acts in two places
in a contrary direction; whereas on the one hand the contact
of the copper with the zinc tends to discharge the electricity
in one direction, whilst on the other hand the contact of the
same metals emits it in an opposite direction; and in this man
ner there are two contrary forces of adhesion, which, as far as
regards disturbance of the electric equilibrium, destroy one
another. Neither of them can therefore avail in setting in
motion the electricity which is developed in the chemical action,
by which this fluid is equally distributed throughout the me
 tallic circuit, and in the liquid which is contained in the cup
and exerts the chemical action on the metal.
    Those who adopt the purely chemical theory, following
De la Rive, in order to explain how the current originates in
the battery of Volta at so weak a tension, admit, speaking ac
cording to the system of the dualists, that the two electricities
separated by the chemical action tend to unite by their re
ciprocal attraction; and it is therefore that in this point,
where there is a separation of the two electricities, they in fact
unite again in part. The tension therefore does not become
very great, because it is only the portions of the two electri
cities remaining separate that form themselves into a cur
rent. The neutralization or the equilibrium of the electricity
evolved by chemical action, according to the followers of the
pure chemical theory, does not occur at all by virtue of the
action itself; whilst, according to us, this disturbance would
be produced by a second force, which would be adhesion.
Now those who adopt purely the theory of contact, it appears,
see in the chemical action itself only a means of augmenting the
points of contact of the liquid with the metal, by which the elec
tricity finds various ways of disposing itself in a current. But
how will they explain so many facts where the chemical action
is manifest by the development of electricity ? Moreover the
simple combination of the metalloids chlorine, bromine,
iodine, &c. with the metals is not accompanied by a develop
ment of the electric fluid; and it therefore seems that there is
only a development of this fluid, when by affinity one of
the elements of the voltaic pair tends to combine with one of
the components the electrolyte or conductor of the second
class.
    The gas battery devised by Grove is easily explained in
 the above-described manner of considering the generation of

the electric current in the voltaic apparatus. For adhesion,
we know, is not only manifested between solids, as the metals,
but also between a solid and a liquid or aeriform fluid. And
many facts of chemical reactions meet with easy explanation
from such a force, by which affinity appears to be excited and
thence the electrical current to arise, which determines a de
composition and a new combination. However long a time, in
fact, a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is left to itself, these
gases do not combine even when placed in presence of bodies
which have a great affinity for water, and which, it would
seem, ought to produce their union, as for instance sulphuric
acid, potass, lime and the like. We know that if a piece of
platina be immersed in the mixture their combination follows
on the metallic surface, and extends in certain cases to the
whole aériform mass, so as to cause the explosion of the mix
ture. Grove himself recognises an analogy in the phaeno
menon of his gas battery and that of the ordinary combination
of the two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, by means of the
presence of platina. The decomposition of ammoniacal gas
by means of incandescent copper is one of the few instances
in which the decomposition of a gaseous body is excited
by a solid body. The attraction of gold for chlorine excites
the decomposition of nitric acid united with hydrochloric
acid when gold-leaf is placed in aqua regia; for aqua regia
only contains free chlorine after being heated, or after having.
been left to itself for a long time. Numerous other facts of
this nature have been collected by Mitscherlich *, and related
in the Reports of the Royal Academy of Berlin, of December
 1841, and other similar ones by Reiset and Millon communi
 cated to the Royal Academy of Paris in June 1843. All
 these facts are called by them phaenomena of contact, and Mit
 scherlich calls the bodies by which they are produced contact
 substances.    Berzelius has introduced a new name into science,
 catalytic force, to denote the cause of adhesion; but with
 the new name he has not thrown any light upon the nature
 of this force.   We see in all these facts the adhesion of a solid
 for a fluid bring into activity the affinity by which, when
 bodies are conveniently disposed in a complete circuit, elec
 tricity is evolved, which then forms a continuous current in
 the mode explained.
    From all that we have said it would follow that, with a
 single force, mechanical, chemical or physical, there is only
 an electrical disturbance, or the phaenomena of statical elec
 tricity: thus the mechanical action of friction produces in
 the ordinary machine a simple disturbance of electricity; the

 change of ar, y or 2, then in order for X, Y, Z to be the same
 for every part of an element, that element must be also con
 sidered a mathematical point, having no distinction of parts at
 all.
    In nature, however, the forces are physically and not mathe
 matically continuous, and the elements on which they act may
 have an infinite range of magnitude. The reasoning by which
 such forces are submitted to calculation is however precisely
 the same as if they were mathematically continuous.
    The element of fluid, then, may be of any finite magnitude
 below a certain limit, and will consist of a number of ultimate
 particles, on each of which the forces acting are the same.
 For the whole extent of this element X, Y, Z are the same,
 and it may be taken of any size consistent with this condition.
    The next thing to be attended to is, that the element must
 not be acted upon by any new forces during the instant (dt).
 During this interval, therefore, every particle in the element
 is acted upon solely by the forces X, Y, Z, which vary or
 may vary with the time, but vary similarly for each of these
particles. In other words, there is no disturbing force intro
duced during (d t) into the system of ultimate particles, which
 together make up the element we are considering; therefore
there can be no disturbance of the relative positions of these
particles. Therefore the number of particles composing the
element remains the same during the interval (dt); and this
condition expressed analytically gives us the equation of con
tinuity.
    Let p be the density of the element at the commencement
of the time (dt); this is supposed to be the same for the whole
of the element; V the volume of the element at the beginning
of (dt) and V at the end. We have then (p' being also the
density at the end of the time (dt))
                            pV=p'V.
    We have now merely to express this condition in another
form. The notation is the same as Poisson's. V-(a"—a)(y'-y)
(2–2): where for (a'—w) we may write 8a, for (y-y), 8 y,
and for (2–2), 82. We have to state in terms of the velocities
(u, v, w) parallel to the coordinate axes, that the variation of
(a'—a)(y'—y)(2–2)p is nothing during the instant (dt). Now
calling the whole differential coefficient of (a'—a)(y'-y)(2'-2)
with regard to the time D.V, and similarly for that of p,
    D, V+ (a'—a)(y'—y) (w-w)+(a'-a') (2–2) (v-v)

the quantities     #.   &c., cannot affect the other two:  according
therefore to a well-known principle, the two parts must sepa
 rately = zero.
     Therefore, finally, dividing out by the common factor 8a.

     It is obvious that this equation only requires that the num
 ber of particles in the element should remain unaltered during
 (dt); but the mode in which it is obtained implies, not only an
 identity in the number of particles at the beginning and end of
 (dt), but an identity of the particles themselves. This obser
 vation has also been made by Poisson, whose words are (art.
 651), “c'est pour abreger que l’on a considéré le volume de
 cette partie du fluide comme infiniment petit; et si l’on divise

 dont chacune renferme meanmoins un nombre extremement
 grand de molecules l'equation [of continuity] exprime réelle
 ment que chacune deces parties renferme toujours les mémes mo

        In all cases where new forces are being continually intro
  duced, as in the flowing of rivers or of water through pipes of
  variable form, it is impossible to calculate the motion, and at
  the same time the equation of continuity is no longer appli
  cable.            But, on the other hand, there are cases in which this
  equation holds, where nevertheless the other three equations
  of motion do not hold, and in fact where there may actually
  occur a split or division in the fluid. As an instance may be
  mentioned the flowing of a stream of water over the edge of a
  perpendicular precipice, where gravity suddenly comes into
  action. In this case the number of particles may remain the
  same in an element which may be conceived to consist of par
  ticles that have fallen over as well as of those that remain. But
  the equation of motion would require the new force of gravity
  to be taken into account.

                 Letter from Mr. Southern to Mr. Wattº. .
      The experiments, of which the particular circumstances are
 hereafter related, were made in 1803, with the view of ascer
 taining, chiefly, the density of steam raised from water under
 different pressures above that of the atmosphere, an apparatus
 having then been made for a different purpose, which seemed
 pretty well adapted to this object, as it did equally so to that
 of ascertaining the latent heat of steam.
      It may be premised, that the thermometers employed in all
the experiments which will be now related, were made and
graduated with the greatest care, the tubes having been accu
rately measured as to the proportional capacity of their dif
ferent parts, the boiling-point of each ascertained, according
to the rules prescribed by a committee of the Royal Society, in
1777, (viz. the bulbs and tubes being in steam when the baro
meter stood at 29-8 inches, this degree of temperature being
called 212°,) and in all cases the bulb and the tube, as high as
the mercury ascended in it, were kept in the steam or the
water whose temperature was to be noted. This latter cir
cumstance was effected in the case of steam, by sliding the
tube of the thermometer through a stuffing-box, or collar,
made tight, till the mercury in it could just be seen above it.
The tube had known marks on it, from which measurements
were taken to the mercury, and thence the temperature
known.
    The quantity of steam was measured by filling a cylinder
with it (inclosed in the steam), whose diameter was about 3'16
inches, and driving it out by the motion of a piston, which had
18 inches stroke regulated by the rotation of a crank. The
solid contents of the piston-rod, which was 0.86 inch dia
meter, diminished the contents of the cylinder, leaving the
quantity discharged each stroke by the motion of the piston,
   " In all the experiments, of which an account is given in this letter, Mr.
Southern was assisted by Mr. William Creighton.

           Southern's Experiments on the Density of Steam,                                       115
very nearly 1807 cubic inches; but as the piston did not rise
h; enough to touch the top that closed the cylinder, and
there was also unavoidably a space between the valve and the
cylinder, these spaces together were computed to equal 1-7
cubic inch. Of course, had the elasticity of the steam been
just equal to that of the atmosphere, no addition to the 1807
cubic inches would need to be made; but as in the three succes
 sive experiments it was about 4, #, and 3 greater, these propor
tions of the spaces would escape when the valve was open that
allowed the discharge of the steam to be made into the atmo
 sphere, and must therefore be added respectively to the con
 tents discharged by the motion of the piston.                                ºf
    These additional quantities are 1.7 x #='57; 1.7 x 3 = 2-83;
 and 1.7 x 3–5'1; which, added to                     ..f.                  131°27 in the
 first experiment; 138°53 in the second, and 1358 in the third,
 for the quantity of steam discharged at each stroke of the pis
 ton; and therefore the number of strokes which would dis
 charge one cubic foot in each of the three experiments, would
 be 13'164, 12.941, and 12724, respectively.
    The steam was conducted from the cylinder, after passing
 the valve, by means of an iron pipe attached to a small copper
 one, having its end bent down, and immersed a short depth
 into a cistern of water.             The cistern was made of fir-wood,
 and painted inside and outside with white paint; was about 30
 inches square, and 26 inches deep; and the quantity of water
 in it was ascertained by weighing it, as was also the accession
 to it by the condensed steam.                                                                        .. . ;
  - The elasticity of the steam was ascertained by measuring
 an actual column of mercury which it supported; and the
 number of strokes was ascertained by a machine called a
 Counter.

       These results appear to support the conclusion that the
density of steam is nearly, if not accurately, proportional to its
 elasticity; at least this may be affirmed of it within the limits

       From the above experiments may be calculated the latent
 heat of steam developed in the three cases; for if the weight
of the water which received the augment of heat, be multiplied
by the number of degrees of temperature communicated to it,
and if this product be divided by the accession of weight to
the water (which only could have communicated the acces
ision of temperature), it is evident that the quotient will give
the temperature which the steam lost; and if to this be added
the temperature which it retained (viz. that of the water in
the cistern at the conclusion of the experiment), a number will
be obtained showing the whole heat, or the sum of the latent
and sensible heat of the steam. Hence, by subtracting the
sensible heat of      iºn from

  "Three other experiments were instituted with the intention
  of ascertaining the latent heat of steam under the three same
  degrees of elasticity, viz. equal to the support of 40, 80 and
  120 inches of mercury. The steam was raised or generated
 in the same boiler used in the previous experiments, and from
  the end of a cast-iron pipe of 1% inch diameter which united
  with it, a small copper pipe was taken (its diameter about
  # inch) and bent down so that its end could conveniently be
 immersed an inch or two under the surface of the water. The
  end of this pipe was closed by a thin disc of copper, in which
  a circular hole was made régth of an inch diameter, through
  which the

  a tinned iron vessel that weighed 377 lbs., and its capacity for
  heat may therefore be called equivalent to 4 lb. of water." In
:* the experiments, the water employed to receive the

      If either of the equations above be applied here to the facts
  noted in this table, the sum of the latent and sensible heat will
  come out 1119°, 1190° and 1228°; and the latent heat 890°,
  920° and 933°. It was observed, however, that the tin vessel
  lost heat to the surrounding air very sensibly, and an experi
  ment was made to determine the amount of this effect; and it

  was found when the contained water was at 80°, 1° was lost
  in five minutes; when at 60°, 1° was lost in ten and a half
  minutes; it would therefore probably lose 1° in eight minutes
  during the time of an experiment, the mean temperature being
  about 65°; and as the excess of temperature at the beginning
  and end of an experiment above that of the air was nearly the
  same in all three, the loss would be nearly proportional to the
  duration of each. Hence, to the acquired heat should be
  added, in the first experiment, 13°; in the second, #9; and
  in the third, #9; being severally proportional to the said du
  ration. These being respectively j to the temperatures
  in column V. and VI., give in the former 81%, 82° and 81}^;
  and, in the latter, 385%, 34° and 833°; and if either of these
  sets of numbers be used in the calculation, according as one
  or the other of the equations is adopted to develope the re
  sults, they will be found to be 1171°, 1212°, and 1245° for
  the sums of the latent and sensible heat; and consequently
  the latent heat in each experiment will be 942°, 942° and
  950°.
     It may be remarked, that no allowance was made in calcu
  lating from the former experiments, for the heat which would
  be taken by the cistern, but which in the first of them, lasting
  two hours, would probably be very sensible, and may account
  for the principal part of the deficiency of latent heat brought
  out by the calculation from that experiment, in comparison
  with that from the two succeeding ones.                      -
                                                                    . . . . .
     The opinion which I entertain from these experiments as
  to the latent heat of steam is, that it is a constant quantity, and
  perhaps this opinion obtains support from the modern dis
  coveries of definite proportions. But it is necessary, however,
  to explain the limitation with which I here use this term,
“constant quantity.” It is well known that if common air be
  expanded, cold is produced *; and it must therefore happen,
  that if a given quantity of it at a given temperature could be
  gradually expanded, and as it was so expanded, gradually
  supplied with heat, so as to keep the temperature unaltered,
  this supply of heat would become latent; the thermometer
  would not show it. It is probable, both from analogy and
  experiment, that this effect takes place in the expansion of
  steam. It is not of this part of its heat, though latent, and in
, the experiments above related undistinguishable, that I would
     * An opportunity occurred to me some years back, which enabled me
  to determine, with tolerable precision, the degree of cold produced by the
  expansion of common air from the bulk of two to three, which I found to
  be 19° or 20°.

 be understood to speak when I state my opinion to be as just
 mentioned; but it is of that which, when water alters, its state
 to that of an elastic fluid, becomes essential to it in every de
 gree of elasticity, besides that which belongs to its expanded
 state. This latter may be called the latent heat of eapansion#,
 while the other may perhaps properly be called constitutional.
    Allow me here to illustrate hypothetically this matter: If
 this essential or constitutional part of latent heat be added to
 water having the necessary portion of sensible heat, and per
 fectly confined in a close vessel, I conceive the water would
 be in the state of an elastic fluid; would in fact be steam, as
 dense as water (possibly compressible, and capable of greater
  density), and would then require no latent heat of expansion;
 but if the containing vessel be now conceived to expand, for
 instance into double the space, I then imagine it would re
 quire some addition of heat during this expansion to maintain
 its proportional elasticity. It must be observed, however,
  that while this expansion was calling for more latent heat, the
  sensible heat necessary for the diminishing elasticity would be
  lessening; but it does not follow that these quantities should
  necessarily balance each othert.
. . When this fluid, steam, is raised in low temperatures, and
  of course under a low degree of elasticity, it obtains from its
 source, at the same instant, not only the constitutional part
  of its latent heat, but also that of expansion, and thus the two
  kinds are confounded; and, in experiments where they are
  developed by total condensation, are only to be detected to
  gether in sum; and it may be that this sum, together with the
  sensible heat, in different states of elasticity, may make a con
 stant quantity; but if the latent heat of expansion from a
  denser to a rarer state be greater than the diminution of the
 sensible heat necessary only for the latter, the sum of the sen
  sible and total latent heat will be more in steam raised in low
  temperatures than in high ones, which the result of your ex
  periments made in low temperatures seems to countenance.
     In all that I have said above, when speaking of steam, I
  have always intended that fluid in the state in which it is raised
  from water, viz. saturated therewith; but undoubtedly this
  fluid, after it is so raised under any temperature, and being
  clear from any additional accession of water, may be heated
  above that temperature, and cooled down to it again with

    Besides the experiments first related, in which the tempe
rature of steam raised under high pressures was observed,
others had been made some years before (in 1797 and 1798) for
that purpose only; and as they were made, with the greatest
circumspection, both the manner of making them and their
results may be here described, as may also the results of other
experiments, made with equal care, to ascertain the tempera
ture of steam raised under low pressures.
    The instrument used in the former was a Papin's digester,
similar to what you had used in your original experiments,
and to that described in the Encyclopædia Britannica, art.
Steam, No. 22, the leading differences being in adapting a
metallic tube to it to contain the thermometer, or rather as
much of it as contained mercury, in the manner mentioned in
the beginning of this letter, and instead of a valve, by the load
on which to measure the elasticity of the contained steam, a
nicely-bored cylinder was applied, with a piston fitting it, so
as to have very little friction, and to the rod of this was ap
plied a lever, constructed to work on edges like those of a .
scale-beam, by which the resistance against the elastic force
of the steam could be accurately determined; and at your
suggestion, to be assured that no inaccuracy had crept into
the calculation, by which this resistance through the medium
of the lever was ascertained, an actual column of mercury of
30 inches high was substituted, and the correspondence was
found to be within Tân of an inch.
   The observations at each of the points of pressure noted
were continued some minutes, the temperature at each being
alternately raised and lowered, so as to make the pressure of
the steam on the under side of the piston alternately too much
and too little for the weight with which it was loaded; and
thence a mean temperature was adopted, the extremes of which
were, as well as I now recollect, not more than half a degree
on each side of it. The load on the piston, including its own
weight, &c., was calculated to be successively just equal to 1,
2, 4, and 8 atmospheres of 29-8 inches of mercury each, and
the temperature of the steam was varied as above till that of
each point was determined: the results were thus—

 To James Watt, Esq., Heathfield.
    P.S. Some circumstances which occurred in the perform
 ance of the experiments (made in 1797 and 1798) of which
 the results are last related, suggested the trials of a mixture
 of air with the steam; and I made a few, not indeed with the
 greatest nicety, but as they furnished a strong probability that
 the following law of elasticity of a given mixture was either
nearly or accurately correct, it may be of use to say, that the
 apparatus used in the steam experiments being prepared as if
for a repetition of them, and as perfectly exhausted of air as
for them, a known measure of common air was sent up the
tube through the mercury and water, and took its place in the
ball; the water surrounding which was heated, and its tempe
rature observed at different periods as before; and indeed the
process was precisely the same as the former, with the addi
tional notice of the space in the ball occupied by the expanded
air and steam jointly. This process was repeated three or
four times with different quantities of air, but the notes not
being preserved, I can only now mention the conclusion they
induced me to form as to the law above-mentioned, viz. that
whatever the elastic force of the air admitted would be in its
expanded state, supposing it dry and to occupy the whole
   * These are inserted from numerous experiments made by Mr. W.
Creighton. Mr. W. Creighton published a theorem for the elasticity of
steam at different temperatures in the Philosophical Magazine, 1819,

 XXV. On the Earhalation of Bicarbonate of Ammonia by the
          Lungs. By LEWIS THoMPson, M.R.C.S., &c.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
 HAYºº lately had             occasion to ascertain the amount of
         moisture given off by the lungs of several healthy indi
 viduals during a fixed period, I was induced to examine the
 nature of the fluid thus condensed. The result has proved
 that bicarbonate of ammonia is constantly exhaled from the
 lungs to the extent of rather more than three grains every
 twenty-four hours for each individual; and although this
 quantity may appear trifling, yet the amount arising from a
 large population like that of London is well worthy of notice,

             *  *               Royal Society. . . . .               125
  and must exceed, 150 tons of solid bicarbonate of ammonia
  per annum; and if, as is extremely probable, other animals
  also exhale this substance, the atmosphere must not only
 always contain enough of this agent for the purposes of vege
 tation, but, by a reciprocal action, the mutual increase of ve
 getables and animals would only tend to render the air better
 adapted for the due development of both. The existence of
 ammonia in the breath may easily be demonstrated, by re
 spiring air which has passed through diluted sulphuric acid,
 and then expiring it through a tube surrounded by water at
 32°F., to the further end of which a vessel is attached to re
 ceive the fluid which condenses. On acidulating this fluid
 with one or two drops of pure muriatic acid and evaporating
 to dryness on a water-bath, a residue will be obtained, which,
 when dissolved in five or six drops of water and introduced
into a small test-tube, will give off ammonia on the addition
of two or three drops of a strong solution of potash, as evi
denced by its action on turmeric paper and muriatic acid, or
 by its peculiar smell. The respiratory process should be con
 tinued for an hour or two.
    It would be interesting to know whether any difference is
observable in the amount of ammonia exhaled from the lungs
of individuals suffering from disease of the kidney, diabetes, &c.

Jan. 7, “   Qº.                Recherches sur l'Arc Voltaigue; et sur
  1847.           l'influence qu'exerce le Magnétisme, soit sur cet Arc,
soit sur les Corps qui transmettent les Courants Electriques Dis
continus.” By M. Auguste De la Rive, Foreign Member of the
 Royal Society, Professor in the Academy of Geneva, Corresponding
Member of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, &c.
    In the first section of this memoir the author gives a detailed de
scription of the phenomena exhibited by the luminous voltaic arc
produced either in a vacuum or in atmospheric air, or in hydrogen
gas, by employing electrodes of different kinds of conducting sub
stances, in the form either of points or of plates. He examines mi
nutely the transfer of particles which takes place from one pole to
the other under these various circumstances, and the differences
which occur when the currents are reversed. He observed that
when a positive metallic point is presented to a negative plate, par
ticles of the former are transported by the voltaic arc, and deposited

126                          Royal Society.
on the latter, forming a ring of a regular form, having as its centre
the projection of the point on the plate. This happens in atmo
spheric air whether highly rarified or of the ordinary density, but
not in hydrogen gas. This deposit consists always of oxidized par
ticles of the positive metal which forms the pointed electrode. In
the case of platinum, the circular spot is of a blue colour, and pre
sents the appearance of the coloured rings of Nobili. This effect
the author is disposed to ascribe to the action of the oxygen brought
by the voltaic current into that particular condition which Schoen
bein first described under the name of Ozone. While this deposit
is taking place, a vivid blue light is emitted.
   In the second section the author investigates the action exerted by
a powerful electro-magnet on the voltaic arc.      He describes the re
markable modifications which the length, the form, and even the
nature of the arc undergoes when the electro-magnet is brought ex
tremely near to it, and the magnetization of the electrodes them
selves, when they are susceptible of that affection by their approxi
mation to the electro-magnet. He notices the singular phenomenon
of a peculiar sound emitted by the luminous arc, when subjected to
this magnetic influence; a sound which varies both in its nature and
its intensity according to the nature, the form and the temperature
of the electrodes, consisting sometimes of a shrill whistle, and at
other times of a series of slight detonations.
   The third section is devoted to the investigation of a remarkable
phenomenon presented by all the conducting bodies while transmit
ting discontinuous electric currents, under the influence of a power
ful electro-magnet; namely, the emission of a sound resembling that
of the revolving toothed-wheel in Savart's experiments. This sound
is distinctly heard, and is peculiarly loud with prismatic bars of lead,
bismuth, tin, &c., about three-quarters of an inch square and a foot
and a half long, whether placed in the direction of a line joining the
poles of an electro-magnet, or in a direction at right angles to such
line: it was weakened only by increasing the distance between the
poles and the bar. The intensity of the sound appeared to depend
much less on the nature of the substance which was subjected to
this action, than on its form, its volume, and its mass.   All conduct
ing bodies, whatever may be their nature, or state of aggregation,
are capable of yielding these sounds. They are produced by char
 coal of all kinds and shape. Mercury contained in a cylindrical
 glass tube, of similar dimensions with the metallic bars, emits a
sound of great intensity; and a still louder sound arises from a wire
coiled as a helix around a cylinder of wood, and also by tubes formed
of different metals. Similar phenomena are also observable by the
action of a helical coil substituted for the electro-magnet.
    On the whole, the author arrives at the conclusion that the phe
nomena noticed in this paper are altogether molecular, and that they
establish the following principles: first, that the passage of the elec
tric current modifies, even in solid bodies, the arrangement of the
particles; and secondly, that the action of magnetism, in like man
ner, produces an analogous modification in the molecular constitu

tion of all bodies. This has already been demonstrated by Faraday
in the case of transparent bodies, in its effects on polarized light;
and is now extended by M. De la Rive to opaque conducting bodies,
by employing, instead of polarized light, a discontinuous electric
Current.
   “On the Ganglia and Nerves of the Virgin Uterus.” By Robert
Lee, M.D., F.R.S., &c.
   The author states that his recent dissections have enabled him to
verify the descriptions he gave of the ganglia and nerves of the
uterus in his papers already published in the Philosophical Trans
actions, and also to detect the existence of ganglia situated in the
muscular coat of the uterus, and of plexuses of nerves accompanying
all the blood-vessels and absorbents ramifying in its walls, between
the peritoneum and lining membrane. By examining the hearts of
a foetus, of a child of six years of age, of an adult in the sound state,
a human heart greatly hypertrophied, and the heart of an ox, he
found that there exists a striking analogy between the ganglia and
nerves of the uterus and those of the heart. He ascertained by
microscopic observation that the muscular and vascular structures
of the auricles and ventricles are endowed with numerous ganglia
and plexuses of nerves, which, as far as he knows, have not yet been
described, and which enlarge simultaneously with the natural growth
of the heart, and also continue to enlarge during its morbid condi
tions of hypertrophy. The author also finds that the size of the
ganglia and nerves of the left auricle and ventricle, in the normal
state, is more than deuble that of the corresponding parts on the
right side. A description is then given of two elaborate drawings
which accompany the paper.
   “On a new and practical form of Voltaic Battery of the highest
powers, in which Potassium forms the positive element.” By John
Goodman, Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., A.M.,
Sec. R.S.
    The author succeeded in constructing a voltaic arrangement of
some power by fixing a piece of potassium to the end of a copper
wire, placed in a tube containing naphtha, and bringing it in con
tact with a small quantity of mercury, held by a layer of bladder
 closing the lower end of the tube, which was itself immersed in
 acidulated water immediately over a piece of platinum, and then
 completing the circuit by establishing a metallic contact between
 the copper wire and the platinum. This battery acted with energy
 on the galvanometer, and effected the decomposition of water. A
 series of twelve pairs of similar plates exhibited a sensible attraction
 of a slip of gold leaf. Thus it appears that the substance which
possesses the highest chemical affinity manifests also the greatest
power of electrical tension.
    Jan. 21. “On Photographic Self-registering Meteorological and
Magnetical Instruments.” By Francis Ronalds, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
    The apparatus employed by the author at the Kew Observatory,
 and which he terms the Photo-Electrograph, is described by him
 in the following words:—“A rectangular box, about sixteen inches

  128                    …     Royal Society.
  long and three square, constitutes the part usually called the body of
  a kind of lucernal microscope. A voltaic electrometer (properly
  insulated, and in communication with an atmospheric conductor) is
  suspended within the microscope, through an aperture in the upper
  side, and near to the object end. That end itself is closed by a plane
  of glass, when daylight is used, and by condensing lenses, when a
  common Argand lamp is employed. In either case an abundance
  of light is thrown into the microscope. Between the electrometer
  and the ether, or eye-end of the microscope, fine aghromatic lenses
  are placed, which have the double effect of condensing the light
  upon a little screen, situated at that eye-end, and of projecting a
  strong image of the electrometer, in deep oscuro, upon it. Through
 the screen a very narrow slit, of proper curvature, is cut (the chord
  of the arc being in a horizontal position), and it is fitted into the
 back of a case, about two-and-a-half feet long, which case is fixed
 to the eye-end of the microscope, at right angles with its axis, and
 vertically. Within the case is suspended a frame, provided with a
 rabbet, into which two plates of pure thin glass can be dropped, and
 brought into close contact by means of six little bolts and nuts.
 This frame can be removed at pleasure from a line, by which it is
 suspended, and the line, after passing through a small aperture
 (stopped with grease) cut through the upper end of the long case,
 is attached to a pulley (about four inches in diameter), fixed, with
 capacity of adjustment, on the hour arbor of a good clock. Lastly,
 counterpoises, rollers, springs, and a straight ruler are employed for
 ensuring accurate rectilineal sliding of the frame, when the clock is
set in motion.
    “A piece of properly prepared photographic paper is now placed
between the two plates of glass in the moveable frame; the frame
is removed (in a box made purposely for excluding light), and is
suspended in the long case; this is closed, so as to prevent the possi
bility of extraneous light entering with it; the clock is started, and
the time of starting is noted.
    “All that part of the paper which is made to pass over the slit in
the screen, by the motion of the clock, becomes now therefore suc
cessively exposed to a strong light, and is consequently brought into
a state which fits it to receive a dark colour on being again washed
with the usual solution, excepting those small portions upon which
dark images of the lower parts of the pendulums of the electrometer
are projected through the slit. These small portions of course re
tain the light colour of the paper; and from the long curved lines
or bands, whose distances form each other, at any given part of the
photograph, i.e. at any given time indicate the electric tension of
the atmosphere at that time.
    “By certain additions to the instrument above described, the kind
as well as the tension of electrical charge is capable of being re
gistered; and by the employment also of a horizontal thermometer,
&c., it is adapted to the purposes of a Thermograph, as well as
Photo-barometrograph and Magnetograph.”

     February 1846.-The Mathematical Theory of the two great So
  litary Waves of the first Order. By S. Earnshaw, M.A.
     The nomenclature of this paper is adopted from a Report on
  Waves by Mr. J. S. Russell, printed in the Proceedings of the
  British Association. From the extreme comprehensiveness of the
  equations of fluid motion, the author infers a necessity of appealing
  to experiments for the suggestion of data which may be used in mo
  difying the generality of those equations so as to suit actual cases of
  known fluid motion. With this view he has made use of the expe
  riments recorded in Mr. Russell's report, and thence selected the two
  following properties:—1st. The velocity of transmission of a wave in
  a uniform canal is constant. 2nd. The horizontal velocity is the same
  for all particles situated in a vertical plane, cutting the axis of the
  canal at right angles. By reference to Mr. Russell's report, it will
  be seen that these two properties, selected on account of their sim
  plicity and ready experimental examination, are distinguishing cha
  racteristics of what he has denominated the two great solitary waves
  of the first order. By the aid of them the equations of motion take
  such modified forms as to admit of exact integration; so that
  without employing any analytical approximations the author is en
  abled to obtain theoretical expressions for all the circumstances of
  the two solitary waves. The results are tested by a comparison of
  the velocities of transmission of various waves given by theory and
  by experiment. The greatest difference of these in the case of the
  positive wave is not found to exceed ºth part of the whole velocity;
  but in the case of the negative wave it is found to be much greater,
  and to amount in one instance to as much as #th of the whole velo
  city. The reason of this discrepancy is conjectured; and the agree
  ment in the case of the positive wave is considered to be exact.
     It is found in the course of the investigation that one of the me
  cessary conditions of fluid motion is not satisfied; and it is shown
  that it cannot be satisfied as long as the two principles, adopted from
  Mr. Russell's report, are supposed to coexist.      They are proved in
  fact to be incompatible with each other.      But as the second prin
- ciple was found by Mr. Russell to be so nearly exact that he could
  not detect any deviation from it in his experiments, it is shown by
  theory that from this circumstance there will be a rapid degradation
  of the summit of the wave, and a consequent loss of the velocity of
  its transmission, both which results of theory were observed to be
  true experimentally. The memoir concludes with pointing out the
  agreement of theory with some minor phaenomena noticed by Russell.
     May 25, 1846.-Cases of Morbid Rhythmical Movements, with
  observations. By G. E. Paget, M.D., Fellow of Caius College and
  of the Royal College of Physicians, London.
     Seven cases were related.    The movements were vibratory, rota
  tory, bowing, &c.     In some of the cases they were incessant; in
  others paroxysmal; and in others again they were of both kinds,

the predominant movement being replaced at intervals by distinct
paroxysms.
   On a comparison of these cases with the few others on record,
and with the experiments of Flourens and Majendie, it was inferred
as probable, that one class of the movements, viz. the rotatory, de
pended on disorder in the cerebellum or its transverse commissure,
the pons. With regard to the other movements, it appeared that
there were no sufficient grounds for even a probable conjecture as       t
to the particular part of the encephalon, the excitement or disorder
of which might act as an immediate cause of the movements.
   The remote causes were such as under other circumstances are
known to excite the common convulsive diseases, such as chorea and
epilepsy. These remote causes were in most cases eccentric.

   Nov. 13, 1846.—An Explanation of the observed Irregularities
in the Motion of Uranus, on the Hypothesis of Disturbance caused
by a more distant Planet; with a Determination of the Mass, Orbit,
and Position of the disturbing body. By J. C. Adams, Esq., M.A.,
F.R.A.S., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge*.
   The author introduces the subject by remarking, that when Bou
vard constructed his Tables of Uranus (those now commonly in use),
he found it impossible to reconcile the ancient observations, made
before the discovery of Uranus as a planet, with the modern obser
vations, and that therefore in the formation of his tables he relied
solely upon the latter; but that in a very few years the still more
modern observations exhibited a departure from the tables nearly as
great as the ancient ones, and therefore there seemed now to be no
sufficient reason for rejecting the ancient observations. The author
then states that his attention was first directed to this subject by
reading the report on the recent progress of astronomy made to the
British Association at their meeting in Oxford; and that in July
1841 he formed a design of investigating the yet unaccounted-for
motions of Uranus, in order to discover whether they could be ex
plained by an exterior disturbing planet. In 1843 he made a first .
attempt, supposing the orbit of the disturbing planet to be a circle,
and its mean distance twice that of Uranus.       This investigation was
founded exclusively on the modern observations, using, as far as 1821,
the errors given in the equations of condition in Bouvard's tables,
and for subsequent years the errors given in the Astronomische
Nachrichten, and the Cambridge and Greenwich Observations. The
result showed a good general agreement of the observed disturbance
with the disturbance which would be produced by the action of such
a planet. In February 1844, the author received from the Astro
   * This paper was presented to the Society on the evening of Nov. 13,
1846. It has since been published entire as an extract from the Appendix
to the Nautical Almanac for 1851.

nomer Royal the results of the general reduction of the Greenwich
Planetary Observations.
   In the meantime the Göttingen Academy had proposed for the
subject of a prize the theory of Uranus, and though the author had
no hope of being able to complete an essay in time to compete for
the prize, he was stimulated by the publication of this proposal again.
to enter on the investigation. He now took into account the pos
sible eccentricity of the disturbing planet to the first order, retaining
the same assumption for mean distance.        For the modern observa
tions, the tabular errors used, as far as 1830, were exclusively those
of the Greenwich Observations, except one by Bessel in 1823; after
1830 the Cambridge and Greenwich determinations and those in
the Astronomische Nachrichten were used.         Those for the obser
vations anterior to the discovery of the planet were taken from
Bouvard.
. Results for the elements of the disturbing planet were obtained,
which were communicated in September 1845 to Prof. Challis, and
in October 1845 (slightly altered) to the Astronomer Royal. After
wards the investigation was repeated, supposing the mean distance
diminished by about ºth part. The results were communicated to
the Astronomer Royal in September 1846. They seemed to show that
the mean distance ought to be still further diminished.
    The author, after adverting to the dates of M. Le Verrier's papers,
 and showing that his own calculations were earlier in date, says, “I
 mention these dates merely to show that my results were arrived at
 independently and previously to the publication of M. Le Verrier,
 and not with the intention of interfering with his just claims to the
 honours of the discovery; for there is no doubt that his researches
 were first published to the world, and led to the actual discovery of
 the planet by Dr. Galle, so that the facts stated above cannot de
 tract, in the slightest degree, from the credit due to M. Le Verrier.
    The investigations proceeded as follows:—First, to diminish the
 number of equations, the results were collected in groups of three
 years each ; and these were so arranged as to present results nearly
 independent of the error of radius vector. Thus twenty-one equations
 were obtained; and these, without extension for the two or three
 last years (which might subsequently have been included, but which
 would have disturbed the similarity of the calculations) were also
 used in the subsequent calculations for a different assumed mean di
 stance. Then all the principal inequalities in the recognised theory
 of Uranus were verified, and corrections for an error pointed out by
 Bessel, and for the altered mass of Jupiter, were applied, as well as
 for some terms of the second order of masses pointed out by Hansen.
 Other inequalities of higher orders were neglected; as their effects
 may be represented, either by a very slow alteration of the epoch
 and mean motion, or by a very slow alteration of the perihelion and
 eccentricity; both which may, without sensible error, be assumed
 as constant, during the comparatively short period through which
  Uranus has been observed. The author then gives a table of the
 differences between the theoretical longitudes (thus corrected), and
 the observed longitudes: the maximum values are as follows:–

           In 1712 m +937 tº ºn.                 In 1804                 +24.2
              1750      –47-6.       . . ..              1840            -66-6
 These are then converted into corresponding errors of mean longi
 tude, which the author finds more convenient.
. Then, formulae are investigated for the effects of small corrections
 of the elements of the orbit of Uranus, and for the perturbations of
 mean longitude produced by a disturbing planet, expressed in the
 notation of Pontécoulant. These are expanded as far as the second
 order of eccentricities (involving only the first power of the eccen
 tricity of the unknown planet), and the whole is reduced to numbers,
 with no symbols remaining, except for functions of the corrections
 of the elements of Uranus, and functions of the epoch, longitude of
perihelion, eccentricity and mass, of the disturbing planet. All the
numerical quantities are computed on the supposition that the mean
distance is double that of Uranus.           Any one of these expressions,
 adapted to a certain time, being made equal to the error in the ta
bular place of Uranus for the same time, furnishes an equation of
condition.
    These equations of condition are treated by the method of least
squares; and the successive steps of elimination are given. The
author considers that the modern observations are scarcely sufficient
to give the eccentricity and longitude of perihelion of the disturbing
planet; but when the ancient observations (always omitting that of
1690 as uncertain) are combined, there are ample means for deter
mining these elements. The equations, after the elimination had
proceeded to a certain degree, were solved by successive substitu
tion.    The results thus obtained were—
                                 Hypothesis I.
              Assumed mean distance = 2 x that of Uranus.

        Mass (that of the sun being 1).................... 0'0001656
which were communicated to the Astronomer Royalin October 1845.
   The author then states that he made a second investigation, on
the supposition that the mean distance of the disturbing planet
= mean distance of Uranus ×                    The process, with very little
difference, is the same as that for the former assumption of mean di
stance. The formulae, the equations, &c., are given in the same man
ner as before.    The elements obtained thus are as follows:—
                                   Hypothesis II.
             Assumed mean distance = 1942 x that of Uranus.

        Mass (that of the sun being 1).....................               0-00 01:5003
   The corrections to the elements of the orbit of Uranus are inves
tigated on both hypotheses. Then on substituting the effects of the

                     Royal Astronomical Society.                        133
corrections and the effects of the perturbations, the residual errors are
obtained, of which the following are the maximum values:—

   After this time, to the year 1840, the largest error is 2"-35.
   After 1840, the errors increase on both hypotheses. They are,
                                  Hypoth. I.      Hypoth. II.

It appears from this extremely probable that the mean distance of
the disturbing planet ought to be assumed nearly = mean distance

 It seems probable that these errors would be increased by still further
diminishing the mean distance.
    Expressions are then investigated for the correction of radius vector
produced by the correction of elliptic elements, and by the effects of
perturbation.     The numerical values are as follows:–

    The author states that no satisfactory results could be found for
 the node and inclination of the planet's orbit, as deduced from the
 irregularities in the latitude of Uranus.
    The author then remarks that the perturbations of Saturn pro
 duced by the new planet will be undoubtedly sensible; and he sug
 gests that it would be interesting to examine anew the theory of
 Saturn, and to ascertain whether the masses of Jupiter and Uranus
 deduced from it are consistent with those obtained by other methods.
 He remarks that the published reductions of the Greenwich Obser
 vations now make such an inquiry comparatively easy.

    Mr. Lassell forwarded a more complete account of his physical
observations on Le Verrier's planet, with his Newtonian reflector,
2-feet aperture, mounted equatoreally:—
    Oct. 3. He received an impression of a ring, not much open, and
nearly at right angles to the parallel of daily motion. Speculum A
and plane metallic reflector.
    Oct. 10. The same impression of a ring in the same direction. A
minute star just steadily visible, with full aperture of 24 inches,
powers 316 to 567, distance 2# to 3 diameters, a little to the right,
and apparently below the ring continued. Speculum B and Merz's
prism.
    Nov. 10. The planet very like Saturn, as seen with a small tele
scope and low power, but much fainter. Same speculum and prism
as before.
    Nov. 11. The planet still retains its appearance. A faint point
of light considerably distant, in the direction of the ring and below
it.   Speculum A and plane reflector.
    On these nights several persons saw the supposed ring, and all in
the same direction, as shown by independent diagrams.
    Nov. 30. A minute star above, and a little to the left of the con
tinuation of the ring, distance 2 diameters. Speculum B and Merz's
prism.
    Dec. 3. The same relative appearance exactly of planet and small
star as on October 10th. The direction of the ring estimated at
about 70° with the parallel of daily motion. The small star about
3 diameters distant and 50° N. following. Telescope as before.
    Dec. 4. No minute star visible, though carefully looked for. Te
lescope as before.
    Mr. Lassell says that the points of light seen on Oct. 10, Nov.30,
and Dec. 3, were, so far as he could judge, the same in appearance
and brightness. There were no other stars in the immediate neigh
bourhood. Hence he conceives the probability is in favour of the
star being a satellite.
    With respect to the ring, Mr. Lassell says that “he has never
looked at the planet, under tolerable circumstances, without receiving
the same impression of its existence;” and that so far as he can
judge, the direction of the supposed ring makes a constant angle
with the meridian, and not with the horizon; but this is not very
certain.
    In speaking of the quality of his telescope, Mr. Lassell says that
he finds Merz's prism gives him more light than a plane reflector,

                     Royal Astronomical Society.                   135
and with no loss of distinctness; and that he has succeeded in bring
ing the foci of his exterior and inner surface to agree within a hun
dredth of an inch. The telescope shows seven stars in and two near
the trapezium of Orion, and so far approaches to resolving the ne
bula, that it shows “stars, the centres of nebulous clouds, scattered
all over the nebula.”
   In confirmation of Mr. Lassell's idea that there is a ring about the
new planet, Mr. Hind stated that the South Villa telescope shows it
oblong, and that the major axis makes an angle of about 30° with
the meridian.
   Reduction of Tycho Brahe's Observations of the Comet of 1590,
with Elements deduced therefrom. By Mr. Hind.
    “The comet of 1590 was first perceived by Tycho Brahe on the
evening of March 5, while he was employed in observing the planet
Venus.     It was situated near the Northern Fish, between Aries and
Andromeda.      The diameter of the head was three minutes, and a
faint tail was visible, extending from 7° to 10°, and directed towards
the zenith at about 7h 30m P.M.
    “M. Pingré, in his Cometographie, tomei. p. 554, has given a series
 of observations on this comet made by Tycho, and extracted from a
manuscript preserved at the Dépôt de la Marine in Paris. The
observations are detailed at considerable length in this manuscript;
but the table in M. Pingré's work is an abstract made by Tycho
 himself, and I have used it as the basis of my calculations. For
 deducing the places of the comet, we have the apparent times of
 observation at Uraniburg, the distances from known stars, and the
 declinations for the same times as these distances: also in most
 cases, the comet's altitude, and frequently its azimuth from the south
 towards the west. I have calculated the positions from the observed
 declinations and distances, duly corrected for parallax and refraction,
 making use of the altitudes in the preliminary computations only.
On two occasions the comet was observed on the meridian sub polo;
 in these cases I have performed the reductions in the usual manner,
 applying refraction and parallax.”
    Mr. Hind then presents tabular results of his reductions at the
 following stages:—
    An ephemeris of the sun.
    A catalogue of the stars of comparison.
    An approximate ephemeris of the comet, for computing the effects
 of aberration and parallax.
    The observed distances of the comet from the stars corrected for
 refraction, aberration and parallax, with the Uraniburg mean time,
 and the resulting right ascension and declination of comet.
    “The following longitudes and latitudes are computed from a mean
 of each day's observations of right ascension and declination, omit
 ting, however, the third result for March 6, and the first for March 7.
 They are referred to the apparent equinox of the date:

   On Luminous Rings round Shadows. By the Rev. Baden Powell,
Savilian Professor of Geometry, Oxford. . . . . . . " "
   The remarkable optical phaenomena attending total solar eclipses,
especially the formation of a luminous ring round the discs, are now
on the whole so well established, that speculations have been ha
zarded as to their cause : and though these speculations, as yet
scarcely amount to more than very general illustrations, yet as ex
perimental facts have been elicited which seem to bear a resemblance
to the phaenomena in question, they deserve notice, even in the pre
sent uncertain state of the inquiry.
   The author disclaims any idea of bringing forward such facts as
a complete explanation; but he is induced to offer them because one
experiment devised by him long since was thought by the late Mr.
Baily worthy of being laid before the Society, though communicated
to him without any such intention. (Ast. Soc. Notices, March 10,
 1843.)           -
   The following is the author's historical summary of the observa
tions of the luminous ring :-
    The phaenomenon appears to have been observed as early as the
time of Plutarch, as appears by a passage from him cited in the
 Comptes Rendus, 1842, i. 847. In more modern times, probably the
 earliest recorded instance is in the eclipse of 1567 [this is clearly
 wrong in date or name] observed by Kepler. The ring was observed
 at Naples in 1605 (Phil. Trans. vol. xl. 177); and from the year
 1706 we have the full and well-known records of the most eminent
 astronomers down to the present day, which establish the phaeno
 menon as a regular part of the appearance of a total eclipse. The
 author refers to instances in the Mem. Ast. Soc., vol. i. p. 144, and
 vol. x. p. 9–16, 37, &c., and to the Notices of this Society, vol. v.
 p. 207; as also to the Comptes Rendus for 1842, parts 1 and 2. He
 remarks that remarkable discrepancies are found in the accounts of
 the same, as well as of different eclipses, and he mentions instances.
 Some of these discrepancies admit of easy explanation. In the tran
 sit of Venus in 1769 light was seen surrounding the part of the pla
 net off the sun, both at immersion and emersion; but this has been
 ascribed to her atmosphere. (Ast. Soc. Mem. vol. x. p. 27.) The
 singular protuberances observed in the eclipses of 1733 and 1842 do
 not seem to belong to the ring; and it seems to the author hardly con
 ceivable that they can be purely optical phaenomena, as suggested
 by M. Walz and M. Arago.
    The author next gives an account of the attempts of different
 astronomers to assign a cause for the luminous ring. Kepler con
 sidered it to be due either to combustion round the sun, or to refrac
 tion of his rays by the moon's atmosphere. Others have more ge
 nerally attributed it to some peculiar effect of the solar atmosphere;
 and some, especially Olbers, expressly attribute it to the zodiacal
 light. De l'Isle, and more lately Arago and Walz, regard it altogether

 as a phaenomenon of diffraction. Several instances are then given
 of luminous rings surrounding terrestrial objects seen in shadow, as
 observed by different philosophers.
    Experimental imitations of the luminous ring, by artificially eclip
 sing the sun, were long ago made by De l'Isle and La Hiri (Mém.
Acad. Paris, 1715, p. 166), and such an intimation is also spoken of
by Mr. Baily (Ast. Soc. Notices, vol. v. p. 212).
    Among the experiments described by Newton in the third book
 of his Optics, one, which is emphatically mentioned as unfinished,
 seems to bear closely on the present subject. The sun's light being
admitted through a hole one quarter of an inch in diameter, and
partly intercepted by a knife-edge fixed along one side of a hole
three quarters of an inch square in a screen, and falling on a paper
beyond, Newton saw “two streams of faint light shoot out both
ways from the beam of light into the shadow like the tails of comets.”
Again, placing his eye to receive the light, he saw “a line of light
 upon the edge (of the knife) all along it.”. . . . “It was contiguous to
 the edge and narrower than the innermost fringe,” and “between the
 edge and the first fringe.” Newton thus clearly distinguishes be
 tween this peculiar phaenomenon and the ordinary effects of diffrac
tion.
   The author then proceeds to detail his experiments made for the
purpose of producing the luminous ring, remarking that the essential
conditions in all diffraction experiments are, that the origin of the
light be as nearly a point as may be, and that the area of the rays
diverging from it extend beyond the edge of the opake diffracting
body.
   He finds that with apertures up to a quarter of an inch or more,
and whether the area of the rays reach beyond the edge of the
opake body, or lie even considerably within it, a small circular disc,
seen at a distance, either with or without a telescope, is edged by a
bright luminous ring, which cannot be seen with the eye-lens, and is
therefore not an optical image like the diffraction fringes, but is seen
in the telescope distinctly when in focus for the opake disc. With
a straight edge the same phaenomenon is observed as a line of light
running along it. If the origin be a lens of short focus the ring is
seen as before, but less perfectly; while the diffraction fringes are
seen perfectly with the eye-lens. The origin being a hole, the ring
is visible under different variations of the area of the rays, but ceases
to be visible when the area is less than about a quarter of the disc.
Changes in the distance of the eye from the disc produce very little,
if any, change in the breadth of the ring.
   The ring was examined by a telescope with cross-wires in its
focus. The intersection of the wires was fixed on the edge of the
disc before the light was admitted, and on its admission the ring
extended sensibly beyond; on its being then fixed on the edge of
the ring, the edge of the disc fell within it on shutting out the light.
The experiment was repeated in various ways to determine the in
fluence of reflexion from the edge, &c.
   When the area is a hole, the disc being within the area of the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              139
 rays, if the shadow of the disc be examined by an eye-lens of two
 inches' focus, there appear at all points of the circumference streaks
 of yellowish light radiating into the shadow, and crossing at the
 centre they form there a round bright spot; but the streaks are
 supposed to be chiefly due to irregularities in the edge. An analo
 gous phaenomenon is seen when a straight edge is used. A modifi
 cation of the same phaenomenon is observed in the case described by
 the author to the British Association, at the meeting in 1846.
    The experiments above were all made by means of the sun's light.
 There are well-known difficulties in performing any diffraction ex
 periments by candle-light; but the author succeeded in exhibiting
 the ring by means of the light of a flame placed in the focus of a
 short lens limited by a circular aperture. When the shadow is
 thrown on a white screen at about one foot distance from the disc,
 the middle of the shadow appears faintly illuminated; but no streaks,
 as in the case of solar light, could be detected, nor is the faint illu
 mination perceptible to the eye viewing the disc directly. The
 author in conclusion makes mention of the theory of M. Babinet,
 which attempts to explain the phaenomenon on the undulatory hy
 pothesis on this principle, that “at points exterior to the area of the
 rays there is no light, owing to the natural destruction of the secon
 dary waves. If, then, of the two rays proceeding to any such point
 to destroy each other we intercept one by an obstacle, the other re
 mains, and gives rise to a point of light at that point; that is, just
 beyond the obstacle, a series of luminous points thus created by the
 removal of interfering rays will give rise to the luminous borders
 on the edge.” (Nouv. Bulletin des Sciences, Nov. 1832. Quetelet,
Appendix to Translation of Herschel on Light.)
   The author, in conclusion, remarks that, imperfect as the whole
investigation confessedly is, it is by thus making the facts known
that we may most reasonably hope to elicit some better elucida
tion of them.

                          THE CENTRAL SUN.
   Professor Mädler of Dorpat, has published a pamphlet, in
which he announces his belief that the centre of the great nebula
in which our system lies, or of the congeries of stars which form the
Milky Way, is in the Pleiades; and that the star Alcyone is more likely
than any other to merit the title of the Central Sun. This question
is not like that of an asserted planet—one which can soon be settled
in the affirmative. If within the next half-century opinion on the
subject should have arrived at something like either positive recep
tion or positive rejection, it is perhaps as much as can now be ex
pected. Meanwhile the pamphlet is before us (Die Central Sonne,
Leipzig, 1847), and its leading points are, shortly, as follows:–
   The observations of astronomers have made it highly probable,
and Professor Mädler considers it as an established fact, that New
ton's law of gravitation reigns throughout the sidereal space, and
governs the movements of all stars; which he thinks chiefly proved
by the nature of the orbits of binary systems.              . . . .
    Setting out from this fundamental principle, he shows that, what
ever may be the form of a system of fixed stars, the proper move
ments of the individual bodies must be accelerated as the distance
from the central point increases, and that all the times of revolution
of these different bodies around their common centre are nearly
 equal, as long as the mass in the centre of attraction has not too
 considerable a predominance over all the other masses.
    By a very extensive and laborious set of observations and com
parisons, the Professor found that the group of the Pleiades forms
the only point in the heavens to which the preceding conclusion is
applicable; that really the velocity of the true proper movements of
the fived stars increases insensibly from this group in all directions;
and that, moreover, most of them are moving in the same sense.
    He therefore assigns the Pleiades as the central group of that
stellar system which is terminated by the Milky Way (to which our
own and all the isolated suns belong), and the star Alcyone as that
body which, most probably, is the proper central sun of this system.
    From the proper movement and parallax of 61 Cygni (taking the
latter = 0"-3483), he attempts to deduce the distance of Alcyone
from our sun, and obtains the following approximate results:–
   The parallax of Alcyone = 0"-006097, or the distance from the sun
34 millions of radii of the earth's orbit.     . .        -

 18,200,000 years, and moves in its orbit at the rate of 36-8 English
 miles per second.              of .                J -) ( –     j i: * : * :
    The sum of all the masses contained within a globe described
 around Alcyone with the radius vector of the solar system amounts
 to 117,400,000 times the mass of the sun.
    The ascending node of the sun's orbit is situated in long. 236°58'
 of the ecliptic of 1840; and the sun will pass through this point
 about the year. 154,500 of our chronology.
    The inclination of the sun's orbit to the ecliptic of 1840 is 84° 0'.
   Regarding the constitution of this immense system, Professor
 Mädler has come to the following conclusions:— . . ,
   The centre is marked by a group consisting of a great number of
stars and considerable individual masses.          Around this stretches a
narrow zone, comparatively devoid of stars. Then follows a broad
and rich ring-shaped layer, then another intermediate zone compa
ratively poor, and so on, a succession of a still unknown number of
rings, the two utmost of which form the Milky Way. These rings
are connected in several places with each other by intermediate parts,
like bridges; and the rings themselves are not everywhere of the
same density, but show now and then something approaching to the
formation of groups. In general, however, they consist only of
isolated, single or double stars.                   -                       -
   In the course of his investigations, the learned Professor points
out the importance of studying more closely the proper movements
of the fixed stars; and recommends chiefly those in the neighbour
hood of the Pleiades to the attention of astronomers.-Athenaeum,

oN THE FERMENTATIon of TARTAR1c Acid AND ITS PRODUCTS.
                     BUTYRO-ACETIC ACID.      BY M. NICKLES,
   In preparing tartaric acid from crude tartar, it often happens,
during the heat of summer, that the tartrate of lime still containing
some fermentable matters, suddenly begins to ferment, and is con
verted, in a short time, into an acid which has long been taken for
acetic acid.              -
   On the occurrence of this fermentation, M. Noellner saturated the
product with oxide of lead, and obtained fine octahedral crystals, on
attentively examining which, he considered them as the salt of a
peculiar acid different from acetic acid, and to which he          .        the
name of pseudo-acetic acid. An experiment performed with crude
tartar, without the addition of lime, yielded merely acetic acid.
   M. Berzelius, in his Annual Report for 1843, p. i22, considers this
acid as a mixture of acetic and butyric acids. M. Noellner, however,
had obtained a salt of lead crystallizing in octahedrons, a salt of soda
also octahedral, and a mammillated magnesian salt, none of which,
forms occur in the corresponding salts of acetic and butyric acids,
   To clear up the point, M. Nickles saturated eight pounds of crude
tartar with lime; the filtered liquor was boiled with gypsum ; the

142           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
tartrate of lime produced by the second reaction was added to that
obtained by the first, with all the organic substances, and exposed to
a fine summer sun at a temperature of 95° to 104°F. and 113°F.
The disengagement of gas took place very slowly, and it required
six weeks to produce a small quantity of a substance possessing all
the properties about to be described.
    It appears from the experiments of M. Nicklès, that changes ef
fected in tartaric acid by fermentation, may take place in three modes;
if this acid be free or combined with potash, it is converted into acetic
and carbonic acids; if the potash be replaced with lime, the tartaric
acid yields carbonic acid, acetic acid and butyric acid (pseudo-acetic
acid); and lastly, under circumstances which as yet are undetermined,
the tartaric acid is converted into carbonic acid, acetic acid, and a
new acid which M. Nicklès calls butyro-acetic acid, it containing the
 elements both of butyric and acetic acids, and these acids occur
 among the products of its decomposition.
    On determining the silver of a salt which M. Noellner had sent
 to M. Nicklès, the latter obtained the same result as the former;
 when, however, the acid was set free by the decomposition of the
 salt of lead with sulphuric acid, then saturated with carbonate of
 ammonia and precipitated by nitrate of silver at a boiling heat, M.
 Nicklès obtained, at first, fine crystals of acetates, and then from the
 residual solution, magnificent dendritical crystals of butyrate of
 silver. The separation of the two acids may also be effected by
 chloride of calcium; this salt dissolves the acetic acid only, whereas
 the butyric acid collects it in an oily form on the surface; M. Nicklès
 states several new facts as to the mode in which a mixture of acetic
 and butyric acid acts. Thus butyric acid does not precipitate acetate
 of lead if mixed with a small quantity of acetic acid. The influence of
 the latter extends yet further; if a mixture of butyric and acetic
 acids be saturated with oxide of lead, and excess of ammonia be
 added, small rose-coloured acicular surbasic crystals of butyrate of
 lead are formed, which owing to a small quantity of interposed ace
 tate are soluble in water.    This surbasic salt absorbs carbonic acid
 rapidly from the air. A mixture of acetate and butyrate of barytes
 is capable of dissolving a large quantity of chloride of lead, but
 without forming any definite compound.
     Butyro-acetic acid possesses properties which prevent its being
 considered as a mere mixture of butyric and acetic acids. It was
 obtained by the decomposition of a salt of lead which had been ex
 posed to the air more than two years; its odour resembles that of a
 mixture of the two acids, but less pungent; it is soluble in water, al
 cohol and aether. It is obtained pure by decomposing its salt of soda
 by phosphoric acid; it then rises to the surface of the liquid in the
 state of an oily stratum; its boiling-point is nearly 284°F. When
 heated with sulphuric acid, it is slightly altered with the evolution of
 sulphurous acid gas.
     The crude acid yields a liquid which produces with barytes a
 prismatic compound; it is very soluble in water, especially when
 hot, and but slightly soluble in absolute alcohol; it is perfectly per

manent in the air, but still yields the odour of rancid butter. Ex
posed to a current of dry air at 212°, this salt loses 3:25 per cent. of
water; at 392° it fuses, and again loses 2.80 per cent. Thus dried,
the salt consists of [Cº(Hº Bay O*]. By dry distillation it yields a non
acid oily body; the last mother-waters yield acetate of barytes.
Butyro-acetic acid readily yields an aether with alcohol and sulphuric
acid. It has the smell of fruit. With respect to this acid, it will
be observed that it is isomeric with metacetonic acid, obtained during
the last year by M. Gottlieb from potash and sugar. M. Nicklès
has not had sufficient opportunity to ascertain the identity of these
two acids,-Journ. de Chim. Méd., Novembre 1846.
ON THE IGNITION OF BRASS WIRE IN THE WAPOUR OF ALCOHOL,
                             BY M. REINSCH.
                        -
   It has hitherto been supposed that the property of igniting in the
wick of a spirit-lamp was peculiar to a coil of platina or palladium wire.
The author has lately discovered that all other metals possess this pro
perty, which do not melt at a red heat, even whether they oxidize or
not. If a coil of piano-wire be placed in the wick of a spirit-lamp
(absolute alcohol), and it be allowed to burn till the spiral is suffi
ciently red-hot and then extinguished, the spiral remains red-hot for
a few seconds and then ceases to be so. If the lamp be thus lighted for
three or four times, the iron wire remains red-hot exactly like a pla
tina wire, and the peculiar odour of aldehyd and acetic acid is at the
same time developed. If the experiment does not succeed, the flame
of the alcohol must be covered with a glass tube, and not extin
guished till this precaution has been taken. M. Reinsch states that
he could not succeed at first with brass, silver and copper wire;
brass wire should be thin, and the spirals made as close to each other
as possible, but they must not touch; the flame of the alcohol also
should not be continued longer than is necessary to ignite the brass
wire, and after this it ought to be suddenly extinguished to prevent
the wire from melting, and to prevent the spirals from touching each
other. Copper and brass wire continue as vividly red-hot as platina
wire, though they are gradually acted upon by the acetic acid and
 afterwards volatilized.   The silver wire does not remain so long ig
nited. The wires of the metals mentioned absorbing heat too rapidly,
remain but incompletely red-hot, but a thicker iron wire remains red,
 being not so good a conductor of heat. Silver wire becomes but im
 perfectly ignited, because being ignited, it becomes so soft that the
 spirals soon touch each other. The same occurs with a gold wire.
    The author also succeeded in producing ignition with charcoal;
for this purpose a fragment of charcoal is placed in the wick; the
 alcohol is removed from the lamp, except sufficient to moisten the
 wick, which is to be lighted and the flame is to be cautiously extin
 guished; these experiments, the author observes, explain a fact
 which has hitherto been an enigma—the ignition of platina and
 the inflammation of hydrogen gas by spongy platina. Thus in the
 first experiment, the vapour of alcohol being imperfectly consumed

144           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
by the fire of the brass wire still hot, there is produced exactly the
heat necessary to continue it incandescent. If the spirals of a brass
wire approach each other without touching, the vapour of the alcohol
oxidizes, and can act on a large surface; the heat is so much in
creased by it, that the spirals remain red-hot; if the spirals be further
removed from each other, ignition ceases, the heat produced by the
imperfect combustion not being sufficient to heat the spirals, which
before almost touched.
   As to what relates to spongy platina, the globules are surrounded
with an atmosphere of hydrogen, oxidation takes place at the same
time, heat is consequently developed by the large surface of the
spongy platina, and a reiterated contact of the gases so increases
the heat, that the gas is inflamed. Platina would not possess this
specific quality if it were not so refractory as not to fuse by the heat
of inflamed hydrogen.
 | M. Reinsch has also found that this property belongs to metals
which fuse readily and are not capable of being made into wire.
He made the following experiment: some asbestos was moistened
with a solution of these metals, and after having made it red-hot, and
it had become brittle by the ignition, it was moistened with a little
alcohol, after which it was cautiously rolled round the wick; the
metallized asbestos was kept for some time red-hot in the flame of
the alcohol, a glass tube being held over it : asbestos which had
been prepared with chloride of platina remained vividly red-hot.
Iron answers best for this experiment: asbestos moistened with a
solution of sulphate of iron and then immersed in solution of am
monia, and washed in water and dried quickly, remains red, like
an iron wire.      Asbestos moistened with a solution of gold and
heated to redness, remains red-hot in the vapour of alcohol like a
platina wire. The same occurs when asbestos is moistened with a
solution of silver. It has been above stated that gold and silver
wires possess the property of ignition but imperfectly; which shows
that they are subject to soften readily. A wire prepared, with
chloride of tin and oxalate of ammonia, remains only a few seconds
red, even under the glass tube, the tin being too suddenly converted
into oxide. The case is nearly the same with lead, but it remains
red rather longer. Cobalt and nickel possess the property of igniting
like iron. Manganese and chromium remain red for a very short
time. Arsenic is suddenly volatilized, the wire however remains
red for a few seconds; the same occurs with mercury. Bismuth
possesses this property of ignition in a rather less degree than iron.
Cadmium resembles tin.       Zinc is the only metal which does not at
all ignite. . . . . .              -
   The author is of opinion that platinized asbestos may become an
important substance for the condensation of several gases, as also
for the preparation of vinegar.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Nov. 1846.
  ON THE DISTILLATION OF MERCURY.               BY. M. M. E. MILLON.

collected and weighed. The four retorts did not yield equal quan
tities; but on putting aside those which differed the most, it was
easy to select two, which, subjected to the above proof, furnished
nearly an equal quantity of mercury. Thus in three paralleliopera

     Mercury thus affected in a marked manner in its mode of distilla
tion would appear to possess some difference in its degree of purity;
but the author attempted in vain to discover any difference by re
agents; the mercury of the first and last kilogramme was similarly
affected in all the examinations to which it was submitted.
     It then occurred to the author to try whether the addition of any
foreign metal, in quantity so small as to escape analysis, could affect
the volatility of the mercury. The results were of considerable in

146;          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
terest; the thousandth or even ten-thousandth of a foreign metal is
sufficient to cause very characteristic differences in the results of
parallel experiments. . . . . . . .
   A ten-thousandth of lead added to mercury stops its distillation
almost entirely. In the following comparative experiments, the
mercury which distilled with the greatest difficulty was put into the
retort A., which yielded most quickly.
   First operation.—Retort A., containing 100 grammes of mercury,
to which 1-10,000dth of lead had been added, yielded in a given time
by distillation in the bath 5 grammes of mercury.
   Retort B., containing the same quantity of mercury without any
lead, heated for the same time in the same bath, gave by distillation
67 grammes of mercury.
   Second operation.—Retort A., containing 100 grammes of mercury,
to which 1-1000dth of lead had been added, yielded in a given time
by distillation in the bath 2 grammes of mercury.
   Retort B., containing the same quantity of mercury without any
lead, heated for the same time in the same bath, gave by distillation
55 grammes of mercury.
   Zinc was substituted for lead, and when in the proportion of
 1-10,000dth, the mercury distilled was to that obtained without the
zinc as 6.5 grms, to 72.
   Some metals have no sensible influence on the distillation of mer
cury : among these are gold, iridium, silver, copper, tin, nickel, cad
mium and arsenic.      The action of platina is precisely the reverse of
that of lead and zinc: it accelerates distillation, but less than lead
and zinc retard it; in order that platina may produce this effect, it
must be digested in the mercury for a day or two at the temperature
of 122° to 176°F.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Novembre 1846.

    According to M. Peligot, the composition of the white Bohemian
glass varies but very little in the different manufactories of that
country. He has analysed various specimens which were perfectly
pure and colourless, and they all yielded very nearly the same results.
Their composition was found to be as follows:–                                                    " '

    The composition of the verre-agate, or verre de pâte de riz of
Bohemia is remarkable; it is a simple silicate of potash, the semi
opacity of which is derived from imperfect vitrification, which has
left grains of quartz, not fused, interposed in the mass. It contains,

    This glass does not attract moisture from the air; when long
boiled in water it is not acted upon. It differs from the soluble
glass of Fuchs in containing about 10 per cent. more silica.

ºf     <U+017F>ºon oxypic<U+017F><U+017F>ic Acid-styPHNic Acid.

     in experimenting on Indian yellow, M, Erdmann discovered a new
acid, to which he gave the name of oxypicric acid.
 ... This substance, has also been obtained by MM. Boettger and Will,
without their being aware of the results of M. Erdmann's experi
ments. It was procured by these, chemists by treating several gum
resins with nitric acid, as for example ammoniacum, assafoetida, &c.;
they also procured, it from the watery extract of Brazil wood, san
ders and yellow wood, and they have called it styphnic acid, from
orvprès, astringent.
     They prepare it by heating one part of assafoetida with from four to
six parts of nitric acid of 1:20. At first they heat it to about 158°
to 163°F.; as soon as the violent action which then takes place is
moderated, it is to be boiled till all solid matter disappears. When
the solution, on the addition of water, deposits a powder which is
granular to the touch, the oxidation is finished; if the water sepa
rates a flocculent precipitate, the ebullition with the nitric acid must
be continued: it is then to be evaporated to the consistence of a syrup,
much water is to be added, and after having boiled it, carbonate of
potash is to be added as long as effervescence ensues, taking care to
add no excess, in order that the resinous portions which the liquor
may still contain be not dissolved.          After neutralization the liquor
is to be filtered and evaporated, and set to crystallize. There then
separates a salt of potash which is very slightly soluble, having the
form of a brown crust, or of fine needles aggregated in mammillated
forms. This salt is to be dissolved and re-crystallized in water, and
the oxypicric acid is to be precipitated by nitric acid.
     This acid is precipitated in the state of a white powder, or in scales
having the form of fern leaves; it is to be washed with cold water
and then dissolved in boiling absolute alcohol; from this it separates
in prismatic crystals of considerable size.
     The properties of this acid are that its taste is neither sour nor
bitter, but slightly astringent; its solution, either in alcohol or water,
colours the epidermis permanently.
     It is yellow, reddens litmus strongly, and readily decomposes the
alkaline carbonates. It requires 88 parts of water at about 144°F.
for solution : alcohol and aether dissolve it readily. When cautiously
heated on platina foil it fuses, and on cooling becomes a radiated
mass: at a higher temperature it yields vapours which readily in
flame. When suddenly heated it detonates slightly.
     Nitric and hydrochloric acids even when concentrated do not act
upon it at a boiling heat. It dissolves readily in concentrated nitric
acid, and water precipitates it from solution in the form of a white
powder.
     Aqua regia decomposes it entirely with the production of oxalic
acid.      Concentrated sulphuric acid when heated also decomposes it.
If a piece of very dry potassium be sprinkled with this acid, and it
be slightly-pressed with a pestle, the acid inflames : sodium does not
produce the same effect.
     A concentrated aqueous solution of oxypicric acid, especially when

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                149
heated, readily dissolves zinc and iron. Sulphuretted hydrogen has
no action upon it; but an alcoholic solution of hydrosulphate of am
monia gives it a deep brown red colour. Assafoetida yields about 3
per cent. of this acid. . . . . .          :: * * **
      MM. Boettger and Will found, as M. Erdmann had done, that its
composition is C6H3N3O8, or Cº. (HS X3) O3." This acid is bibasic.
It is capable of forming several salts with two different bases.          All
the oxypicrates, in common with the picrates, possess the property
of exploding with considerable force when heated gently.—Journ.

            REDUCTION OF THE PERSALTS OF IRON BY ZINC.
       Metallic zinc reduces the persalts of iron to the state of protosalts,
and precipitates at the same time some metallic iron, often in the
state of brilliant scales. According to M. Poumarède, it is equal to
one-third of that which remains in solution, the reaction taking place
according to the following equation (Fe3–3Fe):
               6SFeºg O
                    Or
                r—"—,
  -             Sº Fes O2++Zn}=3 SFe2O++3SZn2O4 +Fe2.
  . By superoxidizing the mixture of protosalts which results from a
first reduction, a fresh quantity of iron may be precipitated; and by
successive operations, the whole of the iron of a solution may be pre
cipitated. . . . .
   ... If weak solutions be operated upon, there is usually disengaged a
certain quantity of hydrogen, which, according to the author, is de
rived from a secondary decomposition, operated on water by the iron
set free; in fact, the zinc is always covered with a very slight coating
of oxide of iron.
       According to M. Poumarède, the solutions of nickel, manganese,
and even of alumina, yield similar results.-Journ. de Pharm. et de
 Ch., Novembre 1846.
                   AWARD OF MEDALS.-LINNAEAN SOCIETY.
       A Special General Meeting of this Society was held on Friday the
 8th of January, to consider the subject of the following Statement
 and Resolution of Council relative to the Bequest of the late Edward
 Rudge, Esq., F.L.S.
       The Council, after much patient and anxious deliberation, had
 unanimously come to the following resolution:-                            -
       “Resolved,—That in the opinion of this Council, on a full con
 sideration of the terms of the bequest of the late Edward Rudge, Esq.,"
 of the interest of a sum of £200, for the purpose of establishing a
 Medal ‘to be awarded by the President and Council of the (Linnaean)
 Society, at their discretion, to the Fellow of the said Society who
 shall write the best communication in each volume which after his
 (the testator's) decease shall be published by the said Society, in
 either of the four departments of Natural History,’ it is inexpedient     *

 1150            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 3 to accede to the liberal intentions of the testator under the conditions
   expressed in his will.” . . .
 by This Resolution, which received; the entire concurrence of the
   President and of every Member of the Council, was chiefly founded
   on the following considerations:–
   a<U+017F> The great object of the Linnaean Society, as of all other bodies
   similarly constituted, is the production and publication of such essays
   as tend to the advancement of that branch of science which it culti
   vates. The principal question therefore in reference to Mr. Rudge's
   bequest, is the manner in which its acceptance would operate on the
   Society's publications, and the Council has arrived at the conclusion
   that its tendency would be prejudicial rather than favourable; inas
   much as while the Medal would offer no inducement to some of those
   Members who have hitherto been in the habit of communicating
  papers which have had a place in the ‘Transactions,’ they might,
   on the contrary, be unwilling to submit their future communications
   to this new ordeal; and it does not appear probable that the Medal
   would prove a stimulus to the production of more valuable Essays
  from any other class of the Society. On the other hand, it is pro
   bable that dissatisfaction would arise in the minds of some of those
   Members, who after contributing papers to more than one volume of
  the ‘Transactions,’ should fail in obtaining the award of a Medal.
      A second objection to the acceptance of the bequest arises from
  the absence of any discretionary power of withholding the Medal,
  which is necessarily to be awarded to the best paper in every volume,
  and consequently to papers of very unequal value, thereby lowering
  the character of the Medal, and consequently affecting the scientific
  reputation of the Society itself.
     Differences of opinion, and consequent dissatisfaction, would also
  be not unlikely occasionally to arise in deciding upon the compara
  tive merits of papers in botany and zoology, the two branches of
  natural history, of which, for many years past, the Transactions of
  the Spciety have exclusively consisted.
     Another point may still be noticed as decidedly unfavourable to the
  acceptance of the bequest, namely, the not improbable award of the
  Medal by the Council, in some cases to one of its own body, in strict
  conformity with the conditions of the will; conditions which neither
  the Council itself, nor (as it appears from the tenor and provisions
  of the will) any other party has the power to modify.
     These objections have appeared to the Council so important as not
  to admit of any other course but that of respectfully declining to
  accept a bequest, the operation of which would in all probability be
  injurious to the best interests of the Society, by lowering the cha
  racter of its publications, and endangering the continuance of that
  harmony which has hitherto prevailed in all essential points. The
  Council is at the same time deeply sensible of the kind and liberal
  intentions of Mr. Rudge, and entertains a sincere regret that the
  express terms of his will should have rendered the acceptance of his
 bequest liable to such grave objections.

on the part of the Council, some of the Fellows who had been Mem

awarding of medals in those Societies, and their inutility for the
promotion of science; after which the Resolution proposed by the
Council was unanimously approved and adopted.” tº

 154 Sir D. Brewster's leeply to the Astronomer Royal
 has invented to designate the unfortunate members of the
 colour-blind community.
     But before I proceed to give a notice of the analysis of the
 spectrum by absorption, I must refer to the mode of making
 the experiments. Mr. Airy says that “the eye has no memory
jor colours,” and that it is therefore necessary to compare im
 mediately the modified with the unmodified spectrum. It may
 be true that the eye has no memory of any kind, and there
 fore not for colours; but I know that I have a memory for
 colours, and that the colours are so much committed to my
 memory by fifty years’ schooling, that without any immediate
 comparison I can tell whether or not the green space has
 become yellower, and whether or not, by certain combinations
  of absorbing media, I see before me a portion of white light
 standing close to a portion of red light in the spectrum, like
 an almond and a cherry stuck together.
     But, apart from this consideration, I beg to remind Mr.
  Airy that I was the first person to use the methods which he
 considers his of placing the modified beside the unmodified spec
  trum, by employing the same slit for both; and that I showed
 it to him <U+017F>ºfteen years ago, when he did me the honour of paying
 me a visit in Roxburghshire. In my paper On the Lines of the
 Spectrum, read to the Royal Society in 1833%, I write thus,
 when speaking of the coincidence of the Nitrous gas lines with
 those of Fraunhofer:-
    “In order to afford ocular demonstration of this fact, I formed the solar
 and the gaseous spectrum with light passing through the same aperture, so
 that the lines in the one stood opposite those on the other, like the divi
 sions on the vernier and the limb of a circle, and their coincidence or non
 coincidence became a matter of simple observation. I then superimposed
 the two spectra when they were both formed by solar light, and thus ex
  hibited at once the two series of lines, with all their coincidences and all
 their apparent deviations from it. Professor Airy, to whom I showed this
  experiment, remarked that he saw the one set of lines through the other,
 which is an accurate description of a phaenomenon perhaps one of the
 most splendid in physical optics, whether we consider it as appealing to the
 eye or to the judgement.”
     On the 15th of April 1822, I laid before the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh a paper, in which I describe specific experi
 ments, proving that the colour of parts of the spectrum is
 changed by absorbing media, and that a distinct yellow band
 can be insulated on the most refrangible side of the line D+.
 About the same time Sir John Herschel addressed a letter to
 me On the Absorption of Light by Coloured Media, &c., f

                 on the New Analysis of Solar Light.                          155
 containing experiments from which he drew the same con
clusion that I did, as appears from that letter, and from the
 following passages in his Treatise on Light. Viewing the
 spectrum through a piece of smalt blue glass 0.042 of an
 inch thick, he makes the following observation:—
   “This RED (the innermost of the two red bands)**is fee from the slightest
shade of on ANGE: its most refracted limit came very nearly up to the dark
line D in the spectrum. A small sharp black line separated this RED from
the YELLow, which was a pretty well-defined band of GREAT BRILLIANCY
AND PURITY of colour, of a breadth exceeding that of the first RED, and
ôounded on the GREEN side by an obscure but not quite black interval.”—Art.
496.
    Upon this distinct and well-described observation, which is
precisely what I have witnessed a hundred times, Sir John
reasons as follows:—
   “The two reds noticed in Art. 497 have absolutely the same colour, and
cannot be distinguished. On the other hand, the transition from pure red
to pure yellow, in the case there described, is quite sudden, and the contrast
of colours most striking. * * * * What then, we may ask, has become of
the on ANGE; and how is it, that its place is partly supplied by RED on one
side and Yellow on the other? These phaenomena certainly lead us very
strongly to believe that the analysis of white light by the prism is not the only
analysis of which it admits. * * * * This idea has been advocated by Dr.
Brewster in a paper published in the Edinburgh Transactions, vol. ix, and
the same consequence appears to follow from other experiments" published
in the same volume of that collection.”—Art. 506.
    Having had occasion in the course of the ten years subse
quent to 1822 to view the spectrum through, literally, hun
dreds of solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies in different combi
nations, I was led to the generalisations which I have described
in a paper On a New Analysis of Solar Light, read to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh on the 21st of March 1831+.
I endeavoured to prove by specific experiments that the solar
spectrum was compound, and capable of analysis by absorbing
media, and I succeeded in insulating a portion of white light,
which the prism could not decompose. But as these points
are not now at issue between the Astronomer Royal and me,
I shall make no further allusion to them.
    Nearly three years after the reading of this paper, on the
6th of January 1834, the President and Council of the Royal
Society made the following announcement:—
   “The President announced that the Council had resolved to award the
Keith Biennial Prize, for the second period, to Sir David Brewster, for his
paper On a New Analysis of Solar Light.”
    Being then resident in the country, I had no knowledge
whatever of the intention of the Royal Society to do me this

156    Sir D. Brewster's Reply to the Astronomer Royal
honour.    No doubts were expressed to me about the accuracy
of my experiments, and no explanations asked ; and being
accidentally in Edinburgh on the 6th of January, the reading
of the announcement at the meeting of the Royal Society that
evening was the principal intimation I received of the adjudica
tion of the prize. Prof. Forbes, the Secretary to the Physical
Class, was then the representative of physical science in the
Council. I knew that he had made many experiments on the
action of absorbent media on the solar spectrum, and I have
no doubt that he observed the great fundamental fact described
by Sir John Herschel and myself, which, if a truth, settles the
question between Mr. Airy and me.
   It would appear that in the year 1833 Mr. Airy made experi
ments on the spectrum. He could not see any change of
colour in the spectrum produced by absorbent media, and he
mentioned this result of ALLY, and from recollection, at a
meeting of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. He did not
consider his experiments worthy of being preserved, for he did
not even copy them from his pencilled notes: he did not think
them deserving of publication; and yet Dr. Whewell, the
 Historian of science, takes them up four years afterwards, and
setting aside Sir John Herschel's experiments, which he may
not have known, and mine which he did know, and holding
cheap the decision of the Royal Society, of which he probably
was also ignorant, he adduces the experiments of Mr. Airy,
without mentioning his name, as hostile to mine, by stating
 that my facts were “denied by other experimenters.”
   This gratuitous challenge of the accuracy of my experiments,
 on anonymous authority, was animadverted upon in one of the
 reviews of Dr. Whewell’s work; and upon publishing a second
 edition of it, he naturally applies to his anonymous experi
 menter, who turns out to be Mr. Airy. Without making a
 single new experiment, without even having recourse to his
 pencil notes, which he seems to have lost, the Astronomer Royal
 authorizes the Master of Trinity to refer again to his experi
 ments as invalidating my analysis of solar light. Dr. Whewell
 has of course done this; but he has done it in a note so ex
 ceptionable in its argument, and to me so unintelligible in its
 interrogatories, that I am most unwilling to criticise it. He
 asks me, for example, if it is meant, that is, if I mean, that
 Newton's experiments prove nothing? Who ever said that
 they proved nothing? Newton's prismatic analysis of the spec
 trum is, in my opinion, one of the greatest of his discoveries.
 “Or,” he adds, “is Newton's conclusion allowed to be true of
 light which has not been analysed by absorption?” To this
 I reply, that Newton's conclusions respecting the apparent

               on the New Analysis of Solar Light.                157
division of the spectrum into seven colours, and their difference
of refrangibility, is not in the slightest degree affected by the
results of my analysis. “And where,” he continues, “are
we to find such light since the atmosphere absorbs?” I again
answer, that Newton's prismatic analysis must, of course, be
the analysis of light after it has experienced all the actions
which it has undergone in passing through the atmospheres of
the sun and the earth; but if I misapprehend the object of the
question, it may be otherwise answered by stating that light
which has not suffered absorption, and which does not want a
single definite ray, may be found in the white artificial flames
with which we are all familiar. I have distinctly stated in my
original memoir, what Dr. Whewell seems not to have read,
that Newton's analysis of light by the prism is perfect, so far
as it goes; but Newton committed a mistake, i<U+017F> mistake is the
proper term, when he asserted that to the same refrangibility
always belongs the same colour.
   Having authorized Dr. Whewell to refer again to his ex
periments on absorption, the Astronomer Royal has thought it
necessary, in order to justify the reference, to publish his recollec
tions of these experiments. This is the first time in the annals of
science that the recollections of experiments have been given
to the world. A philosopher in his decline, when his failing
sight and his trembling hand are no longer fit for the delicate
operations of experimental inquiry, may be excused for calling
up the recollections of his manhood in support or in refuta
tion of some exciting speculation; but no apology can be made
for those who, with the means and the leisure for repeating
their experiments, bring forward their recollections to discre
dit or to overturn the researches of others who have laboured
patiently and successfully in the same field of scientific re
search.
   In the present case these recollections have a still more
peculiar character: they are admitted by their author to be
“only negative.” “Of the results of these experiments,” says
the Astronomer Royal, “I can give little more than the single
negative one,—that no change was produced in the qualities of
the colours.” These recollections have still another peculiarity.
Relating as they do to colours, they are the recollections of a
person who confesses that he has no memory for colours, and
so imperfect are they that he forgets the names of the miscel
laneous contents of a chemist's shop through which he viewed
the spectrum, and he remembers only the “port and porter”
of his own cellar.    Mr. Airy cannot even tell us what he ac
tually saw when he absorbed the sun's rays by smalt-blue glass,
port and porter. He does not describe the spectrum thus

158            On the New Analysis of Solar Light.
produced; but merely tells us that the qualities of the colours
were unchanged. Sir John Herschel, as we have seen, made
the experiment with the same glass carefully, and describes
the results of it minutely; and I have done the same; and
both of us have found that the qualities of the colours were
decidedly changed. But Mr. Airy may perhaps have made
the experiment more skilfully than we did; and he takes credit
for comparing the modified with the unmodified spectrum, and
with excluding all extraneous light, precautions which others
have taken far more carefully and effectually than he did. With
all these precautions, however, he neglected the most important.
He received his spectrum upon a paper screen 1 and while he
was viewing it, his retina was influenced by all the various
colours which shone in his modified and unmodified spectrum.
In the experiments of Sir John Herschel, I believe, but cer
tainly in my own, not a ray of light entered the room but what
passed through the narrow slit; the retina was our screen,
and the absorbing medium was held close to the eye and im
mediately behind the prism, the only method of obtaining the
purest spectrum from a given prism. I have now before me
a modified and an unmodified spectrum. I can compare any
portion of the one with any portion of the other, or I can
examine it alone; and so completely are the colours changed
with the combination of absorbents which I employ, that I
should regard the person as colour-blind who does not see the
change. In the striped spectrum which I have described in
my paper, the phaenomena are still more beautiful and in
structive.
   But it is not merely by absorbent substances that the qua
lities of the spectral colours may be changed. I have obtained,
during a series of unpublished experiments, similar effects from
the interference of pencils transmitted through perfectly colour
less media, and prismatically analysed.
   What, then, is the result of all this discussion?    Sir John
Herschel and I have minutely described certain experiments,
in which we have proved to our own satisfaction and that of
many others, that absorbing media change the colours of por
tions of the spectrum. Mr. Airy, by inferior methods as I
think, but by superior methods as he thinks, recollects having,
fourteen years ago, found that these colours were not changed
The Master of Trinity records the last of these results as un
doubted scientific truth, and strives to transmit it to the latest
posterity.

XXIX. Additional Observations on Hail, and on the Organic
   Bodies contained in Hailstones, &c. By AUGUSTUs WAL
   LER, M.D.”
                               [With a Plate.]
 IN     a preceding Number of this Journal (August 1846) I
     have stated the results of a microscopic observation of
hailstones previous to their fusion, and likewise of the water
resulting from them. It was then found that this water con
tained particles of different shapes, which from their nucleated
structure, globular form, and general appearance, were evi
dently of an organized nature. Since making these observa
tions I have had an opportunity of repeating them, which
occurred on the 1st of August, when London and the country
in general were visited by that tremendous storm which has
been the occasion of so much damage.
   Aug. 1.-In my neighbourhood (Kensington) there occurred
several falls of rain, which continued, with a few intervals,
from about 4 P.M. to late in the evening: the fall of water was
accompanied with frequent peals of thunder and flashes of
lightning. With the drops of water particles of hail were oc
casionally found, which rarely reached the size of a bean. No
damage was done to the hot-houses in this locality. One of
these hailstones, perfectly white, when examined under the
microscope in the ordinary way, presented the usual appear
ance of being composed of minute particles of ice, some sphe
rical, others of a more irregular shape, and numerous bubbles
of air escaped as it melted. The organized substances con
tained in the drop of water which resulted were numerous.
Most of them were of an irregular shape with angular outlines.
Others were globular; and some of these were completely
black, with a nucleus in the centre.           With higher magnifying
powers were seen green globules about 3 o'owth of an inch in
diameter, which were either collected in clusters or adherent
together in single lines, like the beads of a rosary, as repre
sented in fig. 1 of my former paper on hail.
    In order to preserve the drop of water for a leisure exami
nation free from dust in the atmosphere, I placed it in a little
apparatus nearly air-tight, which will be described hereafter.
    Aug. 2.-The drop of water thus secured and left under
the microscope was found unaltered in size, but the orga
nized matter had entirely altered its appearance. Some
of the organized particles had given off filaments in various
directions, as represented in Plate I.f, presenting the ap
   * Communicated by the Author.
   # The magnifying powers under which the objects are represented in
this plate are as follows:—Fig. 1. magnified 360 diameters, fig. 2, 200 dia
meters, and fig. 3, 300 diameters.

160       Dr. Waller's additional Observations on Hail,
pearance of hollow tubes, jointed at intervals, with a few
branches or subdivisions generally arising at the joints. The
particles which gave rise to this vegetation appeared to
me to belong to those which I have before described as the
irregular angular particles. Among these one or two infu
soria were likewise seen, moving about with great rapidity.
When at rest their form was oval (A), but when in motion
their anterior extremity frequently became elongated, as at B.
Their organization was extremely simple; no filaments nor
appendages of any kind were to be detected about them.
Their interior had a granulated appearance. All these cha
racters indicate that they belong to the genus Uvella of the
 Monadinae, and probably of the species Uvella glaucoma
 (Ehrenberg). C represents one perfectly circular, which
was in a state of constant motion, revolving round its centre.
    Aug. 3.-The vegetable filaments had greatly augmented in
number. Small elongated cells, as represented, could be seen
at various places, as if forming the first elements of the tubulous
 branches spread out around them. The infusoria had like
 wise greatly increased in number.
    Aug. 4.—The same appearances were presented as the day
 before. Scarcely any alteration could be detected in the ve
getable and animal bodies: the last were as active in their
movements as before. I purposed to continue these observa
 tions every day, in order to ascertain their future changes;
 but unfortunately by some accident one of the slips of glass
 belonging to the apparatus was broken, and in consequence
 the water quickly dried up, so that when next examined the
 infusoria were found to be dead.         The further addition of
 water was ineffectual to restore the vegetable particles to life.
    For the purpose of repeating these observations, and likewise
 for many others of a microscopic nature, the little apparatus
 which I have made use of will be found very serviceable. It
 consists of a small square piece of sheet caoutchouc, more or
 less thick according as it may be required, with an aperture
cut in the centre about the size of a shilling. On each side
of it are placed two slips of glass of the same size, which, by
a moderate degree of pressure, may generally be made to
adhere to it so strongly as to render the little air-chamber,
where the india-rubber has been cut away, perfectly secure
from all access of dust and nearly air-tight. When the glass
does not easily adhere to the caoutchouc, this last may be
rendered sufficiently glutinous by heating it moderately. In
stead of glass the plates may be of thin mica, which adheres
still better; and from being so much more thin, will allow of
the employment of the highest magnifying powers without the
possibility of the access of foreign matter. I have sometimes

  and on the Organic Bodies contained in Hailstones, &c. 161
used a metallic framework with a screw, by means of which
the whole is rendered perfectly air-tight, and the glasses may be
pressed nearly into immediate contact, but in most cases this is
superfluous. As an instance of its efficiency in preventing all
evaporation, I may state that I have preserved vaccine lymph
in a fluid state in this manner during more than two months,
with merely the assistance of a degree of pressure on the
glasses, in the first instance secured by a few turns of wire.
This is decidedly the most effectual mode of preserving this
substance fit for use at any moment. A few of the same kind
of apparatus in the pocket-book will be found most useful
companions to the microscopic observer, when the slips of
glass in ordinary use are inapplicable.
   Although the existence of organized particles in the upper
regions of the atmosphere appears at first very improbable,
we shall find that several facts exist which much decrease this
apparent improbability, and even some that appear to corro
borate this statement. M. Boussingault has found that organic
matter may invariably be detected in the atmosphere. It is true
that his experiments have been confined to the lower atmosphe
ric strata, and it would be very desirable to ascertain whether
they hold good for those which are several thousand feet above
the sea. The same may be detected in rain-water ; and what
is still more to the point, I find that M. Girardin (Académie
 des Sciences, April 1834) has detected in the water resulting
 from the fusion of hailstones, “a strongly azotized organic
 matter, and also lime and sulphuric acid without any trace of
 ammonia being present.” The frequent vegetations in snow
 show at what a low temperature the vital principle may be
 sustained. The red and green appearance assumed by it has
 been found to be produced by the Haºmatococcus nivalis and
 the Protococcus viridis, as these plants have been termed, and
 which are probably the same species at different periods of
 growth, which have been found to penetrate many inches
 below the surface of the snow. These vegetations are found
 under the microscope to consist of minute globules, some
 green and transparent, about the size of 0"01 to 0”05;
 others red, generally larger than the former, and frequently
 arranged in single rows, like the beads of a necklace, adherent
 together. The globules are found of all intermediate tints
 between the green and the red, and likewise others of larger
 dimensions of a red colour, about 0”05 to the Omm-055,
 which have a more compound structure, as within them are
 seen several granules or smaller globules, which was not the
 case in the two former.    M. Martens states, that in some of
 these globules microscopic infusoria may be detected (see

162      Dr. Waller’s additional Observations on Hail,
 Kaemtz's Meteorology). I am not aware that the origin of this
vegetation in snow has ever been satisfactorily accounted for;
but when we consider how widely this vegetation is diffused,
and the depth to which it penetrates, it does not appear un
likely that it may have fallen with the snow, in the same man
mer as the organic bodies in hail are brought from the upper
regions of the atmosphere. Further observations must deter
mine how far these surmises are correct, and whether these
bodies are not the same in both cases.
   Again, in the hands of Ehrenberg the microscope has been
the means of detecting, in dust fallen on ships in the Atlantic,
the remains of above sixty different species of infusoria. Mr.
Darwin, in his interesting paper in the Transactions of the
 Geological Society, mentions that dust has been collected in
this manner at a point midway between Senegal and Cayenne.
The distance to which volcanic ashes may be conveyed by the
higher atmospheric currents, in a direction contrary to that
of the lower prevailing winds, is well known. These facts
being duly weighed, the frequent and even habitual existence
of minute cryptogamic sporules and infusorian ovules in the
higher regions of the atmosphere, where hail is formed, will
not appear more incredible than the continued suspension
of globules of water composing clouds; which globules,
as measured by diffraction, are found of far greater size than
the former. The relation between the presence of these par
ticles and other phaenomena of meteorology remains to be
determined, and how far they may be regarded as accom
panying and detector agents of other atmospheric conditions
following or preceding them; and whether the infusoria and
the cryptogamia are the same at all seasons of the year;
whether the locality in which they are collected has any influ
ence; and lastly, whether they are the same in hail and water
falling at about the same time.
   In meteorology water likewise presents itself in what is
termed the vesicular, as in clouds and fogs, in the condition
of rain, snow and frost. In a paper which was read before
the Royal Society, and which will appear in the Philosophical
Transactions, 1847, will be found some experiments of mine
upon water in the first-mentioned condition; with regard to
the others I shall confine myself to the following remarks.
   The transformation of fogs into rain is frequently taking
place around us. Fogs, which at first are what is termed dry
fogs, scarcely possessing the power of moistening surrounding
objects, after a time are found to deposit numerous small glo
bules of water, which as long as they remain attached to mi
nute filaments retain their spherical form, but when in con

  and on the Organic Bodies contained in Hailstones, &c. 163
tact with other bodies moisten them like common rain.      This
may be regarded as similar to the formation of rain in clouds,
except that it is on a much smaller scale, as the thickness of
the stratum of the fog is much less than the strata of clouds,
as measured by M. Peytier.
    We may examine the minute particles of rain or fogs, as I
have already shown, by passing the air which contains them
through essence of turpentine, lowered a few degrees below
the common temperature. They are then left behind in the
liquid; but at the same time they are mixed with others which
arose from the condensation of the water contained in the air
in an elastic condition. Difficulties exist with regard to the
measurement of the globules while floating about. This is an
objection to the employment of this method of fixing the glo
bules.    I have therefore endeavoured to use another means
of observing these particles, and for this purpose have ex
amined them as they exist on the filaments which compose the
spider's web.                      -
    In order to examine these globules in situ, it will be found
convenient to make use of two square frames of sheet cork of
equal size, about two or three inches square. These are to
be placed on each side of the web, then pressed together and
bound. The whole of the web interposed may then be re
moved with the globules in statu quo, which may then be sub
mitted to the microscope and measured. The globules may
sometimes be as small as Tºonth of an inch, which is less than
the globules of the clouds in some instances as measured by
Kaemtz. But generally these globules are much larger.
They will be found placed at regular intervals, and while
undisturbed show little tendency to coalesce; but when taken
into a warm room they appear to lose with the increase
of temperature, their cohesion to the line, and easily run
 off, coalesce with each other and rapidly evaporate; while so
doing, instead of a globular form they become elongated ellip
 soids, with the long diameter in the direction of the spider's
 line running through them. In the same fog I have found
these globules always of the same dimensions. When the
 webs are examined over the extent of one or two miles at least,
but in different fogs, their sizes are very different. It is ne
cessary to warn the observer respecting an error that might
be easily made in examining the web of the common spider,
because in its natural state it is found covered with minute
globules or beads, which contribute probably to secure the
prey of the animal. These beads are arranged with great
 symmetry. Thus at nearly equal distances will be found
globules, as in fig. 2, and between them others smaller dis

164       Dr. Waller’s additional Observations on Hail,
posed with equal regularity. We may distinguish them readily,
inasmuch as the globules of water soon disappear, whereas these
beads are permanent, and unaffected by the vacuum of the
air-pump. Mr. Blackwall has described them fully in the
Transactions of the Linnaean Society.
    Numerous particles of an organic nature may be detected
in rain. But this investigation is liable to many errors
which do not exist with regard to hail; because a solid body
of ice will remain completely free from all foreign particles in
the lower strata, and only contains those which were fixed
within it at the moment of its solidification; while in rain we
find a mixture of foreign bodies derived from various sources,
which the drop of water meets on its passage from the point
at which it is formed to the moment of reaching the ground,
such as dust raised by the wind, pollen of flowers, and in the
neighbourhood of towns, particles of soot continually floating
in the atmosphere. It therefore requires great care to avoid
coming to erroneous conclusions respecting the nature of the
body under examination, and also to detect the existence of
organic particles in the midst of others which mask its pre
sence. For these reasons I avoid entering any further upon
this subject at present, although deposits of rain-water have
presented under the microscope several particles of an organic
Ilature.
    The most prevailing forms which the particles of snow in
flakes assume, are minute acicular crystals irregularly grouped
together, small regular rhombic prisms, often modified by se
condary planes, and double six-sided pyramids, like the cry
stals of sulphate of potash. The more regular particles are ge
nerally found deposited on others more irregular, arranged in
wreaths and various other shapes. A globular nucleus with
small pyramids upon it is a frequent form in flakes of snow.
Separate particles of snow affect much more regular forms. In
these the hexagonal form, or some tendency to assume it, is
generally remarked; and examples of all the forms given in
Scoresby's voyage, and of others still more complex, may be
detected by the microscope in snow of this climate. The
spongy deposit formed on the outside of vessels containing a
freezing mixture is found under the microscope to present
crystalline forms, which resemble the common forms found in
snow much more than those of any other deposit, such as
frost, or the arborescent deposit often found on the windows
IIl Winter.
    In these experiments the hygrometric conditions of the
atmosphere, the degree of refrigeration, and even the rapidity
with which heat was abstracted, appeared to exert great influ

  and on the Organic Bodies contained in Hailstones, &c. 165
ence in modifying the crystalline forms that were obtained.
In the same fall of snow a great uniformity is found in the
forms of the separate crystals and of those which compose the
flakes: sometimes there is only one prevailing shape, at others
several very different distinct forms exist, falling at the same
time. At the commencement of the fall the forms are gene
rally more regular. In different falls of snow the forms of
crystallization are scarcely ever alike or liable to be con
founded; and even after a temporary cessation these are found
to alter. In every respect we find the closest analogy between
the formation of these crystals and those obtained from solu
tions in which the temperature, degree of condensation, and
repose of the liquid, are found to have such influence. Some
observations made on separate occasions will better elucidate
these remarks.
    Jan. 7, 1846.-There was a fall of snow, the flakes of which
consisted of minute crystals of an octahedric form, placed on
acicular ramifications of an irregular description. Besides
 these, small globules of ice studded with minute pyramidal
 crystals were perceived under the microscope. The snow
 examined at intervals was found to contain spherical globules
 without projecting crystals, which towards the end of the fall
 of snow gradually increased in size, and might be termed sleet,
 as they were visible to the naked eye: subsequently the sleet
 gave place to rain, consisting of minute drops. It is impossible
 to account for the formation of the mace-like particles of snow,
 without admitting, as in my experiments, two distinct periods
 or stages in their development. In the first stage the globular
 particle is deposited, and in the second the projecting pyra
  mids are formed from moisture, condensed from either a gasi
  form or a liquid state.
     Dec. 11, 1846.-A heavy fall of snow commencing early in
  the morning, which, after a temporary cessation at about 11
  A.M., continued until 2 P.M. Many of the crystals were very
  regular, thin plates, which presented a hexagonal arrangement;
  some closely resembled fig. 15 of Scoresby’s figures, as given
  in Kaemtz's Manual, without the projecting radii. Some were
  composed of a very thin hexagonal star, around which nearly
  circular apertures were disposed at regular intervals, and at
  the exterior of these six radii. The flakes were composed of
  irregularly-grouped particles; some of a lance-shape, size
  rägth of an inch ; others regular six-sided prisms, like those
  of frost, about sºnth of an inch; and lastly, others nearly
  globular.
     Dec. 12.—At about 10 A.M. there was a slight appearance
  of snow during nearly an hour. It consisted of separate par

 166       Dr. Waller’s additional Observations on Hail,
 ticles, which, from their size, form and colour, nearly resem
bled the eggs of the common blow-fly. At about 2 P.M. the
 snow fell more thickly, under the form of small conglomera
tions or balls, varying from the size of half a pea to three or
four times larger. Pressed between the fingers; some of these
pellets of snow were easily crushed; only a few offered any
degree of resistance. To the naked eye they appeared to
consist of spongy crystalline particles: under the microscope
they were found to be composed of small regular crystals
nearly cubical, mixed with others more irregular of complex
outlines: the regular forms were exactly similar to the crystals
of frost and the cube-like particles found in the snow on the
day preceding. One of these balls submitted to the micro
scope on a slip of glass, began slowly to liquefy, from the con
tact of the glass and of the surrounding air. As this was
taking place the liquid was diffused by capillarity over the en
tire mass, without any trace of moisture appearing externally
until the entire ball was in a state of semi-fusion, and of a dull
and semi-transparent white like a small hailstone: at the same
time the ball contracted in size and assumed a biconvex or
lenticular shape. While these changes were taking place the
crystals became fused at the angles and edges, most of them
becoming globular and ovular: in this condition several of the
balls were exposed to the open air, then several degrees be
low the freezing-point. When examined the next morning
they were found perfectly hard, of a regular lenticular shape,
of a dull white colour, in every respect like certain hailstones
which I had collected during the summer. Under the mi
croscope elliptic and circular particles were seen, like those
composing hailstones. Previous to and during their fusion,
bubbles of air were seen exactly as in the hailstones, though
in less abundance. Some of these were enclosed, as repre
sented at p. 105, vol. xxviii. Phil. Mag. This observation
shows in a direct manner, with a much greater degree of
precision than I could have anticipated, the process of for
mation of hail as it takes place in general. In the first place,
an agglomeration of crystalline particles, probably in conse
quence of certain vorticose currents, takes place in a globular
shape. The ball of snow, thus formed by the capillary attrac
tion which it possesses from its porous structure, absorbs any
moisture that may exist around it. The effect of this moisture
is twofold; first, as modifying the angular outlines of the com
ponent particles; and secondly, as binding them together into
a consistent mass, which any further abstraction of caloric
will reduce to the state of a hard and solid hailstone.     If the
addition of moisture is considerable, the liquefaction of the

  and on the Organic Bodies contained in Hailstones, &c. 167
snow may continue until all traces of separate crystalline par
ticles have disappeared and the air has been disengaged, the
whole becomes transparent, and still capable, by its low tem
perature, of easily solidifying and forming a transparent mass
of ice. In either case the deposition of successive layers of
transparent ice, or of confused solid grains, may be accounted
for by a continuance of the same actions.
    In order to exemplify this, it is not requisite to confine our
selves merely to snow already in a globular state: any kind of
snow slightly pressed into a globular shape becomes hardened
and modified by diffusion of water through it, in consequence
of slight melting of its particles. According as this is more or
less continued, we obtain all the dull white tints of various
hailstones. If the mass thus obtained be now exposed to the
 air below the freezing-point, the process is still further com
pleted by its entire solidification.
    It still remained to be seen whether the conglomerations of
snow contained, like hail, any organic particles. I was desi
 rous to determine this point, because I considered them as
 being much less liable to contain foreign matter, such as dust
 &c. of the lower strata of air, than the common flakes of snow:
 at the same time we must admit the possibility of the intro
 duction of foreign particles, even after the entire formation of
 the ball, much more than in a solid body of ice like a hail
 Stone.
    In order to obtain a ball as free from impurity as possible,
 one of the hardest was selected, and after the exterior parts
 had been carefully brushed off, it was inclosed in the little
 apparatus before described. Several conglomerations were
 operated upon in this manner. In these the foreign particles
 were numerous; they all appeared irregular and of an amor
 phous inorganic nature, except some green globules closely
 agglomerated together, some in large quantities, others only
 consisting of groups of three or four: their size was about
 grºwth of an inch, and they were very similar to some found
 in hai, the vegetation of which was not examined (see p. 105,
 vol. xxviii. Phil. Mag.). The drops of water resulting, with
 their contents, were examined every day. The first two
 days they were kept in a room which averaged a few de
 grees above congelation; no alteration of the particles was de
  tected. The third day they were exposed to the rays of the
 sun: on the fourth day the green globules had emitted slight
  filaments. Every succeeding day these filaments increased,
  and near them were transparent granules scattered about
  which increased very slowly, as represented at fig. 3. These
 vegetations were preserved for more than a month by occasion

 168      / Dr. Waller's additional Observations on Hail,
 ally adding a drop of distilled water, so as to prevent their
 complete desiccation. At the end of this time the group of
 vegetation had but slightly increased, but around were several
 other groups of vegetations of the same nature which were not
 perceived at the commencement of the examination.            Their
 examination, which hitherto had been made nearly every day,
 was then abandoned as presenting no further object.
     As it is possible to distinguish snow of different formations,
 its minute examination made simultaneously by different ob
 servers over a considerable extent of country, would enable us
 in all probability to determine several interesting points con
 nected with the formation of snow. By their aid we might
 ascertain to what distance in certain cases the same crystalline
 form is preserved, and in what manner this is effected; whether
 by a simultaneous formation, or by a gradual propagation from
 one point to another; also at what rate of speed this is effected.
    The frequent transformation of the vapours of water from
 the gasiform to the nebular state, commencing from a small
 cloud at the horizon and rapidly extending to the whole visible
 sky, bears a close analogy to the action of crystallization of
 bodies in solution in a liquid. In both cases a molecular ac
tion commencing from a circumscribed point is gradually
propagated to the entire mass, when at a proper degree of
saturation in the liquid solution the crystals formed are all
alike. In the meteorological phaenomenon, as it is a liquid
that falls, the crystalline action cannot be observed; but the
frequent production of hail renders it not unlikely that the
clouds may sometimes be composed of solid particles.              *
    From their connection with the preceding remarks I will
mention the following experiments:—                            -
    Exp. 1. A saturated solution of sulphate of soda covered
with a thin coating of oil was allowed to cool, and remained
at rest for several hours. On a glass rod being brought in
contact with the surface, the well-known phaenomenon of the
solidification of the solution ensued. The speed at which this
solidification travelled from one extremity of the tube to the
other was at about the rate of one foot in forty seconds. The
crystalline particles thus formed consisted of long aciculae
about rºuth of an inch in thickness.
    Exp. 2. In a similar solution there were deposited, previous
to its solidification, beautiful transparent, hard crystals, which
are known to differ from Glauber's salts by their containing
only eight equivalents of water of crystallization to one of salt.
After the solidification had taken place the crystals were found
to be changed to a milk-white colour, although they still re
tained the same shape. Under the microscope they were

  and on the Organic Bodies contained in Hailstones, &c. 169
found to consist of minute irregular particles, which accounted
for the change of colour and opacity. It appears, therefore,
as if the molecular action, which causes the solidification, has
the power of disaggregating or breaking up the crystalline
arrangement of a body in a solid state.
    Exp. 3. A solution of sulphate of soda which is not satu
rated, or has not been allowed to cool entirely, is affected by
the contact of a foreign body much more slowly. After the
lapse of several minutes, the formation of separate clusters of
crystals much larger than the former is observed: after about
half an hour, these clusters were seen at numerous intermediate
points throughout the length of the tube, which was several
feet long.
   Frost and snow examined under a magnifying power are
much more alike than we should expect from their appearance
to the naked eye. I have already mentioned the small, nearly
cubical prisms, precisely like those of frost, which are found
in snow. In the following instance of hoar-frost the likeness
is still more complete.
   Dec. 28, 1846.-The ground and all minute filaments were
covered with abundant crystals of frost: thermometer 27°F.
The filaments of the spider's web were studded with quadri
lateral prisms ranged transversely along the threads. In the
afternoon a slight fall of snow occurred, whose particles were
exactly like those of Dec. 12, except that they fell in large
flakes. These were examined together with other particles of
frost deposited on a web, and found to be precisely the same,
except that the particles of snow were about a third smaller
than those of frost.
    Several salts manifest a peculiar tendency to ascend and cry
stallize on the sides of the vessel which contains them, but none
of them so greatly as water when it solidifies in a cavity formed
by moist earth. The first crystals formed are considerably
above the surface of the water; and they increase until a solid
crust is formed by them and the cavity below remains perfectly
dry. Camphor, naphthaline, iodine and hydrosulphate of am
monia, resemble water in their volatile properties, and their
tendency to solidify in a crystalline shape. The tendency of
the first to deposit itself in crystals on the side of the glass
nearest the light is well-known. Naphthaline in the same con
dition slowly deposits a few minute crystals on the same side :
after the lapse of a month a few scattered clusters of them were
formed, after which no further increase of them was perceived
even at the end of several months. Iodine exposed in a large
bottle to the sun during the summer formed deposits of differ
ent forms on various occasions, but all composed of rhombic
   Phil. Mag. S.3. Vol. 30. No. 200. March 1847.           N

170      Dr. Waller's additional Observations on Hail.
plates slightly modified. Some of these rhombic crystals were
separate, about the tenth of an inch in size, and with angles
of about 50° and 180°: some of the crystals formed long,
thin, narrow blades, above half an inch in length, with a bright
metallic lustre: on their edges were two or three indentations
indicating the separate crystals.
   Hydrosulphate of ammonia.-This is to be obtained by bring
ing into contact ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen in a
gaseous state and perfectly dry at a low temperature. We
then observe the formation of a white crystalline deposit on the
sides of the vessel in which the gases are received. Any fur
ther directions respecting the mode of obtaining it will be found
in Thenard's Chemistry, Berzelius, &c.
    Hydrosulphate of ammonia is so extremely volatile, that a
piece of lint wetted with aether and placed in contact with any
part of the bottle which contains it, causes the salt to form a
deposit at the inner surface beneath. The crystals in these
cases are frequently very regular hexagonal stars, like those
of snow. A current of water falling on any part of the bottle
rapidly produces the same effect. In summer it generally sub
limes to the upper part of the bottle, on account of the greater
heat which is communicated to the base of the bottle by con
tact with the shelf on which it is placed. In a clear night the
opposite effect is produced when placed in contact with the
ground. But it is particularly when employed as a differential
thermoscope that the indications of this salt are interesting.
Thus, during a clear night the salt rapidly accumulates towards
the points at which the greatest radiation of caloric takes place.
 A bottle containing this salt placed between two unequal ra
diating surfaces, indicates, by its change of position, the dif
 ference in the radiation of these surfaces.     In fact wherever
 the equable distribution of caloric is disturbed in the same
 direction for some time, the altered position of the hydrosul
phate serves as an indicator of the course it has taken, and
the forms of the crystals show to a certain extent the rapidity
with which it has been effected, because where the action is
 rapid the crystals are much smaller and more confused, than
 when it has been more gradual. It is surprising how small a
 difference in the radiating power is sufficient to alter the posi
 tion of the salt when properly disposed. I will not at pre
 sent enlarge any further on the thermoscopic properties of the
 hydrosulphate. It presents all the conditions corresponding
 to those of water. During its preparation it is frequently ob
 served in the air in a state of microscopic crystals representing
 snow : the crystals formed by rapid evaporation are exactly
 like the hexagonal plates of snow. A more gentle action gives

Rev. H. Moseley on a Machine for Calculating Numbers. 171
rise to crystallization, like those of frost and of congealed
water. Although we have rarely seen it in a liquid state, yet
during summer, under the influence of the sun's rays, its cry
stals become perfectly liquid and assume a globular form, and
which they retain as they again solidify; forming, in these
cases, conditions corresponding to water in a liquid state, ice
and sleet.
XXX. On a Machine for Calculating the Products, Quotients,
   Logarithms, and Powers of Numbers. By the Rev. HENRY
   Moseley, M.A., F.R.S., one of Her Majesty's Inspectors
   of Schools, and lately Professor of Natural Philosophy and
   Astronomy in King's College, London*.
                          [With a Plate.]
I    HAVE proposed to myself in the construction of this
    machine, to determine mechanically the products, quo
tients, logarithms, squares, square roots, ..f other powers
and roots of the natural numbers, by means of combinations of
greater simplicity than have hitherto been applied to the pur
poses of mechanical calculation.
   The accompanying Plate II. is intended to illustrate the prin
ciple of the machine, but it does not show the mechanical
details of its construction or the due proportion of its parts.
   It will be observed that it consists principally of a cone and
a screw. The application of the cone and the disc to various
purposes of mechanical calculation has long been well known,
and particularly by the ingenious applications made of the disc
to dynamical admeasurement by MM. Poncelet and Morin.
   The novelty of this instrument consists in the combination
of the screw with the cone.
   CD represents a small screw terminated by solid cylindrical
axes or gudgeons, of which that shown by the letter D is pro
longed, and carries an index T. The screw admits of being
fixed in its bearings or made to revolve in them.
   PQ is a wheel having a hollow cylindrical axis, into which
is accurately fitted a hollow cylindrical piece, whose internal
surface is traversed by the thread of a female screw working
 upon the male screw CD.
   The hollow axis of the wheel PQ admits of being fixed
upon the cylindrical piece inserted in it, or of being disengaged
from that piece, so that the wheel PQ may be made to carry
the female screw round with it in its revolutions, or to turn
freely upon the outside of the cylinder which contains that
screw, as upon an axis.
                  * Communicated by the Author.

 172 Rev. H. Moseley on a Machine for Calculating the
   The three arms of the wheel PQ are pierced by apertures,
through which pass, accurately fitting them, the three rods of
the rigid frame EF, which frame turns in fixed bearings at C
and D upon hollow axes, through which axes pass the cylin
drical extremities or gudgeons of the screw CD.
   The wheel PQ traverses the frame EF longitudinally, and
at the same time carries it round with it in its revolutions: and
it admits of being fired upon the frame at any distance from
either extremity. The frame carries an index S.
   AGH is a cone, whose side AG is parallel to the screw
CD, which turns by means of a spindle AB upon fixed bear
ings, and which is continually pressed upon the edge of the
wheel PQ by a spring acting upon the extremity of its spin
dle.    The cone is of some soft metal, brass for instance.
The edge of the wheel PQ is very thin, of steel, and milled,
so that it imprints a minute tooth upon the soft face of the
cone at every point where it revolves in contact with it.
   The spindle AB carries an index R. The indices R, S, T
point to equidistant divisions upon fixed circles, not shown
in the Plate; and each of them is connected with a train of
wheels and pinions, whose numbers of teeth are in the pro
portion of ten to one, and which serve to measure the com
plete number of revolutions and parts of a revolution made by
each index.
   Now certain dimensions (hereafter to be determined) being
assigned to the different elements of this combination, it may
be shown,-
   1st. That if the frame EF be fixed, and the screw CD
turned until the index T points to any given number Ng, and
then the frame be released, the wheel PQ fired upon the
frame, and the cone turned until the index R points to any
other given number Ni, then will the index S point to the
product of the numbers N, and Ng.
   2nd. That if, as before, the frame EF be fixed, and the
screw turned until the index T points to any number Ns, and
then the wheel PQ be fived on the frame, the frame released,
and the cone turned until the index S points to any other
º:       N2, then will the index R point to the quotient of N2
  y N8.
   3rd. That if the screw CD be fixed, the wheel PQ and the
frame released, and certain other adjustments made, and ifthe
cone be turned until the index S points to any number N,
then will the index R point to the logarithm of that number.
   4th. That if the spindle of the cone be connected with the
axis of the screw CD by means of two bevelled wheels, so that
the rotation of the one shall always bear a given relation to
that of the other, then the frame EF and the wheel PQ being

Products, Quotients, Logarithms, and Powers of Numbers. 173
both released, and the cone turned until the index R points
to any number, the index S will point to the square of that
number.
                    Theory of the Instrument.
   Let be taken to represent half the angle at the apex of the
cone, p the radius of the wheel PQ, and a the distance between
each two threads of the screw ; also let nº n2, ms represent
severally the numbers of equidistant divisions on the circles
to which the indices R, S, T severally point; then will
}, }, §       represent the numbers of revolutions made se
verally by the indices whilst the numbers N1, N2, Ng are
registered. Now suppose that when the wheel PQ is at the
apex of the cone the indices R., S and Teach point to zero,
and the frame EF being fixed, let the screw CD be turned
until the index T shows the number Ns; then will the screw
have made   § revolutions, and the wheel PQ will have ad
vanced from the apex of the cone to a distance AP from it,
represented by * . A ; so that the radius PM of the circle de
scribed by that point whilst the cone revolves will be represented
by  §   A sin I, and its circumference by 2x    S.  A sin i. Now
let the cone be made to revolve (the wheel #Q being fixed
upon the frame and the frame released) until the index R shows
                           -                      N          -
the number Ni, or until the cone has made # revolutions;
then will the point P in it have been made to revolve through
a space represented by
                     27: #asin. N,

But by reason of the continual pressure of the cone upon the
edge of the wheel PQ, that wheel will have been carried round
in the revolution of the cone, so that the circumference of
the wheel will have described precisely the same space as the
point P of the surface of the cone; if therefore N2 represent
the number pointed to by the index S, so that ; represents

whence it follows that if, proceeding in other respects precisely
as before, we cause the cone to revolve, not until its own index
R points to a given number, but until the index Spoints to
the given number N2, then will the index R of the cone show
a number Ni, which is the quotient of N2 and Ns.
     To adjust the instrument to show the logarithms of num
bers, let the wheel PQ be brought to the apex of the cone,
and let the screw CD be fixed, and the index S then made
to point to zero. Let the come then be turned until the index
S points to unity, and in this position of the cone let the index
R be made to point to zero. The frame EF being then
allowed to turn freely, and the wheel PQ to traverse freely
on the frame, the number N, shown by the index R will
always be the logarithm of the number Nashown by the index S.
For while the number N, is increased by the exceedingly small
number AN1, let the number N2 be increased by AN3; the

 same time, by the index of the second frame.
     In like manner, by placing any number of like systems of a
 frame, screw and wheel, upon the side of the cone, the third
 screw receiving its motion from the second frame, the fourth
 from the third, &c., any other powers of the number Ni, or
 roots of the numbers N3, Na, &c. may be conceived to be deter
 mined, the power shown by the last index, or the root by the
 first, being one greater than the number of frames so applied.
     The four equations of condition (2.), (3.), (),), (6.) between
 the nine quantities m1, m2, ng, na, n, n', A, i, p leave five of them
 undetermined.      These are to be assumed of such values as
 may be found most convenient in the construction of the
 machine, the general principle of which it is the object of this
 paper to explain.
     The Plate in particular, as has already been stated, is by
 no means intended to show the details of the construction
 of the machine, or even the general proportions of its parts,
 but simply to illustrate its principle. There are, indeed, some
 elements of its construction, which, for the sake of simplicity,
 have been altogether omitted from it. These are the trains
 of wheels which must be connected with each of the axes car
 rying the indices R, S, T to register the complete numbers of
 revolutions made by those indices, and the divided circles to
 which the indices point, showing such portions of the num
 bers N1, Na, &c. as correspond to less than one complete re
 volution.
    It will be obvious that, since the number N2 represents (in
 the first adjustment of the instrument) the product of the
 numbers N1 and Ns, the divisions on the circles pointed to
by the indices R and T must be greater than those of the
circle pointed to by the index S, or the numbers n, and ng less
than the number n3.
    It will, moreover, be observed, that the instrument, whilst
it differs from other calculating machines, and claims to be
superior to them in the simplicity of its combinations, differs
also, and is inferior to them in this respect, that the truth of
its registrations is dependent on the mechanical accuracy of
its construction.
   Those elements of the machine, on the mechanical truth

Mr. J. G. Children on a New Light for Optical Purposes. 179
and adaptation of which its accuracy depends, are, 1st, the
screw, the convolutions of whose thread must be of geome
trical unifornity; 2nd, the cone, whose surface must be of
geometrical truth; and 3rd, the wheel, whose edge must have
so intimate a contact with, and hold upon, the surface of the
cone, as to partake accurately in its motion at every point
which it traverses.
    My experience in the use of a similar cone and wheel in a
steam indicator constructed at the expense of the British
Association of Science, has convinced me that the required
accuracy is in this last respect attainable.
    In respect to the two first-mentioned sources of error, it
may be observed that there are no mechanical forms of greater
simplicity than the cone and the screw, and probably none in
respect to which greater truth of construction is attainable.
    Every such instrument must however have its error; its
amount in respect to this instrument may be determined by an
obvious method, and it is probable that it may in every case be
corrected by a corresponding adjustment.
XXXI. On the use of a mixture of Spirit of Wine and Cam
   phine, as a Light for Optical Purposes. By JoHN GeoRGE
    CHILDREN, Esq., F.R.S.
                       To Richard Taylor, Esq.
       MY DEAR SIR,                       Halstead Place, Feb. 13, 1847.
 IF you think the following trifle worth        inserting in the Phi
     losophical Magazine, it is at your service. I have lately
assisted a friend in getting up an apparatus for dissolving
views, &c. on a scale too large for sufficient illumination by
 the best Argand lamp, and we considered condensed hydrogen
gas as too dangerous an agent for a plaything; especially in
 private houses in the country, where much must be left in
 the preparation of the gases, &c. to servants unused to such
 duties.   We set to work therefore to find a substitute that
 might answer our purpose; and after a few trials we obtained
 a tolerable light, by throwing the flame of spirit of wine on a
surface of quicklime by a current of oxygen gas, something
 after the manner of Lieut. Drummond's original experiment”.
 The illumination by the flame of spirit of wine alone, however,
proved to be too feeble; but by mixing a portion of camphine
 (spirit of turpentine) with it (which readily dissolves in alcohol)
   * Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 330. Drummond's object and
 ours were somewhat different. He wanted to get an intense but small
 sphere of light, “adapted to the nature of a (parabolic) reflector:” we
 also wanted as intense a light as we could obtain, but, as we could not
advantageously use a reflector, one which should likewise extend over a
 much larger surface.

 180 Mr. J. G. Children on a New Light for Optical Purposes.
in the proportion, by measure, of one part of camphine to eight
 parts of spirit of wine, of the specific gravity of .841 at 60° F.
 (equivalent to the spirit of commerce of 60°), we obtained a
 light amply sufficient, not only for my friend's dissolving views,
 but also for his microscope and physioscope, and perfectly
 free from all danger, or even possibility of explosion. My
friend’s screen is about 22 x 18 feet; and if it were twice as
large, the light is quite capable of illuminating it brilliantly;
 and it shows a microscopic object, magnified from half an inch
 to thirty feet, or 720 times, linear, with great distinctness and
 beauty. I do not mean that our toy can be compared to the
almost solar intensity of the oxy-hydrogen light, also invented
 by the late Lieut. Drummond*, and now in common (too
common 2) use; but in a trial I made the other day in Francis
 Street, with an apparatus hastily put together for the purpose
by Mr. Collins, I found its effect, measured by one of Wheat
stone's photometers, equal to that of seventy-six of Brecknell
and Turner's best platted-wick wax candles; and in several
trials with our own apparatus, more carefully arranged, and
with thoroughly well and recently burnt lime (an essential
caution), we have found it quite equal to 108 of the same can
dles, and on one occasion to 120 ! The oxy-hydrogen light at
Mr.Collins's, which was splendidly brilliant, being compared in
the same manner, was found equal to 121 of the same candles.
    In these experiments, no portion of the rays from either of
the lights was intercepted; our object being to ascertain the
comparative illuminating power of their entire surfaces, and
not their comparative intensities onlyf.
    Were it not for the peculiar odour of the so-called naphtha
or coal-oil, which to some persons is highly offensive, even in
its purest state, it might, when highly rectified, be advan
tageously substituted, in an oeconomical point of view, for the
spirit of wine. Four ounces of camphor dissolved in a pint of
that liquid, gives, under the same circumstances, nearly as
brilliant a light as the spirit and camphine.
   The light from camphine alone is for a few seconds intensely
brilliant, but it is soon quenched in the enormous mass of un
burnt carbon, which partly condenses on the lime and partly
escapes into the atmosphere, filling the whole apartment with
a dense and almost suffocating cloud of floating black particles.
   * Philosophical Transactions, 1830.
   + Some attempts indeed were made in Francis Street to compare the
intensities alone; but the apparatus, from want of time to prepare a better,
was too imperfect to allow me to place any confidence in the results. As
far as they went, they were greatly in favour of the superior intensity of the
oxy-hydrogen light. I hope to repeat the trials with a more refined appa
ratus.

          M. Encke on the Newly discovered Planet.                       181
A sufficient and well-regulated supply of oxygen gas might
perhaps remedy this defect.
   Our apparatus consists of a copper lamp with two tubes
lying close together, and each containing a wick formed of
flat cotton rolled up into a cylinder; and a cylinder of lime,
about three-eighths of an inch long and one-eighth of an inch
in diameter, inclosed in a thin copper case. The pipe con
veying the oxygen gas from the gasometer terminates in a
small jet, inclining upwards, which lies between the two wicks
slightly parted to receive it, and within rather less than one
eighth of an inch from the circular disc of lime, and about
one-fourth of an inch above the lower edge of the copper case.
We find that the common chalk of this neighbourhood fur
nishes a lime which gives a better light than that from the
Bristol, or any other limestone we have tried”.
   Mr. Collins, philosophical instrument-maker to the Royal
Polytechnic Institution, makes lanterns for dissolving views
and microscopes, fitted up with the spirit and camphine light,
and will be happy to show its effect to any gentleman who may
wish to see it. His address is “26 Francis Street, Tottenham
Court Road,” and at the Polytechnic Institution.

XXXII. On the Newly discovered Planet. By M. ENcKE+.
Tº new planet, the orbit and                present position of which
      had been announced d priori by M. Le Verrier of Paris,
was discovered almost immediately at the Berlin observatory
by Dr. Galle: the very first night the Hora XXI. of the Aca
demy's star-maps (which have been prepared with such extra
ordinary care and accuracy by Dr. Bremiker) was compared
with the heavens, and thus afforded the most brilliant proof
of the truth of theory, and the wonderful sagacity with which
M. Le Verrier had made use of the existing data. With
this confirmation, so far exceeding any expectations which

of the mode in which it is gained.
    From the slowness of the motion of the planet, the obser
vations hitherto made at the Berlin observatory, although
they extend to twenty-five days, may all be connected with a
star occurring in Bessel's zones, the mean place of which was

            M. Encke on the Newly discovered Planet.                183
   The elements are indeed merely approximative; but since
a circular orbit, previously calculated by me from other ob
servations, gave very nearly the same numbers, it may at least
be concluded from them that the planet is much nearer than
M. Le Verrier had assumed. Its distance from the sun should
be 33 according to his elements, while according to the above
it will not differ much from 30 ; consequently the period of
revolution will also be shorter. If the orbit were actually cir
cular, the period would be about 165 years.
    In another point, however, with respect to which M. Le
Verrier had only presumptions to go upon, he has hit the
truth with most remarkable accuracy. According to him, the
disc of the planet amounts to about 3"-3, while the mean of
the measurements gives 2"-7.
    I take this opportunity of expressing my views with regard
to the name which I intend to assign to the planet for the next
year, as I am compelled to come to some decision on account
of the publication of the Astronomical Jahrbuch, in which the
 planet must be inserted as soon as its elements are more ac
curately determined. To every new planet, the astrono
mers who were countrymen of the discoverer at first added ap
pellations, which were intended to call to mind some peculiar
circumstance. Thus the English called and still call Uranus
the Georgian planet.*, as a mark of gratitude to king George
the Third, whose munificence enabled Herschel to construct
 his great reflectors; and the planet was detected, as is well
 known, by its disc. Piazzi named his planet Ceres Ferdinan
 dea, in honour of the king of Naples, the founder of the obser
vatory at Palermo. In the same manner Pallas was at first
called Olbersiana, until Olbers himself pronounced strongly
 against the adjective. Subsequently the epithets have been
 disused by the German discoverers, Harding, Olbers and
 Hencke; and according to the suggestion of Bode, the name
 Uranus has been everywhere introduced except in England,
 and the name Ceres is now generally used without any addition.
    The astronomers of Paris appear also to have had respect to
 this custom of naming the planets after the ancient divinities,
 principally of the Romans; since Le Verrier himself, in his
 first letter to Dr. Galle, Oct. 1, in answer to the announce
 ment of the discovery of the planet, states at the conclusion,
 “the Bureau des Longitudes has pronounced for NEPTUNE,
 the sign a trident.” This too appears to have been after some
 ††               ; for as Dr. Galle had in his letter hinted at the
 name Janus, M. Le Verrier observes that “the name Janus
    * In the Nautical Almanac only. Uranus is the name now in general use
 with British astronomers.-ED,

     Moreover, this name [Neptune] has been widely bruited;
 for in a letter which I have received from Gauss, our first
 German authority in astronomy, dated Oct. 7, he says, “Icon
 sider the name    §.                by M. Le Verrier to be very
 appropriate; perhaps a trident might be selected as the sign if
 it were not improper in any way to interfere with the rights of:
 the discoverer.”                                         - -   * * *
    Now in a letter which I have received from M. Le Verrier,
 dated Oct. 6, he states, “I requested my illustrious friend, i.
 M. Arago, to choose a name for the planet. I was somewhat ,
 startled at the decision (j'ai été un peu confus) which he madeº
 at a sitting of the Academy.” This confirms the information:
 we have received through other channels, that the name Le
 Verrier had been proposed by M. Arago.                       º  * *
    Fortified by the high authority of Gauss, and the Bureau,;
 des Longitudes of Paris, I shall, under these circumstances, 2
 retain for the next year the name Neptune, and the sign of .
 the trident, until public opinion in Germany has become suffi-j
 ciently consolidated to establish a definitive appellation, Ourº
 German custom has prevailed in the case of four, we may a
 even say five new planets, as Herschel was a German by birth;
 and as it cannot be in the least my intention to undervalue the ºr
great merits of M. Le Verrier, which I have most cordially,
admitted, so it is my opinion that his name will ever remain<U+017F>t
so firmly connected with Neptune, that it is not necessary, in
order to keep up the recollection of the discovery, to introduced
the somewhat incongruous collocation of the heathen gods
 with a modern name. Besides, in the present case, a Germann
has the essential merit of having discovered the planet.
    In letters which I have since received from Sir John Her
schel, the planet is also called Neptune; and Struve, in Pul-,
kowa, has pronounced decidedly for retaining this name. The
first astronomical authorities, therefore, in Germany, France,
England and Russia, have pronounced in favour of NEPTUNE.
   Note.—A paper received by the Astronomer Royal from
M. Struve, and inserted in the Athenaeum for Feb. 20, assigns
similar reasons for adopting the proposed name. We subjoin
the following passage:—
   “Far be it from us to have any intention of withholding our
entire admiration from the eminent merit of M. Le Verrier.
But impartial history will, in the future, make honourable
mention also of the name of Mr. Adams, and recognise two
individuals as having, independently of one another, discovered
the planet beyond Uranus. In the same way, it attributes

              *Mr. H. S. Warner on viº<U+017F>.” ‘’’                         185

and to Leibnitz. Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal at Green
wich, has published a complete and authentic report on the
labours of Mr. Adams relative to the existence of the Trans
Uranian planet.        In that report, we see that in September
1845. Mr. Adams arrived at a result, and that in October he
transmitted to Mr. Airy a paper containing elements of the
present planet so nearly approximative that it might have
been found in the heavens ten months before it actually was.
But Mr. Adams's labours were unsuccessful, because the two
astronomers (Mr. Challis of Cambridge and Mr. Airy of
Greenwich) to whom they were known hesitated to admit
them without further examination.            Their doubts are ex
plained by the importance and novelty of the object, and by
the extraordinary difficulty of the research itself, which might
well have been deemed beyond the powers of a young savant
till then unknown. These doubts were accordingly not dis
sipated until the moment when M. Le Verrier published the
results of his admirable investigations, which led to the most
brilliant discovery in the astronomy of the solar system, while
the other astronomers of Europe had no suspicion of the ex
istence of Mr. Adams's labours.         M. Galle of Berlin, was the
first to find the planet indicated by M. Le Verrier. While
we consider all these circumstances attendant on the discovery
of the new planet, we at the same time conceive that we find
the adhesion of M. Le Verrier to the name of Neptune, not
only in his announcement to us of the 1st of October, but also
in his later letters addressed to the Academy of Sciences and
to two astronomers of the central observatory—letters which
make no objection whatever to the name of Neptune chosen
by the Bureau des Longitudes.
    “Consequently, we will retain the name of Neptune; and
will make no change unless hereafter the general voice shall
determine in favour of another name.

 reasons and in his conclusions.

     Thus, incongruity in geometrical problems (and of course
 in those only can we consider w/– l a symbol of perpendicu

that V-1 marks an error in estimating direction, it is easy
 to show that this error is one of a right angle; for the error
shown by V-1 being twice repeated, gives —a in place of

XXXIV. On the Induction of Atmospheric Electricity on the
    Wires of the Electric Telegraph. By Prof. Joseph HENRY +.
THE action of the electricity of the atmosphere on the wires
       of the electrical telegraph is at the present time a subject
of much importance, both on account of its practical bearing,
and the number of purely scientific questions which it involves.
I have accordingly given due attention to the letter referred
to me, and have succeeded in collecting a number of facts in
reference to the action in question. Some of these are from
the observations of different persons along the principal lines,
and others from my own investigations during a {...,
on the 19th of June, when I was so fortunate as to be present
in the office of the telegraph in Philadelphia, while a series of
very interesting electrical phaenomena was exhibited. In con
nexion with the facts derived from these sources, I must ask
the indulgence of the Society in frequently referring, in the
course of this communication, to the º of my previous

investigations in dynamic electricity, accounts of which are to
be found in the Proceedings and Transactions of this Institu
tion.                             *   -            . . .. . . .  . . .
    From all the information on the subject of the action of the
electricity of the atmosphere on the wires of the telegraph, it
is evident that effects are produced in several different ways.
    1. The wires of the telegraph are liable to be struck by a
direct discharge of lightning from the clouds, and several cases
of this kind have been noticed during the present season.
About the 20th of May the lightning struck the elevated part
of the wire, which is supported on a high mast at the place
where the telegraph crosses the Hackensack river. The fluid
passed along the wire each way, from the point which received
the discharge, for several miles, striking off at irregular inter
vals down the supporting poles. At each place where the dis
charge to a pole took place, a number of sharp explosions
were heard in succession, resembling the rapid reports of
several rifles. During another storm, the wire was struck in
two places in Pennsylvania, on the route between Philadelphia
 and New York; at one of these places twelve poles were
 struck, and at the other eight. In the latter case the remark
 able fact was observed, that every other pole escaped the dis
 charge; and the same phaenomenon was observed, though in
 a less marked degree, near the Hackensack river. In some
 instances the lightning has been seen coursing along the wire
 in a stream of light; and in another case it is described as
 exploding from the wire at certain points, though there were
 no bodies in the vicinity to attract it from the conductor.
     In discussing these and other facts to be mentioned here
 after, we shall, for convenience, adopt the principles and lan
 guage of the theory which refers the phaenomena of electricity
 to the action of a fluid, of which the particles repel each other,
 and are attracted by the particles of other matter. Although
 it cannot be affirmed that this theory is an actual representa
 tion of the cause of the phaenomena as they are produced in
 nature, yet it may be asserted that it is, in the present state of
 science, an accurate mode of expressing the laws of electrical
 action, so far as they have been made out; and that though
 there are a number of phaenomena which have not as yet been
 referred to this theory, there are none which are proved to
 be directly at variance with it.
     That the wires of the telegraph should be frequently struck
 by a direct discharge of lightning, is not surprising, when we
 consider the great length of the conductor, and consequently
 the many points along the surface of the earth through which
 it must pass peculiarly intº,to receive the discharge from
                                    2

188             Prof. Henry on Electrical Induction
:*: ...Also, from the great length of the conductor,
the more readily must the repulsive action of the free electri
city of the cloud drive the natural electricity of the conductor
to the further end of the line, thus rendering more intense the
negative condition of the nearer part of the wire, and conse
quently increasing the attraction of the metal for the free
electricity of the cloud. It is not however probable that the
attraction, whatever may be its intensity, of so small a quantity
of matter as that of the wire of the telegraph, can of itself
produce an electrical discharge from the #. although,
if the discharge were started by some other cause, such as the
attraction of a large mass of conducting matter in the vicinity,
the attraction of the wire might be sufficient to change the
direction of the descending bolt, and draw it in part or whole
to itself.   It should also be recollected that, on account of the
perfect conduction, a discharge on any part of the wire must
affect every other part of the connected line, although it may
be hundreds of miles in length.
   That the wire should give off a discharge to a number of
poles in succession, is a fact I should have expected, from my
previous researches on the lateral discharge of a conductor
transmitting a current of free electricity. In a paper on this
subject, presented to the British Association in 1837, I showed
that when electricity strikes a conductor explosively, it tends
to give off sparks to all bodies in the vicinity, however inti
mately the conductor may be connected with the earth. In
an experiment in which sparks from a small machine were
thrown on the upper part of a lightning-rod, erected in ac
cordance with the formula given by the É. Institute, cor
responding sparks could be drawn from every part of the rod,
even from that near the ground. In a communication since
made to this Society, I have succeeded in referring this phae
nomenon to the fact, that during the transmission of a quan
tity of electricity along a rod, the surface of the conductor is
charged in succession, as it were, by a wave of the fluid, which,
when it arrives opposite a given point, tends to give off a spark
to a neighbouring body, for the same reason that the charged
conductor of the machine gives off a spark under the same
circumstances.
   It might at first be supposed that the redundant electricity
of the conductor would exhaust itself in giving off the first
spark, and that a second discharge could not take place; but
it should be observed, that the wave of free electricity, in its
passage, is constantly attracted to the wire by the portion of
the uncharged conductor, which immediately precedes its
position at any time; and hence but a part of the whole re

              on the Wires of the Electric Telegraph.           189
dundant electricity is given off at one place; the velocity of
transmission of the wave as it passes the neighbouring body,
and its attraction for the wire, preventing a full discharge at
any one place. The intensity of the successive explosions is
explained by referring to the fact, that the discharge from the
clouds does not generally consist of a single wave of electricity,
but of a number of discharges along the same path in rapid
succession, or of a continuous discharge which has an appre
ciable duration; and hence the wire of the telegraph is capable
of transmitting an immense quantity of the fluid thus distri
buted over a great length of the conductor.
   The remarkable facts of the explosions of the electricity into
the air, and of the poles being struck in interrupted succession,
find a plausible explanation in another electrical principle
which I have established, namely, in all cases of the disturb
ance of the equilibrium of the electrical plenum, which we
must suppose to exist throughout all terrestrial space, the state
of rest is attained by a series of diminishing oscillations. Thus
in the discharge of a Leyden jar, I have shown that the phae
nomena exhibited cannot be explained by merely supposing
the transfer of a quantity of fluid from the inner to the outer
side of the jar; but in addition to this we are obliged to admit
the existence of several waves, backwards and forwards, until
the equilibrium is attained. In the case of the discharge from
the cloud, a wave of the natural electricity of the metal is re
pelled each way from the point on which the discharge falls,
to either end of the wire, is then reflected, and in its reverse
passage meets in succession the several waves which make up
the discharge from the cloud. These waves will therefore
interfere at certain points along the wire, producing, for a
moment, waves of double magnitude, and will thus enhance
the tendency of the fluid at these points to fly from the con
ductor. I do not say that the effects observed were actually
produced in this way; I merely wish to convey the idea that
known principles of electrical action might, under certain cir
cumstances, lead us to anticipate such results.
   2. The state of the wire may be disturbed by the conduc
tion of a current of electricity from one portion of space to
another, without the presence of a thunder-cloud; and this
will happen in case of a long line, when the electrical condition
of the atmosphere which surrounds the wire at one place is
different from that at another.      Now it is well known that a
mere difference in elevation is attended with a change in the
electrical state of the atmosphere. A conductor, elevated by
means of a kite, gives sparks of positive electricity in a perfectly

190           Prof. Henry on Electrical Induction
clear day; hence if the line of the telegraph passes over an
elevated mountain ridge, there will be continually, during
clear weather, a current from the more elevated to the lower
points of the conductor.
   A current "y also be produced in a long level line, by the
precipitation of vapour in the form of fog at one end, while
the air remains clear at the other; or by the existence of a
storm of rain or snow at any point along the line, while the
other parts of the wire are not subjected to the same influence.
   Currents of sufficient power to set in motion the marking
machine of the telegraph have been observed, which must have
been produced by some of these causes. In one case the ma
chine spontaneously began to operate without the aid of the
battery, while a snow storm was falling at one end of the line,
and clear weather existed at the other.     On another occasion
a continued stream of electricity was observed to pass between
two points at a break in the wire, presenting the appearance
of a gas-light almost extinguished. A constant effect of this
kind indicates a constant accession of electricity at one part of
the wire, and a constant discharge at the other.
   3. The natural electricity of the wire of the telegraph is
liable to be disturbed by the ordinary electrical induction of a
distant cloud. Suppose a thunder-cloud, driven by the wind
in such a direction as to cross one end of the line of the tele
graph at the elevation, say of a mile; during the whole time
of the approach of the cloud to the point of its path directly
above the wire, the repulsion of the redundant electricity with
which it is charged would constantly drive more and more of
the natural electricity of the wire to the further end of the
line, and would thus give rise to a current. When the cloud
arrived at the point nearest to the wire, the current would
cease for a moment; and as the repulsion gradually diminished
by the receding of the cloud, the natural electricity of the
wire would gradually return to its normal state, giving rise to
a current in an opposite direction. If the cloud were driven
by the wind parallel to the line of the telegraph, a current
would be produced towards each end of the wire, and these
would constantly vary in intensity with the different positions
of the cloud. Although currents produced in this way may
be too feeble to set in motion the marking apparatus, yet they
may have sufficient power to influence the action of the cur
rent of the battery so as to interfere with the perfect operation
of the machine.
   4. Powerful electrical currents are produced in the wires of
the telegraph by every flash of lightning which takes place

             on the Wires of the Electric Telegraph.          191
within many miles of the line, by the action of dynamic in
duction; which differs from the action last described, in being
the result of the influence of electricity in motion on the na
tural electricity of the conductor. The effect of this induction,
which is the most fruitful source of disturbance, will be best
illustrated by an account of some experiments of my own,
presented to the Society in 1843. A copper wire was sus
pended by silk strings around the ceiling of an upper room, so
as to form a parallelogram of about sixty feet by thirty on the
sides; and in the cellar of the same building, immediately be
low, another parallelogram of the same dimensions was placed.
When a spark from an electrical machine was transmitted
through the upper parallelogram, an induced current was de
veloped in the lower one sufficiently powerful to magnetize
needles, although two floors intervened, and the conductors
were separated to the distance of thirty feet. In this expe
riment no electricity passed through the floors from one con
ductor to the other; the effect was entirely due to the repul
sive action of the electricity in motion in the upper wire on
the natural electricity of the lower. In another experiment,
two wires, about 400 feet long, were stretched parallel to each
other between two buildings; a spark of electricity sent
through one produced a current in the other, though the two
were separated to the distance of 300 feet; and from all the
experiments, it was concluded that the distance might be in
definitely increased, provided the wires were lengthened in a
corresponding ratio.
   That the same effect is produced by the repulsive action of
the electrical discharge in the heavens, is shown by the fol
lowing modification of the foregoing arrangement. One of
the wires was removed, and the other so lengthened at one
end as to pass into my study, and thence through a cellar
window into an adjacent well. With every flash of lightning
which took place in the heavens, within at least a circle of
twenty miles around Princeton, needles were magnetized in
the study by the induced current developed in the wire. The
same effect was produced by soldering a wire to the metallic
roof of the house, and passing it down into the well; at every
flash of lightning a series of currents in alternate directions
was produced in the wire.
   I was also led, from these results, to infer that induced cur
rents must traverse the line of a railroad, and this I found to
be the case. Sparks were seen at the breaks in the continuity
of the rail, with every flash of a distant thunder-cloud.
   Similar effects, but in a greater degree, must be produced
on the wire of the telegraph by every discharge in the heavens;

192            Prof. Henry on Electrical Induction
and the phaenomena which I witnessed on the 19th of June in
the telegraph office in Philadelphia, were, I am sure, of this
kind. In the midst of the hurry of the transmission of the
congressional intelligence from Washington to Philadelphia,
and thence to New York, the apparatus began to work irre
gularly. The operator at each end of the line announced at
the same time a storm at Washington, and another at Jersey
City, The portion of the circuit of the telegraph which en
tered the building, and was connected with one pole of the
galvanic battery, happened to pass within the distance of less
than an inch of the wire which served to form the connexion
of the other pole with the earth. Across this space, at an in
terval of every few minutes, a series of sparks in rapid succes
 sion was observed to pass; and when one of the storms arrived
 so near Philadelphia that the lightning could be seen, each
 series of sparks was found to be simultaneous with a flash in
 the heavens. Now we cannot suppose for a moment that
 the wire was actually struck at the time each flash took place;
 and indeed it was observed that the sparks were produced
 when the cloud and flash were at the distance of several miles
 to the east of the line of the wire. The inevitable conclusion
 is, that all the exhibition of electrical phaenomena witnessed
 during the afternoon was purely the effect of induction, or
 the mere disturbance of the natural electricity of the wire at a
 distance, without any transfer of the fluid from the cloud to
 the apparatus.                                               ºf
     The discharge between the two portions of the wire con
 tinued for more than an hour, when the effect became so
 powerful, that the superintendent, alarmed for the safety of
 the building, connected the long wire with the city gas-pipes,
 and thus transmitted the current silently to the ground. I
  was surprised at the quantity and intensity of the current; it
  is well known, that to affect a common       galvanometer with
 ordinary electricity, requires the discharge of a large battery;
 but such was the quantity of the induced current exhibited on
 this occasion, that the needle of an ordinary vertical galvano
  meter, with a short wire, and apparently of little sensibility,
 was moved several degrees.
     The pungency of the spark was also, as might have been
  expected, very great. When a small break was made in the
  circuit, and the parts joined by the fore-finger and thumb, the
  discharge transmitted through the hand affected the whole arm
  up to the shoulder. I was informed by the superintendent,
  that on another occasion a spark passed over the surface of
  the spool of wire, surrounding the legs of the horse-shoe
  magnet at right angles to the spires; and such was its inten

              on the Wires of the Electric Telegraph.              193
sity and quantity, that all the wires across which it passed
were melted at points in the same straight line as if they had
been cut in two by a sharp knife.               tº       . .    .. . .

    The effects of the powerful discharges from the clouds may
be prevented in a great degree, by erecting at intervals along
the line, and aside of the supporting poles, a metallic wire,
connected with the earth at the lower end, and terminating
above at the distance of about half an inch from the wire of
the telegraph. By this arrangement the insulation of the con
ductor will not be interfered with, while the greater portion
 of the charge will be drawn off. I think this precaution of
 great importance at places where the line crosses a river, and
 is supported on high poles; also in the vicinity of the office
 of the telegraph, where a discharge, falling on the wire near
 the station, might send a current into the house of sufficient
 quantity to produce serious accidents. The fate of Prof. Rich
 man, of St. Petersburg, should be recollected, who was killed
 by a flash from a small wire, which entered his house from an
 elevated pole while he was experimenting on atmospheric
 electricity.
    The danger, however, which has been apprehended from
 the electricity leaving the wire and discharging itself into a
 person on the road, is, I think, very small; electricity of suf
 ficient intensity to strike a person at the distance of eight or
 ten feet from the wire, would, in preference, be conducted
 down the nearest pole. It will, however, in all cases be most
 prudent to keep at a proper distance from the wire during the
 existence of a thunder-storm in the neighbourhood.
    It may be mentioned as an interesting fact, derived from
 two independent sources of information, that large numbers
 of small birds have been seen suspended by the claws from
 the wire of the telegraph. They had in all probability been
 instantaneously killed, either by a direct discharge, or an in
 duced current from a distant cloud, while they were resting on
 the wire.
    Though accidents to the operators, from the direct dis
 charge, may be prevented by the method before mentioned,
 yet the effect on the machine cannot be entirely obviated; the
 residual current which escapes the discharge along the per
 pendicular wires, must neutralize for a moment the current
 of the battery, and produce irregularity of action in the appa
 ratus.
     The direct discharge from the cloud on the wire is, com
 paratively, not a frequent occurrence, while the dynamic in
 ductive influence must be a source of constant disturbance

 194       Mr. H. Spencer on the Form of the Earth.
 during the season of thunder-storms; and no other method
 presents itself to my mind at this time for obviating the effect,
 but that of increasing the size of the battery, and diminishing
 the sensibility of the magnet, so that at least the smaller in
 duced currents may not be felt by the machine. It must be
 recollected that the inductive influence takes place at a distance
 through all bodies, conductors and non-conductors; and hence
 no coating that can be put upon the wire will prevent the forma
 tion of induced currents.
    I think it not improbable, since the earth has been made to
 act the part of the return conductor, that some means will be
 discovered for insulating the single wire beneath the surface
 of the earth; the difficulty in effecting this is by no means as
 great as that of insulating two wires, and preventing the cur
 rent striking across from one to the other. A wire buried in
 the earth would be protected in most cases from the effect
 of a direct discharge; but the inductive influence would still
 be exerted, though perhaps in a less degree.
   The wires of the telegraph are too small and too few in
number to affect, as some have supposed, the electrical con
dition of the atmosphere, by equalizing the quantity of the
fluid in different places, and thus producing a less changeable
state of the weather. The feeble currents of electricity which
must be constantly passing along the wires of a long line, may,
however, with proper study, be the means of discovering many
interesting facts relative to the electrical state of the air over
different regions.
XXXV. The Form of the Earth no proof of Original Fluidity.
                    By HERBERT SPENCER+.
IT has been generally considered that the spheroidal form
    of the earth—indicating as it does obedience to centrifugal
force—implies a primary state of fluidity. If however it can
be shown that, notwithstanding its apparent solidity, the earth
must be at the present moment entirely subject to the influ
ences affecting its general figure, and that so far as the gra
vitative and centrifugal forces are concerned it is plastic still,
the theory of original fluidity, however probable on other
grounds, can no longer be inferred from the earth's oblate
IlesS.
   The facts indicative of a varying relationship between the
bulk and tenacity of matter are of every-day observation. We
constantly see a drop of water maintain its sphericity in spite
of opposing forces—increase the mass, and it flows out in com
                 * Communicated by the Author,

            Mr. H. Spencer on the Form of the Earth.          195
plete obedience to them. “ The mud in our streets stands in
ridges behind the passing cart-wheel—when scraped together
it appears liquid and assumes a horizontal surface. On the
spade of the excavator, clay retains its square figure and its
sharp angles; but when made into a bulky embankment, it
will, if the slope be insufficient, spread itself out on one or
both sides of the base, occasionally continuing to slip until it
assumes an inclination of six to one.
    A comparison of the physical powers of large and small
animals exhibits a series of facts of an analogous character.
A flea jumps several hundred times its own length, and is un
injured by collision with any obstacle. The great mammals,
on the other hand, seem to possess no agility whatever; and
 a concussion borne by the insect with impunity would smash
an elephant to a jelly. Between these extremes may be ob
 served a gradation in the ratios of power to bulk; so that
 commencing with the smaller creatures, every increment of
size is, catteris paribus, accompanied by an under-proportionate
 increase of strength, until we arrive at that limit (to which the
 elephant has evidently approximated) where the creature is no
 longer capable of supporting its own framework.
     These and innumerable like facts point to the inference
 that fluidity and solidity are to a great extent qualities of
 degree; that the cohesive tenacity of any piece of matter bears,
 as the mass of that matter is increased, a constantly decreasing
 ratio to the natural forces tending to the fracture of that mat
 ter; and that hence any substance, however solid to our per
 ceptions, only requires to have its bulk increased to a certain
 point, to give way, and become in a sense fluid before the
 gravitative and other forces.                                     -
     However repugnant to that “common sense” for which
 some have so great a respect, this proposition is capable of a
 very simple demonstration.
     The strength of a bar of iron, timber, or other material
                                               BD2
 subjected to the transverse strain varies as +: B being the
  breadth, D the depth, and L the length. Suppose the size
  of this bar to be changed, whilst the ratios of its dimensions
  continue the same; then as the fraction    #  will remain con
  stant the strength will vary as D*, or (since D bears always
  the same proportion to B and L) as Bº or L*. Hence in
  similar masses of matter the resistances to the transverse strain
  are as the squares of the linear dimensions. The same law
  still more manifestly applies to the longitudinal strain, when

196                         Royal Society.
the strength, depending as it does on the sectional area, must,
in similar masses, vary as the square of any side. And in the
torsion strain we may readily detect the like general principle,
that, other things equal, the resistances to fracture bear a con
stant ratio to the squares of the dimensions.                         -
    Not so however with the powers tending to the disruption
of matter. The effects of gravity, centrifugal force, and all
agencies antagonistic to cohesive attraction, vary as the mass,
that is, as the cubes of the dimensions.                .
    However great, therefore, in a given portion of matter, may
be the excess of the form-preserving force over the form
destroying force, it is clear that, if during augmentation of
bulk the form-preserving force increases only as the squares
of the dimensions, whilst the form-destroying force increases
as their cubes, the first must in time be overtaken and exceeded
by the last; and when this occurs, the matter will be fractured
and re-arranged in obedience to the form-destroying force. ,
    Viewed by the light of this principle, the fact that the earth
is an oblate spheroid does not seem to afford any support to
the hypothesis of original fluidity as commonly understood.
We must consider that, in respect of its obedience to the geo
dynamic laws, the earth is fluid now and must always remain
so; for the most tenacious substance with which we are ac
quainted, when subjected to the same forces that are acting
upon the earth's crust, would exceed the limit of self-support
determined    by the above law, before it attained mirrºth ofs
the earth’s bulk.
    Reference to a table of the resistances of various substances
to a crushing force will render this manifest.                    - -

YTHE Marquis of Northampton in the Chair.
      The noble President stated that the Council had awarded one of
its Medals to M. Le Verrier; two Medals to Mr. Faraday, for his
discoveries in the universal action of Electricity and Galvanism; and
one of the Royal Medals to Prof. Owen, for his paper on the Be
lemnite.
   After presenting the Medals, the President proceeded to the bio
graphical notices of some of the deceased members, from which we
select the following:—
   JoHN Bostock, M.D., has long occupied a distinguished station

                            Royal Society.                         197
among the zealous cultivators of Animal Chemistry, Physiology,
and other branches of Medical Science.       His father had been esta
blished as physician at Liverpool, and from his great talents would
probably have risen to considerable eminence, had not these brilliant
prospects been doomed to sudden extinction by an untimely death,
before he had attained the age of thirty. He left an only child, the
subject of the present notice, who was born in 1774, the year pre
ceding that fatal event, and whose early education was conducted
at the New College at Hackney, at the time when Dr. Priestley was
delivering lectures on chemistry. Having imbibed, under such able
tuition, an ardent love of science, young Bostock was led to make
choice of medicine as his profession. He studied at Edinburgh,
where he graduated in the year 1798, and soon afterwards com
menced practice in his native town. The activity of his mind was
there displayed, not only in numerous contributions to most of the
medical and scientific journals, but also in the prominent part which
he took in planning and establishing various charitable, scientific
and literary institutions, and more particularly the Fever Hospital,
and the Botanic Garden; and also the Philosophical and Literary
Institution of Liverpool, where, in the capacity of Professor of Phy
siology, he delivered the first course of lectures there given.
   Having secured a competent fortune, Dr. Bostock determined, in
1817, to relinquish his profession and fix his residence in London,
where he could possess more extensive means of prosecuting his
favourite studies, and enjoy a more enlarged society of scientific
friends.    He soon became an associate of most of the scientific so
cieties of the metropolis, and an active labourer in their management.
In 1818, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; was several
times placed on its Councils, and in 1832, filled the office of Vice
President. He was for some years Secretary of the Geological So
ciety, and in 1826 was appointed its President. He long held the
office of Treasurer of the Medical and Chirurgical Society, and took
an active share in the management of the Fever Hospital, not only
as a member of its Committee, but also as one of its House Direct
ors. He was also, during a long period, one of the lecturers on
Chemistry at the Medical School of Guy's Hospital, being appointed
to that office on the death of his friend Dr. Marcet, in 1822.
   Amidst these multiplied public avocations, he found leisure for the
accomplishment of a great variety of literary and scientific labours,
the aggregate amount of which would appear astonishing to any
one who was not acquainted with his methodical habits, his perse
vering industry, and his advantageous employment of every portion
of his time. His contributions to medical and scientific journals,
transactions of societies and cyclopædias, amount to no less than
sixty-nine; of which twenty are contained in Nicholson's Journal
and Annals of Philosophy, eighteen in the Medico-Chirurgical Trans
actions, and twelve in the Cyclopædias of Practical Medicine, and of
 Anatomy and Physiology. Only one paper by him appears in the
 Philosophical Transactions (in 1829), namely, that “On the spon
taneous purification of the Thames Water," recording the observa

 198                        Royal Society,
tions he made in the course of some analyses which he undertook
at the request of the Commissioners appointed by the Crown to
inquire into the supply of water to the metropolis.
   Some of the more finished papers and essays which had appeared
in these works, were afterwards republished by him in a separate
form. Among these are his “Account of the History and present
state of Galvanism,” originally published in Brewster's Cyclopædia,
and which appeared in 1818; and his “History of Medicine,” which
had been prefixed to the Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine. One
of his earliest publications was an “Essay on Respiration ;", his at
tachment to chemical pursuits having naturally led him to the par
ticular study of this part of the animal economy. At a later period,
he engaged in the compilation of a general work, embracing the
whole subject of physiology, which he completed in three volumes,
the last of which appeared in 1827, under the title of “Elementary
System of Physiology;” the third and last edition, published in 1837,
comprised the whole in one thick octavo volume of nearly 900 pages.
It is a work of immense labour and research, containing condensed
and elaborate analyses of all that had at that time been published,
both as to facts and theories, in the wide field of physiology. It con
stitutes, in fact, an Encyclopaedia of this department of medical
science, where the student will find indicated, with scrupulous ex
actness, the authorities for every statement, and the sources which
may supply him with whatever further information he might require
on any particular subject. After he had completed this work, he
projected a new translation of Pliny’s “Natural History,” to be ac
companied with notes; in 1828 he printed, for private distribution,
a specimen of the work, consisting of the first and thirty-third
books; and he afterwards devoted a considerable portion of his
time to the prosecution of this undertaking, in which he had made
some progress at the time of his death.          For the last two or
three years his health had been declining, but the immediate cause
of his death was an attack of cholera, which proved fatal on the 6th
of August in the present year.
   Respected and beloved by a wide circle of friends and relatives,
his memory will long be cherished with affection by those who sur
vive, and with gratitude by the votaries of those sciences which his
labours have promoted and enriched.

   John THOMSON, M.D., one of the ablest representatives of the
last generation of medical men, was Professor of General Patholog
in the University of Edinburgh, and died on the 11th of October last,
at his residence in the vicinity of that city, at the advanced age of
eighty-two years.
   He was born in the town of Paisley in Renfrewshire, and in over
coming the impediments of an humble station, of straitened cir
cumstances, and of a defective education, he early exhibited those

His innate love of knowledge soon became apparent by the strenuous
application of his mind, in succession, to various important objects
of scientific interest. While yet a youth, and during the short in
tervals of leisure, stolen from the servile drudgery of a medical ap
prenticeship in his native town, he devoted himself with such energy
and success to the study of Botany, as ever after to retain a lively
interest in that pursuit. Having completed his medical education
in the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in the medical
schools of London, he settled, in the concluding years of the cen
tury, as a general practitioner in Edinburgh. He there delivered
lectures on Chemistry, and published a translation of Fourcroy's
Elements of that science, accompanied with valuable notes.
   Being appointed one of the Surgeons of the Royal Infirmary in
the year 1800, he commenced his labours as a Teacher of Surgery,
and on the institution, at his recommendation, of a Professorship of
Surgery in the Royal College of Surgeons, he was appointed to that
office. It was on his representation that the injurious system which
then prevailed, of changing the surgeons at short intervals, was aban
doned, and the tenure of that office rendered one of reasonable
duration; and that the delivery of Clinical lectures by the surgeons
in office, of all modes of instruction the most valuable, was com
menced. To his counsel the College of Surgeons were indebted for
the foundation of a Museum of Anatomy, both healthy and morbid,
which, enriched as it has since been by many valuable collections,
now ranks second only to that of the Royal College of Surgeons of
England.
   For a period of sixteen years Mr. Thomson delivered the lectures
on Surgery in the Hall of the College to crowded auditories of
students and practitioners. In the year 1806 he was appointed by
the crown Professor of Military Surgery in the University of Edin
burgh, a chair which had been newly created by the government of
that period.
   The publication on which his permanent reputation rests bears
the title of “Lectures on Inflammation.” It appeared in 1813, and
was in effect a revival and masterly exposition of the views and doc
trines of John Hunter, which, partly from a deficiency of perspi
cuity in that great man's style, and partly from the small degree of
attention which they had excited among the profession, had never
before obtained their due influence, nor had their truths been suffi
ciently recognised and established. It is a work which exhibits the
results of acute discrimination, unwearied ardour, persevering re
search, and a clear and careful method of argumentation. It has
been translated into many foreign European languages, and speedily
became the standard authority on that important subject, consti
tuting as it does the basis of all Pathology.
   On the death of Dr. Gregory in 1821, Dr. Thomson resigned his
surgical appointments, and having formerly graduated at King's Col
lege, Aberdeen, now joined the College of Physicians and practised
as consulting physician, commencing at the same time a course of
lectures on the practice of physic. This may be regarded as the

second remarkable period of his professional career. The novel and
distinguishing feature of this course of lectures consisted in its being
founded on pathological anatomy, or the structural changes induced
by disease in the several tissues of the body, as auxiliary to the an
cient system of pure symptomatology., . To accomplish this object
in the most effectual, manner, Dr. Thomson had recourse to the aid
of the draughtsman, and presented to the eye of the student accurate
coloured delineations of morbid appearances, arranged on anatomico
physiological principles, and accompanied by their corresponding
histories. The result of this spirited enterprise, prosecuted both
abroad and at home during a period of several years, and at a very
considerable pecuniary sacrifice, has been a splendid collection of
anatomical drawings, surpassing all others at present existing in
richness and extent.                                                     *
   In 1832, a Chair of General Pathology was added to the Univer
sity of Edinburgh, to which endowment the suggestions and the
evidence of Dr. Thomson before a commission appointed by Lord,
Liverpool's government in 1826, materially contributed. The ap-.
pointment of first professor was conferred upon himself; but the
pressure of advanced years and infirm health unfortunately com
pelled his retirement after he had held it for four years.
    At various times Dr. Thomson visited the British metropolis and
the continent of Europe, chiefly for the purpose of personally exami
ning their pathological collections; and after the battle of Waterloo
he repaired to Brussels, in order to avail himself of the advantages
which were afforded on that occasion of examining the nature and
treatment of gun-shot wounds and field injuries. The result of his
observations he shortly afterwards published in a “Report of the
wounded at Waterloo.”
   To Dr. Thomson's spirit of independence, not less than to his
ardent love of knowledge, the school of Edinburgh is specially in
 debted; for in addition to his active exertions in the foundation of
Professorships, of a museum and of a library, and the establishment
of a dispensary for visiting the poor in their own dwellings, he was
ever watchful of its interests, and as fearless in denouncing usages
which he considered prejudicial as he was prompt in suggesting and
 earnest in promoting beneficial changes and reforms. To the jea
lousies which are ever engendered by merit, and by attempts at re
 form, and to the opposition he encountered from the magisterial
authorities of the city, may be ascribed his failure of success when
a candidate for the vacant chair of Dr. Gregory, although he was
supported by overwhelming testimonials of superior claims from the
most eminent medical men throughout Europe; and the same cause,
together with the liberal bias of his political views and opinions, (for
though he did not obtrude he never sought to conceal them) will
also explain the anomaly, that although no professional opinion
was more highly esteemed than his, yet he never attained to ex
traordinary popularity in practice. Some of the prejudices he had to
 contend against were the fruits of his scrupulous honesty, of the sim
 plicity of his mind and manners, and of his hostility to every species

he should have enjoyed a cordial and continued intimacy with such
men as Stewart. Allen and Mackintosh. "Associated with the pro
jectors of the Edinburgh Review, he was a contributor to some of
the early numbers, of articles connected with medical philosophy.
In other researches of science not strictly professional, Dr. Thomson
evinced an erudition of greater extent and profundity than could
have been attained by any individual not possessing his quickness
of apprehension and unquenchable thirst for knowledge.             -
   The profession at large are perhaps scarcely aware of the extent
of their obligations to Dr. Thomson. Some however yet survive
who can attest the peculiar interest he inspired in his pupils by his
earnestness as a teacher, and the enthusiasm they imbibed from his
precepts and cherished by his example. Unostentatious in his search
after truth, he was neither so frequent or voluminous an avowed
contributor to the common stock, as many men of much inferior
talent; but he was continually engaged in fostering the spirit and
directing the pursuits of others, of whom some have largely contri
buted, in their riper years, to extend the boundaries of medieal and
surgical knowledge.
   The biography of Dr. Cullen, whose character he held in high
veneration, occupied the years of his retirement. The vigour of his
faculties remained unimpaired to the last, and he contemplated with
calm serenity the approaching end of a life devoted to the cultiva
tion and improvement of the profession he had chosen, and of which
he was a distinguished ornament.                 -
   Astronomy has sustained a heavy loss, in the last year, by the
death of BEssEL.       FRIEDRICH WILHELM BEss EL was born at
Minden, on the 22nd of July 1784. His father held a civil office
under the Prussian government, with the title of Justizrath, but
his means were narrow and his family numerous; and at the age
of fifteen the future astronomer began his career as an assistant
or apprentice in a mercantile house in Bremen. Having acquired
a taste for Astronomy and Mathematics, he assiduously devoted his
leisure time to the study of those sciences; and his progress was
such that he soon attracted the notice and obtained the friendship
of Dr. Olbers, then in the zenith of his fame.      His first published
essay, which appeared in Zach's ‘Monatliche Correspondenz' in
1804, was a reduction of the observations made by Harriot and
Torporley of the comet of 1607. In communicating this paper to
Zach, Olbers eulogised, in the warmest terms, the acquirements and
industry of his young friend, and expressed his regret that so much
talent and zeal, and such powers of calculation, should not have
been acquired for the exclusive service of astronomy. An oppor
tunity was soon found of making the desired acquisition; Bessel,
in 1806, becoming successor to Harding in the office of assistant
to Schroeter, in the Observatory of Lilienthal. In this congenial
situation he rapidly acquired for himself a great reputation; and

indeed, almost from the first, took his place as one of the best astro
nomers of Europe. In 1810, he was appointed professor of astro
nomy in Königsberg; a post which he occupied during the re
mainder of his life, and over which his genius and labours have
thrown an imperishable lustre.
   The Observatory of Königsberg, now so celebrated, owes not only
its celebrity, but its existence to Bessel. The building was begun
in 1811 under his direction.     It was finished in 1813; and the first
published observations are dated in November of the same year.
From 1815 the observations have been published regularly; accom
panied by full descriptions of the different instruments successively
employed, the elements of reduction, some valuable catalogues, and
all the information necessary to inspire complete confidence in the
results. This publication has exercised a powerful influence on the
progress of practical astronomy.
   Bessel's scientific life is one of extraordinary fertility, and it is
only a few of the more important of his productions which can even
be alluded to in this brief notice. His principal work, the ‘Funda
menta Astronomiae,' is peculiarly interesting to English astronomers,
from the circumstance of its being founded on observations made at
the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Bradley's observations, as is
well known, were taken possession of by his representatives, and
presented by them to the University of Oxford. From various
 causes, their publication was not completed until 1805, forty-three
years after the death of Bradley; and although some results and
some imperfect catalogues had been deduced from them, the great
 mass of the observations still remained in a state in which they were
 nearly useless. At the instigation of Olbers, Bessel undertook the
 formidable task of reducing the whole series. The reduction was
 comunenced in the autumn of 1807, and, though frequently inter
 rupted by his other avocations and duties, it was never wholly laid
 aside till its completion in 1818, in which year the ‘Fundamenta'
 made its appearance. Of this great work it would be difficult to
 speak in terms of too high praise. Besides elaborate determina
 tions of all the principal elements of the reduction,-the errors
 of the instruments, the height of the pole, refraction, parallax,
 aberration, precession, proper motion,--it contains a catalogue of
 the mean places of 3222 fixed stars, observed between 1750 and
 1762 with the best instruments in existence at that time; and re
 duced to the epoch of 1755 with a precision and accuracy of which
 there was no previous example. It now furnishes astronomers with
 the best existing means of determining all those data which can
 only be deduced from a comparison of observations made at consi
 derably distant intervals of time, and may be considered, in fact, as
 having laid the foundations of the principal improvements which
 have been made in astronomy since the date of its publication.
    The ‘Tabulae Regiomontanae,’ published in 1830, may be re
 garded in some respects as a supplement to the ‘Fundamenta.'
 This collection was undertaken with a view to facilitate the reduc
 tion of planetary observations, past and future, on a uniform system;

and it contains all the tables necessary for that purpose as well as for
ordinary star-reduction, for the century to which it applies, founded
on elements derived from the comparison of Bradley's with Bessel's
own observations, together with the formulae for computation.         It
is in daily use in every observatory, and has led to the general
adoption of a uniform and precise system of astronomical calcula
tion which has been attended with signal advantage to the science.
    The services rendered to astronomy by Bessel were not con
fined to the observatory and the closet. In the course of a series
of experiments, undertaken in 1826, for the determination of the
length of the seconds' pendulum, he detected and demonstrated
the existence of a cause of error in the usual reduction to a va
  uum, which, though it had long before been clearly pointed out by
   u Buat, appears to have been entirely overlooked and forgotten.
This consists in the fact that every oscillating body drags along
with it a certain portion of air, or of the fluid in which it moves,
so that the specific gravity of the actually moving mass is different
from that of the body at rest; and as the quantity of dragged air
depends on the form of the moving body, the specific gravity can
not be determined a priori, but must be found by experiment for
each particular pendulum.      It followed, therefore, that the results
of all the previous pendulum experiments were erroneous to the ex
tent occasioned by the neglect of this circumstance. Bessel's method
of conducting the experiment was extremely ingenious; and it may
be asserted that his determination of this important astronomical
element—the absolute length of the seconds' pendulum—is the only
 one yet given which is deserving of full confidence. The details
and results were published in the Berlin Memoirs in 1828.
    Another very important result of the indefatigable activity of
 Bessel, is the ‘Gradmessung in Ost-Preussen,’ published in 1838.
 A series of geodetical measurements, comprehending the measure
 of an arc of the meridian of the Dorpat Observatory, had been exe
 cuted by Struve and Von Tenner in Russia, and it was of great im
 portance, in reference to the question of the figure of the earth, to
 connect them with those of the west and south of Europe.           The
 operations necessary for this purpose were undertaken by the Prus
 sian government in 1830, and executed under the direction of Bes
 sel, who seized on the opportunity of measuring an arc of the meri
 dian of his Observatory. In consequence of the novel methods em
 ployed both in the geodetical and astronomical parts of this operation
 the details are of extreme interest, more particularly with reference
 to the ingenious apparatus for measuring the base line, the mode of
 observing and connecting the terrestrial angles, and the application
 of a method of computation by which every geometrical relation sub
 sisting among the angles over the whole triangulated surface is ex
 pressed by equations of condition, and the results, with their pro
 bable errors, deduced by the method of least squares. The ‘Grad
 messung’ may be described as having done for geodesy what the
 ‘Fundamenta’ did for astronomy; both works exhibiting the appli
 cation of the best and surest methods of deducing results from ob

servations which science has yet placed within the reach of the
computer.
   Several of his minor papers on the subject of geodesy, published
in the “Astronomische Nachrichten, are of great interest and value.
He recomputed the French triangulation between Montjouy and
Formentera (No. 438), and the sector observations of the English
and Indian arcs measured by Mudge and Lambton (334, 336); and
from the whole of the meridional arcs hitherto measured with ad
missible precision, deduced elements of the terrestrial spheroid which
give probably the nearest approximation which has yet been made
to the true form and magnitude of the earth.
   In connexion with the measurement of the pendulum and arc of
meridian, he also undertook a comparison of the standard measures,
of Prussia; determined their relation to the unit of the French
measures; and directed the execution of a new standard which will
probably become an object of great interest in some future age.
The details of these delicate and difficult comparisons are described
by him in an interesting work published by order of the Prussian
government in 1839.
   The question of the annual parallax of the fixed stars, a vexed
question in astronomy since the days of Bradley, has of late years
acquired an extraordinary interest through the labours of Struve,
Henderson, and Bessel. Having previously made some unsuccess
ful attempts, Bessel at length determined to attack the problem in a
new way, and to subject one individual star to a scrutiny which
would infallibly decide whether any appreciable parallax existed in
that particular case. The star which he selected was 61 Cygni, a binary
system whose two members had been proved to be physically con
nected, and which, by reason of the very considerable distance be
tween the component bodies, and its large proper motion, afforded
strong presumptions of its being one of the nearest to the earth. With
the splendid heliometer of the Königsberg Observatory, an instru
ment peculiarly adapted for such a purpose, he commenced a series.
of micrometrical measurements of the distances of the star from two
others in its vicinity, which were continued from August 1837 to
March 1840, and conducted with all the appliances and precautions
for attaining extreme accuracy which were to be expected from the
importance of the inquiry and the consummate skill of the observer.
The results exhibited a periodic and systematic fluctuation of the
places of the double star, agreeing exactly in its law and period with
the effects of parallax, and referable to no other known cause. The
parallax thus indicated was indeed an extremely minute quantity,
amounting only to 31-100ths of a second; but no one in a condition
to appreciate the evidence on which it rests will doubt the possibility
of detecting such a quantity by such means; and astronomers, accord
ingly, regard the conclusion as one which, if not absolutely certain,
is at least so extremely probable, that it must command assent until
disproved by another equally good, and longer continued, series of
observations.
   The fruits of the extreme precision which Bessel so greatly con

 tributed to introduce into astronomical observations and reductions,
 have already begun to make their appearance. In an interesting
 disquisition published in some recent numbers of the “Astronomische
 Nachrichten’ (514,515, 516), he seems to have established the
 existence of a very remarkable phenomenon which had been indi
 cated, at different times, by Pond, namely, the variability of the
 proper motion of two of the principal stars, Procyon and Sirius.
 It is unnecessary to point to the boundless field of speculation re
specting the constitution of the sidereal heavens which such a dis
 covery lays open,                                   -
    The annals of astronomy afford many illustrious examples of inde
fatigable industry and prolific labour, but few more remarkable than
 Bessel.   From the date of his first publication in 1804, the astrono
mical periodicals of Germany teem with his productions. Zach's
 ‘Monatliche Correspondenz, Lindenau's ‘Zeitschrift,' Bode's “Jahr
 buch, the “Berlin Ephemeris, the “Memoirs of the Berlin Acade
my,' and, more especially, Schumacher's ‘Astronomische Nachrich
ten,' have all been enriched by his communications. The last-named
journal, indeed, contains upwards of 180 bearing his signature, em
bracing almost every subject connected with the science and prac
tice of astronomy, and questions of every order of difficulty. Some
of his papers in the “Berlin Memoirs' are extremely remarkable,
not only by reason of the results arrived at, but as showing the re
sources and originality of the author, and his skill in the highest
departments of analysis and physical astronomy. Among these may
be mentioned, in particular, his researches on the great comet of
1807 (published in 1810), in which he proposed a method, which is
now generally followed, of determining the orbit when it is necessary
to take the perturbations into account; a most important memoir on
the precession of the equinoxes (1815); another on the planetary
perturbations (1824); and three on the right ascensions of Maske
lyne's 36 stars (1818, 1819, 1825). Among his later productions
are two quarto volumes of “Untersuchungen’ (or Astronomical Re
searches), and a third is said to have been nearly prepared for the
press. Many other titles might be cited, but those now mentioned
may suffice to give an idea of the wide extent over which he ranged.
Indeed it may be said of Bessel, that there is no department of astro
nomy which he did not handle, and that nothing passed through his
hands without receiving extension or improvement. But, perhaps,
that which stands out as most remarkable in his writings is his pro
found knowledge of the theory of instruments; and perhaps also the
influence of his example in teaching observers to trust less to the
mechanical perfection of instruments, and to bestow more pains in
determining their errors so as to remove them by numerical correc
tions, have contributed as much to the advancement of astronomi
cal science as his own proper labours and discoveries. His country
men adopted his methods as the models of their practice; the pre
sent state of German astronomy shows with how much advantage.
   Bessel was elected a Foreign Member of this Society in 1825.

painful illness occasioned by an internal disease. The history of
his labours will occupy a large and prominent place in the history
of astronomy during the first half of the present century.
    The BARon DE DAMoiseAU was one of the most distinguished
astronomers of the age. His most considerable work was his “Mé
moire sur la Théorie de la Lune,” which was presented to the In
stitute in 1821, but not published before 1827, when it appeared in
the “Mémoires des Savans Etrangers.” The methods which are used
in this important memoir are, generally speaking, the same as those
adopted by Laplace: the moon's true longitude being assumed as
the independent variable, and the final equations solved by the me
thod of indeterminate coefficients; the solutions being given in nu
merical and not in literal coefficients, as in the great work of Plana
on the same subject. The approximations, also, are carried to a
greater extent than in the “Mécanique Céleste.” This memoir was
followed by the celebrated “Tables of the Moon,” which were founded
upon it, and which appeared in 1824 under the title “Tables de la
Lune, formée sur la seule Théorie de l'Attraction et suivant la divi
sion du cercle en 400 dégrés.” They form the first, and indeed the
only expanded tables of the moon which are founded entirely upon
theory, borrowing nothing whatever from observation but the sim
ple elliptic elements, the proportion of distances of the sun and moon,
and the masses. All preceding tables, such as Mayer's, Borg's and
Burckhardt's, had derived many of their coefficients empirically from
observation. These tables are the basis of those which are used by
the present Astronomer Royal in the great lunar reductions which
are now in progress under his superintendence.
    The Baron de Damoiseau was also the author of “Tables of the
Satellites of Jupiter,” and of many other works and memoirs con
nected with the advancement of astronomical science: he was a very
profound analyst, a most laborious and faithful calculator, and the
author of the most important advancements which the lunar theory
received in the period which intervened between the appearance of
:     great works of Laplace and Plana to which I have before re

    The results of the observations made by Captain Lefroy, of the
 Royal Artillery, Director of the Magnetical and Meteorological Ob
 servatory at St. Helena, are here given; from which it appears, on
 the examination of the barometrical changes during seventeen months,
 that a maximum of pressure corresponds to the moon's passage over
 both the inferior and superior meridians, being slightly greater in
 the latter case, and that a minimum corresponds nearly to the rising
 and setting, or to six hours before and after the former periods. The
 average atmospheric pressures are 28-2714 inches in the first case,
 and 28.2675 in the last; the difference being 0.0089 inch. The
 height of the cistern of the barometer above the sea is 1764 feet;
 and the latitude of the Observatory 15°57' S. These results were
 still further confirmed by those of a series of observations during

   Jan, 8, 1847.-Reduction of the Observations of Halley's Comet,
made at the Cambridge Observatory in the years 1835 and 1836.
By the Astronomer Royal.
   These observations were chiefly made with the 5-foot equatoreal.
They were reduced as far as was practicable at the time, and the
corrections for refraction and parallax applied.   In this state they
were published in the Cambridge Observations for 1835.
   The instrumental errors, though pretty well known, and known
to be small, were not then corrected. It was thought better to put
off this part of the complete reduction until correct places of the
small stars of comparison could be obtained. In 1836 and 1837
most of these stars were observed at Greenwich, and they are suffi
ciently numerous to establish all the results which can be drawn
from the observations of the comet.    Some stars could not be seen,
though carefully looked for.
   In exhibiting the results two methods have been followed. First,
the place of the comet has been determined differentially with respect
to small stars, which have themselves been subsequently determined.
Secondly, the error of the instrument has been computed from the
observations of known stars, admitting of accurate observation, and
the error so deduced has been applied to correct the instrumental
observation of the comet. A comparison of these results will often
show which is to be preferred.
   The final results are compared with the Ephemeris circulated by
 the Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, under the date Dec. 30,
 1835, which is the same, as to places unaffected by perturbation,
 with the Ephemeris in the Appendix to the Nautical Almanac of 1839.
 In this Ephemeris the effects of aberration are fully included, con
 trary to the supposition of the Astronomer Royal in the Cambridge
 Observations, 1835, p. lxiv.
    It has not been thought advisable to deduce the elements of Hal
ley's comet from these observations. That task will be best per
formed by some future Rosenberger, who, with all the observations
from both hemispheres before him, may hope to bring a satisfactory
 result out of the whole mass.

   After mentioning the great superiority in uniformity and sim
plicity of Bessel's method over those previously in existence, the
Astronomer Royal remarks, that the strict attention to sign required
both in the partial additions and in collecting the sum is exceedingly
troublesome, and that more errors in observatory business arise from
oversight as to sign than from any other cause. He has therefore
been led to consider the possibility of avoiding changes of sign, and
suggests the following method as probably an improvement in giving
the data of the corrections in the Ephemeris and Catalogue.
   On examining the maximum values of the quantities A, B, C, D
in the Nautical Almanac, and of a, b, c, d, a', b", c', d' in the British
Association Catalogue, it will be seen that A, B, and D can never
be equal to 25, that c' is always less than 25, and that up to a north
polar distance of 3° 45', c must also be less than 25. All the other
numbers are less than 1 2.
        Let E=A+25            Let e-a+ 1-2          Let e'–a'+ 1.2
            F=B+25               f=b+ 1.2               f=b'+ 1.2
            G=C+ 1-2             g=c-H25                g'=c'+25
            H=D-H25               h=d-H 1-2              h'=d'+ 1-2
   All the introduced symbols are necessarily positive.
   Arranging and multiplying
                       Aa-Ee-1-2E–25e-H30
                       Bö=Ff–1.2F–25f-30
                            &c.         &c.
   And
    -                  Aa'=Ee'–12 E–25e'+30
                            &c.         &c.
   Hence, collecting and arranging, it will be found that the sums of
the corrections in R.A. and in north polar distance will be respect
ively,–
         In R.A. =1200+Ee-FFf--Gg+Hh
                           —(1.2E+1.2F4-25G--1-2H)

                          —(25e'+25 fººt-1.2g+25h')
where the numbers are seconds of time in the first group, and se
conds of space in the latter.

    It will be seen that the second line in each group is identical,
and depends solely on E, F, &c.; that is on A, B, C, and D. This
therefore could be tabulated in the Ephemeris for the day, under one
symbol K. The third lines depend on a, b, &c. and a', b', &c.; and
therefore admit of tabulation in the Catalogue as k and k' respectively
for each star.    The corrections could now be in this form :—
           In R.A. =120°-0+E e-HEf +G g-H H h-(K+k)
           In N.P.D.—120"-0+Ee'+Ffl-HGg'+HA'—(K+k).
The greatest possible value of K is about 182, and the greatest
values of k and k' are about 170.    Let
                   L=190—K, l–170—k, 1–170—k';
then substituting these values in the last equations, the corrections
are,
            In R.A. =E e-HP f--Gg-H H h--L-- l—240’00
            In N.P.D.—Ee'+Ff-FGg'+ Hh'+L+/–240":0
in which every symbol is necessarily positive.
   The Astronomer Royal finds that logarithms with five decimal
places would be wanted for the corrections in R.A., and that four
would be sufficient in N.P.D. .
   An additional column would thus be required for the Ephemeris
and two columns for the Star Catalogue, but there would be no sign
employed either in the tabulation or computation. The trouble of
deducing E, F, &c., e,f, &c., L, l, &c. is trifling, and might be made
still easier by subsidiary tables. The change proposed is not recom
mended for uncatalogued stars observed only once. Stars which
are nearer the pole than 3° 45' require special treatment.

orbit of Castor has only been roughly deduced, as the observations
are not yet sufficient to define the elements with precision. It was
undertaken by Captain Jacob for the purpose of ascertaining what
alteration was required in Mr. Hind's elements to make them repre
sent his own observations, and those of Captain Smyth in 1838 and
1843.
    In computing the orbits of the other stars, the method of least
squares has been employed to correct the elements which were ob
tained in Sir J. Herschel's manner.

third or fourth. There are six magnitudes. The principal stars are

 and sometimes do not, agree with those found in some European
 maps.
    The map is executed coarsely by block-printing. The positions
 and magnitudes are incorrect. There is no appearance of European
 origin. The selection of stars of the fifth and sixth magnitude
 could not well have been copied, and some stars are inserted which
 are not to be found in any common catalogue or map. The epoch
 seems to be about A.D. 1735.
    A Historical Survey of Comets. By Dr. Michelsen.
    The author commences with a general review of the early history
 of cometary astronomy, and notices the uncertainty attaching to
 ancient European accounts of comets: the information given us by
 the Chinese annalists, Ma-tuon-lin, as sketched by Mailla, Gaubil and
De Guignes, presenting a more definite aspect. He remarks that
the comet which appeared in the time of Anaxagoras may be con
sidered the first established historically, though as yet unconfirmed
by any astronomical calculation.
   The author then proceeds to give a detailed description of the most
celebrated comets, commencing with Halley's, which he endeavours
to trace back as far as the year 426 b.c. The various confirmed
appearances of the comet since 1456 are then described, and also
circumstances relating to comets in previous centuries, which might
possibly be identical with Halley's.
   The comet of Encke is traced from its discovery by Mechain, in
 1786, to the present time.    The detection of a resisting medium in
space from the motion of this comet, and the determination (from its
perturbations) of the mass of Mercury, are also noticed.
   Biela's comet is described at its different appearances since the
year 1772. The author notices the supposed identity of the comets
of 1264 and 1556, and of those of 1532 and 1661. The great comet
of 1843 is described, and, assuming the period of revolution to be
about 175 years, some ancient comets are mentioned which might
possibly be the same.
   Those comets which, though only observed at one appearance,
yet remained visible long enough to allow their periodicity to be
determined, are placed in a separate class. The comet of Olbers in
1815 is computed by Bessel to have a period of 74 years, and the
next return is fixed for February 9, 1887. The comets of 1740 and
1666 do not show the least resemblance to this. The great comet
of 1811 was found by Argelander to have a period of 3066 years.
The second comet of 1811 was computed by Nicolai ; it was much
fainter than the first: the period assigned is about 763 years. Encke
made the time of revolution of the comet of 1812 about 71 years.
The comet of 1807 was computed by Bessel, who fixed the period at
about 1714 years.
   The author describes the celebrated comet of 1680, that of Lexell
in 1770, the comets of 1769, 1780, 1783, 1793, &c., and concludes
that there are three comets whose return is certain; five probably
periodical, from the similarity of their elements with those of pre

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 211
ceding comets; and nineteen for which elliptical orbits have been
calculated with some degree of probability, making the total number
of periodical comets twenty-seven.
   In the latter part of the paper a general account of remarkable
comets is given, commencing with that mentioned by Ovid, and con
tinued down to 1843.       The author has collected together the best
determinations of the orbits of periodical comets, and many parti
culars relating to the physical appearance of these bodies.

 in the possession of the Royal Society. I regret to say it is in a
 most dilapidated condition, and its eye-glass is lost. The next of
 any importance was made by Hadley in 1728; its large speculum's
 diameter was about six inches; its focal length about sixty-three
 inches; it magnified 230 times; in performance it equalled the great
 Huygenian refracting telescope of six inches diameter and 123 feet

   FORMATION OF SULPHOWINIC ACID.                BY M. M. E. MILLON,
    The author states, that some years since wishing to prepare sul
 phovinic acid with peculiar care, he made a mixture of sulphuric acid
 and alcohol in a platina crucible surrounded with ice and common
 salt: the acid mixture being afterwards saturated, did not yield the
 slightest trace of sulphovinate.
    Wishing afterwards to ascertain precisely the conditions under

 212          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
which the    º of sulphowinic acid occurs, the author discovered
 that it depended on several circumstances, the principal of which are,
—1st, the relatiye proportions of acid and alcohol; 2nd, the heat
 applied to the mixture; 3rd, the heating of the two liquids at the
 moment of mixing them ; 4th, the time during which the acid and
alcohol remain in contact. To ascertain these points, the author at
 first employed monohydrated sulphuric acid SO3, HO, and absolute
 alcohol C+ H6 O°, or else hydrated C4H8O2, HO ; there is no differ
 ence in the progress of the reaction, whether absolute or hydrated
 alcohol be employed.
    To determine the quantity of sulphovinic acid formed, the same
 quantity of sulphuric acid as that used with the alcohol was mixed
 with water; and this last was used in such proportion as to make
 the diluted acid equal in volume to the mixture of acid and alcohol.
 Equal portions of these were then saturated with an alkaline solution
 of known strength, and by the difference the proportion of combined
 sulphuric acid was determined; it being ascertained that sulphuric,
 on becoming sulphovinic acid, saturates one-half less base.
    When equivalents of sulphuric acid and anhydrous alcohol are
 employed, the following results are obtained: if the alcohol be ren
 dered extremely cold, and the sulphuric acid be gradually added, so
 as to avoid raising the temperature, no combination whatever takes
place. The sulphuric acid retains all its saturating power; and if it
be kept constantly cooled by melting ice, the strength of the acid
remains the same for several successive days.       A temperature of 50°
to 60°F. is sufficient to cause the conversion of 77 parts out of 100
of sulphuric acid into sulphovinic; thus about three-quarters of what
the sulphuric acid is capable of yielding are produced; this propor
tion cannot be exceeded.       It remains the same for several months,
and it is useless to raise the temperature of the mixture.          When
equivalents of sulphuric acid and alcohol are used, 77 out of 100 of
the acid is the largest proportion that can be formed into sulphovinic
acid. This formation requires several days at 50° to 60°F.; but it
occurs in a few hours at 86° to 95° F.; and it takes place in a few
minutes if the mixture be immersed in boiling water; and it is a
remarkable circumstance that the combination is instantaneous, if
the alcohol be suddenly poured into the sulphuric acid so as to pro
duce great heat.
    It appears, therefore, that there are in reality, in this formation of
sulphovinic acid, three sources of chemical action which are equiva
lents; they are time, the temperature applied, and the natural heating
of the mixture. The action of light was repeatedly attempted to be
substituted; but the direct application of the most intense solar rays
never accelerated the formation of sulphovinic acid.
    The mixture of two equivalents of alcohol with one equivalent of
sulphuric acid acts exactly in the same manner as the preceding
mixture; only it is more easy to avoid in it the formation of sulpho
vinic acid; the influence of time and heat is similarly exerted. The
sulphuric acid produces a little less sulphovinic acid, from 73 to 74
in 100 parts; the non-action of light is similar.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            213
    If however two equivalents of sulphuric acid and one equivalent
of alcohol be employed, circumstances are altered; sulphovinic acid
is always formed; and still more, the proportion of sulphovinic acid
is always the same, whether the acid be poured into the alcohol or
the reverse; whether metallic vessels be used or not; and whether
they are or are not cooled.    The whole of the acid and alcohol do
not however combine; the reaction does not take place on much
more than half of the mixture, for not more than 54 of sulphovinic
acid can be formed from 100 of sulphuric. This proportion does not
change by prolonging the contact, or even by the application of a
heat of 212°F. continued for several hours; the capacity of satura
tion of the acid mixture remains the same. In heating to 212°, the
volume is scarcely diminished; it follows, therefore, that the alcohol
which is not changed into sulphovinic acid must be retained by a
peculiar affinity.—Ann, de Ch. et de Phys., Fevrier 1847.
on A METHOD of PRODUCING LIGHTS AND SHADES IN EQUAL
    PERFECTION IN DAGUERREOTYPE PICTURES.                BY MM. BEL
     FIELD LEFEWRE AND LEON FOUCAULT.
    It was observed soon after M. Daguerre had made known his
wonderful discovery, that the iodized plate was not suited for pro
 ducing a perfect image of every object, but that if there was a great
variety of light and shade, i.e. very light and very dark parts, they
 would not be simultaneously brought out with correctness : one of
 these two alternatives must be chosen; either to stop the process
 when the light parts of the picture are brought out (in which case
 the dark parts will not be clearly distinguishable), or to allow the
 light to act for a longer time, in order to render the dark parts di
 stinct; but in this case the light parts will be rendered indistinct,
 or, as it is called, burnt.
    These evils have fortunately been remedied by the employment of
 certain substances, which not only allow of the operation being
 performed with greater rapidity, but also produce sensitive surfaces
 capable of receiving a much greater variety of tints. These are,
 however, far from being perfect; and therefore if any process could
 be discovered which would bring out the light and dark parts of the
 picture with equal distinctness, without increasing the sensitiveness
 of the plates, it would be advisable to have recourse to it in certain
 cases. If the operator knows how to work well upon these different
 sensitive surfaces, without confining himself exclusively to the most
 sensitive, he will be able to produce any effect desired; for instance,
 if requisite, he will moderate the intensity of the rays of the sun
 bearing upon objects of inadequate reflective powers, or heighten
 the tone of a picture.
     With a view to facilitate the attainment of good results, Mr. Bel
 field and myself determined on making known a new mode of pre
 paring the sensitive surfaces, the effect of which is to impart to the
 plates the property above-mentioned, and which assimilates them to
 the human retina.

214           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    Our method requires the employment of iodine and bromine, and
is easily performed by persons who are accustomed to employ those
 substances separately. It consists in polishing and iodizing the
plate in the ordinary manner, and afterwards causing it, by any
convenient means, to absorb three times as much vapour of bromine
as is usually thought sufficient to render the plates as sensitive as
possible. Whilst the ordinary quantity of bromine does not visibly
alter the tint of the iodized layer, that which we recommend causes
it to assume a deep bluish violet tint.
   The sensibility of the plates thus surcharged with bromine is re
duced to a third of what it would be if the ordinary quantity only
were used ; but at the same time they are rendered capable of pro
ducing a perfect picture of subjects presenting the greatest variety
of shade. This will be seen by inspecting a small picture, presented
herewith, which was produced when the sun was shining. There
will be perceived the clouds in the sky, white houses, with the sha
dows well-defined, and trees, the foliage of which is delineated much
in the same manner as if executed by an artist.
   We recommend the ordinary quantity of bromine to be exactly
tripled; as if less than this quantity be used, the picture will not be
properly brought out; and if more than this quantity were used, the
mercury would not be properly condensed and the image would not
be so well-defined.
   This new property, communicated to the iodized plates by an
excess of bromine, may be very usefully applied; and besides, as
it appeared to us that this statement might be useful to the chemical
world, we have been induced to make this communication to the
Academy.—Comptes Rendus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences,

OBSERVATIONS ON THE EXPERIMENTS OF MESSRS. FOUCAULT
   AND FIZEAU, RELATIVE TO THE ACTION OF THE RED RAYS
   UPON DAGUERREOTYPE PLATEs. By M. EDMond BEcQUEREL,
   Messrs. Foucault and Fizeau, at the sitting of the Academy on the
5th inst. (October 1846), presented some observations concerning
the action of the red rays upon Daguerreotype plates, from which it
would appear that the least refrangible part of the solar spectrum
acts upon the iodide of silver in an inverse manner to the most
refrangible portion. As it appears that these gentlemen are not
acquainted with the experiments which have been made during the
last few years on this subject, and as the results stated by them do
not appear to me to lead to the conclusions which they deduce, I
take the liberty of submitting some remarks thereon to the Academy.
   Dr. Draper (Philosophical Magazine, Nov. 1842), on examining
the image produced by the action of the spectrum upon iodized plates
of silver, made known, before these gentlemen, the existence of pro
tecting rays modifying the influence of the solar rays, and even acting
negatively upon the iodide of silver. Sir J. F. W. Herschel examined
the pictures on that occasion, and in a very interesting experiment

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              215
(Philosophical Magazine, Feb. 1843) on the different appearances
which the iodized plates assume when exposed for the same space
of time to varying intensity in the light, and submitted to the vapour
of mercury, attributed these effects to the unequal thickness of the
substances deposited upon the plates of silver serving as reflecting
surfaces.      He showed, moreover, that on operating upon paper
covered with iodide of silver, nothing was observed which indicated
the action of negative rays, but that all the active parts of the solar
spectrum acted chemically in the same manner on the iodide.
    The experiments which I have made on the chemical action of
the solar rays, from 1841 to 1844, have all led me to the same con
clusion.     Attention ought not therefore to be directed to the deposits
formed on the surface of Daguerreotype plates, as if these were the
only data to lead to the conclusion that the rays acted in various
ways; for if so, there would be risk of defective results.
    In support of the foregoing I will cite the following experiment,
 of the accuracy of which any person will be able to judge. “Let a
 Daguerreotype plate be prepared with iodine only (in order to avoid
 the admixture of active substances), and let the blue, indigo, and
 violet parts of a purified blue spectrum, presenting Fraunhofer's
 black lines, be thrown upon it. If the action only lasts a short time,
 after submitting it to the mercury vapour, the black lines will be
 seen to fix themselves upon a white ground, which represents those
 parts affected by the active parts of the spectrum *.” But if the plate
 be exposed to the spectrum for an hour or more, then the appearance
 of the plate changes, on passing it through the mercury vapour; the
 lines of the spectrum are scarcely marked, and the action has been
 nearly uniform throughout its surface, but the lines which are visible
 appear white, and show very distinctly upon the ground, which ap
 proaches to blackness: the effect is quite contrary to what it was
 before.    That portion of the plate which is acted upon by the violet
 part of the spectrum has, under these circumstances, the same ap
 pearance as the portion of the plate exposed to the red rays by Messrs.
 Foucault and Fizeau ; and to produce this effect, it was only neces
  sary to vary the time of exposure of the plate to the same por
 tion of the spectrum,     Must it be inferred, in the second case, that
 the iodide of silver had been acted upon by negative rays * Certainly
 not; for if the experiment be repeated upon iodide of silver laid upon
 paper, the paper will become darker and darker, in proportion to the
  time it continues exposed to the spectrum ; and, besides, I have
  found (Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 3rd series, vol. ix. p. 268
  et seq.) that the electrical effects arising from the chemical decom
  position of the iodide always act in the same direction.
     It will be seen that the conclusion to which Messrs. Foucault and
  Fizeau came, viz. that there exist in the red prismatic rays negative
  rays, cannot be received, simply from the fact that the Daguerreo
  type plates are not always the same in appearance. The contrary
  effects, as will be seen hereafter, are secondary effects produced by
     * E. Becquerel on the Constitution of the Solar Spectrum.—Bibliothèque
  Universelle de Genève, August 1842.

216            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
several chemical reactions taking place simultaneously, and are not
due to contrary action, exercised on the part of the solar rays, on
the iodide of silver alone.”         : -- - - - -   -
* Another fact which I will calf attention to is, that the least refran
gible part of the spectrum, instead of possessing a negative action
upon the iodide of silver, exercises a continuous influence upon most
of the salts of silver alone, such as the iodide, the bromide, and the
chloride; and also that the experiments upon which this proposition
is founded have been verified by the commissioners of the Academy,
charged with the examination of one of my memoirs.
* In the foregoing, the only point discussed was the influence of
light upon iodide of silver, or the simple salts of that metal. When
plates of silver are exposed successively to the vapours of iodine,
bromine or chlorine, the mixtures obtained may give rise to various
 kinds of chemical reaction, of which the result only is appreciable.
 For this reason these mixtures must not be employed without great
caution, and the Daguerreotype plates must be used as little as pos
sible in experimenting as to the nature of the active rays.
    In order to show how far the mixture of sensitive materials is
capable of influencing the effects of the spectrum, I will direct atten
tion to the following observation of Sir J. Herschel :—
    If paper be prepared, first with a strong solution of lead and after
wards with bromate of potash and nitrate of silver, a surface will be
produced which will speedily become black on exposure to the light;
on being presented to the spectrum, the black tint will be produced
in the most refrangible rays, as far as green. But if the paper has
been blackened by previous exposure to the light, on being covered
with a dilute solution of iodide of potassium and exposed to the blue
part of the spectrum, the paper will become white. This result
proves that the iodide of potassium is decomposed, and that the silver
which stained the paper being iodized, and coming in contact with
an alkaline iodide, ceases to be affected by the light; the paper will
therefore remain of a yellowish-white in that portion of the spectrum
on which the reaction takes place.
    If the layer of iodide of potassium employed is produced from a
dilute solution of that salt, the paper not only becomes white in the
violet part of the spectrum, but also becomes darker in the red rays,
and even beyond, a neutral line being in the middle. It would ap
pear therefore, from an examination of the image thus obtained, that
two contrary results were produced; viz. the destruction of the co
lour in the violet part and its augmentation in the red. These
effects may be easily explained as two distinct chemical reactions:
first, the action of the light upon the iodide of silver, the colouring of
which had commenced; second, the action of the light to effect the
decomposition of the iodide of potassium, and the iodizing of the
silver arising from the sub-iodide formed by the first reaction. As
the red part of the spectrum contains those rays which continue the
chemical action commenced upon the salts of silver, and as the
first reaction is only commenced, the latter has most influence in
that part of the spectrum. The second reaction is, on the contrary,

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             217
 at its height in the violet. Thus these appearances of inverse action
 in the colouring do not arise from two distinct effects, positive and
 negative, produced by the rays upon the same sensitive surface, but
 are owing to two distinct chemical reactions, which predominate
 respectively in the red and violet parts.
    If the blackened paper be covered with a fresh layer of iodide of
 potassium, it will begin to turn white at the least refrangible part,
 and the neutral line will again approach the red; if a sufficient
 quantity of iodide be used, the paper will turn white from the violet
 to the red; but if a very strong solution of iodide were employed,
 the paper would whiten, even in the dark; so violent is the action
 of the iodide of potassium upon metallic silver.
    These results clearly prove that several chemical actions may take
 place simultaneously in the mixtures of sensitive substances, the re
 sults only of which are observable. Analogous effects must neces
 sarily be produced on employing iodized plates of silver, and after
 wards exposing them to the vapour of bromine or to chlorine; and
 perhaps even when using plates iodized according to M. Daguerre's
 plan. In fact, under these circumstances, the iodide, chloride, or
 bromide of silver, are in direct contact with the metallic silver; and
 as, by the decomposition of these salts, through the action of the
 light, subsalts are formed, the result is that iodine, chlorine and bro
 mine are exposed directly to the above-named salts, and even to the
 metallic silver itself, at the moment when the solar action makes its
 influence felt. These reactions, which are sufficiently complex, be
come more so by the iodides, chlorides, and bromides of silver being
 submitted to the action of rays which always act with the same
 energy in the violet part of the spectrum; whilst in the red portion
 the rays react with greater energy, owing to certain chemical actions
 naving commenced.
    It is therefore essential to distinguish between the chemical re
actions effected under the influence of light upon sensitive substances
alone, and upon combinations of them.        This has not been done by
 Messrs. Foucault and Fizeau : they have considered a Daguerreotype
plate as offering a separate sensitive surface, whilst it is only by a
mixture of substances that different effects can be produced in the
various parts of the spectrum, as is proved by Herschel's experi
ment, and without the existence of rays acting in an inverse direc
tion. Thus it has been proved by experiment, that the solar rays,
although of various degrees of refrangibility, only act in one way
upon iodide of silver; whilst a mixture of this substance with other
matters may occasion several chemical reactions acting conjointly
and hiding the principal effect.
   If the light acts only in one way upon iodide of silver (the con
tinuous rays included), the case may be different on other sensitive
substances, and the rays may act sometimes positively and sometimes
negatively. It is known, in fact, that each sensitive substance is
differently affected by the solar rays; this might be explained by
stating that each sensitive substance receives the rays in a manner
peculiar to itself. I will cite as an example an observation of Wol
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 30. No. 200. March 1847.                Q

laston's, with regard to the sensitive substance guaiacum, which be
 comes blue beyond the violet part of the spectrum, and again becomes
 colourless in the red and yellow rays.
    I have confined myself to the foregoing observations, on the sub
ject of Messrs. Foucault and Fizeau's note, to show that the com
 plicated phaenomena produced by the appearance of the Daguerreo
 type plates (although very important for the photographic images
 produced in the camera-obscura, and for the observation of active
 rays of very little intensity) cannot lead to definite and unvarying
 results, as regards the nature of the chemical action produced. It is
 therefore necessary to operate, as has been heretofore done, by means
 of simple products, with sensitive paper, regard being had to the
 electrical effect due to the chemical reaction produced under the in
 fluence of the solar rays.-Ibid.
          RESEARCHES ON MELLON AND IT'S COMPOUNDS.
            BY MM. A.U.G. LAURENT AND CH. GER HARDT.
    The authors observe that in their last memoir on this subject they
 had not repeated the experiments of M. Liebig ; that they had
 merely modified a part of his theory, the authority of his name ap
 pearing to be a sufficient guarantee for the accuracy of his results.
    According to M. Liebig, this substance is composed of—
         Six atoms of carbon           . . . ..    =458:61     39-36
         Eight atoms of azote . . . . . .          =708 16      60-64
         One atom of mellon. . . . . . . . = 1 166-77         100-00
    According to him, it is a radicle composed of carbon and azote,
capable of uniting with hydrogen, oxygen and metals, so as to form
compounds analogous to those into the composition of which cyano
gen enters.
    The authors state, and they do it with regret, that the reliance
which they placed on the results of M. Liebig has totally misled
them; and that it is not a part only of his labours on this subject
which is erroneous, but that this is the case with the entire history
of mellon, with all its transformations and all its reactions.        The
authors assert that they are also in a condition to prove that the sup
posed analogy with cyanogen does not exist; for instead of con
sisting only of carbon and azote, mellon contains besides one and a
half per cent of hydrogen. Various processes have been employed
for obtaining mellon. That analysed by MM. Laurent and Ger
hardt was obtained very pure by calcining chlorinated cyanamide
(cyanamide chlorée) as long as hydrochloric acid and hydrochlorate
of ammonia were disengaged.
    The following are the results of four experiments performed to
ascertain the composition of mellon:—

   These numbers are confirmed by the results obtained by M. Voelc
kel in analysing glaucene, which, according to MM. Laurent and
Gerhardt, is merely mellon derived from the dry distillation of po
liene (A.), and of persulphohydrocyanic acid (B.). The results of M.
Voelckel are as follows:–
                                               A.              B.

   From numerous experiments, MM. Laurent and Gerhardt have
arrived at the following conclusions:—
   1. Mellon is not, as supposed by M. Liebig, a binary compound,
comparable with cyanogen; for besides carbon and azote, which are
not in the proportions stated by M. Liebig, it contains one and a
half per cent. of hydrogen, and is represented by C6H3Nº.
   2. The formation of mellon by chlorinated cyanamide does not
occur, as stated by M. Liebig, accompanied simply with hydrochlorate
of ammonia, but there is also disengaged an enormous quantity of
hydrochloric acid, amounting to about 16 per cent.
   3. Chlorinated cyanamide contains double the quantity of chlorine
stated by M. Liebig, and ought to be represented by C*H* Cl Nº.
   4. By the influence of potash, chlorinated cyanamide is converted
into ammeline C3H8 No O, or ammelide C3H4N4O2.
   5. The new substance, the formation of which has been recently
announced by M. Liebig from urea, is a body previously known by
the name of ammelide.
   6. Ammelide does not possess the composition attributed to it by
M. Liebig ; it contains C*H*N* O2, as had been previously stated
by one of the authors.
   7. The melam of M. Liebig is an impure mixture of poliene CºHº
Nº and mellon.
   8. The dry distillation of persulphohydrocyanic acid, as stated by
M. Liebig, does not occur; but the assertions of M. Voelckel respect
ing this phaenomenon are correct.
   9. The sulphuret of cyanogen does not possess the composition
adopted by M. Liebig : it contains hydrogen, and is represented by
C* HN3 S3; it cannot therefore be the radical of the sulphocya
Ilurets.
   10. Heat does not decompose mellon, as stated by M. Liebig,
into three volumes of cyanogen and one volume of azote ; but the
products vary according to the temperature, and always contain hy
drogenated compounds, to the complete destruction of the mellon.

 *11. Potash does not dissolve mellon and yield the mellonide of
M. Gmelin, as stated by M. Liebig; but it produces a tribasic salt
C" (HMA) Nº Oº, containing hydrogen and oxygen, at the same time
that ammonia is developed. Other products are also formed at the
same time.
  - 12. Mellon does not simply and purely combine with potassium ;
but the combination occurs with the evolution of ammonia, and the
product is a bibasic salt CG Nº M2, a salt which on dissolving in water
probably gives C*NS M2 H2O, and appears to be identical with the
mellonides of M. Gmelin.
    13. Mellon does not integrally dissolve in sulphuric acid, for the li
quid contains sulphate of ammonia.—Ann, de Ch. et de Phys., Janvier
 1847.
    ON THE PREPARATION, PROPERTIES AND COMPOSITION OF
                         ACETAL. BY M. STAS.
    The author states that by following precisely the directions of M.
 Liebig for preparing acetal, he obtained a product which, when re
 distilled, did not possess any fixed boiling-point. The liquid pro
 cured at 203°F. recommenced boiling at about 190°, and the tempe
 rature gradually increasing, finished at 226° or even 230°.
    The product distilled at 190° was reduced to about half by a con
 centrated solution of potash; this action takes place in a few hours
without the contact of air. The portion collected at about 220°, and
below it, does not undergo any appreciable alteration by the alkaline
 solution without the contact of the air.
    The potash solution, obtained by treating the first product, remains
 colourless; when saturated with carbonic acid and evaporated in
vacuo, a residue is left, which yields to anhydrous alcohol a white
salt, which is very soluble in water, and precipitates nitrate of silver
 in pearly white laminae; it is merely acetate of potash without any
 trace of formiate.
     These facts prove, according to M. Stas, that the acetal described
 by M. Liebig is a mixture of at least two substances, one of which
 is acetic aether, and the other is acetal, properly so called, and com
 parable to the methylal of M. Malaguti, as will hereafter be shown.
    M. Stas observes that some chemists still doubting of the exist
 ence of acetal, he states the method of procuring it in a certain and
 rapid manner, and constant in composition, before he describes its
properties; the process is as follows:—
    Fragments of pumice-stone are to be washed with hydrochloric
acid and then heated to redness; afterwards the pumice is to be
moistened with alcohol which is nearly anhydrous, and to be intro
 duced into a balloon capable of containing 80 to 100 pints. This
balloon should have a short neck, but large enough to allow of
 introducing the arm. As many capsules as the balloon will contain
 are to be placed on the pumice; these capsules are to be as flat as
possible, and covered with a thin stratum of platina black. The
 neck is to be perfectly covered with a glass plate, and the balloon is

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 221.
then to be exposed to a temperature of about 68°, till nearly all the
alcohol is converted into acetic acid.                              ºr ) . . .
   Fresh air is to be occasionally admitted into the balloon, and care
taken that the liquid is always below the pumice, and that the latter
is never covered by the former. In about a fortnight or three weeks
the liquid becomes more or less viscid, its consistence resembling
that of sulphuric acid on being poured. At this period the liquidis
to be removed, and replaced by an equal quantity of alcohol of 60
per cent. When several pints of very acid liquid have been thus
obtained, it is to be neutralized by carbonate of potash, and as much
chloride of calcium dissolved in it as it is capable of taking up.
Dried acetate of potash may be substituted for chloride of calcium;
in this case it is unnecessary to saturate the liquid by the carbonate
of the same base.
    In whatever mode the liquor is saturated, it is to be submitted to
cautious distillation; only one-fourth of it is to be distilled, and in a
well-cooled receiver; this is to be saturated with fused chloride of
calcium, which immediately separates a considerable portion of a
very volatile fluid of an extremely suffocating odour; this is to be
separated by a pipette, and water is to be cautiously added to the
saline solution as long as it continues to separate fresh quantities of
aethereal fluid, which is to be added to that previously obtained. By
careful distillation of the solution of chloride of calcium, a still
 further small portion of the organic matter may be extracted: as
already remarked by M. Liebig, the substance thus separated is a
 mixture of aldehyd, acetic aether, alcohol and acetal.
    In order to isolate the acetal, powdered chloride of calcium is to
 be added to the mixed fluids, as long as it continues to dissolve;
 when this is completed, the liquid is to be distilled from a water
 bath, but always below its boiling-point, until the product ceases
 to reduce ammoniacal acetate of silver.       The residual matter, de
 prived of aldehyd, but still containing some acetic aether and al
 cohol mixed with the acetal, is added to a great excess of very con
 centrated solution of potash, which completely destroys the acetic
 aether: in operating upon about 750 grains of the fluid, and very
 frequently agitating the mixture, it requires three or four days’ action
 to decompose the last portion of the aether. It now remains only to
 wash the acetal with once or twice its volume of water, to digest it
 with recently-fused chloride of calcium, and to distil it, in order to
 have it perfectly pure.                                                  , ºr
    The properties of acetal are, that it is a colourless aethereal and
 fluid liquid, but less so than aether, to which it has been compared.
 It has a peculiar sweet smell; its taste is cooling with a distinct nutty
 after-taste. Its density is 0.821, at about 72°F. It boils between
 219° and 223°F. Water at 77° dissolves about Tºth of its volume,
 and less as its temperature is increased.    Chloride of calcium and all
 very soluble salts in general separate the acetal from solution in
 water; aether and alcohol dissolve acetal in all proportions; chloride
 of calcium does not separate it from alcohol unless water be added;
 aldehyd, as observed by M. Liebig, exhibits the same phaenomenon.

222           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    Under the influence of platina-black or of the air, acetal is very
rapidly converted, first into aldehyd and then into concentrated acetic
acid; the action is extremely rapid when the platina is moistened;
oxidizing bodies in general produce the same effect; thus diluted
nitric acid furnishes aldehyd at first and afterwards acetic acid;
chromic acid gives acetic acid only. A solution of ammoniacal ace
tate of silver has no action upon it at any temperature; out of the
contact of air neither saturated solutions of potash, soda, the solid
alkalies, nor potashed lime, have any action upon it, either at a low
or high temperature; sulphuric acid at first dissolves it, then decom
poses and blackens it; chlorine acts upon it, removes its hydrogen
and forms chlorinated compounds, which the author has not had time
yet to examine.      By analysis it yielded—

    M. Stas observes, that on comparing the results of his analyses
with the composition of alcohol, the latter, under the influence of the
oxygen of the air and platina-black, has lost one-third of its oxygen,
and two-ninths of its hydrogen; these quantities being equivalent to
one of oxygen and two of hydrogen, as is readily ascertained. Ace
tal may be represented by a combination of two molecules of aether
with one molecule of aldehyd, according to M. Stas, C12H4 O*=
 2(C4 Hº O), C4H4O2; while according to Liebig its formula is
C4H8O, Ae O+ H2O=C8H18O3, or one equiv. of aldehyd and one
equiv. of aether.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Feb. 1847.
 PRESENCE OF SULPHUR IN METALLIC SUBSTANCES STRUCK BY
                                     LIGHTNING.
    On Sunday, the 14th of June 1846, the parish church of Saint
 Thibaud-de-Couz, three leagues from Chamberry, was struck by
 lightning; the church was filled with a dense smoke, accompanied
 by a strong smell resembling that of gunpowder. The gilt frame of
 a large picture was almost entirely blackened, and six gilt chande
 liers were all rendered as black as copper would be after long exposure
 to sulphuretted hydrogen.
     M. Bonjean procured some powder by scraping the surface of the
 chandeliers which had been most strongly coloured; by treating it
 with aqua regia he obtained a solution in which solution of nitrate
 of barytes gave a white precipitate insoluble in nitric acid.—Journ.

    M. C. Rammelsberg states that when a solution of chrome-alum
is mixed with one of neutral chromate of potash, the first portions
produce a red brown colour; afterwards a brown precipitate is
formed, on the surface of which a very yellow liquid floats.
    This precipitate dissolves in hydrochloric acid with a yellowish
green colour; ammonia precipitates oxide of chromium, leaving
chromic acid in solution. When digested with potash, it readily
yields chromate of potash and oxide of chromium.

XXXVIII. On the Effects of Magnetism, &c. upon the Dimen
   sions of Iron and Steel Bars. By J. P. Joule, Esq., Se
   cretary of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Man
   chester.
                      [Continued from page 87.]
       ITH a view to ascertain whether the lengthening effects
         observed in the experiments detailed in the former
part of this paper were entirely independent of the diameter
of the bars, I made a very extensive series of experiments, in
which fine wires both of iron and steel, bundles of very fine
iron wires, chains composed of copper and iron links, &c.
were employed. In order to keep these flexible articles exactly
in the axis of the coil, a weight was placed upon one of the
levers, so as to exert upon them a force of tension equal to
about eight ounces.
   The results of the experiments in which wire of ºth of an
inch thickness was employed, accorded very well with the
previous experiments with thicker bars; but on employing
iron wire which was only ragth of an inch thick, the phaeno
mena assumed quite a different character; for on transmitting
the current through the coil, the length of the wire became
suddenly diminished instead of being increased. This phae
nomenon appeared to me exceedingly anomalous, and it was
some time before I found out its cause. At last, thinking
that the wire was attracted by the coil, I varied its position
from the centre to either side, and increased the amount of
its tension. The former of these operations produced no
sensible effect; but the increase of tension caused the shorten
ing effect of the current to be considerably augmented. It
became manifest, therefore, that the weight of eight ounces,
acting upon very fine wire, produced the anomalies in question.
This was further demonstrated to be the case by diminishing

the tension as far as possible, I then found that the phaeno
mena of elongation took place as in the case of the iron bars,
only to a smaller extent, which was obviously owing to the
degree of tension necessarily left in order to keep the wire in
the axis of the coil.
   The new field of inquiry thus opened appeared to me to be
one of great importance, and calculated eventually to become
the means of throwing a great deal of light upon some of the
most interesting questions connected with molecular actions
and the real character of magnetism. I therefore constructed
an apparatus whereby the effects of tension and pressure might
 be further studied. This apparatus, which is represented by
 the adjoining woodcut, consisted of a strong wooden lever A,
                              Fig. 1.
furnished with a hard steel knife edge at K resting on a hard
steel plate.   At the distance of one foot from the knife edge
a brass plate was fastened to the lever, into which a piece of
iron or steel wire, one-fourth of an inch in diameter, could be
screwed: the upper end of the wire could also be screwed
into a brass, bolt, the head of which rested upon the cross
piece S.     Weights could be placed on the lever at W to in
crease the tension. The magnetic balance, consisting of a bar
magnet eight inches long, properly furnished with scales, was
situated at B. . The further extremity of the lever was con
nected with a fine lever  multiplying eight times, the index of
                                                                *

           upon the Dimensions of Iron and Steel Bars.       227
which was examined by the microscope employed in the for
mer series of experiments.     Each division of the micrometer
passed over by the index indicated an elongation of the wire
under examination equal to raºrgth of an inch.
   When pressure instead of tension was employed, a pillar
of iron or steel wire, one quarter of an inch in diameter, was
placed at C so as to support the weight of the lever; its ends
abutted upon flat plates of copper or brass.
   Every precaution that I could think of was taken in order
to give accuracy to the results. In particular I may mention
that the coil was not permitted to touch either the wire under
examination, the lever, or any other part of the apparatus to
which it might communicate motion through the change of
its own molecular condition in consequence of the passage of
the electrical current. In spite of these precautions the ex
periments were very troublesome, owing to the almost inces
sant vibrations of the index. Although my laboratory is
situated quite out of the town, and detached from every dwell
ing, these vibrations were so extensive during the day time,
that the experiments had, in general, to be carried on after
eight o'clock P.M., when the greater part of the traffic had
ceased. It was at all times impossible to make an observa
tion when a cart was passing along a road at the distance of
one or two hundred yards; nor could anything be done as
long as much wind was blowing. Owing to these circum
stances it was frequently very difficult to estimate an effect
equal to one-tenth of a division of the micrometer. I believe,
however, that the results of the tables are in no case more
than two-tenths of a division wide of the truth.
   The experiment which I first made was with a piece of soft
iron wire, one foot long and one quarter of an inch in dia
meter. It was made as straight as possible, and its ends were
ground perfectly true and flat. It was placed as a pillar under
the lever, so as to support its pressure, which was equal to
82 lbs. The coil by which it was magnetized was formed out
of a copper wire thirty-three yards long and one-tenth of an
inch in diameter, well-covered with cotton-thread. Its length
was 11} inches, and its interior diameter one inch. The same
coil was employed in all the experiments with wires of a foot
long. The temperature of the wire was in every case about 45°.
   The method of experimenting was the same as I employed
in the former section of this paper. A current was passed
through the coil, the effects of which, both on the length of the
iron pillar and on its magnetism, were noted. The current
was then cut off; and the effect of so doing on the length of
the pillar noted, as well as the quantity of magnetism remain

 228          Mr. J. P. Joule on the Effects of Magnetism, &c.
 ing in it. A more powerful current was then passed, and the
 observations repeated as before; and so on with still more
 powerful currents. The fifth column of the table gives the
 effect upon the magnetic balance in grains, abstraction being
 made of the effect due to the coil itself, which had been pre
 viously carefully determined by experiment.

    The numbers in the last columns of the preceding tables
show that the elongation follows a rather higher ratio than
the square of the magnetic polarity. In the former section,
in which all the bars employed were a yard long, the ratio was
somewhat lower than that of the square of the polarity in the
case of well-annealed iron.        I am inclined therefore to think
that the anomalies referred to at p. 83, were occasioned rather
by the too great length of the iron bars, which prevented
them from being magnetized as much at the ends as at the
middle part, than by their different magnetic conditions at the
centre and surface.
    From the above tables it appears evident that the augmen
tation of pressure does not make much difference in the amount
of elongation for the same quantity of polarity. However, I
thought it desirable to try the effect of a greater pressure.
For this purpose I employed a piece of soft iron wire, six
inches long and one-fourth of an inch in diameter. This iron
pillar stood upon a small piece of flattened brass, resting upon
a block of hard wood six inches high, in order that it might
be sufficiently elevated to support the lever. . It was placed in
the axis of a suitable coil, 5}, inches long and one inch in in
terior diameter, constructed of a covered copper wire twenty
yards long and one-tenth of an inch in diameter.

     A comparison of the last columns of the two preceding
 tables will show that pressure has no sensible effect upon the
 extent of the elongation.                I had not sufficient voltaic force to
 saturate the short bars, but there appears no reason to doubt,
 that their elongation, when saturated, would be one-half that
 of the pillars one foot long, just as the latter were found to
 experience one-third of the elongation observed in the bars of
 a yard long employed in the first section. I may remark in

             upon the Dimensions of Iron and Steel Bars.               231
this place, that the greater proximity of the magnetic balance
to the coil increased the numbers in columns 5, representing
the magnetic intensity of the six-inch pillars. The two pre
ceding tables are therefore only comparable with themselves.
In all the other experiments with one-foot bars, the magnetic
balance was at the uniform distance of 4} inches from the
centre of the bar, so that they are strictly comparable with
one another.
    I now proceed to give an account of some experiments on
the effects of the force of tension. The bar employed was a
piece of soft iron wire 12# inches long and a quarter of an inch
in diameter. Its extremities were formed into very fine
threaded screws, extending one-third of an inch, for the pur
pose of screwing into the brass plate and bolt, as shown in the
figure already described. The effectual length of the bar,
when screwed into its place, was exactly one foot. In the
first experiment of this kind, the tension employed, being that
occasioned by the weight of the lever alone, amounted to
80 lbs. In the subsequent ones the tension was further in
creased byplacing weights on the lever,

    In tables 13 and 14 we notice the rapid decline of the effect
of elongation, until at last, in table 15, with a tension of
740 lbs. it ceases altogether, and the new condition of shorten
ing commences. With a tension of about 600 lbs. the effects
on the dimensions of the wire would cease altogether in the
limits of the electrical currents employed in the above experi
ments.         From the last column of table 15, which consists of
the columns 2 and 5 multiplied together and divided by co
lumn 4, we gather that the shortening effect is very nearly
proportional to the magnetism of the wire into the current
traversing the coil. The law of the square of the magnetism
will still indeed hold good where the iron is sufficiently below

            upon the Dimensions of Iron and Steel Bars,                  233
the point of saturation, on account of the magnetism being in
that case nearly proportional to the intensity of the current.
For the same reason, on examination of the previous tables,
it will be found that the elongation is, below the point of satu
ration, very nearly proportional to the magnetism multiplied
by the current. The necessity of changing the law arises
from the fact that the elongation ceases to increase after the
iron is fully saturated; whereas the shortening effect still
continues to be augmented with the increase of the intensity
of the current.

     The uniformity of the numbers contained in the last column
of each of the two preceding tables affords conclusive evidence
of the correctness of the law I have stated, viz. that in the case
of tension the shortening effect is proportional to the current
traversing the coil multiplied by the magnetic intensity of the
bar.                                                                                                           -
     In order to discover, if possible, what proportion the short
 ening effect bears to the force of tension, I have constructed
 the following table from the results observed with currents of
about 700 and 1000 intensity in the preceding experiments.

     On comparing Experiment 18 with Experiment 13, it will
 be observed that the elongation of the cast iron is equal, if not

superior to that of the soft iron, when magnetized to the same
extent.           It will also be remarked that the increase of tension
does not produce half the diminution of elongation which it
does in the case of the soft iron.

nº From the above experiments it will be seen that the same
remarks which were made with regard to the soft iron, apply
also to the soft steel. The superior retentive power of the
latter metal enables us however to trace the elongating effects
of the permanent magnetism, which, we see, diminish with the
increase of tension, until at last, as in experiment 24, they
cease altogether. ----------                     -           --

      From the above experiments we find that the induction of per
manent magnetism produces no sensibleeffect on the length of a
bar of perfectly hardened steel, and that the temporary shorten
ing effect of the coil is proportional to the magnetism multiplied
by the current traversing the coil. The shortening effect does
not in this case sensibly increase with the increase of tension.
I have made an experiment, in which a hard steel pillar was
subjected to a pressure of 80 lbs., which I have not inserted,
because the coil not being the same as I had hitherto em
ployed, that experiment was not strictly comparable with the
rest. Its result however showed that the hard steel pillar
suffered a diminution of length equal to 0-1 of a division of the
micrometer, with a current capable of giving a magnetic polar
ity of 1-7. This accords very well with the results obtained
with a tension of 1030 lbs.
      Copper is the only non-ferruginous metal which I have ex
perimented on. In the trials made with wires of this metal,
pressure and tension were successively applied, and very power
ful currents transmitted through the coil; but I could in no
case detect the slightest alteration in their dimensions.
      I shall not prolong this paper by a discussion of the pro
bable cause of the remarkable facts I have pointed out. The
law of elongation naturally suggests the joint operation of the
attractive and repulsive forces of the constituent particles of
the magnet as the cause of that phaenomenon. On the other

 240 Mr. J. P. Joule on the Effects of Magnetism, &c.
 hand, the fact that the shortening effect is proportional to the
 magnetic intensity of the bar multiplied by the current tra
 versing the coil, seems to indicate that, in this case, the effect
is produced by the attraction of the magnetic particles
 by the coil. But then it will be asked, why so re Fig. 2.
 markable an augmentation of the effect is produced
 by the increase of tension in the case of the soft iron
bars? When we are able to answer this question in a
satisfactory manner, we shall probably have a much
more complete acquaintance with the real nature of
magnetism than we at present possess.
                                 Postscript.
   I have already, in the former part of this paper,
described an experiment which indicated that no altera
tion in the bulk of a bar of soft iron could be pro
duced by magnetizing it. I thought, however, that
it would be interesting to confirm the fact by an ob
servation of the alteration of the dimensions of the
iron at right angles to the direction of its polarity.
For this purpose I took a piece of drawn iron gas
piping one yard long, fººths of an inch in bore, and
#ths of an inch in thickness. . A piece of thick
covered copper wire was inserted into this tube, and
bent over the outside of it in the manner indicated
by fig. 2. The lower extremity of the iron tube
being fixed, and the upper end being attached to the
micrometrical apparatus described in the first section
of this paper, each division of which corresponded to
rººrgath of an inch, I obtained the following re

    The results of the above table show that the length of the
tube was diminished, in order to make up for the increase of
its diameter, which, in this instance, was in the direction of the
polarity. The quantity of the shortening effect, viz. 3'4, is
however only one-third of that due to the maximum elongation
of soft iron bars as observed in the first section. This is pro
bably owing to the grain of the iron being in cross directions
with respect to the polarity in the two cases; and partly per
haps to the iron tube not being fully saturated with magnetism.
The experiment is worth repeating, especially as it affords a
means of studying the magnetic condition of closed magnetic
circuits.                              -
XXXIX. Second Report of Proceedings in the Cambridge
    Observatory relating to the New Planet (Neptune). By the
   Rev. J. CHALLIS, M.A., Plumian Professor of Astronomy
   in the University of Cambridge*.
IN conformity with a wish expressed by the Vice-Chancellor
     and the Observatory Syndicate at their ordinary terminal
meeting, held on March 15, I propose in this report to carry
on, for the information of members of the senate, the account
of proceedings in the observatory relative to the new planet,
a first report of which was made on December 12 of last year.
The theoretical grounds on which a search for the planet was
instituted, the manner in which the search was conducted, and
the degree of success that attended it, were stated in the former
report, which brought the history of proceedings down to the
date at which the planet was discovered. I have now to give
an account of the subsequent observations both of its position
in the heavens, and of its physical appearance, and to state the
                    * Communicated by Professor Challis.

242   Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet.
results respecting the orbit which have been deduced from the
observations by calculation.
   A regular series of observations of the planet was com
menced on October 3, 1846, and continued at all available
opportunities, partly with the meridian instruments, and partly
with the Northumberland equatoreal, to December 4, soon
after which the planet became too faint to observe on the
meridian on account of day-light. The observations were
subsequently carried on with the equatoreal to January 15.
The series was much interrupted by cloudy weather, parti
cularly in the months of December and January. On the
whole I have obtained twenty-eight positions of the planet with
the meridian instruments, and twenty-five positions with the
Northumberland equatoreal by means of ninety-two differential
observations of right ascension and as many of north polar
distance. The equatoreal measures were all referred to the
same star, No. 7648 of the British Association Catalogue, the
exact place of which was determined by sixteen observations
with the transit, and eight observations with the mural circle.
I have reason to think that the positions obtained with the
equatoreal are entitled to very nearly the same weight as those
obtained on the meridian.     All the above observations I have
completely reduced, and have placed the results at the disposal
of Mr. Adams for deducing elements of the planet's orbit.
   On January 12, I had for the first time a distinct impression
that the planet was surrounded by a ring. The appearance
noticed was such as would be presented by a ring like that of
Saturn, situated with its plane very oblique to the direction of
vision. I felt convinced that the observed elongation could
not be attributed to atmospheric refraction, or to any irregular
action on the pencils of light, because when the object was
seen most steadily I distinctly perceived a symmetrical form.
My assistant, Mr. Morgan, being requested to pay particular
attention to the appearance of the planet, gave the same direc
tion of the axis of elongation as that in which it appeared to
me. I saw the ring again on the evening of January 14. . In
my note-book I remark, “The ring is very apparent with a
power of 215, in a field considerably illumined by lamp-light.
Its brightness seems equal to that of the planet itself.” On
that evening, Mr. Morgan, at my request, made a drawing of
the form, which on comparison coincided very closely with a
drawing made independently by myself. The ratio of the
diameter of the ring to that of the planet, as measured from
the drawings, is about that of 3 to 2. The angle made
by the axis of the ring with a parallel of declination, in the

By a measurement taken with the position circle on Jan. 15,
under very unfavourable circumstances, this angle was found
to be 65°. I am unable to account entirely for my not having
noticed the ring at an earlier period of the observations. It
may, however, be said that an appearance like this, which it
is difficult to recognise except in a good state of the atmosphere,
might for a long time escape detection, if not expressly and
repeatedly looked for. To force itself on the attention, it
would require to be seen under extremely favourable circum
stances. Previous to the observations in January, the planet
had been hid for more than three weeks by clouds. The
evenings of January 12 and 14 were particularly good, and
the planet was at first looked at in strong twilight. Under
very similar circumstances I have twice seen with the North
umberland telescope the second division of Saturn's ring,
    I communicated to Mr. Lassell of Liverpool, who was the
first to suspect the existence of a ring, my observations upon
it, accompanied with a drawing; and I have received from him
in return a drawing of the appearance presented in his twenty
feet reflector, closely resembling mine both as to the form and
the position of the ring. Mr. Lassell writes, “I cannot refuse
to consider that your observation puts beyond reasonable doubt
the reality of mine.” In this conclusion I concur, and ac
cordingly in communications to the Royal Astronomical
Society and to Schumacher's Astronomische Nachrichten, con
taining my reduced observations, I have ventured to express
my conviction of the existence of a ring.
    By micrometer measures taken with the Northumberland
telescope, I find the apparent diameter of the body of the
planet to be very nearly 3".
    The above account includes all the observations on the
planet I could obtain before its disappearance in the solar rays.
By the kindness of Mr. Adams I am able to add some par
ticulars respecting its orbit, which he has derived by calcula
tion from the reduced places with which I furnished him. As
was stated in the former report, Mr. Adams calculated first
approximations to the elements, by employing the places I
obtained on August 4 and 12 in the course of searching for
the planet, with observations since the discovery extending to
October 13. For the sake of comparison with the second ap
proximations, I now give the first results.

    In calculating the following second approximations, Mr.
 Adams used the mean of the two places of August as a single
 place, and of the others he selected nine which seemed to be
 the best determined, and which were separated by convenient
 intervals. All the results are calculated for the epoch of 1846,
 August, 8-0 mean time at Greenwich.                   O   l   Il

    The first position on which the above results depend, that
 of August 4, was obtained sixteen days before the planet was
 in opposition, and the last position, that of January 15, thirty
 two days before it was in conjunction. The great variation
 of the planet's elongation from the sun in this interval, is fa
vourable to the correctness of the above determinations, which,
although they cannot pretend to extreme accuracy on account
of the short period over which the observations extend, are
yet entitled to considerable weight. Mr. Adams has in fact
calculated the probable errors of the above results by sup
posing each observation of right ascension or of north polar
distance to be liable to an error of 3"; and he finds that there
is little probability of their receiving any great amount of cor
rection by taking account of future observations. It may be
remarked that the first and second approximations do not
differ by any large quantities. Hence it may be inferred that
the places of August are deserving of confidence, and that on
account of the extension given to the period of observation
by including those places, this second approximation to the
elements is more accurate than it would have been if it de
pended solely on observations made since the discovery of the
planet.
   The calculations give 59'8" for the planet's heliocentric
motion from August 4 to January 15. This is so small an
arc that it is not possible to deduce with any degree of cer
tainty those elements the determination of which depends on
change of the heliocentric distance. Mr. Adams has, how
ever, discussed the observations with this object in view, and
has obtained certain limiting results, which, as possessing
considerable interest, I here subjoin.

   Prof. Challis's Observations relative to the New Planet. 245
    The eccentricity of the orbit cannot exceed 0-18. The
 most probable value is 0:06, which differs, but little from the
 eccentricities of the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
    The most probable longitude of perihelion is 49° 58', and
 the probable true anomaly 276° 43', according to which the
planet is near the extremity of the latus rectum and is de
 scending towards perihelion.        These results are extremely
 uncertain.
    The mean distance is 30-35, with a probable error of 0.25;
and the corresponding sidereal period is 167 years, with a
probable error of about two years.       It is remarkable that the
periodic time is very nearly double that of Uranus; so that
these two bodies will offer an instance of mutual perturbations
of large amount, differing in character from those of the other
planets, but analogous to the mutual perturbations of the first
and second, and second and third satellites of Jupiter.
   According to Bode's law of the planetary distances, the
mean distance of the new planet should be nearly 38. The
actual mean distance differs so much from this, that we are
compelled to conclude that this singular law, which holds with
reference to the other planets, fails in this instance.
    Since the apparent diameter of the new planet is to that of
Uranus nearly in the ratio of 3 to 4, according to the foregoing
determination of the distance its bulk is to that of Uranus in
the ratio of 8 to 5.
   The above is the sum of the results derivable from the first
series of observations.    For further and more exact informa
tion we must wait till the planet emerges from the solar rays.
Before concluding this report, I am desirous of saying a few
words respecting the name of the planet. I recently had the
satisfaction of receiving from M. Struve the copy of a commu
nication read by him at the general annual meeting of the Im
perial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, on December
29, in which he states the reasons that have induced himself
and the other Poulkova astronomers to adhere to the name
of Neptune, which name was first proposed by the French
Board of Longitude, shortly after the discovery of the planet.
These reasons are thus briefly expressed in a note addressed
to me personally: “The Poulkova astronomers have resolved
to maintain the name of Neptune, in the opinion that the name
of Le Verrier would be against the accepted analogy, and
against historical truth; as it cannot be denied that M. Adams
has been the first theoretical discoverer of that body, though
not so happy as to effect a direct result of his indications.”
M. Struve's communication has been published in this coun
try by the Astronomer Royal, who has expressed his assent to

246       Mr. T. Hopkins on the Hourly Alterations of
the reasons therein contained, and his determination to adopt
the name of Neptune. Prof. Gauss and Prof. Encke have
also, as I understand, adopted this name. I have only to add
that it is my intention (and I am permitted to say, the inten
tion of Mr. Adams also) to follow the example set by these
eminent astronomers.

XL. On the Hourly Alterations of the Vapour Atmosphere at
            Bombay. By THoMAs HoPKINs, Esq.”
                            [With a Plate.]
     HAVE already availed myself of the observations made
      at Bombay under the superintendence of Dr. Buist,
through a paper on the meteorology of that place by Colonel
Sabine, on which I made some remarks that were inserted in
the Philosophical Magazine for December 1846.         But since
those remarks were written I have had transmitted to me,
through the kindness of Colonel Sykes, a lithographed copy
of the observations themselves, in which are to be found im
portant facts connected with the hourly production of aqueous
vapour at Bombay, and its apparent influence on the move
ments of the barometer.
    In addition to the hourly registrations of other meteorolo
gical instruments, Dr. Buist has furnished columns of the
Reights of the wet- and     dry-bulb thermometers, showing the
hourly depression of the wet below the dry thermometer for
 each month of the year 1843. From these columns, it appears
 that the wet was depressed below the dry instrument, to a cer
 tain extent varying both with the time of the day and the
 season of the year. The depression was the least in the wet
 season and the greatest in the dry one; and, with reference to
the diurnal changes, the depression was generally, but not
 uniformly, the least about sun-rise and the greatest near to
 mid-day. These depressions of the wet below the dry ther
 mometer are known to be results of the cooling power of eva
poration of water on the bulb of the wet instrument; and the
 cooling thus produced is proportioned to the extent of eva
poration of water that takes place; being small when the eva
 poration is little, and great when it is much. Thus the regis
 tration of the wet-bulb thermometer not only furnishes us
 with means of determining how far evaporation kept down the
 temperature of the thermometer exposed to its influence, but
                     * Communicated by the Author.

               the Vapour Atmosphere at Bombay.             247
also of ascertaining what were the relative amounts of water
evaporated during the different portions of the time, the
cooling being the effect of the conversion of certain quantities
of water into aqueous vapour, and being in every separate
part of that time proportioned to the quantity converted.
   We have also in a separate column of Dr. Buist's returns,
the difference between the dry and the wet thermometers;
and this difference may be taken to express the relative quan
tities of water evaporated, and the force of evaporation. From
about six in the morning, varying with the season, this differ
ence generally increases until, say twelve or one o'clock in the
day, when it declines until the following morning.
   As already stated, evaporation is less in the wet than in the
dry season; and there is also less difference between the morn
ing and mid-day force of evaporation in the former than in
the latter season. The cold part of the year is the period for
the land and sea breezes, and also for the extensive daily fluc
tuations of the barometer; and Dr. Buist says that this season
lasts five months, namely, during October, November, De
cember, January and February, forming the winter of the
part. But of these October is wavering and uncertain; we
may therefore consider the other four months as the season
when the sea and land breezes blow in the most decided man
ner, and in which the greatest daily fluctuations of the baro
meter take place; it is consequently desirable that we should
carefully examine the returns for the whole of these months.
To do this, we will take the mean hourly difference between
the dry and wet thermometers for each month, and by adding
them together and dividing by four, obtain the mean hourly
force of evaporation for the winter season. This I have done,
and the result is given in the following table, to which are
added in other columns the mean hourly heights of the baro
meter, thermometer and wet-bulb thermometer, for the same
period, that the whole may be seen at one view injuxtaposition.
The same facts are shown in a diagram (Plate IV.), in which
the curve of the wet-bulb thermometer is exhibited in accord
ance with the figures of the table; and also as a base line,
from which the distance of the dry thermometer is shown, the
intermediate space marking the relative force of evaporation
in each hour of the day.

   By examining this table we may see that evaporation at four
in the morning is 6°5, from which it rises, until at ten o’clock
it is 9°3, being an increase of 2°8; and during this time the
barometer is admitted to be raised to the height that it attains,
29.928 inches, through the pressure of the vapour that has
been recently produced by evaporation and thrown into the
atmosphere.
   From ten to twelve o'clock, evaporation, as measured by the
difference between the two thermometers, increases up to 11°3,
being a further rise of 2°; but at the same time the barometer,
instead of rising higher, as might be expected, falls no less
than 1044, as by that hour it sinks to 29.884 inches.
   Evaporation becomes rather less active after twelve o'clock;
but it still shows great force, and continues to exhibit it till
four o'clock, at which time it is 9°1, being only 2 less than
it was at ten in the morning. Yet during the whole of the
time from ten in the morning to four in the afternoon, when
evaporation was so energetic, the barometer was falling, and
sunk no less than 113. What then became of the vapour

               the Vapour Atmosphere at Bombay.              249
that was produced and discharged into the atmosphere within
this period? The quantity passed into the atmosphere in
the six hours must have been large, it being the product of
an average evaporation of 10°3 for the whole time; whilst
the average for the previous six hours was only 7°3 when
the barometer was rising. Now, can it be supposed that a
 comparatively small additional quantity of vapour raised the
barometer considerably from four to ten in the morning, and
a further large addition to that quantity, acting in the same
way from ten to four in the afternoon, not only ceased to raise
it, but was attended by a fall of that instrument to an extent
greater than the previous rise, -without some other cause
 coming into operation It cannot be maintained that the
increase of surface thermometric temperature had but little
counteracting effect before ten, and great counteracting effect
after that time until four o'clock.     For the rise of the ther
mometer from four to ten in the morning was little less than
it was from ten in the morning to two in the afternoon,-the
time of the highest temperature, —it having risen so much as
 3°-5 in the former, and only 3°8 in the latter period. And it
should be remembered that evaporation from ten to four was
constantly adding fresh vapour to that which was previously
in the atmosphere, where the whole was accumulating, and
pressing with its aggregate weight on the barometer. There
is, therefore, in the facts presented to us in the tables, no
countenance for the supposition that temperature, as measured
by the thermometer near the surface of the earth, counteracted
the increase of vapour pressure after ten o’clock, and caused
the fall of the barometer.                                       -
   It is however sufficiently evident, from the facts given, that
the vapour produced in the morning constituted the material
which supplied the heat that at this time rendered the atmo
sphere warm and light in the locality, and caused the baro
meter to fall.
   When the sun advances above the horizon it warms the
surface of the globe, and not only increases evaporation of
water, but heats that portion of the atmospheric gases that is
near the surface,—which portion rises probably in separate
streams or columns,—cooler columns at the same time de
scending to the surface and taking the place of the warmer.
This process goes on as the sun rises higher, until at some
particular time, depending on the locality and season, the
ascending columns reach a height sufficient to enable the ex
panding gases to cool and condense some of the vapour which
is intermingled with them. This ordinarily takes place from
nine to eleven o'clock, or say at ten in the morning, from

250       Mr. T. Hopkins on the Hourly Alterations of
which hour condensation is warming the atmospheric mass in
the locality. This warmed mass, a mixture of gases and
vapour, as it ascends is acted on by the different laws of cool
ing, of condensation, and of expansion by heat, which the
constituent parts of the atmosphere obey; and the result is
the formation of a buoyant column of cloud, of greater or less
thickness, according to the quantity of vapour that has been
condensed. The whole local column being thus made lighter
by the liberated heat, it presses with less force on the surface
of the earth, and consequently on the barometer. This dimi
nished pressure is however effected through the liberated heat
driving a portion of the material of the atmosphere, the gases,
from the heated part to other parts of the atmospheric space;
and thus we find that the heat just liberated by the conden
sation of vapour counteracts the increased pressure of the
aqueous matter, which is at the same time passing into the
atmosphere in the form of vapour. For it is here contended
that the vapour that had been produced from four to ten in
the morning, is, soon after the last-named hour, not only raised
but condensed,—deprived of a part of its heat, and converted
into minute particles of water, which float in the gaseous
atmosphere as a cloud; and as such, undoubtedly form a part
of the whole atmosphere and contribute to its weight. It is
not therefore through a reduction in the quantity of aqueous
matter in the local atmosphere, at this period of the day, that
the barometer falls; but that fall is caused by the expanding
 º of liberated heat driving from the heated vertical co
 umn a part of the ponderable gases which previously existed
within it, and, in that way, by removing a part of the material
of the atmosphere, causing the jº to press with less
weight on the barometer.
   The quantity of vapour that passes daily into the atmo
sphere while the temperature is rising, and which does not
fall as rain, is returned to the earth as dew on its surface;
and thus an equilibrium is established between the production
and the condensation of vapour; but this does not take place
during the period of which we have been treating, that is to
say, from four o'clock in the morning to four in the afternoon.
Vapour is not daily abstracted from the atmosphere by the
formation of dew on the surface of the earth, until the baro
meter ceases to fall at four o'clock in the afternoon. At pre
sent we have to consider the influence of vapour during two
periods of six hours each,--that in which the barometer is
rising from four to ten in the morning, and that in which it is
sinking from ten to four in the afternoon: and it has been
shown that aqueous matter during the whole of this time was

              the Vapour Atmosphere at Bombay.                 251
increasing in quantity and accumulating in the atmosphere;
and as far as that matter influenced the atmosphere, it must
have increased its weight. The aggregate pressure of aqueous
matter did not cease to increase at ten o'clock in the morning,
when the barometer began to fall; that fall was produced by
a new cause which then came into operation in the locality,
namely, the expanding and displacing power of liberated
heat.
   It will probably be asked whether cloud forms near to, or
over Bombay, after ten o'clock, and increases till four, as
assumed 2 and to this inquiry I cannot give an answer that is
likely to be quite satisfactory, not having full information on
the subject. Dr. Buist, in his introductory remarks, does not
particularly notice the formation of clouds within that portion
of the day. In the hourly-observation tables there is a column
for describing the appearance of clouds; and the entries in
that column show that the cumulus, the cirro-cumulus, and
the cirro-stratus were often formed, but they are not de
scribed in such a way as would justify me in adducing them
as proofs of the agency here ascribed to them, although they
do furnish rather strong presumptive evidence on the subject.
    Clouds form pretty freely from ten in the morning till four
in the afternoon, whilst from ten at night to four in the morn
ing the atmosphere is represented as being generally clear:
and taking the accounts given of the clouds during the two
periods, we are fully authorized to say that they formed and
remained suspended in the air during the former period, and
were dissolved before the arrival of the latter period; showing
that there were daily formation of cloud by condensation of
vapour, and daily dissipation of those clouds by evaporation.
    But in addition to the daily formation of visible clouds, there
 are indications that condensation takes place, but only to such
 an extent as to produce a haziness or misty appearance in the
 sky; and if this process is carried on until a considerable
 height is attained, it must warm the atmospheric mass and
lighten it. Indeed, at the commencement of the process of
 gradual condensation, the cloud that is thereby formed is not
 seen; as it is only when a sufficient stratum of floating glo
 bules of water is produced that the cloud becomes visible.
 The first slight falling of the barometer before rain is probably
 caused in this way.
    Judging from analogous cases, it may be presumed that
 palpable daily clouds at Bombay were first formed near the
 high ground to the east of that place, as such clouds in other
 similar places generally form near to, or against the sides of
 hills.  Our old navigators have described such formations in

 252 Mr. T. Hopkins on the Vapour Atmosphere at Bombay.
many parts of the world; but the following account given by
 Hutchison of Glasgow, contains a description of that which
ordinarily takes place in localities similar to that of Bombay,
although the distance of the mountains from the places of
observation in the two cases, and the influences of the trade
winds may modify the process. Mr. Hutchison says that
“the formation of clouds is finely illustrated by the phaeno
mena daily exhibited during the dry season over what are
called the Liguana, or Port Royal Mountains in the island
of Jamaica.    These mountains are situated about four or five
miles to the north-east by east of Kingston, the principal port
in the island, and their height above the level of the sea is
about 4000 to 5000 feet. During the dry season, from the
beginning of November till the middle of April, the sea and
land breezes alternately succeed each other with an interme
diate interval of atmospheric stillness, in the following manner.
From sun-rise till about ten o'clock in the forenoon it is usually
perfectly calm. About ten o’clock, the sea breeze, blowing at
Kingston from the east, or a little to the south of east, com
mences and continues till about half-past three in the after
noon, when it gradually and entirely subsides.” . Again,
“About eleven o’clock every forenoon, or between that and
mid-day, the summits of the Port Royal Mountains begin to
be covered with clouds, which, though thin, fleecy and trans
parent at first, gradually increase in density till about one
o'clock. By this time the upper portions of the mountain,
when viewed from Kingston, seem to be wholly enveloped in
dense clouds, rain is apparently falling in torrents, flashes of
lightning are seen, and the sound of distant thunder is heard.
About half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, the clouds, gra
dually diminishing in density, begin to quit the mountains;
so that their summits again become visible, as in the morning,
and so continue till about eleven o'clock the following day.
The clouds after quitting the mountains rise gradually to a
greater altitude and float very slowly westward, assuming as
they proceed the appearance of large heaped-up cumuli.”

the trade-wind at Bombay was ordinarily from north of west,

  XLI. Remarks on the Ertractive Material of Urine, and on
     the Earcretion of Sulphur and Phosphorus by the Kidneys in
     an unoa'idized state. By EDMUND Ron ALDs, Ph.D., Giessen”.
- SOME months back, at the instigation of Dr. Golding Bird,
        I undertook some experiments to ascertain whether, in
  cases of diseased and imperfect function of the lungs or liver,
  when the normal quantity of carbon could not be discharged
  from the system by those channels, the kidneys undertook an
  extra duty, and whether under such circumstances an excess
  of carbon could be shown in the urine above that usually
  secreted under healthy conditions.
     Should this question be answered in the affirmative, and
  should it be found that a larger amount of carbon was excreted
  by the urine in persons affected with such diseases, a practical
  application might reasonably be made of the fact. For by
  stimulating the kidneys to still greater exertion, the amount of
  work required of the lungs or of the liver could be lessened,
  and thus a better chance offered them of being restored to a
  healthy state.
     The method proposed for solving this problem was, to pre
  cipitate the urine of different patients suffering from diseases
  of the kinds mentioned, with basic acetate of lead, keeping it
  slightly alkaline by the addition of a few drops of ammonia,
  then to ascertain the amount of organic matter contained in
  the precipitate, and in particular the amount of carbon, and
  lastly to compare these quantities with those obtained in a
  similar manner from the urine of healthy individuals.
    * From the Philosophical Transactions for 1846, part iv.; having been
  received by the Royal Society April 25, and read June 18, 1846.

254    Dr. Ronalds on Sulphur and Phosphorus in Urine.
  In endeavouring to determine the amount of organic matter in
the lead precipitate by burning, as likewise in determining the
quantity of carbon by an elementary analysis of the same pre
cipitate with oxide of copper, results were obtained which did
not agree, and many difficulties arose which it is not necessary
to state now, but which rendered it absolutely necessary to
separate by some means the organic matter from the oxide of
lead before submitting it to analysis, and even that we might
obtain accurately its quantity. Whilst employed in seeking
an accurate mode of separation, Dr. Scherer's paper appeared
on the extractive matters of urine”, in which a successful mode
of separation is described, and the question at issue answered.
Dr. Scherer finds that the extractive or colouring matter of
the urine contains a larger quantity of carbon and hydrogen
when obtained from persons in whom the normal function of
the lungs, of the liver or of the skin is deranged, than when
taken from healthy subjects, and that the same excess of carbon
passes off by the urine when the diet is more than usually rich
in that element. From his paper however it does not appear
that the quantity of this extractive or colouring matter passed
during a certain space of time has been ascertained, and it
strikes me that he assumes the quantity of extractive to be the
same in all kinds of urine; this I think requires to be proved
before it can be positively affirmed that more carbon and hy
drogen do pass off by the urine in such diseased conditions, as
a larger quantity of less highly carbonized extractive matter
might compensate for the excess of carbon in the more highly
carbonized, supposing the latter to be in less quantity. The
relative quantity of these matters, and likewise the relative
quantities of urea in a certain amount of urine, must be ac
curately determined before the conclusion can be considered
as absolutely proved.                               -
   Whilst engaged with the foregoing researches, it occurred
to me that it might not be devoid of interest to the physiologist
to know the amount of sulphur which was secreted by the
kidneys in an unoxidized state. That urine does contain sul
phur, not in combination as sulphate, is evident from the smell
of sulphuretted hydrogen which, mixed with that of ammonia,
is evolved from it whilst undergoing spontaneous decomposi
tion, also from the blackening which white lead paint suffers
when exposed to the gases arising from putrid urine, and like
wise from the fact, that urine allowed to putre<U+017F>y in a glass
vessel containing oxide of lead as one of its constituents, per
manently blackens the glass. To set the fact beyond doubt,
two portions of urine, previously deprived of mucus by acetic

  acid and filtration, each consisting of four fluid ounces, were
  measured; the one simply evaporated and burnt, the other
  evaporated and afterwards deflagrated with nitre. Each por
  tion was then dissolved in dilute nitric acid, leaving a minute
  insoluble residue, and the sulphuric acid precipitated by
  chloride of barium; the results were as follows:—
. Four fluid oz., simply incinerated, gave Four fluid oz., deflagrated with
                     grs,               gr.                       nitre, gave in grains

      The quantity of sulphur in four fluid ounces not excreted in
  the state of sulphate was therefore 0.417 grain. To ascertain
  the quantity of sulphur excreted by the urine in twenty-four
  hours in an unoxidized state, the whole quantity passed by
  three individuals during that time was collected on different
  days and measured; its specific gravity was taken, and after
  being filtered from mucus, two portions of each specimen were
  measured in a specific-gravity bottle containing 1000 grain
  measures; one portion was simply acidified with nitric acid,
  and the sulphuric acid precipitated by nitrate of barytes. The
  other portion was evaporated with nitre and deflagrated, and
  the fused mass treated with dilute nitric acid and nitrate of
  barytes. From the difference in the quantities of sulphate of
  barytes obtained, the amount of sulphur not in an oxidized
  state was ascertained. The results from five different experi
  ments are shown by the following table.

      It thus appears that from three to five grains of sulphur
  pass off daily by the urine in some other combination than as

 256       Dr. Ronalds on Sulphur and Phosphorus in Urine.
 sulphuric acid, and that these three to five grains amount to
 about one-fourth of the whole quantity of sulphur excreted by
 the kidneys. With a view to ascertain what compound con
 tained this sulphur in the urine, I have examined the preci
 pitates produced in urine by neutral and basic acetate of lead,
 after the separation of the sulphates by baryta, and find that
 they only contain traces of sulphur. The colouring matter
 described by Scherer, and obtained by the method he adopts,
 likewise contains only a trace; whereas the liquid containing
 the urea, generally considered free from all other organic
 matter, which remains on the separation of the precipitate by
 basic acetate of lead, contains nearly the whole of this excess
 of sulphur, but how combined I have not yet been able to
 ascertain. The determination of this question, which I pro
pose to examine, may possibly lead to some interesting facts,
 and perhaps throw some light upon the question respecting
 the formation of cystic oxide.
    From some preliminary experiments made for the purpose
of ascertaining whether phosphorus was contained in urine in
any other compound than as phosphate, the following results
 were obtained.
    To the four ounces of urine employed for the preliminary
determination of the sulphuric acid and sulphur in the former
experiment, after the precipitation of the sulphuric acid by
barytes, some more nitrate of barytes was added and then the
whole carefully neutralized with ammonia. The following
quantities were obtained:—
Phosphate of barytes obtained from the        Phosphate of barytes obtained from
  PO5 naturally contained in urine was       urine after deflagration with mitre was

showing an excess of phosphorus over that contained as phos
phate in the four ounces of urine to be 0-105 grain.
    In another experiment, in which the same portions of urine
were employed as at the fifth column of the foregoing table,
the following were the results:—
Phosphate of barytes obtained from the POs Phosphate of barytes obtained from
  maturally contained in 1016 grs. of urine.    1016 grs. of urine after deflagrating
                                                            with nitre.
       BaC PO, 8'135 grains                      BaC PO, 5.313 grains
            = PO, 0.993                              = PO, 1.687
            =P       O-435.                         =P          O'740
Therefore 0.305 grain of phosphorus was contained in the
1016 grains of urine in an unoxidized state, which, calculated
for the whole amount of urine passed in twenty-four hours,

        Mr. A. Cayley's Note on a System of Imaginaries. 257
would amount to 5'896 grains. In some other specimens of
urine which I examined there was however no approach to
this quantity of phosphorus in an unoxidized state, and as
the mode of analysis employed in these preliminary experi
ments was not the most accurate, I intend to make the deter
mination of the quantity of phosphorus the subject of further
experiments.
   The only opportunity I have had of examining urine in a
diseased state, was a portion obtained from a patient suffering
from diabetes mellitus. As might have been anticipated from
the character of this disease, the amount of sulphur which the
urine contained in an unoxidized state, was considerably
greater (by one-fourth) than in healthy urine.
   The diabetic urine had a specific gravity of 1046.
   Of this urine 1046 grains, precipitated with nitrate of ba
rytes, gave—
   4:308 grains sulphate of barytes= 1.479 grain SOs =0.592
grain S.
   After the precipitation of the sulphuric acid by baryta, the
urine was evaporated down with nitric acid, mixed with nitre
and deflagrated. An excess of nitrate of barytes having been
used to precipitate the sulphuric acid, there remained on
treating the fused mass with dilute nitric acid, an insoluble
residue of sulphate of barytes, the sulphuric acid of which had
been derived from the oxidation of the sulphur by the nitre;
the sulphate of barytes amounted to
    1-837 grain = 0.629 grain sulphuric acid = 0:251 grain sul
phur, or 0.024 per cent,
whilst in healthy urine the sulphur in this state never exceeded
0-018 per cent.

                    XLIII. On Gun-Cotton.
               By E. F. TEsche MACHER, Esq.”
IN    consequence of the discovery by Professor Schönbein of
     gun-cottom, and of the possibility of its substitution in
many cases for gunpowder, I have been induced to enter into
an examination of the mode of its formation and of its syn
thetical composition, principally with a view of ascertaining
how far it would be likely to affect an important branch of
trade—the production and value of saltpetre and nitrate of
soda.    The examination was not commenced with the view
of publishing it, but some of the facts brought to light ap
peared to possess sufficient interest to lay before the Society.
I must premise that the experiments relate only to the gun
cotton prepared by the process recommended by Mr. T. Tay
lor.   Equal measures of nitric acid of sp. gr. 1509, and of
sulphuric acid sp. gr. 1840, were mixed together, and consti
tuted (No. 1) the acids used in these experiments. I dried
50 grs. of South American cotton (from La Guayra) over a
water-bath, and found the cotton gave off 3:40 grs. of hygro
metric water. The 46-60 grs. of cotton which remained after
drying, I steeped in 487; grs. of the mixed acids No. 1; the
  * Communicated by the Chemical Society; having been read Nov. 2,
1846,

                Mr. Teschemacher on Gun-Cotton.              259
 strong acids were in contact with the cotton about two mi
 nutes, and after squeezing well, the cotton was washed in
 water to free it from the acid: the quantity of water used was
 5000 grs.
    The strong acid squeezed out of the cotton weighed 1134
 grs. (No. 2), leaving 374 grs. of acid (No. 3) to be accounted
 for, to make up the original quantity used. The cotton thus
 prepared was perfectly dried in the air over a water-bath, and
 was found to weigh 79 grs., being an increase of 32.40 grs. on
the cotton used, equal to an increase of 69% grs, upon every
 100 grs. of cotton in its original state.
    To ascertain whether the cotton would absorb anything
more, I steeped 25 grs. of the above cotton, after it had been
washed and dried, in fresh acid (No. 1), but no increase of
weight took place. I also steeped a fresh portion of cotton for
three minutes in the same quantity of fresh acid (No. 1); it
weighed after washing and drying 78 grs. ; a third portion
was steeped for four minutes in one-third more acid than in
the previous experiments, it weighed after washing 79 grs.;
so that it appeared that the cotton had taken up its maximum
from the acid by the first immersion.
    As these 32°40 grs. increase of weight were clearly derived
from the 487% grs. of the mixed acids, I made the following
 experiments to ascertain what alteration the acids had under
gone.
    I neutralized 100 grs. by weight of the original acid (No. 1)
by carbonate of soda, and found that it required 52.80 grs. of
soda for that purpose. I found likewise that to neutralize
the 113% grs. of strong acid (No. 2) separated from the cotton,
required 58.52 grs. of soda, and that the remaining 374 grs.
of acid to be accounted for, contained in the washings, required
 170:30 grs. of soda for neutralization, making together 228-82
grs. of soda required to neutralize the 487% grs. of acids No.
2 and 3, used for acting upon the cotton; therefore, if 100
grs. of the original mixed acids (No. 1) required 5280 grs. of
soda as above for neutralization, 487% grs. would require (if
not acted upon by the cotton) 257'36 grs. of soda; it how
ever only required 228.82 grs. as above. The difference, 28'54
grs. of soda, is therefore equal to the acid which disappeared,
or was taken up by the immersion of 46-60 grs. of cotton in
the mixed acids. To ascertain whether a portion of each of
the mixed acids, or only one of them, was taken up by the
cotton, I added to the solution of the 100 grs. of mixed acids
(No. 1) (neutralized by the soda) chloride of barium, and ob
tained a precipitate weighing 126 grs. of sulphate of barytes.
   I also, in the same manner, precipitated from the solution

260 ºmir. Teschemacher on Gun-Cotton.' "
No. 2, 165-40 grs. of sulphate of barytes, and from No. 3, of
374 grs., 449:30 grs. of sulphate of barytes, making together
614.70 grs.; therefore, if 100 grs. of the original acids (No. 1)
give 126 grs. of sulphate of barytes, 487% grs... would give
614:25 grs.; they gave, as above, 614.70 grs., showing that
mo portion of the sulphuric acid was withdrawn, but that it
was a portion of the ingredients of the nitric acid alone that
combined with the cotton.
   The quantity of soda neutralized by the acids (Nos. 2 and 3)
was, as just stated, 28.54 grs. ; therefore, if 32 grs. of soda
neutralize 54 grs. of nitric acid, 28.54 grs. of soda will give
48 grs. of nitric acid, the quantity of acid which disappeared,
or was taken up by the cotton.
    From what took place, the following may be deduced as
its synthetical composition :-48 grs. of dry nitric acid, con
taining 35-66 grs. of oxygen, were decomposed by the 46-60
grs. of cotton, and 32.40 grs. were added to the weight of the
cotton. It is probable that the mixed acids combined with a
portion of the constituent water of the cotton, which was
replaced by oxygen and nitrogen, in the proportions of nitric
acid, as there was no appearance of the evolution of either
nitrogen or oxygen in the formation of the gun-cotton.
    Its synthetical composition would stand thus:–
     46-60 grs. of cotton deprived of
     15-60 water, give                         -
     31:00 cotton without constitutional water, combined with
     48:00 oxygen and nitrogen derived from the mixed acids,
      79:00 the weight of gun-cotton produced, equal to
     39:25 parts cotton,
     60-75 ... oxygen and nitrogen (nitric acid)
 in 100:00 parts.
  . From these experiments we arrive at the following conclu
 sions regarding the formation of this substance:–That as it
 requires 48 grs. of nitric acid, or its equivalent 90'66 grs. of
 saltpetre, to form 79 grs. of gun-cotton, it will require 60-75
 grs. of nitric acid, or its equivalent 1 14-76 grs. of saltpetre, to
 form 100 grs. of gun-cotton; and according to the same calcu
 lation, it will require 97.76 grs. of nitrate of soda for the same
 purpose.
    Taking into consideration the original cost of the cotton,
 the expensive manipulation of the conversion of the nitre into
 nitric acid, and the additional weight of nitre required to
 produce the same weight of gun-cotton, it is evident that the
 latter substance must be more expensive than gunpowder,
 taking weight for weight of each. How far, however, gun

cotton inay exceed gunpowder in its explosive force still re
mains to be ascertained, and this of course forms an important
element in the calculation. Other processes may be alrea
known, or may be hereafter discovered, calculated to reduce
the expenses of the formation of the so-called gun-cotton,
but it must be still borne in mind that an enormous quantity
of oxygen, amounting to 45 parts in every 100 parts of gun
cotton produced, must be obtained from some, extraneous
source for combination. . .             . . .     º, in         . . . . ."
    Many other vegetable fibres may be substituted for cotton;
but as far as a few experiments which I have made, it appears
they do not possess the explosive force of cotton.                In a trial
upon flax, I found that 50 grs. increased in weight to 72 grs.;
the explosive force was feeble; this was the case with sawdust
similarly prepared; but it is possible that this latter form of
impure lignin may eventually be of more importance than it
appears at present.
    Fifty grains of deal sawdust dried at 212° were first washed
with dilute muriatic acid and then with dilute caustic alkali;
they were found to have lost 6 grs. after washing and again
drying. The 44 grs. remaining were steeped in the mixed
acids for about five minutes, then washed and dried; they
increased to 58°7 grs. The acids were examined by carbonate
of soda in the manner before detailed, the sawdust was found
to have neutralized 22.90 grs. of soda, equal to 38.65 parts
of nitric acid, or 66'66 of nitric acid for every 100 parts of
gun-sawdust. This gun-sawdust flashed off readily, but with
less rapidity than gun-cotton, leaving a small carbonaceous
residue.
    The difference in quantity of nitric acid taken up by the
 sawdust and the cotton is no doubt owing to the former being
a much more impure form of lignin than the latter.

rays transmitted by various media, when these are the seat of
a sufficient electro-magnetic induction *. I have shown that
polarized calorific radiations are affected in a manner entirely
similar+. Are these effects limited to the cases in which they
have been detected 2 Would not the action of the magnet
upon fluids, or rather on diaphanous and diathermanous bodies,
 be capable of impressing on light and caloric other modifi
 cations hitherto unperceived? The mere statement of these
 questions is enough to indicate an unlimited field of research.
I shall content myself with describing the experiments which
 I have made upon the rays of the spectrum, which may be
studied by processes capable of accurate admeasurement, and
 whose theory is intimately connected with that of light.
    81. I long ago observed that the production of the rays,
 their direction, number and distribution, are not affected by
 the presence of a magnet in contact with the prism. I re
 peated these experiments, inducting magnetism in various
 media through which the luminous bundle had to pass.
    82. My prism, of the finest flint glass, was made by Fraun
 hofer; its angle of refraction is 45°4' 20".                -
    83. The diaphanous bodies submitted to induction were
 the following:—Among the gases, air and nitrous acid, dry
 and moist: these were inclosed in a glass tube O*180 long
 and 0"008 in diameter. Lastly, among solids, a specimen of
 very pure flint glass was selected, in the form of a square
 prism on 170 long and On-O195 the side.
     84. The rays were observed in a dark chamber with an
 opening in the shutter of six metres, with an excellent comet
 seeker by Cauchoir. This instrument has a reduced opening
 of Om'069 and Om'66 focal distance: it was used with a mag
 nifying power of seven times.
    85. The light sent horizontally by a heliostate with a sil
 vered or black mirror, or from a lamp, was polarized more or
 less completely by reflexion or by its passage through a Nicol's
 prism. A second similar prism served as analyser.
    86. The electro-magnet is formed of a horseshoe of very
 soft iron, weighing 12*5, around which is wound a well
 annealed copper wire of Om:003 diameter and 70*8 long.

 repeated my experiments. He polarizes and analyses heat with Nicol's

 double helices, destined to reproduce the phaenomena discovered by Mr.
 Faraday, and on which M. Biot has read a very favourable report to the
 Institute. According as the magnetism is engendered in this powerful
 apparatus, or the voltaic circuit is broken, the deviation of the rheometric
 needle varies several degrees. (October 1.)                            -

This apparatus easily raises 312 kil. : it was set in action with
a Bunsen's battery of from twenty to forty pairs. Moreover,
its energy was augmented, according to circumstances, by lay
ing on the poles the great helix (3), the three wires of which
were connected by their ends, or a tube of soft iron containing
the transparent media to be induced; sometimes even the enve
lope of iron with the diaphanous body were placed in the hol
low of the helix.
    87. Whatever may have been the degree of polarization of
the luminous bundles and the intensity of the magnetic forces
developed, the rays of the spectrum produced by the rays of
the sun or from an artificial source presented no appreciable
change. Their number and their distance, varying with the
nature of the light and with that of the prisms, were not mo

   § IX. Has statical or dynamical induction any influence on
             -           chemical affinities
    88. Chemical affinities are intimately connected with the
electric forces. The problem of their reciprocal dependence
has not yet been solved, because this problem has not been
 regarded in all its bearings. Admitting, with most physicists,
 that the magnetic influence is felt in imponderable fluids in a
 mediate manner, by a disturbance or by a new and forced
equilibrium in the constitution of the medium traversed by
 these fluids, it becomes highly interesting to examine whether
 this disturbance interferes with the forces of affinity, whether
 it can increase or diminish them. The following experiments
 were directed to this object.
    89. Between the arms of the electro-magnet (86) was ar
 ranged a voltameter with lamina of platina, in which some
 acidulated water was electrolysed. The voltaic current could,
 at will and by a very simple arrangement, thus bring the mag
 net into action and develope a north or south pole at either of
 its extremities. The product of decomposition in a given time
 was estimated by the hydrogen always collected on the same
 electrode. Now, whatever the direction and intensity of the
 magnetism engendered, as well as the position of the volta
 meter within or without the polar arms, the volume of the
 gas remained the same *.
     90. The same was the case also when the electro-magnet
 was replaced by the large helix (3), in the hollow of which
 the voltameter was placed.
    * I have been informed by Prof. Grove that similar experiments, still
 unpublished, had led him to the same result. (October 1, 1846.)

264 Prof. E. Wartmann's third Memoir on Induction.
    91. To meet the objection that the influence of the magnet
is not sufficiently felt on the lamina of platina, I constructed
two new voltameters (Plate V. figs. 1 and 2) in which the
electrodes are prisms of soft iron, gilded by the galvanic pro
cess, and which I magnetize by placing them upon the polar
surfaces of the large magnet (86), covered with a very thin
isolating leaf of mica. In one of these apparatus, the prisms
are Om:030 in breadth. Repeated experiments, made with
batteries of variable force, sometimes collecting the two gases,
sometimes the hydrogen alone, and decomposing acidulated
or alkaline water, have invariably led to the same results.
    92. But, it will be said, the electric current which imparts to
the magnetits power, is an uninterrupted current and incapable
of exerting any action upon the electrolyte which is not in its
circuit. In order to remove this difficulty, I substituted elec
tricity of tension for that of the current. A fourth voltameter
 (fig. 3) was constructed so as to ensure the most perfect isola
tion between its poles. Behind these, against the sides of the
glass vessel, I fixed two platina laminae, one-half of which was
immersed vertically 0"-03 in the liquid to be decomposed,
 whilst the other was continued outside in a horizontal band
terminated by a ball.        A thick coating of wax on the exte
rior of the voltameter prevented all electric communication
between these laminae, except through the liquid. The hydro
gen produced in the unit of time by the electrolysis of the
acidulated water was measured carefully. The quantity of
gas did not vary when one of the laminae of platina was placed
in relation with the conductor of a powerful electrical machine
 (with a plate three metres in circumference), the other lamina
communicating with the ground; or when these laminae were
employed to connect the armatures of a battery of three
 large Leyden jars, kept constantly charged. The direction of
 the analysing current was changed without the effect being
 modified.
    93. We may conclude from the preceding experiments, that
statical or dynamical induction has no influence upon the che
 mical actions engendered by electricity.
     § X. Are magnets capable of producing chemical action ?
    94. The subject which I have alluded to in the preceding
paragraph is so intimately connected with the controverted
 question of the chemical actions produced by magnets and by
 terrestrial magnetism, that I deemed it necessary to devote to it
 some special experiments. Most observers who have studied it
 have used only magnets of small power. I have employed
electro-magnets of great energy, which were at my disposal, to

       Prof. E. Wartmann's third Memoir on Induction. 265
repeat their researches, being persuaded that a very intense
force must produce corresponding decisive and considerable
effects.   Other circumstances have thrown doubt on the con
clusions mentioned by those authors; account has not been
taken of the relations between the surfaces which were the
seat of the action to be measured, nor of the differences of
temperature, of density, and of composition of the liquids em
ployed. I have endeavoured to guard against these causes of
error, and to obtain conclusive results by means of numerous
trials of sufficient duration.
   95. I procured cylinders of soft iron, taken from the same
bar, and about Om:027 in height and Om.02 in breadth. Four
tumblers were so arranged that the plane of their axes co
incided with that of the magnetic meridian and four others
arranged in a perpendicular direction. After having poured
into each of them a solution of sulphate of copper in layers of
equal depth, an iron cylinder was placed in the centre; and
the pole of an iron horseshoe magnet was then set on the
upper unsubmerged face. The four magnets, the strongest of
which carried about forty kilogrims, were distributed, one N.S.,
the second S.N., the third E.W., and the fourth W.E., with
relation to the north pole of the terrestrial magnetism; they
were separated, so as not to exert any reciprocal influence.
At the end of fifteen hours the deposits of copper on each
cylinder presented everywhere the same appearance and the
same consistence. The balance proved that they were all
nearly of an equal weight; the slight differences found, which
scarcely attained to one- or two-thousandths of the total quan
tity of copper reduced, are explained by the inequality of
development and cleanness of the surfaces of the eight cylin
ders. The experiment was repeated a great number of times
with solutions of copper more or less pure, and more or less
concentrated, without the general result varying.
   96. I will further cite the following experiment, which led
to the same conclusions. Twelve iron cylinders were distri
buted in pairs, in six distinct vessels containing a solution of
iron-alum as neutral as possible. The pairs of cylinders of
the second, third, fourth and fifth vessels, were placed in con
tact with the poles of four electro-magnets, the first of which
has been already described (86); the second is capable of car
 .#     sixty kilogrims; the third at least forty, and the last more
than 280. They were in other respects arranged as in the
cases before described (95), and their poles were covered with a
plate of mica. Lastly, the current of a battery of forty Bunsen's
pairs was passed, so as to decompose the liquid by passing
across the interval between each couple of cylinders, at the

266      Prof. E. Wartmann's third Memoir on Induction.
same time setting the electro-magnet in action. The current
went from north to south between the non-magnetized cylin
ders of the first vessel; then from north to south between
those of the second vessel and the axis of the electro-magnet;
then from west to east and from east to west, through the
liquid and the axes of the magnets of the third and fourth
vessels; then from south to north between the cylinders and
in the axis of the magnet of the fifth ; lastly, from south to
north in the last vessel between its cylinders removed from all
magnetic atmosphere. Weighings made with very delicate
balances showed that the deposits of oxide of iron on the ne
gative cylinders were not at all affected by the magnetism.
The mean weight of these deposits, estimated, after having
heated them to above 212° F., was 1.3 gramme.
    97. Those authors who have treated of the question of the
influence of magnets, have often confounded the part which
they may play in chemical actions with that which they exer
cise in phaenomena of molecular arrangements and of crystal
lization. I think I have proved that their part is null in the
first case, but I do not deny its existence in the second. Every
new arrangement in the particles of a body must be influenced
by the magnet if it is accompanied by a disengagement of
dynamic electricity, a more frequent circumstance perhaps
than is generally supposed”.
   98. My experiments, which are new in their arrangement
and the power of the magnets employed, invalidate therefore
the opinion of Von Arnim f, J. W. Ritterf, Ludickeš, Masch
   * A reservation must however be made for the modifications of mole
cular equilibrium which the changes of condition occasion. Thus the
fusion of solids and the solidification of liquids do not liberate more elec
tricity than the evaporation of pure water or the liquefaction of vapours
chemically neutral. Any one may convince himself of this by placing in
a horizontal glass tube a leaden cylinder, the extremities of which are con
nected with those of a good rheometer, and by effecting the fusion of the
metal or its solidification by a requisite elevation or lowering of tempera
ture. Another experiment consists in filling a platina crucible with melted
wax, in which is suspended a great quantity of plumbago. In the midst
of this conducting mass is immersed a platinum rod, isolated in its centre
by a covering of glass, and the lower extremity of which is naked only for
an extremely small length. The rheometric wire communicating on the
one part with the crucible, and on the other with the projecting head of
the rod, the wax may be melted or be allowed to congeal without any cur
rent resulting.

between the various results he has obtained with iron wires supported by
the poles of a magnet and submitted to a chemical action. He finds that
in a solution of crystals of sulphate of copper, the copper is reduced in
greater abundance around the north pole, whilst in the acidulated water
the volume of hydrogen liberated is always more considerable at the south
pole. Won Arnim, at the end of the last century, asserted that the north
pole of a magnet is oxidized more in water than the south pole. ... Ritter
subsequently maintained the opposite opinion; but notwithstanding his

, 99. I have had, occasion to observe, in the preceding expe
riments, a phaenomenon of rotation which merits to be noticed,
not only as a new confirmation of the theory of Ampère, but
also on account of the relations which it may have with the
facts which will be stated in the following paragraph. . .
     100. If, after having caused two soft iron cylinders to adhere
to the poles of a horseshoe magnet, these cylinders are im
 mersed in a solution of sulphate of copper contained in a vessel
 of any form and protected from vibration, we perceive, at the
end of a few minutes, when the deposit of reduced copper is
already quite visible, a double current established in the mass
of the liquid. This current often affects much more the lower
than the upper molecules; sometimes, according to the den
sity of the fluid and the state of its surface, it is only established
 in its interior.          In order to be able to examine it well, the
liquid mass must be illuminated, either directly or by means
of mirrors or refractors. A convenient arrangement consists
in placing this mass in a glass vessel with smooth sides, and
 illuminating it in the dark chamber by a bundle of solar light.
 The tint of this bundle may be varied from red to violet, by
interposing in its course coloured media, or by refracting it by
a prism, without the phaenomenon being modified. The
movement is rendered perceptible from the displacement of
the particles suspended in the liquid; if the latter is perfectly
limpid, it is not observed. It is easily produced by employing
a concentrated solution of sulphate of copper, from which
some small particles of oxide have been precipitated by a few
drops of potassa; these particles remain in suspension. This
current ceases at the end of a longer or shorter time, with the
chemical action which gives rise to it, when the quantities of
copper deposited and of iron dissolved have reached a certain
relation. It does not occur in solutions of subacetate of lead,
of iron-alum, of triple sulphate of copper, zinc and iron, what
ever pains are taken to establish in their interior precipitates
of oxide, or to add to them light powders. Sometimes it lasts
for more than two hours. Pure water, rendered slightly opa
line by particles of oxide of copper, presents no movement.
     101. The current is never produced except under the influ
ence of the magnet. Soft iron cylinders immersed in sulphate
of copper are of themselves incapable of producing it; they
only acquire this power when magnetism is induced in them.
If an electro-magnet be employed, the rotation varies with the
direction of the electric current. It takes place circularly or
elliptically around each magnetic pole, and is directed like the

        Prof. E. Wartmann's third Memoir on Induction.              269
current of Ampère. It goes therefore from north to south
by the west around the north pole, or that by which the cur
rent of the battery enters, and from north to south by the east
around the south pole, or that which communicates with the
zinc of the Bunsen’s apparatus (fig. 9). In general it does
not appear to be more rapid near the cylinders than at a cer
tain distance. It is especially apparent between them, but
it also exists at a tolerable distance from the centres.         I have
more than once seen the velocity vary in an intermittent man
ner, as if it had to overcome passing obstacles.
    102. The theory of these rotations is easily suggested.
When we immerse a bar of iron in a solution of sulphate of
copper, the electro-chemical action determines in the liquid
an electric current, which proceeds from the peripheric parts
to those immediately around the cylinder, in the direction of
the prolonged radii of the latter. This may be convincingly
shown with a good rheometer, the extremities of which, of
thick well-polished platinum wire, are placed alternately, the
one near the iron, the other toward the margin of the vessel
which contains the solution. This current is analogous to one
passed into a metallic ring full of mercury, which would tend,
radiating towards the centre, to issue by a conductor placed
perpendicularly to the surface. An external horizontal cur
rent, and near the vessel, would, according to its own direc
tion, cause the mercury to rotate to the right or to the left.
 In our experiment the magnet is substituted for the horizontal
 Current.
    103. A chemical action is therefore necessary, and proceed
ing from currents of a certain intensity, for the double polary
rotation to take place. The liquids cited as not producing it
in a certain manner, evidently did not fulfill this condition:
 they did not possess a requisite relation of energy between the
 electric currents and the magnetization. I attribute the ob
 served variations in the force of the electric current, and con
 sequently of the velocity of rotation, to variations in the play
 of the affinities between the iron, all the molecules of which
 are not equally acted upon, and the liquid, the composition
 of which changes incessantly. The reduced copper, even
 upon polished cylinders, is always striated; it is not deposited
 therefore in a uniform manner and without intermittence.
 The temperature, by influencing either the chemical action or
 the viscosity of the liquid, is perhaps not wholly without in
 fluence upon the rapidity of the rotation. Moreover, it will
 be conceived that this latter becomes visible only when it is
 communicated to solid matter on which the light is reflected *.
    * It is evident, that in employing very intense chemical actions, this

    104. The phaenomenon which I now propose to describe
 is not the result of an inductive action, I however mention it
 here on account of the connection which it appears to me to
 have with the preceding facts.
    105. The sulphates of copper of commerce vary much in
 purity. Amongst others, there is one which, when dissolved in
 common water, gives a greenish opaline liquid, which becomes
 blue and limpid by filtration. If a soft iron cylinder is placed
 in this solution, we perceive, as soon as its contour is reddened
 by the deposit of copper, very minute filaments, of a pale blue,
 produced radiating all around its immersed surface. These
 filaments increase rapidly in number and dimensions. They
 soon attain forty to sixty millimetres in length, and then pre
 sent the appearance of stamens with corrugated filaments, ter
 minated by heads or elongated anthers, distributed over a very
 regular circumference (fig. 10). The development of this
 curious figure depends on the concentration of the liquid, the
 capacity of the vessel which contains it, and perhaps on other
 causes, such as the differences of density between the upper
 and lower layers produced by the substitution of the sulphate
 of iron for the sulphate of copper, the increase in density of
 the surface layers owing to evaporation, &c. Be this as it may,
 the relative opacity of the heads contrasts with the limpidity
of the liquid around the iron. When the decrease in the
amount of copper has reached a certain limit, indicated by the
grass-green tint which the solution takes, the deposit agglo
 merates gradually and subsides to the bottom of the vessel,
 which it had not before done, and the reaction is terminated.
    106. The phaenomenon becomes more instructive when
manifested under the action of two centres (fig. 11). Then
the rays which diverge arrive perpendicularly one against
another, following the line of the shortest distance. Beyond
that, they meet following directions more and more oblique.
They never invade each other's domain : they are devoid of
any power of penetrating into the interstices of each other.
These domains are separated by a perfectly straight line,
which intersects rectangularly the middle of the line of the
smallest interval. The rays which, from one part and another,
stop at this right line, there undergo an inflexion, the more
simple or double rotation is easily obtained. We may thus, as Mr. Grove
has told me he had repeated it, cause little cork boats to circulate around
a bar of iron suspended to a powerful magnet, and immersed in dilute
sulphuric acid, &c.    I am told that Mr. Christie had also noticed this ro
tation, but I believe his observation is unpublished. (October 1.)

sensible as it takes place at a less distance from the others,
and resemble more or less decided hyperbolic arcs. The
figure is of a truly geometric symmetry.                                 -
    107. With three centres placed on the summits of an equi
lateral triangle (fig. 12), the dividing right lines proceed from
an internal point situated at an equal distance from the sum
mits, and are prolonged perpendicularly to the three sides of
the triangle which are here the lines of the least interval. The
divergent rays in two directions curve in a very marked man
ner. For the rest, the figure which they produce is perfectly
symmetrical.                                                         -
    108. The radiations which appear to render visible the lines
according to which the affinities are developed, are not sen
sibly altered by magnetism; this is at least the result of an
experiment unfortunately unique. But availing ourselves of
the attraction which causes the cylinders to adhere to the
arms of a magnet to give them a moderate motion of transla
tion, we see the whole figure, and especially the dividing line
which constitutes the most marked part of it, transferred also
without any alteration of form. A vibration, a sudden trans
fer, detaches, on the contrary, the solid particles which were
geometrically grouped: they are precipitated to the bottom,
and all is spoiled.
    109. I suppose these particles to consist of a sub-sulphate
of copper*; but I have not been able to collect a sufficient
quantity of it to subject it to analysis. I propose however to
publish soon a new series of researches on this interesting
subject,
§ XIII. Is there any reaction between currents of induction and
                     continuous electric currents+?
    110. The apparatus which has served for the examina
tion of this question is an electric machine constructed by
M. Bonijol. On its reel are coiled two copper wires; one
which makes 200 turns is traversed by the inductor current;
the other, which is finer, forming 3400 revolutions, is the
seat of the currents induced by the rapid alternatives of
opening and breaking of the circuit of its neighbour. This

in diameter, in which may be fixed a bundle of soft iron wires,
or a hollow cylinder of iron plate furnished externally with
similar wires.
    111. It is especially in valuing the heating effects of which
the induced currents are capable, that we seek to resolve the
proposed problem. After having placed in the circuit of the
 long wire Breguet's thermometer (4. c.), and having deter
mined the number of alternate induced currents, which in the
unit of time give the maximum of heating, an hydro-electric
current was passed into the wire and into the thermometer.
 The inductor current was that of five large pairs of Daniell

 ( 112. The following results were obtained:—
    a. The calorific effect of the currents of induction is more
considerable when the bundle of wires is placed in the helix
than when the hollow cylinder is employed : the latter being
removed, the temperature again decreases.
    b. The result does not vary whether the induced wire is or
is not traversed by a constant current.
    c. The elevation of temperature of the thermometer pro
duced by a continuous and constant current, which traverses
a wire formed into a helix, is independent of the presence or
absence of bundles of soft iron wires, solid or hollow, placed
within it.
    113. I have had constructed a large pair, of bismuth and
soft iron, O"2 long, and the square section of which is Om'022
at the side.   The free extremities of these metals were bound
to a thermo-electric rheometer (46) by a wire long enough
for the instrument to be protected from all magnetic induc
tion.
    114. No appreciable current was produced on placing the
pair in the large helix (3), and developing in it an intense
electro-magnetic state with a Bunsen's battery of twenty
elements.
    115. The soft iron of the couple was enveloped in an iso
lated copper wire. Then, after having heated its solder to a
constant temperature and determined the force of the thermo
electric current produced, a hydro-electric current was passed
into the wire. The deviation of the rheometer did not vary,
notwithstanding the electro-magnetic state induced in the

        XLV. On the Chemical Composition of Gun-Cotton.
 By Messrs. Robert PorreTT and E. F. Tesch EMACHER+.
    N the paper from Mr. Teschemacher read before the So
       ciety on the 2nd of November, the composition of gun
 cotton,    as deduced from careful synthetical experiments, was
 as follows:—                                                        -
        39'25 of cotton deprived of its constitutional water.
        60-75 of dry nitric acid.
       100'00
    We have now to show that this composition agrees very
 closely with the following formula, which we have obtained
 from the analytical experiments that will form an important .
 part of the present communication.
    The formula in question is as follows:—C, H, O,4-4NO,

     -                                                  100
    This, it will be seen, very nearly agrees with Mr. Tesche
macher’s synthetical result. We have therefore taken the
composition of nitrated lignin in all our experiments as iden
tical with that of gun-cotton.
    Having by preliminary trials ascertained that with certain
precautions those products might be evolved without danger
and collected in close vessels, we proceed to state that our
method consisted in introducing the charge of gun-cotton
into a thin glass tube of about the diameter of a goose-quill,
7 inches in length, closed at one end, and bent at the other
so as to be conveniently introduced under a glass receiver
filled with and inverted over mercury, whilst the principal
part of the tube was held in a horizontal position; the gun
cotton was exploded by heat externally applied by means of
a spirit-lamp with a very small wick to the part of the charge
in the fore part of the tube, so that its combustion proceeded
backwards until the whole was consumed. The portion of
the glass tube which is introduced into the mercury should

be bent at such an angle as to prevent any of the mercury
entering the tube previous to combustion, and the combus
tion must be continuous, which is readily effected by carefull
applying the heat backwards as the cotton is ignited. Wit
these precautions, the evolution of the gas was not attended
with any such violence as to interfere with its collection, nor
was any portion of the charge thrown out unconsumed,
which would have been the case had the heat been applied
to the hinder portion first. Having collected a sufficient
quantity of the gas, we passed up into it, first a little caustic
potash, which absorbed the carbonic acid mixed with cya
nogen gas, and then green sulphate of iron, which took up
the nitric oxide; the remaining gas was mixed with half its
bulk of oxygen gas, and exploded in a detonating tube, show
ing the quantity of carbonic oxide present; the remaining
gas after the separation of the carbonic acid thus formed was
considered as nitrogen.
   Some of these constituents were unexpected by us, espe
cially the cyanogen; its presence however was fully proved,
as we succeeded in forming prussian blue with it. The quan
tity of mixed gases obtained from 52-33 grs, of gun-cotton
measured 100 cubic inches; these mixed gases have the fol

Showing in the analytical result a loss of about 7 per cent.
of oxygen and a gain of about 5 per cent, upon the carbon
and nitrogen taken together. We have not been able to make
these discrepancies disappear, but have no doubt that they
result from the difficulties of the experiments, necessarily
performed on very small quantities, and multiplied when
brought out by calculation as 100 grains.
   It occurred to us as being very desirable to add to the
gun-cotton some oxidizing agent in sufficient quantity to fur
mish the necessary oxygen for the complete combustion of all
the elements of the gun-cotton; we tried chlorate of potash
with this view; we could not however get the cotton to com
bine with as much as we desired from an aqueous solution of
the chlorate, so as to adhere to the gun-cotton uniformly; but
a combustion effected with 1 gr. of the cotton with 0.4 gr.
of chlorate, and by treating the residue in the tube with a fur
ther portion of chlorate, gave us the following result:-

   Water    .   .   . O’200 ...
                      0.996 ...
which differs but little from the result obtained by the im
perfect combustion, and agrees completely as far as the nitro
gen is concerned.
   Since reading this paper an article has appeared in the
 Comptes Rendus of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, dated
23rd November 1846, that Messrs. Fordos and Gelis had ob
tained from gun-cottom a cyanic compound ; this tends to
confirm our discovery of the presence of cyanogen among the
gaseous products.
   A view may be taken of the composition of gun-cotton
agreeing with the ultimate results, but arranging the elements
differently, by subtracting 1 atom of oxygen from the nitric
acid and adding it to the lignin; gun-cotton would then be
formed of nitrous acid + oxide of lignin; this new oxide may
possess alkaline properties, and thus account for the singular
fact of the non-acidity of gun-cotton: we intend to try if we
can establish this composition by experiment.
   We have tried the action of a small galvanic battery in de
composing the gun-cotton, but without any decided results;
on the first vigorous action of the battery, reddened litmus
paper was made blue in the negative cell, but as the power
of the battery subsided this effect disappeared. As the result
of several trials, it does not appear that gun-cotton is suscep
tible of explosion by the discharge from a Leyden phial.
   In conclusion, we think proper to express our dissent
from the mechanical view taken by Mr. Crum of the nature
of gun-cotton. He considers that the tubular structure which
the microscope developes in cotton accounts for the admission
of nitric acid into its vessels, but does not explain why it
should not get out again on washing; and he thinks that the
preservation of its fibrous organization is inconsistent with
its chemical combination with nitric acid.      Now the fact is,
that when cotton is immersed in a mixture of equal measures
of sulphuric and nitric acids it combines with the latter only,
to the exclusion of the former, which shows a peculiar affinity
inconsistent with any mechanical view of the action.

XLVI. Microscopic Eramination of the Papillae and Nerves
   of the Tongueof the Frog, with Observations on the Mechanism
   of Taste.    By Augustus WALLER, M.D.”
                           [With a Plate.]
    HAVE described in some former observations the appear
     ances presented by the papillae, the vascular and muscular
parts of the frog's tongue. At present I propose to examine
it in reference to its functions as an organ of taste, and to study
those portions of it in particular which enable it to perform
its sensorial offices. As these are mainly carried on by means
of nerves distributed within it, which collect and convey to
the brain the gustatory impressions which are produced upon
its surface, our attention will be principally directed to the
ultimate ramifications of the nerves, and to the structure of
those parts whence the sensations arise. This investigation is
the more interesting from the circumstance of the minute
anatomy of the ultimate ramifications of the optic, auditory,
olfactory and the common sensitive nerves having been de
scribed with great care in man as well as the lower animals,
whereas the structure of the gustatory nerves has been as yet
unascertained. It is not from the unimportance of the subject
in the estimation of physiologists that such is the case, as it
presents some peculiarities with regard to its nervous struc
ture of great interest, but that the microscopic inspection of a
soft, fleshy and opake body, like the tongue in most animals,
offered greater obstacles than any of the other organs.
    Valentin states that he has been unable to obtain a distinct
view of the terminal plexus and loops of the nerves of the
tongue. Burdach, who has so carefully examined the nerves
 of the frog's tongue, makes nearly the same observation; for
 he expressly mentions that he was unable to examine the mu
 cous membrane of the upper surface of the tongue, on account
 of its thickness and opacity. I hope to succeed in demon
 strating that the organ of taste, far from being the most diffi
 cult to examine, is the most accessible, and that the beautiful
 and simple mechanism of taste may be followed in the depth
 of the tissues during the continuance of life.
    In briefly recapitulating the principal points that have al
 ready been ascertained respecting the structure and functions
 of the tongue, we find—
    1. That anatomists distinguish three kinds of elevations upon
 the human tongue, viz. the conical, the fungiform, and the lenti
 cular papillae. The conical papillae are the most numerous, the
 smallest, and the most liable to change under the influence of
                    * Communicated by the Author.

278        Dr. Waller's Microscopic Eramination of the
disease. The fungiform are larger, more red, nearly globular
in form, and supported by a stem which gives them the a
pearance of a mushroom or berry with its stalk. They are
much less numerous than the former, amongst which they are
interspersed. They exist in greater numbers at the tip and
borders of the tongue, where the sensation of taste is most
acute.     The . papillae are the largest, and are confined
to the base of the tongue, and are only about fifteen in number.
    2. In Berré's plates of microscopic anatomy, an injected
fungiform papilla is represented, which appears entirely com
posed of vascular coils arranged in nearly a globular shape.
Cruveilhier says, “Les papilles quihérissent la langue représent
le corps papillaire de la peau, a son summum de développe
ment. Elles reçoivent des nerfs. Haller les a poursuivis
jusque dans les papilles. Je les ai également suivis, mais sans
pouvoir déterminer comment elles se terminent.”
    3. Comparative anatomy shows the existence in the tongue
of most animals of the same kind of papillae as in man. Cuvier
(Anatomie Comparée) mentions, “Ce sont les papilles fongi
formes qui recoivent tous les filets nerveux qui sont assez gros
pour étre suivis à l’oeil nu, et cette circonstance jointe à celle
de la dureté des papilles coniques dans certains animaux nous
porte à croire que les fongiformes sont le siège principal du
gout.” Messrs. Todd and Bowman adopted the same opinion
from observing the extreme thinness of the epithelium over the
fungiform papillae, as compared with that which invests the
conical papillae”.
    4. The tongue in man is supplied by three pairs of nerves,
the hypoglossus, the glossopharyngeal and the gustatory, a
branch from the inferior maxillary. Numerous experiments
on the lower animals and pathological facts in man have shown,
that the first is the motory nerve of the tongue: much difference
of opinion exists with respect to the functions of the latter.
The experiments of Panizza would lead us to the conclusion
that the glossopharyngeal is the sole nerve of taste, but the
simple deductions of anatomy and the experiments of Longet
are in favour of a conjoint action of the two, the glosso
pharyngeal being the nerve of taste for the base of the tongue,
 and the gustatory that of the tip and anterior third of the
 Same.
    If we now come to the tongue of the frog, we find in it, after
it has been distended for the purpose of examination, the same
elements as we meet with in the human subject. The frame

 their work on Physiological Anatomy, which I regret having consulted too
 late to avail myself of in this paper.

           Papillae and Nerves of the Tongue of the Frog.       279
  work of it consists of two muscles, the thin and membranous
  hypoglossus duplex muscle, arising from the lower border
  of the hyoid bone and advancing upwards and outwards, its
  fibres expanding in a fan-like shape; and the genioglossus, an
  impair muscle of a triangular form, whose base is inserted to
  the apex of the lower jaw-bone, from whence it ascends and
  joins the inferior surface of the hypoglossus. This last is short
  and thick, and does not extend beyond the posterior half of
  the tongue. Numerous transverse fibres of a muscular nature
  form several layers, and tend to increase the strength of the
  tongue. As in man, these vessels and nerves are principally
  situate at the lower surface of the organ, which becomes up
  permost in this animal when spread out of the mouth. The
  upper surface is covered with a very thin membrane, nearly
  transparent like glass, with all the appearances and properties
  of cellular tissue. The lowermost, which is the papillary or
  gustatory surface, is much more thick and opake.
      The surface of the frog's tongue appears to the naked eye
  nearly smooth and constantly covered with mucus secreted
   upon it. When forcibly distended, it becomes sufficiently
   attenuated to allow of the passage of light, and we may then
   detect very minute elevations over the upper surface. By
   means of a simple microscope, we find that the apparent even
   ness arises merely from the minuteness of these bodies, and
   that it contains all the elements of the human tongue, with the
   exception of the lenticular papillae. Small bodies of a conical,
   filiform, or cylindrical shape, are seen over the greater part of
º
   it, corresponding to the papillae conicae in man. Among these
   are others, fewer in number, larger, mostly of a globular form,
   and most abundant towards the extremity of the tongue:
   these are the fungiform papillae. As in man, they are sup
   ported by a kind of neck or pedicel, which is narrower than
   their free extremity. Sometimes this pedicel disappears, owing
   frequently to the condition of forcible distension of the mem
   brane; the papillathen appears simplyglobular*. These papillae
   are those which to the naked eye resemble minute granulations
   slightly prominent above the rest of the membrane. They
   differ from the first-mentioned in another important feature,
   for they are found to contain a coil of blood-vessels, within
   which there is a very active circulation. The conical papillae
   offer nothing of the sort; numerous vessels ramify among
   them at their base, without any appearance of permeating
   within them. The simple lens is the best to employ when we.
   desire to trace the analogies between the organ in this animal
   and that of man; but when we wish to examine the papillae
                     * See Phil. Mag. vol. xxix. plate 1.

280      Dr. Waller's Microscopic Examination of the
more closely, we must use the higher powers of the compound
microscope, which the transparency of the membrane permits.
   The papillae conicae of the frog consist of small elevations
of an irregular form, dispersed over the whole surface of the
tongue. They may generally be regarded as consisting of
small cones or cylinders, two or more of which are joined by
a common stem to the mucous membrane. They are com
pletely covered with scales of epithelium, and frequently appear
to have small apertures upon their surface, as if leading to some
cavity within them. In some, this opening is a small elongated
depression at the apex of the papilla; in others it is sharp
and well-defined, and below it some scales of epithelium ap
pear lining the commencement of the papillary duct. When
the tongue is much distended, these papillae almost entirely
disappear, as if they were simply formed of rugae or folds of
the mucous membrane. They present no appearance of cir
culation. At different ages of the animal they vary considera
bly. In the young they are smaller and more transparent than
in those full-grown, where they are generally like truncated
cones, distinct from one another.     At their summit the elon
gated aperture already mentioned is generally seen.        In the
 Philosophical Magazine one of the most common appearances
of these papillae is represented.
   The fungiform papillae, which are so easily distinguished
from the former by their active circulation, deserve principally
to arrest our attention. The blood, which when seen with the
lower power appeared to move within a small cavity, without
being contained in any capillary, is found, on being subjected
to higher power, to circulate within the usual canals, which
are coiled up into a very small space, so as to cause the blood
to trace a very circuitous route before it is enabled to make
its exit. The exact course which it takes may often be traced
where the circulation is languid, by the gradual progress of the
blood-discs.     The coil is connected with two and sometimes
with three small vessels, which supply it with blood. No dif
ference can be detected between these supplying vessels, either
with regard to calibre or thickness. They are to be considered
as part of the capillary network, and they are often seen to
convey the blood in opposite directions, when watched for a
few minutes. In most instances the supplying vessels arrive
from opposite points, and the circular papilla appears nearly
on a level with the rest of the membrane; but in others the
papilla is like a gourd or wide-necked flask with the larger end
pendent and free. The vessels then run close together, tra

        Papillae and Nerves of the Tongue of the Frog.         281
   The nerves are derived from two pairs, the first of which
traverse a foramen together with the vagus at the base of the
cranium, between the occipital and sphenoid bones. The
second arise from the first cervical nerves, and traverse the
foramen between the first and second vertebrae of the neck.
Both pairs make a curve which is directed forwards and
downwards, and descend nearly in a parallel direction to the
hyoid bone, from whence they ascend to the concavity of
the lower maxillary and enter the tongue, where their main
trunks, much diminished in size, may be traced to the two
tubercles at its extremity. The cervical nerves, which at their
commencement are nearly on the median line, and are internal
to the cranial pair at their origin, retain the same relative
position until they enter the tongue, where they begin to ra
mify, the two cranial nerves then becoming external. The
cranial nerve in its passage to the inferior maxillary bone tra
verses the posterior belly of the digastricus, descends until it
reaches the hyoid bone, when passing under the middle and
over its great cornua, situate either beneath or by the side of
the hypoglossus muscle, continues in that position until it enters
the tongue, without giving off any branches to the muscles of
the neck. The cervical nerve follows nearly the same direc
tion until it reaches the hyoid bone under which it passes,
and likewise places itself under the hypoglossus muscle, pene
trating with the latter into the tongue, accompanied closely by
the lingual arteries and veins. It supplies numerous branches
to the muscles of the throat and neck.        This nerve is much
more considerable than the former, and is much more curved.
The fifth pair or trifacial sends branches to the mucous mem
brane of the mouth, which appear to reach the posterior part
of the tongue, but it gives off no nerves to that organ, corre
sponding to the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary.
    Notwithstanding the transparency of the tongue when in a
 state of distension, we find considerable difficulty in tracing
the ramification of its nervous trunks within the parenchyma.
 At the upper surface, where they are most superficial, we may
under favourable circumstances, with the simple microscope,
be enabled to follow the various ramifications of a large branch
to a considerable extent, but we are unable either to command
a general view of the distribution of a single trunk, or of
distinguishing with any degree of certainty the ramifications
of one pair from another.
    The best mode to examine the nerves in the dead animal is
 to disarticulate the lower jaw-bone on one side, and to divide
 the throat on that side sufficiently to allow the jaw to be turned
completely backwards. The passage of these nerves may be

282       Dr. Waller's Microscopic Eramination of the
followed from their exit from the cranium and spine, until their
immersion into the tongue. After removing the mucous mem
 brane of the surface, we may easily trace, by means of the scal
pel, with the naked eye the distribution of the principal trunks
nearly on the median line, giving off numerous branches, and
 finally proceeding much diminished in size nearly to the two
tubercles on each side. By immersion in alcohol or naphtha,
the nerves become whiter and still more distinct.    The cervical
and cranial pairs then appear unconnected with each other
during their course; and Burdach is of opinion that no com
munication is ever found to exist between these two pairs of
nerves, the first of which he terms the hypoglossus, and re
gards as a pure motor nerve, and the other the glossopha
ryngeal, which he looks upon as destined entirely to the mu
cous membrane.
    My observations do not allow me to adopt this opinion
entirely, as I have seen with the naked eye and with the mi
croscope numerous communications, almost of a plexiform na
ture, between these trunks at their entrance into the tongue.
I have therefore preferred to adopt the terms of cranial and
cervical pairs, which are independent of all theoretical ideas.
I consider the cervical as destined principally to the muscles,
and the cranial to the mucous membrane, where I shall pre
sently describe them. When the muscles have been divested
of their papillary membrane, we are able to trace without diffi
culty, the various ramifications and nervous loops among the
muscular fibres, where we see the nervous fibres nearly reduced
to a single tubule, forming numerous loops or meshes, running
either across or parallel to the striated muscular fibres. These
nervous trunks and fibres appear all to be derived from the
cervical nerve. Instead of completely removing the mucous
membrane, which often renders the examination difficult,
from the blood which issues from the divided vessel, we may
remove a small portion of the membrane, which when done b
tearing it away, will frequently be unattended by loss of j
The surface thus exposed is usually found covered with a dense
plexus of nervous ramifications, which appears to belong to the
muscular system. Sometimes in spreading out the tongue
we separate from it a kind of investing sac of cellular tissue,
nearly as transparent as glass. The microscope detects in
this numerous muscular fibres, generally accompanied with
nerves and capillary vessels. The nervous fibres are usually
accompanied with a satellite capillary vessel closely joined to
them. To complete this brief account of the microscopic
muscular appearances, I will mention that the circulation may
be easily observed in these muscular capillaries, and that a

        Papillae and Nerves of the Tongue of the Frog.        283
muscular contraction produces a constant acceleration of the
blood, if previously stagnating in them. I have not detected
any valves in these capillaries; such as are seen in some of the
larger veins of the frog's tongue. Muscular striae may be seen
at the upper and lower surfaces of the tongue, through the layer
of epithelium and cellular tissue. The contraction of the mus
cular fibres may be frequently observed, either uncovered or
through the epithelium. I have examined them sometimes in
an animal under the influence of strychnia; in none of these
cases have I found either the zigzags described by Dumas and
Prevost as characteristic of muscular contractions, or the ap
proximation of the transverse striae, as described by more re
cent observers.
   To return to the nervous fibres. Burdach has employed
another means of unveiling the distribution of the nerves, which
consists in immersing the tongue for a few minutes in a solu
tion of potassa, in the proportion of three or four drops of alkali
to an ounce of water. By this method the membrane of the
back of the tongue becomes rapidly converted into a transparent
viscous substance like the white of egg, which is easily removed,
leaving the subjacent parts nearly unaffected. By compressing
the tongue between two pieces of glass, we may trace the dis
tribution of all the principal nervous branches of the organ.
 The four nervous trunks advance forwards in a parallel direc
 tion to the tubercular extremity, giving off numerous branches
on their external sides, which branches subdivide and ramify
towards the borders of the organ. On their internal sides they
give off no branches, and appear to have no anastomoses one
with another.     The same unilateral ramification is observed
with regard to the vascular canals, and may in a great measure
be accounted for by considering, that as they and the nerves
are all near the median line of the tongue, the parts to be sup
plied are placed to the right and left sides of this line, and the
nervous and vascular trunks are only in proportion to the parts
to be supplied.
    The cervical nerves are seen to form numerous plexiform
anastomoses between their various branches, and to distribute
frequent loops composed of nearly single fibres among the
muscular parts. The cranial pair ramify in a unilateral man
ner until they attain the tubercular extremity, where branches
are given off on each side of the main trunks: Burdach states
that this nerve presents no plexiform arrangement like the
former, that a few of its fibres at the extremities form curves
or arches, but that generally they terminate abruptly in a bush
like manner, hence his term “terminaison en buisson.”            In
describing his process, Burdach has not concealed its defects in

 284        Dr. Waller's Microscopic Eramination of the
 destroying the papillary surface of the organ; and also he com
 mits the mistake of regarding the papillae as glandular bodies,
 as we may see by the following passages. “There are con
 siderable difficulties, even in the frog, in recognizing the course
 of the nerves in the interior of the tongue; for independently
 of the thick layer of mucus secreted on its surface, this organ
 is obscured by a multitude of granules or opake knots, globular
 in form, which are doubtless mucous glands; and likewise by
 numerous canals, variously twisted, of a thickness nearly equal
 to gºinth of a line, which appear to be filled with corpuscles re
 sembling the blood-discs, and which are either canals to convey
 the mucus, or lymphatic vessels; and lastly by numerous blood
 vessels. Therefore we soon become convinced of the impossi
 bility of distinguishing anything without the employment of
 artificial means . . . . . . . . . . An impossibility already ex
 perienced by Valentin and which my own researches have con
 firmed . . . . . . . . . . All chemical substances, whatever they
 may be, when applied during the life of the animal on the sur
 face of the tongue, have always produced an increase in the
 afflux of the blood to the organ, and have still more injured its
 transparency *.”
    In order to detect the real extremities of these nervous fila
 ments, we have but to examine with care the papillary surface
 of the frog's tongue. If this is well extended and not over-in
jected with stagnant blood, we shall have no difficulty in dis
 cerning, at the base of each fungiform papilla, a dark gray
 spot formed by a nerve nearly the size of a capillary vessel.
 In fig. 1 we have a very correct representation of a papilla as
it appears in a favourable subject. The nerve, of which we
 see a portion, pursues a very winding course. Near the base
of the pedicel of the papilla it is usually twisted, as is repre
sented, into a kind of loose knot composed of several loops.
This spot is the darkest portion of the nerve, and is to be seen
in most of the fungiform papillae. From this point the fibres
ascend apparently less numerous, and accompany the blood
vessels in their numerous gyrations within the papilla. By
reason of the darkness and opacity of the blood-vessels the
numerous convolutions are generally concealed, and it is only
at the intervals between the coils that we are enabled to detect
the nervous tubes. The principal varieties which I have had
occasion to remark with respect to these papillary nerves, are
that sometimes the efferent and afferent capillaries run close
together joined to the nerves, which in that case are in a great
measure concealed. Sometimes the nerve, like the blood-vessels,

         Papillae and Nerves of the Tongue of the Frog.        285
arises from two branches which converge near the papilla as
if they were afferent and efferent. It will be preferable that the
blood should be found circulating in the papilla, in order to
detect more readily the papillary nerve. In cases where the
animal has been killed by strychnia, I have always found these
nerves more easily distinguishable, as if this substance exerted
some effect on the constitution of the nervous system.
   I considered it important to determine whether any vesicular
matter existed in the papilla, such as has been described to
exist at the extremities of some of the nerves of sensation.    In
one or two instances I have distinguished some granular matter,
but in most cases I have not been able, whether from its non
existence or from its being hidden by the engorged vascular
coil, to detect the slightest trace of it.
   Besides these nerves of the fungiform papillae, there exist
others which are spread over the lower surface of the tongue.
They consist of nearly simple nervous fibres, forming a kind
of network under the mucous membrane.           This nervous net
work corresponds to the capillary network distributed to the
mucous membrane, in the same manner as the nervous papil
lary coil corresponds to the vascular one. During winter the
epithelium of the frog's tongue becomes thinner and more
transparent, and the animal is also in an anaemic condition,
from which causes the vessels of the tongue are but very slowly
engorged; these cases are therefore the most suitable for the
inspection of the nerves.
    Tongue of the Toad.—The toad's tongue presents very close
analogies to that of the frog. I have already described in this
journal the slight differences which distinguish them from
each other. I shall now merely state what a further investiga
tion has shown me with respect to their nervous structure and
papillae. The difficulty of procuring these animals in the
winter has prevented mythorough examination of the distribu
tion of the nervous trunks of their central parts, but as far as
 I have examined I find a similar distribution to those in the
frog. The toad's tongue is less extensible and more thick
 than that of the frog, and for that reason it is necessary to
 select a very small animal for microscopic examination. The
 nervous trunks which ramify in the muscles and accompany
 the vessels appear to be more numerous than in the frog. The
 muscular striae are more distinct, and the fibres are arranged
 more like separate muscles. The papillae conicae, or rather
 those that correspond to them, may be compared in general to
 irregular folds or plaits of the intestines; others are like small
 cylindrical villi; while some fewer are convex elevations, with
 a very small dark circular foramen in the centre and a passage
 leading perpendicularly within them.

 286      Dr. Waller's Microscopic Eramination of the
    The fungiform papillae do not generally project upwards,
 but consist of a circular area containing a vascular coil and
 surrounded by an elevated rim of the mucous membrane.
 Scales of epithelium cover the papillae conicae, but the mucous
 membrane is generally too opake to admit of the circulation of
 the blood being clearly distinguished, except at the neuro
 vascular papillae, where it is seen in the coil and at numerous
 spots about the size of Tlo", where the mucous membrane
 appears to be removed, so as to expose fully the capillary cir
 culation beneath.    On these spots the forms of the blood
globules are so distinct as to give the appearance of not being
 confined in a vascular tube. The blood frequently stagnates
 at these points, or bursts through and is effused in small
 quantities over the papillary surface, where the separate glo
 bules may be seen to oscillate, evidently under the influence of
 the cilia spread over the surface.   In favourable cases nervous
 filaments may be traced into the vascular area, similar to those
 of the frog, forming a knot, which afterwards gives off filaments
 accompanying the vascular coil.
    These papillae and their nerves were most clearly displayed
in a toad not half-grown, which had been kept prisoner the
whole of the winter.     From some accidental cause it had been
injured, which had produced great emaciation, and finally oc
 casioned its death.   When examined life was extinct, but the
muscles were flaccid and circulation of blood existed in the
 tongue. This organ was beautifully transparent; the papillae
conicae were as before described; some of the neuro-vascular
 papillae had a circular area with coils; others, mostly confined
to the extremity of the tongue, consisted of nearly globular
 transparent vesicles, projecting above the membrane and con
nected with it by a very narrow neck containing two capillary
 vessels and a nerve. Near the point of insertion of the vesicle
to the membrane a nervous knot was seen, from whence nume
rous nervous fibres proceeded up the pedicel into the vesicular
cavity. Numerous similar vesicles existed at the tubercles,
where they formed nearly a continuous row, the transparency
of the membrane allowing the nervous filaments which supplied
them to be traced backward to the main trunk, which they
joined at an acute angle. The vascular coil could likewise be
followed to similar venous and arterial trunks, closely accom
panying the nerve. . This beautiful arrangement may be aptly
compared to a bunch of currants, each currant representing a
vesicle with its internal coil, and its pedicel to the vasculo
nervous neck of the papilla. As all the papillary nerves joined
the main trunk at acute angles, we may easily figure to our
selves the appearance of the termination of the filaments of
the cranial nerve, as mentioned by Burdach, by stripping off

        Papillae and Nerves of the Tongue of the Frog.         287
the currants and leaving the principal stalk with their project
ing pedicels.
   Physiological action of the Tongue.-Thefungi form or neuro
vascular papillae are the parts which more especially deserve
our attention, as their structural arrangement points them out
as being evidently the principal if not the sole organs of taste
in the tongue. Considered under the simplest point of view,
they may be regarded as hollow vesicles, containing a coil of
nerves and blood-vessels within them, and when a liquid is
brought in contact with its external membrane, its thinness
causes it to be rapidly permeated by the sapid substance which
then comes in immediate contact with the nerve where the
sensation of taste is created. The capillary coil then by its
internal current and its extensive surface, rapidly carries it
away and leaves the nerve free to receive a fresh impression. In
analysing this mechanism, we may for convenience distinguish
three separate periods or stages. In the first the body per
meates the vesicular membrane; in the second it comes in con
tact with the nerve and produces an impression which is con
veyed to the brain; in the third this substance is eliminated
from the cavity and from the nerve. The first is a well-known
 property of all animal membranes, of allowing themselves to
be traversed by the various liquid and gaseous substances with
which they are in contact. We have an instance of this when
venous blood contained in a bladder and exposed to the air or
immersed in water containing air in solution, becomes crimson
from the passage of the oxygen through the membrane into
 the blood. A similar action takes place when various other
 liquids and gases are separated from each other by an organic
 membrane. Acetic acid applied to the tongue of the frog over a
 blood-vessel filled with stagnating blood, destroys its red colour
 and dissolves the tunic of the vesicles in the same way as when it
 is applied to blood taken from the vessels. A still more notable
 example is presented by the branchiae of the tadpole, which may
 be observed during life. There the blood is perceived circulating
 with great rapidity in the capillary vessels, and separated from
 the surrounding water by a verythin membrane. Nevertheless
 in virtue of the permeability of this membrane, a constant cur
 rent exists which causes the oxygen in the water to be absorbed
 by the blood, and the carbonic acid of the blood to pass into
 the water. In this manner the respiration of the animal is
 effected. The rate at which a membrane is traversed by a
 liquid is ceteris paribus in proportion to the thinness of the
 membrane. At the branchial surface it is extremely thin, on
 account of the distinctness with which the globules of the blood
 appear through it. For the same reason, it is evident that the

288      Dr. Waller's Microscopic Examination of the
membraneofthepapilla, being also verythin, is easily permeated.
On the contrary, the thickness of the epithelial scales over the
rest of the surface indicates that there the same action is com
paratively very feeble and slow. It is necessary for a substance
to be in a state of solution before it is capable of traversing a
membrane, for if merely suspended or floating in a liquid its
progress is completely arrested by the membrane. The same
remark also applies to the organ of taste, which is only capa
ble of receiving an impression from a body which can be dis
solved in the saliva, or is already in a state of solution.
   To further accelerate the passage through the membrane,
the body when placed in contact with the vesicle is subjected
to a certain amount of pressure by means of the application of
the tongue to the roof of the mouth. The effect of pressure
in increasing the action of absorption is well-known from
numerous facts; its influence in the action of taste is shown
by the feebleness of the sensation generally caused by a body
when merely applied on the surface of the tongue, compared
to the acuteness of perception which ensues on its being com
pressed between the tongue and the palate. If the surface of
the palate had been entirely smooth, the amount of pressure
thus sustained by a substance in a liquid or a pulpy state would
be very small, but by the existence of small folds and transverse
depressions on its surface the body to be tasted becomes
lodged and fixed between them, and thus exposed to a much
greater amount of pressure. The importance of this com
pression of sapid substances receives additional evidence from
the fact that the gustatory membrane is invariably disposed in
a manner to ensure their compression; and that the soft palate,
which likewise has the power of taste, may be regarded as
squeezing the sapid substance when passing from the throat into
the stomach.
   When the substance is perfectly insoluble, the only sensa
tion of its presence is of a tactile nature, like that of the hand,
which enables us to appreciate the size, form, degree of re
sistance and temperature of the body. The resemblance of
the papillae conicae to the papillae of the organs of touch,
render it very probable that they are destined for the same
purposes and fulfill the same functions. The areolar network
of the nervous fibres at the base of these papillae is very similar
to the terminations of the nerves in the skin, and tends to con
firm the idea of the tactile nature of the papillae conicae.
Supposing all impressions to arise from a molecular pertur
bation of the ultimate nervous fibres, the agent in this case,
which causes the perturbation, is either simple mechanical
contact or caloric. Neither of these agents is liable to accu

         Papillae and Nerves of the Tongue of the Frog.         289
mulate around the peripheric extremities of the nerve, like
a chemical substance; it is therefore a matter of no surprise
that these nerves are not surrounded by so rich a vascular ex
pansion. Nay, further, with respect to the action of caloric,
we are aware that in virtue of its conductibility it tends quickly
to attain a state of equilibrium, which in extreme cases may
be in a degree hastened by the vascular circulation of a fluid
of an equal temperature like the blood, which if developed to
the same extent as in the fungiform papillae, would, it is ra
tional to suppose, so much equalize the distribution of caloric
as to render the nerve incapable of distinguishing minute dif
ferences of temperature. But without entering any further
into these speculations out of the pale of experimental science,
it is proper to state that numerous facts derived from phy
siology and pathology are in favour of what I have deduced
from the examination of the anatomical structure of the two
species of papillae, namely, the existence of two distinctspecies or
sets of organs in the tongue, those for appreciating the chemical
properties of bodies, and those for taking cognizance of their
physical and mechanical attributes. In numerous instances
the faculty of taste is entirely destroyed, leaving the tactile
properties unaffected.
   With regard to the second period or stage, when the blood
comes in contact with the nerve and produces the impression
which is conveyed to the brain, we can form no idea of the
various actions which are produced within the nerve; we can
only surmise that these impressions may either resemble elec
tric currents, such as arise from the contact of two heteroge
neous substances, or that they are caused by a kind of mole
cular perturbation, which is transmitted upwards to the brain,
where it produces a kind of image of a more permanent nature.
We know that different liquids vary greatly in their power of
traversing the same membrane; alcohol and water, for in
stance, in a bladder become separated from each other by the
water traversing the membrane and the spirit remaining be
hind. To this cause may perhaps in some small degree be
attributed the difference in the sensations which different sub
stances give rise to ; but by far the most efficient cause is
probably the peculiar manner in which the nerve is affected,
as different rays of light excite different sensations indepen
dently of the intensity of their action. My experiments have
not enabled me to ascertain whether the nervous fibrils sup
plying the two kinds of papillae are the same or of different
origin, or whether they are rendered distinct in their actions
merely by means of the structure of the parts around them.
   The third stage may be considered as simply a kind of per

meation or imbibition, very similar to what we have described
in the first.    It is evident that if a substance were allowed to
remain permanently in contact with the nerve, the impressions
would be greatly defective, as the substances applied to it
would be mixed. To remedy this evil, it is requisite that a
means should be found of eliminating a substance from the
nervous extremities nearly as quickly as it is allowed to reach
them. The nerve when freed is capable of receiving a second
impression as clear and distinct as the first. We may easily
understand how this may be effected by means of the vascular
coil; for if we suppose for a moment that this coil is filled
with stationary blood, we see no reason to prevent the diffu
sion of the substance in the capillary area from taking place
in the same manner as in the cavity of the vesicle. If the
capillary is now emptied and filled with fresh blood, the same
action of imbibition and of solution will take place a second
time, and so on as fast as the blood is changed and renewed.
In this way we obtain a constant current from the exterior to
the interior of the vesicle; and if the sapid substance has
quitted the surface of the tongue, the absorption will continue
until by an action of endosmosis and exosmosis it becomes
entirely removed from the vesicle. The existence of a constant
current in the coil undoubtedly much accelerates the removal
of the sapid substance from the vesicle, as we observe that
whenever an active imbibition takes place, as in the branchiae
of the tadpole, there exists a corresponding increase in the
vascular system.

 ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF METALLIC ZINC TOWARDS SOLUTIONS
                     OF MERCURY.        BY H. ROSE.
Tº behaviour of metallic zinc towards solutions of the peroxide
     and perchloride of mercury is highly remarkable. The zinc

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            291
throws down the whole of the mercury from solutions of the pernitrate
and persulphate, when the separation of basic salts has been prevented
by the addition of nitric or sulphuric acid.       The zinc does not
combine with the mercury, but the latter separates in the form of
gray globules, which collect at the bottom of the vessel; the zinc
retains its appearance, becoming only somewhat more gray than
before the experiment.
   Zinc behaves in the same manner towards a solution of the per
chloride of mercury; its appearance is not changed, and the mer
cury separates in gray globules; but when hydrochloric acid has
been added to the solution of the perchloride, the immersed bar of
zinc soon becomes quite bright and shining. In this reaction no
evolution of gas occurs; only a few bubbles adhere constantly to
the bright surface of the amalgamated metal; the mercury is only
imperfectly precipitated, for even after several days its presence may
be detected in the solution.    It is true that, when the zinc is left
for a longer time in contact with the liquid, the mercury is at last
entirely separated, but not however as a precipitate of gray globules;
but the whole of it combines with the zinc and amalgamates it. At
all events, when free hydrochloric acid is present, the mercury is
separated far more slowly, and under totally different phaenomena,
than from the solution of the pure perchloride.
    When the experiment is somewhat modified, the result is still
more surprising. For instance, if a bar of zinc be immersed in hy
drochloric acid, and when the evolution of hydrogen is very rapid,
a solution of perchloride of mercury be added, the disengagement
of gas ceases instantly; the zinc becomes bright, resulting from its
amalgamation; and after several days the mercury is only imper
fectly separated from the solution. If a solution of perchloride of
platinum be now added, evolution of hydrogen immediately recom
mences.     .
    When the mercury has been entirely separated from a solution of
the perchloride by zinc in the form of gray globules, and hydro
chloric acid added, the zinc soon becomes bright and amalgamated,
without however the mercury, which has been separated in the form
of globules, wholly combining with the zinc.
    The behaviour of amalgamated zinc is very remarkable. Döbe
reiner observed that no evolution of gas resulted on the contact of
amalgamated zinc with acids; and recently Millon has drawn atten
tion to the fact, that certain metallic solutions hasten the evolution
of hydrogen by means of zinc and dilute sulphuric acid (a phaeno
menon which has been satisfactorily accounted for by Barreswil),
while a solution of perchloride of mercury retards this disengage
ment considerably.
    Zinc, as is well known, is most readily amalgamated by immersing
 it in hydrochloric acid, and then rubbing it over with mercury.
Zinc thus amalgamated remains perfectly bright when placed in
hydrochloric acid, in which it scarcely dissolves at all, or so little,
that only a few bubbles of gas adhere to the shining surface. As is
well known, amalgamated zinc behaves, in an electrical point of
                                   X 2

292           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
view, almost like a distinct metal; and, notwithstanding it is but
little acted upon by acids, is more positive than zinc alone. . If,
therefore, another metal be placed by the side of amalgamated zinc,
which is in contact with a dilute acid, a powerful evolution of gas
immediately results on the former when it touches the amalgamated
zinc. It is requisite, however, that, in order to retain its remarkable
behaviour, especially towards perchloride of mercury, there must
always be some free acid present, without which it acts like ordinary
 zinc. When an amalgamated bar of zinc is immersed in a solution
 of perchloride of mercury, the mercury is separated exactly as with
 pure zinc in the form of gray globules, and the amalgamated zinc
 loses its bright coating. In the same way amalgamated zinc reduces
 solutions of the sulphate of copper, nitrate of silver and acetate of
 lead, like ordinary zinc, with this difference, that an addition of hy
 drochloric or nitric acid does not prevent or retard the reduction of
 the metals by the amalgamated zinc, as is the case with the solution
 of perchloride of mercury.
    When only a few drops of hydrochloric acid are added to a solu
 tion of the perchloride of mercury, the zinc is amalgamated; but
 after some time mercury separates in the form of gray globules,
 which does not occur when a larger quantity of hydrochloric acid
 has been employed.
    Dilute sulphuric acid acts like hydrochloric acid in preventing or
 retarding the precipitation of the mercury from the solution of the
 perchloride; frequently, in this case, a fine crystalline salt separates,
 which however is only perchloride of mercury, which is far less
 soluble in dilute sulphuric acid than in water; subsequently a cry
 stalline powder separates in minute scales, coating the zinc, and fre
 quently floating upon the surface of the liquid; this is the proto
 chloride of mercury, which is not further altered by the zinc. It is
 remarkable that the protochloride is only separated by zinc from the
 solution of the perchloride when sulphuric acid has been added, and
 not from a solution of the pure chloride, nor on the addition of hy
 drochloric acid. Moreover, when a solution of the perchloride of
 mercury is poured upon zinc immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, the
 evolution of gas suddenly ceases, just as with the addition of hydro
 chloric acid. The zinc likewise becomes amalgamated, and a few
 bubbles of gas adhere for a long time to its surface. Nitric acid
 also prevents the precipitation of the mercury from the solution of
 the perchloride by zinc, in the same manner as hydrochloric and
sulphuric acids; in this case the protochloride is also formed. When
 a violent disengagement of nitric oxide has resulted from immersing
 zinc in nitric acid, it is instantly stopped by the addition of a solu
 tion of the perchloride of mercury. It is well known that neither
 sulphuric nor nitric acids in the dilute, and also in the concentrated
state, are capable of decomposing the perchloride of mercury.
    Iron completely precipitates the oxysalts of mercury in the same
 manner as zinc ; the metal is likewise wholly separated by iron from
 a solution of the perchloride, and an addition of hydrochloric acid
neither prevents the evolution of gas nor the elimination of the mer

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              298
 cury; as the iron is not amalgamated, the mercury separates in the
 form of globules.
    While zinc entirely precipitates the mercury from a solution of
the protonitrate, it cannot decompose the protochloride even when
 recently precipitated and in the presence of water. The insolubility
 of the salt is by no means the cause of this phaenomenon, as the
 chloride of silver is most quickly and rapidly decomposed by zinc
 in the presence of water. Even on the addition of hydrochloric
 acid, the protochloride is not decomposed by zinc, or only to a very
 small extent when it has been left for several days in contact with
 it and the acid. Scarcely any evolution of gas is perceptible in this
 instance; nevertheless the liquid, after a short time, contains oxide
 of zinc in solution.
    The insoluble protosulphate of mercury is likewise not reduced
 by zinc in contact with water; however, after several days some
 oxide of zinc has dissolved, and the zinc is slightly amalgamated;
 more is reduced when dilute sulphuric acid is added, but still the
 quantity is very inconsiderable; there is no evolution of gas, but
 nevertheless the zinc is amalgamated.—Poggendorff's Annalen.
        on THE composition of THE organic ALKALIES.
                         BY M. AUG. LAURENT.
    The author observes that the elementary analysis of the organic
alkalies is attended with great difficulty, for a difference of two- or
three-thousandths of hydrogen is sufficient to change their atomic
formula. The greater number of analyses show an excess of hy
drogen over the calculated result, which usually amounts to the
quantities above-mentioned, or about one equivalent. The author
contrived an apparatus to ascertain whether he could not determine
the hydrogen to about one-thousandth; and he remarks that two
formulae are given for morphia; that by Liebig being C*H*N* O",
and that by Regnault C* Hºo N*06. The result of the author's
analysis is stated by him to be—

And he further observes, that the analyses of Liebig and Regnault
were calculated according to the ancient atomic weight of carbon;
whereas with the number 75 the results of Regnault's analysis would
be the same as his, or 71-7 and 71-85.
    Quina.-M. Liebig's formula for this alkali is C* H2+ Nº 0°,
which, according to M. Regnault, ought to be doubled. M. Lau
rent repeatedly crystallized sulphate of quina, then extracted the
alkali, and dissolved it in aether; the solution was evaporated, and the
quina kept for a long time in fusion and then analysed. The results

ON THE CHANGE EFFECTED IN HYDRATED PEROXIDE OF IRON
        WHEN KEPT IN WATER.                          B.Y. M. G.               c. WITTSTEIN.
   It is well known that a solution of persulphate or perchloride
of iron gives a reddish-brown precipitate with ammonia, and it is
flocculent and very bulky : its formula is Fe2O3+3HO, and it dis
solves perfectly in cold acetic acid.                     It does not however appear to
be known, that this precipitate, when kept under water, and without
having been previously dried, almost entirely loses its property of
dissolving in acetic acid, as if it had been dried. Some other organic
acids, which readily and completely dissolve recently-precipitated
peroxide of iron, such as tartaric and citric acids, &c., also dissolve
a much smaller quantity of the oxide which has been long kept under
water.    M. Wittstein states that some researches which he has made
on this subject have afforded him very satisfactory results.
                                                                                         -

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              295
   If the recently-precipitated and washed oxide be examined by the
microscope, it will be seen to be composed of amorphous globules,
among which no crystals are perceptible; on the contrary, the pre
cipitate which has been long kept under water appears to be entirely
crystalline : the small fragments of crystals are of a deep yellow
colour and slightly translucent.     The author states that he is not
aware of the time required to convert the amorphous into the cry
stalline peroxide; but the precipitates on which he made his expe
riments had been prepared more than two years previously. He
thinks, however, that the transformation had taken place for a con
siderable time; for he remembers to have remarked that in six
months the precipitate had altered in appearance and become more
compact. The hydrate, moreover, in assuming the crystalline form,
loses half the water which it contained; the formula of the precipi
tate which has undergone this change is 2Fe2O3+3HO.
   The difficulty then which attends the solution of hydrated peroxide
of iron that has been long kept under water, depends upon two causes,
the crystalline form and partial dehydration. It results from what has
been above stated, that the peroxide of iron, in order that it may be
dissolved by the acids named, and weak acids in general, ought to
be employed soon after precipitation. It is probably not indifferent
that the peroxide of iron employed as an antidote to arsenic should
be recently-precipitated; at all events, preference ought to be given
to recently-precipitated oxide, and it will be proper to renew it every
six months, or annually.      It is not requisite entirely to reject the
hydrate which has been kept ; it may be dissolved in hydrochloric
acid and again precipitated by ammonia.-Journ. de Pharm. et de
Ch., Fevrier 1847.
      ON WILLEMITE.       B.Y. M.M. DELESSE AND DESCLOIZEAUX.
   The mineralogical collection of M. De Drée contains a brownish
silicate of zinc from Franklin, New Jersey, United States. It appears
to have been already analysed by MM. Vanuxem and Keating, who
have referred it to the villemite of Levy; but as it differs much in
appearance from the villemite found in Europe, and as its analysis
does not agree with that of a mineral analysed by Dr. Thomson,
and identical as to its physical properties, and from the same locality,
MM. Delesse and Descloizeaux thought it would be interesting to
make a comparative examination of the two minerals.
   The villemite which MM. Delesse and Descloizeaux analysed was
from the zinc mines of Vieille-Montagne near Aix-la-Chapelle : it is
in small crystals, of a light rose colour, and has the form of a regular
hexagonal prism, terminated by an obtuse rhomb of an angle of 128°
30', as described by Levy and Phillips. These crystals were con
tained in the druses of a ferruginous calamine.
   The silicate of zinc from New Jersey was also crystallized, but
confusedly so; sometimes however the crystals are very well de
fined, and they are referable, both as to form and cleavage, to the
villemite of Levy. The angles are the same; the cleavages perpen

296           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
dicular to the axis of the prism are also evident, as well as those
which are parallel to the faces of the regular hexagonal prism. The
specific gravity of the mineral from New Jersey was 4:154.
    By calcination, the silicate of zinc from New Jersey and the ville
mite lose only 0.005: this small loss is probably owing to a little
hygrometric moisture, and to the oxides of iron and manganese
 which accompany both minerals; the villemite becomes of a slight
 brick-red colour.     As to the New Jersey silicate, it has a brown
 colour, a resinous lustre, and yields a powder of a light dirty green
 colour, which becomes deeper by calcination: like villemite it is in
 fusible by the blowpipe ; with carbonate of soda on platina foil it
 becomes green, indicating the presence of manganese; in borax it
 dissolves perfectly, with a slight colour indicating iron; with phos
 phoric salt, a skeleton of silica remains in the globule.
    The silicate of zinc from New Jersey, like villemite, is very easily
 acted upon by hydrochloric acid, and the silica separates in the ge
 latinous state; it then produces an incrustation around the central
 part, and it is necessary to continue the ebullition for some time,
 that the action may be complete.
    For a quantitative analysis about fifteen grains were dissolved in
 hydrochloric acid; after having separated the silica in the usual way,
 the liquor was evaporated a second time, by which a little more was
 obtained; the zinc was separated by solution in potash, by repeatedly
treating the residue insoluble in acid : the iron was separated from
the manganese by succinate of ammonia; no cadmium was detected.
    There were by these means obtained, by the analysis of the ville
mite of Vieille-Montagne and the silicate of zinc from New Jersey
the following results:—

   The results of these analyses agree very well with those of ville
mite and silicate by MM. Thomson, Levy, Vanuxem and Keating.
It follows that manganeseous silicate of zinc of New Jersey, and the
villemite, though at first presenting different appearances, belong to
the same mineral species, which is a tribasic silicate of zinc Si Znº ;
or supposing that silica contains only two atoms of oxygen, they will
be bibasic silicates of zinc Si Zn2.—Ann, des Mines, tome x. 1846.

 SOLUBILITY OF CARBONATE OF LIME IN WATER CONTAINING
                CARBONIC ACID,       BY M, LASSAIGN.E.
   The solubility of carbonate of lime in water containing carbonic
acid has been long known to geologists, mineralogists and chemists;
it is in this state that all waters which contain this calcareous salt
convey it for the assimilation of plants and animals.
   The spontaneous precipitation of this salt, by contact of the air,
fully explains the cause of the deposits formed by the water, and of
the incrustations, frequently so abundant, which occur on the sur
face of bodies exposed to the water for a certain time.
   There are other facts, however, connected with the subject which
have not been examined into ; such are the degree of solubility of
carbonate of lime at common temperatures in water saturated with
carbonic acid, and the state of saturation in which the salt exists in
this condition.
    The plan on which M. Lassaigne operated was to prepare a solu
 tion of pure carbonic acid by agitating at a temperature of 50°F.
 and a pressure of 29-7 inches: in this solution chalk reduced to a
fine powder was digested for twelve hours.
    The solution obtained was filtered to separate the excess of car
 bonate of lime, and was perfectly limpid; it reddened tincture of
litmus slightly, but had no immediate effect on syrup of violets; but
 after several hours' contact the solution became gradually green.
The solution when treated with a little potash became immediately
turbid, and deposited white flocculi of hydrated carbonate of lime,
 which soon diminished in volume by losing water, and were con
 verted into a white powder, which partly adhered to the sides of the
 vessel; the same effects were obtained with ammonia.       When the
 solution was heated it became turbid, as the gas was expelled by the
 action of the heat, and carbonate of lime was precipitated.
    It was found by experiment that the carbonic acid, which effected
 the solution of the carbonate of lime, was five times greater than
 that which existed in the carbonate of lime dissolved at 50°.
    This result indicates that the calcareous salt to be dissolved in
 water by carbonic acid, is directly converted into sexticarbonate of
 lime, that is to say, into a compound of one equivalent of lime and
 six equivalents of carbonic acid, which would give CaO, 600° as the
 formula of the soluble salt. M. Lassaigne thinks it probable that
 this is the state in which the combination exists in certain spring
 waters which contain it, unless it be regarded as a bicarbonate of
 lime, rendered soluble by four equivalents of free carbonic acid.
 The author is, however, disposed to consider the first hypothesis as
 more conformable to the theory of the saturation of metallic oxides
 with oxacids.
    In operating at the temperatures of 50°F. and 32°F., a differ
 ence was observed in the solubility of neutral carbonate of lime in
 the same solution of carbonic acid. At the former temperature, a
 volume of the saturated water dissolved 0-00088 of its weight of

298           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
carbonate of lime, while an equal volume at 32° dissolved only
0-00070.
   This decided difference proves then that the solubility of carbonate
of lime in water impregnated with carbonic acid, varies with the tem
perature, at least within the limits of 32° and 50° F., which were
those at which the experiments were made.—Journ. de Ch. Méd.,
Fevrier 1847.
  SOLUBILITY OF PHOSPHATE OF LIME IN WATER SATURATED
            WITH CARBONIC ACID.         B.Y. M. LASSAIGN.E.
   The solution of carbonic acid employed in these experiments was
saturated at the temperature of 50° F., and at a pressure of 29.9
inches; the phosphate employed was left in the solution in each case
during twelve hours; and the quantity dissolved was ascertained by
evaporating the same volume of each solution to dryness and weigh
ing the residue.
   1. Pure phosphate of lime, obtained by the double decomposition.
of a calcareous salt and alkaline phosphate ; the solubility was
0-000750.
   2. Fresh bone, a piece of nearly two inches long, ##dths of an
inch wide, and rºodths thick; solubility 0.000166.
   3. Bone disinterred after about twenty years' repose in a cemetery,
the subsoil of which was sandy; solubility 0.000300.
   M. Lassaigne remarks that these facts confirm an opinion advanced
by M. Dumas, that bones which have suffered incipient decomposi
tion in the earth, and which have consequently become less coherent,
yield a larger quantity of their calcareous salts to water saturated
with carbonic acid, than fresh bones containing all their organic
matter.—Journ de Ch. Méd., Janvier 1847.
                       CRYSTALLIZED BILE,
   M. Verdeil effects the crystallization of bile by the following pro
cess:—Fresh ox-bile is to be dried by the water-bath, and the residue
is to be treated with about twenty parts of absolute alcohol. By this
the mucus remains insoluble, whilst the bilate of soda readily dis
solves.   The solution is to be filtered and treated with animal char
coal to decolorize it; aether is then to be cautiously added to it
until it begins to turn milky, and is then to remain in a closed ves
sel. Crystallization occurs after some time : the bilate is then de
posited on the sides of the vessel in the form of small acicular cry
stals in concentric groups.    In twenty-four hours the liquor is to be
poured off; and the crystals, after being washed with aether free
from alcohol, are to be dried over sulphuric acid.
   The crystals thus obtained always contain a little common salt;
from this they are freed by placing them with absolute alcohol in a
freezing mixture: this salt does not dissolve under these circum
stances.

        SINGULAR PROPERTY OF GUN-COTTON MIXTURE.
   Dr. Draper has made the following observations:—Lecturers on
chemistry have known for a long time, that one of the best methods
of illustrating the properties of carbonic acid gas, is to evolve it from
carbonate of ammonia by the action of monohydrated nitric acid.
A dense white fume accompanies the gas, and marks all its move
ments in a striking manner.
   Commercial nitric acid fails to produce the same effect. It sets
the gas free in an invisible state. But if a mixture of commercial
nitric acid and oil of vitriol be used, then the dense fume is at once
produced. The explanation seems to be, that the oil of vitriol, by
retaining water, allows some of the carbonate of ammonia to pass
off with the carbonic acid in a dry state, and hence gives the gas a
smoky aspect.
   But it is singular, that though oil of vitriol will of course decom
pose carbonate of ammonia very rapidly, the gas which escapes is
transparent.
   Some months ago Dr. Ellet, of South Carolina College, published
a process for preparing gun-cotton, which is unquestionably the
greatest improvement yet made in the preparation of that explosive
substance.     His plan is to soak cotton in a mixture of oil of vitriol
and saltpetre, and then wash it thoroughly from the adhering salt.
Now if this mixture of oil of vitriol and saltpetre be made to act on
carbonate of ammonia, like monohydrated mitric acid, or common
nitric acid mixed with sulphuric, it evolves carbonic acid in the
smoky state.
ON THE DEHYDRATION OF SULPHATE OF LIME UNDER WARIOUS
              CIRCUMSTANCES.             BY M. M. E. MILLON,
   The author observes that it is well-known that sulphate of lime
which is slowly produced, retains its water of combination at a tem
perature at which precipitated sulphate loses it.        .
   Sulphate of lime.—This salt contains two equivalents of water,
SO9, HO-H CaO, HO ; according to Graham it suffers no loss at
212°F., and becomes anhydrous at 266°. The general results ob
tained by M. Millon effect considerable changes in this statement.
   Sulphate of lime, of whatever form, origin or mode of formation,
always suffered a first loss, varying from 15 to 17 per cent. This
quantity represents 1:5 equivalent of water : its elimination is per

  300           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 fectly decided, and cannot be confounded with the total loss, which
 varies from 20 to 22 per cent. and corresponds to two equivalents of
 water. The following are the results of experiments:—
    Artificial sulphate of lime, prepared by precipitating cold solutions
 of sulphate of zinc and chloride of calcium; when dried over sulphuric
 acid the result was invariable. By exposure for six hours to a tem
 perature of 176° to 185°F. it lost 17 per cent. ; no further loss oc
 curred by exposure for an additional hour to the same temperature;
 when rendered perfectly anhydrous the loss was 22 per cent.
    Artificial sulphate of lime, precipitated from mixed boiling solutions
 of sulphate of zinc and chloride of calcium ; dried as before, the loss
 at 176° to 185° F. remained invariably at 1571 per cent. ; when
 rendered anhydrous the loss was 20:87 per cent.
    Moistened plaster lost at the above temperatures 16:22 per cent. ;
 rendered anhydrous, the loss was 20-39 per cent.
   Precipitated sulphate of lime, dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and
 crystallized from it.—By fifteen hours' exposure to 176° up to 185°,
it lost no weight, and none occurred till the temperature reached
 221°F., when it lost 15:38 per cent. The same heat was afterwards
 continued during four hours without further loss. Rendered anhy
 drous, the loss was 20.78 per cent.
   Arrow-headed gypsum from Montmartre.—This suffered no loss at
 176° to 185° F.; at 221° it amounted to 15:37 per cent., and the
total loss was 20.78 per cent.
   Fibrous sulphate of lime.—In fifteen hours lost no weight at 185°F.;
at 221° the loss was 17.60 per cent. ; it was afterwards exposed for
twelve hours to the same temperature with scarcely any diminution;
the total loss was 22-62 per cent.
   Alabaster from Volterra.-Suffered no diminution of weight by
exposure at 176° to 185° F.; at 230°F. the loss was 15-61 per
cent.; several hours' continued application of the same heat occasioned
no further diminution of weight; the total loss was 20.83 per cent.
   Snow-white gypsum (Gypse en niège).—Lost no weight at 185°F.;
at 238°F. it was 15:57 per cent. No further diminution occurred
by several hours’ longer exposure to this heat. The total loss was
21:27 per cent.
   Fibrous gypsum from America.-Lost no weight at 185° F.; at
230°F. lost 15:41 per cent.; total loss 20:59 per cent.
   Prismatic gypsum from Sicily.—No diminution of weight at 185°F.;
at 230° it was 15:58 per cent., and the total loss was 20:44 per cent.
   It appears, therefore, that all native sulphates of lime retain their
water at 185° F., and do not lose any below 221° to 236°. Artificial
sulphate of lime crystallized in hydrochloric acid is similarly circum
stanced. Artificial sulphate of lime, on the other hand, whether
precipitated hot or cold, loses three-fourths of the water at 176° to
185°. Moistened plaster is also dehydrated at this lower tempera
ture.
   It will be observed that all the sulphates of lime undergo a frac
tional loss of water, and that the second state of hydration is ex
pressed by (SO3)*, HO-H2Ca().

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              301
   The last fourth of the water of hydration goes off very slowly, if
the heat be not raised tº nearly 400° or 570°F.;     at 257° to 393°F.
mere traces of water are separated in several hours. This resistance
is unquestionably very favourable to the calcination of plaster intended
for buildings; it prevents its complete dehydration, even at a some
what higher temperature.                                 -
    M. Millon has also observed that anhydrates which contain some
hundredths of water, lose it in fractional quantities; one specimen
lost 3.65 per cent. of water. The first loss of 2.89 per cent, occurred
at 221°F.; the remainder, or 0.76 per cent. of water, required a
higher temperature for its expulsion. On examining the anhydrate
with a glass, opake portions were visible, which were small crystals
of the trapezoidal variety of sulphate of lime, and were evidently
formed by the anhydrate having absorbed moisture from the atmo
sphere.—Ann. de Chim. et de Phys., Fevrier 1847.
       COFFEE AS AN ANTIDOTE TO ACETATE OF MORPHIA.
    An invalid took at one dose ten grains and nearly eight-tenths of
acetate of morphia; thirty grains of emetic tartar were exhibited
without occasioning vomiting; after a lapse of three hours, and not
till then, and when the patient was perfectly comatose, a strong in
fusion of coffee with the grounds was given.     In the course of twelve
 hours the invalid took about 11; ounces of coffee; the coma ceased
 and he recovered.
    This fact proves, among a hundred others, that even in the worst
cases of poisoning, the medical man should never despair of the re
covery of his patient. In the above-described case, in spite of a very
strong dose of poison, and notwithstanding the absence of all assist
 ance during three entire hours, and although it was impossible to
 evacuate any portion of the morphia, the patient recovered. If a
 similar accident should again occur, vomiting ought to be immediately
attempted; if this fail the stomach-pump should be employed,
and then concentrated coffee should be administered.—Journ. de
Pharm. et de Ch., Fevrier 1847.
    ON THE FORMATION OF CYLINDIRICAL MASSES OF SNOW IN
                               ORKNEY.
                        To Richard Taylor, Esq.
                          Sandwick Manse by Stromness, Feb. 11, 1847.
    MY DEAR SIR,-A curious phaenomenon in this parish has asto
 nished and perplexed all, and filled the superstitious with no small
 degree of consternation. Since the 6th inst. we have had hail- or
 snow-showers, on the 9th snow-drift, and yesterday a slight thaw
with frost again in the evening.
    During the night a heavy fall of snow took place which covered
 the plain to the depth of several inches. Upon this pure carpet there
 rest thousands of large masses of snow which contrast strangely with
 its smooth surface.    A solitary mass may be seen in a field, but in
 general they occur in patches from one acre to a hundred in extent,
 while the clusters may be half a mile asunder, and not one mass to

 302          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
be seen in the interval. These fields appear at a distance as if cart
loads of manure had been scattered over them and covered with snow
but on examination the masses are all found to be cylindrical, like
hollow fluted rollers or ladies' swan-down muffs, of which the smaller
ones remind me, from their lightness and purity, but most of them
are of much greater dimensions and weight than any lady would
choose to carry, the largest that I measured being 3% feet long and
7 feet in circumference.     The weight however is not so great as
might be expected from the bulk; so loose is the texture, that one
near this house which was brought in and weighed, was found to be
only 64 lbs., though it measured 3 feet long and 6% feet in circum
ference. The centre is not quite hollow, but in all there is a deep
conical cavity at each end, and in many there is a small opening
through which one can see, and by placing the head in this cavity in
the bright sun, the concentric structure of the cylinder is quite ap
parent. So far as I am yet informed, they do not occur in any of
the adjoining parishes, and they are limited to a space of about five
miles long and one broad. They may occupy about 400 acres of
this, and I counted 133 cylinders in one acre, but an average of a
hundred would, at a rough computation, yield a total of about
40,000.
   Now the question naturally arises, what is the origin of these bo
dies 2 I believe the first idea was that they had fallen from the
clouds, and portended some direful calamity, and I hear an opinion
that one had fallen on a corn-stack and been broken to pieces. It is
a pity to bring down such lofty imaginations, and to deprive these
cylinders of their high descent, but I prefer truth, when it can be
discovered, to the loftiest theory. I must at once, then, set aside
the idea that they fell from the atmosphere in their cylindrical form,
as the first one I examined satisfied me that its symmetry and loose
texture must have been immediately destroyed on coming in rude
contact with this earth.
   Farther observation has convinced me that they have been formed
by the wind rolling up the snow, as boys form large snow-balls.
This is proved by examination of the bodies themselves; their round
form, concentric structure, and fluted surface all show this mode of
formation.    Again, it is proved by their position: none are found on
the weather side of hills or steep eminences, where the wind could
not drive them up, nor close to leeward of any wall or perpendicular
bank from which they seem to have originated—the nearest well
formed small ones being 60 yards to leeward, and the large ones
100 yards. All nearer than this are fragments that have not gone
on to completion, but broken down in their passage, and the differ
ent portions of the wreck form the nuclei of others. Many how
ever are found blown to the windward side of walls or over the lee
side of banks.     Indeed, they are found almost exclusively on the
leeward side of hills and eminences, where both the wind and decli
vity assisted in rolling them along, or on plains so exposed that the
wind alone operated without the declivity.
   I shall only add, that this mode of formation is proved by the di
rection in which these cylinders lie. The wind has been from the

north for four days, and I believe that it was so all night, when I am
told it blew strong. Now they are all lying with their ends east
and west, and their side to the wind; and farther, in some cases,
their tracks are still visible in the snow for twenty or thirty yards on
their north side, from which they have gathered up their concentric
coats; and I understand these were still more evident at an early
hour before a snow-shower obliterated them in many places.
                                     I am, Sir, yours very truly,

 IN analysing Mr. Wheatstone's             beautiful discovery, that in
      binocular vision we see all objects of three dimensions by
 means of two dissimilar pictures on the retina, I trust I have
 proved that the dissimilarity of these two pictures is in no
 respect the cause of our vivid perception of such objects, but,
 on the contrary, an unavoidable accompaniment of binocular
 vision, which renders it less perfect than vision with one eye #.
 On the other hand, it is quite true that, in Mr. Wheatstone's
experiment of producing the perception of objects of three
dimensions by the apparent coalescence of two dissimilar
representations of such objects in plano, the dissimilarity of
the pictures is necessary in the exhibition of that beautiful
phaenomenon.
    In performing with the eye alone, the various experiments
detailed in a former paper<U+017F>, I was very much struck with the
fact, that the apparent solid figure, produced by the union of
its dissimilar pictures, never took its right position in absolute
space; that is, in place of appearing suspended between the
eye and the plane upon which the dissimilar figures were
drawn, the base of the solid seemed to rest on that plane,
whether its apex was nearer the eye or more remote than its
component plane figures.
    With the view of finding the cause of this, I placed the
component figures on a plate of glass suspended in the air, so
as to have no vision of the surface on which they rested, and

306             Sir D. Brewster on the Knowledge of
after uniting these figures by binocular vision, and concealing
the two outstanding single figures, I obtained results which,
though not entirely satisfactory, proved that there existed
some disturbing cause which prevented the united image from
placing itself in the binocular centre, or the intersection of the
optical axes. This disturbing cause was simply the influence
of other objects in the same field of view, whose distance was
known to the observer.
    In order to avoid all such influences, and to study the sub
ject under a more general aspect, it occurred to me that these
 objects would be gained by using a numerous series of plane
 figures, such as those of flowers or geometrical patterns upon
 carpets or paper-hangings. These figures being always at
 equal distances from each other, and almost perfectly equal
 and similar, the coalescence of any pair of them, by directing
 the optic axes to a point between the paper-hangings and the
 eye, is accompanied with the coalescence of every other pair.
 When the observer, therefore, places himself in front of that
 side of a papered room in which there are neither doors nor
 windows, and conceals from his eye the floor, the roof, and
 the right and left-hand sides of the room, the whole of his
 retina will be covered with the images of the united plane
 figures, and there will be no interposing objects to prevent
 him from judging of the distance of the picture that may be
 presented to him.
     Let the observer therefore now place himself three feet in
 front of the papered wall, and unite two of the figures, sup
 pose two flowers, at the distance of twelve inches. The whole
  wall will now be presented to his view, consisting of flowers
  as before, but each flower will be composed of two flowers
  superimposed at the binocular centre, or the point of conver
  gence of the optical axes. If we call D the distance of the
  eyes from the wall or three feet, C the distance between the
  eyes or two-and-half inches, and d the distance between the
 similar parts of the two flowers, we shall have a the distance
 of the binocular centre from the wall,   r=''',    = 30 inches
  nearly, and D-a – 6 inches, the distance of the binocular
  centre from the middle point between the two eyes.
     Hence the whole papered wall, with all its flowers, in place
  of being seen, as in ordinary vision, at the distance of three
  feet, is now suspended in the air, at the distance of six inches
 from the observer. In maintaining this view of the wall, the eye
  will at first experience a disagreeable sensation; but after a
  few experiments the sensation will disappear, and the observer
  will contemplate the new picture with the same satisfaction

               Distance given by Binocular Vision.             307
and absence of all strain as if he were looking directly at the
wall itself; for there is a natural tendency in the eyes to unite
two similar pictures, and to keep them united, provided they
are not too distant.
   When this picture is at first seized by the observer, he does
not for a while decide upon its distance from himself. It some
times appears to advance from the wall to its true position in
 the binocular centre, and when it has taken its place, it has a
very extraordinary character:—the surface seems slightly con
vex towards the eye; it has a sort of silvery transparent
aspect, and looks more beautiful than the real paper; it moves
with the slightest motion of the head, either laterally or to or
from the wall.    If the observer, who is now three feet from
the wall, retires from it, the suspended wall of flowers will
follow him, moving further and further from the real wall, and
also, but very slightly, further and further from the observer;
that is, the distance of the observer from the real wall increases
faster than the distance of the suspended wall from it, accord
ing to the law expressed by the preceding formula. The
binocular centre, therefore, recedes from the eye as the ob
server retires, and the strain consequently diminishes.
   In order to observe these phaenomena in the most perfect
manner, the paper should be pasted upon a large screen,
previously unseen by the observer, unconnected with the roof
or the floor, and placed in a large apartment. The deception
will then be complete; and when the picture stands suspended
before the observer, and within a few inches of himself, he may
stretch out his hand and place it on the other side of the pic
ture, and even hold a candle on the other side of it, so as to
satisfy himself that in both cases the picture is between his
hand and himself.
   When we survey this picture with attention, several very
curious phaenomena present themselves. Some of the flowers,
when narrowly examined, appear somewhat like real flowers.
In some the stalk gradually retires from the general plane of
the picture; in others it rises above it: one leaf will come
further out than another, or the flower will appear thicker and
more solid, deviating considerably from the plane representa
tion of it seen by each eye separately. , All this arises from
slight and accidental irregularities in the two figures which
are united, thus producing an approximation to three dimen
sions in the picture. If the distance, for example, of the ends
of two stalks in two coalescing flowers is greater than the
distance of corresponding points in other parts of the stalk,
the end of the stalk will rise from the general surface of the
figure, and vice versé. In    ºmanner,

 308           Sir D. Brewster on the Knowledge of
 two corresponding leaves is greater than the distance between
 other two º". two first, when
 united, will appear nearer, the eye than the other two, and
 hence the appearance of a solid flower is partially given to the
 combination. These effects are better seen in old and imper
 fectly made   prºmº, than in those which are more
 carefully executed.             - - -       ,
    In continuing our survey of the suspended image, another
 curious phaenomenon presents itself: a part of one of the
 pieces of paper, and sometimes a whole stripe from the roof
 to the floor, will retire behind the general plane of the image,
or rise above it; thus displaying, on a large scale, an imper
 fection in the workmanship which it would have required a
 very narrow inspection to discover. This defect arises from
 the paper-hanger having cut off too much of the white margin
 of one or more of the adjoining pieces, so that when the two
 halves of a flower are united, part of the middle of the flower
is left out; and hence when this defective flower is united with
the one on the right-hand of it, and the one on the left-hand
united with the defective one, the united or corresponding
portion, being at a less distance, will appear further from the
eye than those parts of the suspended image composed of
complete flowers. In like manner, if the two portions of the
flowers are not brought together, but separated by a small
space, the opposite effect will be produced. This will be
understood from fig. 1, Plate VI., where M N, O P represent
portions of two separate pieces of paper, each twenty-one
inches wide. In this specimen, there are only two flowers in
each piece, namely one white flower, A or B, and two halves.
If the two halves C, D, are united as in the figure, it is ob
vious that the flower is incomplete, a part of the central circle
of the corolla having been cut off from each half. If we now,
by straining the eye, unite CD with B, and also with A, then
at the same time E will be united with the second or left-hand
image of A, and G with the second or right-hand image of
B. But since a piece has been cut out of CD, the half & & of
A is nearer the half l D than the other half a a is to the other
half C C; and, in like manner, the half bb of B is nearer the
half C C than the other half 88 is to the other half D D.
Hence, when the strained eyes unite a a to D D, the binocu
lar centre is more remote than when a a is united to C, and
the same is true of the other halves; consequently, the halves
DD and b b must appear, as it were, sunk in the wall, or as
further removed from the observer; and if the defective cut
ting exists along the line R S from the floor to the ceiling,
the whole stripe of paper between R S and O P, from the

                         Distance given by Binocular vision.           309
floor to the ceiling               º sunk in the            bapered wall.
But if the defect to fined tº portion, only of the flowers,
then a rectangular space of the breadth RO, and of a height
equal to the defective portioli, will appear sunk in the paper.
If every junction has the same defect as that at RS, then the
whole will appear to consist of equal stripes, every alternate
one being raised and the other depressed... ." . .
        In the preceding example, there are only two flowers in a
breadth, and their distance is 10} inches, which is also the
breadth of the sunk st es. But ifthe flowers are three or
four in           number, and their distance #, # inches,      the sunk
stripes will vary according as we unite two flowers whose
distances are in the one case 7 or 14 inches, and 54 or 10}
or 16; or 21, in the other. Calling B the breadth of the
paper, n the number of flowers or figures in that breadth, and
W the width of the sunk stripe, then we have               w-      Ol'  2B
                                                                         72
or       **cºring. we unite the two nearest, or the first and
 * , , , ºf . , .  . . .       ---
second flower, the first and third, or the first and fourth.
When W = B, the sunk stripes will cover the whole paper,
and all the flowers will lie in the same plane.
        These results afford an accurate method of examining and
discovering defects in the workmanship of paper-hangers,
carpet-makers, painters, and other artists whose profession it
is to combine a series of similar patterns in order to form a
uniform and ornamental surface.                The smallest defect in the
similarity and equality in the figures or lines which compose
a pattern, and any difference in the distance of the single
figures, is instantly detected; and what is remarkable, a small
inequality of distance in a line perpendicular to the axis of
vision, or in one dimension of space, is exhibited in a magni
fied form as a distance coincident with the axis of vision, and
in an opposite dimension of space
        At the commencement of this class of experiments, it is
difficult to realize, and very easy to dissolve, the singular
binocular picture which we have been describing; but after the
eyes have been drilled for a while to this species of exercise,
the pictures become very persistent. Although the air-sus
pended image might be expected to disappear after closing
one eye, and still more after having closed and re-opened
both, yet I have found it in its original position in this latter
case, and even after rubbing my eyes and shaking my head;
and I have sometimes experienced a difficulty in ascertaining,

310             Sir D. Brewster on the Knowledge of
after these operations, whether it was the real or the air-sus
pended wall that was before me. On some occasions a sin
gular effect was produced. When the flowers on the paper
are distant six inches, we may either unite two six inches
distant, or two twelve inches distant. In the latter case, when
the eyes have been accustomed to survey the suspended pic
ture, I have found that, after shutting and opening them, I
neither saw the picture formed by the two flowers twelve
inches distant, nor the papered wall itself, but a picture formed
by uniting the flowers six inches distant                The binocular
centre had shifted its place; and instead of advancing to the
wall, as is generally the case, and giving us ordinary vision of
it, it advanced exactly as much as to unite the nearest flowers,
just as on a ratchet wheel the detent slips over one tooth at a
time; or, to speak more correctly, the binocular centre ad
vanced in order to relieve the eyes from their strain, and when
 the eyes were opened, it had just reached that point which
 corresponded with the union of the flowers six inches distant.
    In the construction of complex geometrical diagrams con
 sisting only of fine lines, and in which similar figures are
repeated at equal distances, it is very difficult to attain minute
accuracy. The points of the compasses sink to different
depths in the paper, and the lines which join such points sel
dom pass through their centres. , Hence arises a general
inaccuracy which the eye cannot detect; but if we examine
such diagrams by strained binocular vision, their imperfections
will be instantly displayed. Some parts will rise higher than
others above the general level, and the whole will appear like
several cobwebs placed at the distance of a tenth or a twelfth
of an inch behind each other*.
    In all the experiments made by Mr. Wheatstone by the
steoroscope, and in those described in my former paper, the
 dissimilar figures are viewed in a direction perpendicular to
 the plane on which they are drawn. A series of very interest
ing results however are obtained by uniting the images of lines
meeting at an angular point, when the eye is placed at differ
 ent heights above the plane of the paper, and at different
 distances from the angular point.
    Let AC, B C be two lines meeting at C, the plane passing
 through them being the plane of the paper, and let them be
viewed by the eyes at E", E", E, E at different heights in a
plane G M N perpendicular to the plane of the paper. Let R.
be the right eye and L the left eye, and when at E" let them

which forms plate 9. of Mr. Hay's work “On the Harmony of Form.”

be strained so as to unite the points A, B. The united image
of these points will be seen at the binocular centre D", and
 the united lines AC, BC will have the position D"C. In like
 manner, when the eye descends to E", E, E, the united image
 D"C will rise and diminish, taking the positions D"C, D'C,
 DC till it disappears on the line CM, when the eyes reach
 M. If the eye deviates from the vertical plane G MN the
 united image will also deviate from it, and is always in a plane
passing through the eye and the line G M.
   If at any altitude EM the eye advances towards ACB in
 the line EG, the binocular centre D will also advance towards
 ACB in the line EG, and the image DC will rise and become
shorter as its extremity D moves along DG, and after passing
the perpendicular to G E it will increase in length. If the
eye, on the other hand, recedes from ACB in the line GE,
the binocular centre D will also recede, and the image DC
will descend to the plane CM and increase in length.
   The preceding diagram is, for the purpose of illustration,
drawn in a sort of perspective, and therefore does not give
the true positions and lengths of the united images. This
defect however is remedied in fig. 3, where E, E, E", E" is
the middle point between the two eyes, the plane G M N being,
as before, perpendicular to the plane passing through ACB.
Now, as the distance of the eye from G is supposed to be the
same, and as AB is invariable as well as the distance between
the eyes, the distance of the binocular centres O, D, D, D",
D", P, from G will also be invariable, and lie in a circle ODP
whose centre is G, and whose radius is GO, the point Obeing
  etermined by
determined      the formula
             by the formula Go-GD=*****
                                 -       TA B-H. R. L.'   Hence,
in order to find the binocular centres D, D, D", D", &c. at
any altitude E, E, &c., we have only to join EG, E. G., &c.
and the points of intersection D, D, &c. will be the binocular
centres, and the lines DC, D'C, &c. drawn to C, will be the
real lengths and inclinations of the united images of the lines
AC, BC.

as the eyes descend from E" to M. When the eyes are near
to M, and a little above the plane of A. º line, when
not carefully observed, will have the appearance of coinciding
with CG, but stretching a great way beyond G. This extreme
case represents the celebrated experiment with the compasses,
described by Dr. Smith, and referred to by Professor Wheat
stone. He took a pair of compasses, Wº. be repre
sented by A C B, A B being their points, A CBC their gS,
and C their joint; and having placed his eyes about E above
their plane, he made the following experiment:-" Having
opened the points of a pair of compasses somewhat wider than
the interval of your eyes, with your arm extended, hold the
head or joint in the ball of your hand with the points out
wards, and equidistant from your eyes, and somewhat higher
than the joint. Then, firing your eyes upon any remote object
lying in the plane that bisects the interval of the points, you
will first perceive two pair of compasses (each by being doubled
with their inner legs crossing each other, not unlike the old
shape of the letter W). But by compressing the legs with
your hand, the two inner points will come nearer to each
other; and when they unite (having stopped the compression),
the two inner legs will also entirely coincide and bisect the
angle under the outward ones, and will appear more vivid,
thicker and larger, than they do, so as to reach from your
hand to the remotest object in view even in the horizon itself,
if the points be exactly coincident".” Owing to his imperfect
apprehension of the nature of this phaenomenon, Dr. Smith
has omitted to notice that the united legs of the compasses lie
below the plane of A B C, and that they never can extend
further than the binocular centre at which their points A and
 B are united.
   There is another variation of these experiments which
possesses some interest, in consequence of its extreme casehaving
been made the basis of a new theory of visible direction by
the late Dr. Wells:#. Let us suppose the eyes of the observer
to advance from E to N, and to descend along the opposite
quadrant on the left-hand of N G, but not drawn in fig. 3,
then the united image of A C, B C will gradually descend
towards CG, and become larger and larger. When the eyes
are a very little, above the plane of A B C, and so far to the
left-hand of A B that C A points nearly to the left eye and
 C B to the right eye, then we have the circumstances under
which Dr. Wells made the following experiment:—“If we

 or rather a little below them, the two edges will be seen united
 in the common aris (G C in fig. 3); and this apparent edge
 will seem of the same length with that of either of the real
 edges, when seen alone by the eye in the axis of which it is
 placed.” This experiment, it will be seen, is the same with
 that of Dr. Smith, with this difference only, that the points of
 the compasses are directed towards the eyes. Like Dr. Smith,
 he has omitted to notice that the united image rises above
 G H, and he commits the opposite error of Dr. Smith, in
 making the length of the united image too short.
    If in this form of the experiment we fix the binocular centre
 beyond C, then the united images of A C, B C descend below
 GC, and vary in their length and in their inclination to G C,
 according to the height of the eye above the plane of A B C,
 and its distance from A B.
    It is a remarkable circumstance, that no examples have
 been recorded of false estimates of the distance of near objects,
 in consequence of the accidental binocular union of similar
 images. This has, no doubt, arisen from the rare occurrence
 of these circumstances or conditions, under which alone such
 illusions can be produced. In a room where the paper-hang
 ings have a small pattern, or similar figures recurring at the
 distance of 1, 1}, or 2 inches, a short-sighted person might
 very readily turn his eyes on the wall, when their axes con
verged to some point between him and the wall, which would
 unite one pair of the similar images; and in this case he would
see the wall nearer him than the real wall, and moving with
the motion of his head like something aerial. In like manner,
a long-sighted person, with his optical axes converged to a
point beyond the wall, might see an image of the wall more
distant, and of an aérial character:—or a person who has
taken too much wine, which often fixes the optical axes in
opposition to the will, might, according to the nature of his
sight, witness either of the illusions above-mentioned.
   In the preceding observations, we have confined ourselves
to the binocular union of figures upon an opake ground. This
limitation almost necessarily precluded us from observing the
results when the binocular centre is beyond the plane where
these figures are situated, because it is not easy to adjust the
eyes to a distant object, unless we look through the surfaces
containing the figures. Now this is by far the most interest
ing form of the experiment, and it has the advantage of putting
scarcely any strain upon the eyes, not only because the bino
cular centre is more distant, but because we cannot, in this

                 Distance given by Binocular Vision.                         315
way, unite figures whose distance exceeds 2} inches, the in
terval between the eyes. Transparent patterns for these ex
periments may be cut out of stiff card-paper, or thin plates of
metal, or they may be made of paper pasted upon large panes
of glass. Experiments may be made with trellis-work, or
with windows composed of small squares or lozenges; but the
readiest pattern is the cane bottom of a chair, and I have per
formed my experiments by simply placing such a chair upon
a high table, with its cane bottom in a vertical position. The
distance of the centres of the eight-sided open figures in the
direction of the width or depth of the chair, varies in different
patterns from 0.54 to 0.76 of an inch. In order to simplify
the calculations, we shall take the distance at 0.5, or half an
inch.     Then let
   D=12 inches be the distance of the pattern from the eyes.
    d=0:5 the distance of the centres of the similar figures.
 +A=distance of suspended image from, and in front of the
             pattern,
 —A'=distance of suspended image from, and behind, the

longer sees the real pattern MN, but a suspended image of
it at mºn, three inches behind M. N. If the observer now ap
proaches M. N, the image mn will approach to him, and if he
recedes, inn, will recede, being 1% inch distant from M. N.
when the observer is six inches from MN, and twelve inches
from M N when he is forty-eight inches from MN, the image

which the observer recedes.      These two velocities are in the

   Resuming the position in the figure where the observer is
twelve inches distant from MN, let us consider the important
results to which this experiment cannot fail to lead us. If the
observer, with his eyes at LR, grasp the cane bottom or
pattern at M N, as shown in fig. 4, his thumbs pressing upon
MN, and his fingers trying to grasp mm, he will then feel
what he does not see, and see what he does not feel ! The real
pattern is absolutely invisible at M N, and stands fixed at m n.
The fingers may be passed through and through—now seen
on this side of it, now in the middle of it, and now on the
other side of it. If we next place the palms of each hand
upon M N, feeling it all over, the result will be the same. No
knowledge derived from touch—no measurement of real di
stances—no actual demonstration from previous or subsequent
vision, that there is a real solid body at M N, and nothing at
all at mºn, will remove or shake the infallible conviction of the
sense of sight that the object is at mºn, and that d L or d R is
its real distance from the observer.      If the binocular centre
be now drawn back to M N, the image seen will disappear,
and the real object be seen at M. N. . If it be brought still
further back to f, the object M N will again disappear, and
will be seen at p, v, as described in a former part of this paper.
   In making these experiments, the observer cannot fail to be
struck with the remarkable fact, that though the openings at
M. N., mm, and p y have all the same angular magnitude, that
is, subtend the same angle at the eye, viz. d Le, d Re, yet
those at m n appear larger than those at M N, and those at ww
smaller. If we cause the image m n to recede and p. v to ap
proach, the figures in m n will invariably increase as they

recede, and those in ply will diminish as they approach the eye,
and their visual magnitudes, as we shall call them, will depend
on the respective distances at which the observer, whether
right or wrong in his estimate, conceives them to be placed. -
   Now this is a universal fact, which the preceding experi
ments demonstrate; and though the estimate of magnitude
thus formed is an erroneous one, yet it is one which neither
reason nor experience is able to correct.' ' ' ' ' ' ' ". . . .”
 - When we look at two equal lines, whose difference of di
stance is distinctly appreciable by the eye, either directly or by
inference, but whose difference of         i. magnitude is not
appreciable, the most remote must necessarily appear the
smallest.     For the same reason, if the remoter of two lines is
really smaller than the nearer, and therefore its angular mag
nitude also smaller from both these causes, yet, even in this
case, if the eye does not perceive distinctly the difference, the
smaller and more remote line will appear the larger*.                     -
    The law of visual magnitude, which regulates this class of
phaenomena, may be thus expressed.                        -                 sy

is D, and V, v the visual magnitudes of the two lines, then ºf

    When I wrote the paragraph in page 314, I had no expec
tation of learning that any example of such an illusion had
ever occurred.       A friend, however, to whom I had occasion
to show the experiments, and who is short-sighted, mentioned
to me that he had been on two occasions greatly perplexed
by the vision of these suspended images. Having taken too
much wine, and being in a papered room, he saw the wall
suspended near him in the air; and on another occasion,
when kneeling and resting his arms on a cane-bottomed chair,
he had fixed his eyes on the carpet, which accidentally united
the two images of the open-work, and threw the suspended
image of the chair-bottom to a distance, and beyond the plane
on which his arms rested.
   The following case, communicated to me by Professor
Christison, is still more interesting. “Some years ago, when
I resided in a house where several rooms are papered with
rather formally recurring patterns, and one, in particular, with
stars only, I used occasionally to be much plagued with the
wall suddenly standing out upon me, and waving, as you de
scribe, with the movements of the head.       I was sensible that
the cause was an error as to the point of union of the visual
axes of the two eyes; but I remember it sometimes cost me a
considerable effort to rectify the error; and I found that the
best way was to increase still more the deviation in the first
instance. As this accident occurred most frequently while I
was recovering from a severe attack of fever, I thought my
near-sighted eyes were threatened with some new mischief;
and this opinion was justified in finding that, after removal
to my present house—where, however, the papers have no
yery formal pattern—no such occurrence has ever taken place.
The reason is now easily understood from your researches,” .

                       By Dr. DE HALDAT+.                      -
THE question of the universality of magnetism, on which
      M. de Haldat presented a memoir to the Academy of
Sciences in 1841 f, having given rise to some objections, has
been subjected to new researches, in which the author has
confirmed the fact, that all bodies in small masses and of an
elongated form are subject to the influence of the magnet when
exposed to its action, both when they are made to oscillate
between the opposite magnetic poles, and when they are sus
pended in the same situation by silk filaments whose torsion
is employed to value the force which they have acquired. A
desire to trace the proximate cause of these phaenomena in
duced the author to ascertain whether these bodies possess, of
themselves, the property of acquiring the magnetic state, or
whether they owe this property to the presence of iron, as
many philosophers have maintained.
   If we consider magnetism in a general point of view, we
shall find that, to attribute this property to iron alone, is to
assign to that substance a special virtue, which later researches
have shown to exist in two other metals, and which the attrac
tion of the magnetic needle by the rotatory discs composed
of various metals contradicts in the most direct manner; and
we must acknowledge that, in short, to deny to the fluid, the
magnetic agent, the generality of influence which we are forced
to recognise in the other agents, or imponderable fluids, as
heat, light and electricity, is to contravene the law of analogy,
which is one of our surest guides in the study of nature. How,
in fact, can we suppose that an agent which, like caloric, but
with an infinitely greater velocity, penetrates all bodies, can
be deprived of the property of exercising upon them an
influence analogous to that exerted by the other agents with
which it has such analogy 2 How can we admit, not only a
great resemblance but even an identity recognised by a great
number of philosophers between electricity and magnetism, and
deny the existence in one of its agents of that which we attri
bute to the other? Finally, if all the agents, as is generally
believed, are only different modifications of one universal
agent, how can we deny to magnetism the generality of influ
ence attributed to the fluid, the universal agent, of which it
would be, so to speak, one of the factors?                   -
    These reasonings, conformable to the principles of natural
philosophy, and sufficient perhaps for philosophers who restrict

 themselves to general considerations, being unable alone to
 solve the objections proposed by the partisans of special mag
 netism, the author had recourse to experiments directed ac
 cording to the following considerations. If the property of
 acquiring the magnetic state belongs only to one body, the
 partisans of this special virtue must prove, 1st, that this metal
 exists in all bodies presenting magnetic phaenomena; 2nd,
 that all bodies contain it, and in sufficient quantity to satisfy
 the magnetic phaenomena developed in the experiments of
 this class; 3rd, that, whatever be the state of the metal, pure
 or combined with different bodies, it always preserves its cha
 racteristic property. The answers to these questions are given
 in an article specially devoted to an investigation of iron, and an
 explanation of the processes adapted to detect it in the various
 substances in which it exists, either in a state of simple mix
 ture or of combination. And as excessively weak quantities
 are able to communicate the magnetic power to the bodies
 which would contain it, it was indispensable to adopt a pro
 cess capable of indicating the minutest quantities. The cha
 racteristic precipitate of its solutions by the cyanide of potas
 sium furnishing a simple and efficacious means of detecting
 this metal, the author adopted it, after having convinced him
 self that in forming, with the precipitate diluted with water, a
transparent column two centimetres (nearly 0:8 of an inch) in
length, the experimenter can, on receiving a ray of white
light, render perceptible at least a five-thousandth of the
quantity of iron in the substances subjected to the magnetic
experiment. At the same time all the agents adapted to ren
der the test more sensitive were had recourse to, and each
analysis checked by means of a test liquor composed of per
sulphate of iron, the amount of which being excessively small,
proved that if this metal had existed in the composition sub
mitted to examination, it would necessarily have been de
tected.
    Sixty substances deprived of iron by the usual means, and
found to be chemically pure, were thus prepared and sub
jected to magnetic action, after having received the elongated
form which ensures the success of these experiments. Among
these substances are the following, whose absolute purity

 divided into two classes, conformably to the abservation of
 Mr. Faraday, previously recognised by M. Becquerel”. Onei
class was placed in the direction of the magnetic current, thee
other transversely to this current. There is therefore no sub
stance absolutely neutral with regard to the property of
acquiring the magnetic power; but whatever be the direction
which it takes, this can always be ascertained, and the acquiredº

 the apparatus which measures the torsion.º. ºoº º 'º º
   -Reverting to the question of the universality of magnetism *
and the speciality of the iron which it repels, the author has
discussed the objections raised against the distinction of the
two modes of magnetization, which, with the fact of the pola--
rization of the luminous ray under the influence of the mag
netic current, has strongly confirmed a theory already based
on so many remarkable analogies and numerous experiments.
He has refuted the fact of the variations in the direction of “
needles successively reduced to disproportionate lengths, which
have been assigned to them from the consideration of the
powerlessness of the most energetic magnets to act otherwise
than upon the centre of the needles, and consequently to give º'
them other than a transverse direction.                     ºr ºf  i = < * * * * : *.
   In rejecting the magnetic speciality of iron, the author has
not denied the very remarkable pre-eminence of this metal i
with regard to the property of acquiring the magnetic power,
which it always manifests with great energy, even when it only 3
exists in an excessively small mass.” An entire article is de
voted to the valuation of the variations of which this arrange-º
ment is susceptible by the combination of oxygen, of several ºt
other substances, and above all by the passage of the metal to
the saline state in which it is generally diamagnetic, even whenºli
the components of the salt are only united by a weak affinity.”
In this examination it has been found, that a quantity of iron'<U+017F>
inappreciable by the most delicate balance might be detected ºf
by the magnetic process, and even estimated approximately; tº
that, however, this power diminishing with the quantity of the tº
metal which puts it in play, it necessarily finds its limit in the tº

ever be the quantity of iron contained in a body, it is appre
ciable by the magnetic process as much as it is by chemical
mean S.
    From general considerations, and from very numerous
facts stated in this memoir, and from numerous others for
which there was no room, it results:—
    1. That iron, although eminently magnetic, is not the only
body which possesses this property.
    2. That its tendency to acquire this state is dependent upon
its purity, and varies with its combination.                       -
    3. Lastly, that the magnetic power acting upon all bodies,
either giving them a direction parallel to the current or trans

like all other imponderable fluids or agents, universality of
influence in nature.

HAVING           had my attention drawn to a new method for
       preparing pure phosphoric acid from bone-ash, proposed
by Professor Gregory, and a new and apparently anomalous
phosphate of magnesia, accidentally discovered by him whilst
trying to obtain the above-mentioned acid pure by heating at
a temperature above 600°F.f, I was induced at the sugges
tion, and with the kind assistance of Professor von Liebig,
to repeat the process, and also to prepare a quantity of the
salt, and subject it to analysis. The general results I have
found are as follows:—If phosphoric acid, freed from lime
and sulphuric acid<U+017F>, be heated to a temperature above 600°F.,
it deposits a white substance, having all the general physical
characters of the new salt, but in which I found on analysis
22:47 per cent. of magnesia, corresponding to the metaphos
phate of magnesia (MgO POs). After a considerable quantity
of this substance had been deposited, I digested the mass in
water, filtered, and evaporated the solution, and again heated
the acid to upwards of 600°F., under the impression that it
might still contain the new compound; by continuing this
heat for half an hour, I again obtained a quantity of meta
lºommunicated by the Chemical         Society; having been read Dec. 7,

phosphate of magnesia; and it was not until after a third re
petition of this process that I obtained Professor Gregory's
compound, in which I found on analysis 16:276 per cent. of
magnesia, corresponding to the quantity found by that che
mist in his salt; but on estimating the quantity of phosphoric
acid present, I only obtained 75:25 per cent. of PO, leaving
a loss of upwards of 8 per cent. Being convinced that an
other base must be present, from the enormous loss, I pro
ceeded further with my analysis and found the presence of
soda, which gave me 8: 146 per cent. of soda.                  -
   This salt therefore is not an anomalous phosphate of mag
nesia, but a double metaphosphate of magnesia and soda, in
the proportions are 3 equivs. of metaphosphate of magnesia
and I equiv. of metaphosphate of soda, 3(MgO, POA) + NaO,
POs. It is nearly insoluble in hydrochloric acid and aqua
regia, but soluble in concentrated sulphuric acid.
   The analysis of the salt was made as follows:—I dissolved
the salt in pure concentrated sulphuric acid, then diluted the
solution with water, and precipitated the magnesia by an ex
cess of ammonia; from the precipitate, after being heated to
redness, was estimated the quantity of magnesia. To the fil
tered solution was added a solution of a salt of magnesia (with
proper precautions) to precipitate the remainder of the phos
phoric acid, and from this precipitate, as well as the former,
was estimated the quantity of the POs. A second quantity
was taken for the determination of the soda, which was dis
solved in concentrated sulphuric acid, diluted with water, and
precipitated by an excess of ammonia. The filtered solution,
containing phosphoric acid, was then precipitated by acetate
of lead, the excess of lead by sulphuretted hydrogen, and the
soda in the solution evaporated and estimated as a sulphate,
which gave me the following results:—

    The different result obtained by Professor Gregory no doubt
arose from the method upon which his examination of this
 salt was conducted, viz. by determining the amount of mag
nesia present, and considering the loss on the weight of sub
stance used to represent phosphoric acid, and probably from
not thinking at the time of the presence of a salt of soda in
bones.
    With regard to the phosphoric acid prepared as above, after
 the salt has ceased to form, I find that it is not yet quite pure,
 but contains traces of magnesia as well as soda, and therefore
 this process will always yield an acid containing more or less
 of these substances.
    Under the impression that the phosphoric acid obtained
by this process was pure, I attempted to prepare with it the
metaphosphates of nickel and cobalt, by adding the sulphates
of these bases to an excess of the acid, and heating as before
to upwards of 600°F., with the idea that they might be de
posited in a somewhat similar manner to the metaphosphate
of magnesia. This I found on analysis not to be the case, as
the salts which I obtained in this way were not the pure me
taphosphates, but double salts in combination with soda,
closely allied in their composition to Gregory’s salt.
    The nickel compound obtained in this way was deposited
in the form of a greenish-yellow, anhydrous powder, insoluble
in water and diluted acids, but soluble in concentrated sul
phuric acid.
   The analysis of this salt was made by fusing with carbo
nate of soda, and treating the fused mass with water to sepa
rate the metallic oxide from the alkaline phosphate. A second
quantity was taken for the determination of soda, which I dis
solved in concentrated sulphuric acid, then diluted with water,
and precipitated the solution containing phosphoric acid by
acetate of lead, and the excess of lead in the filtered solution
by sulphuretted hydrogen. To the filtered solution was then
added an excess of ammonia with sulphuret of ammonium to
precipitate the nickel, and the solution containing soda was
evaporated and determined as a sulphate.

LI.    On the Amount of Sulphur and Phosphorus in various
   Agricultural Crops. By HENRY CLIFToM Sor By, Esq.4.
HAVING thought it highly probable that in the ordinary
      method of estimating the amount of sulphur and phos
phorus in plants, viz. by burning them and analysing their
ashes, there might be in many cases a loss from portions
being rendered volatile by contact with combustible matter
at a high temperature, I was induced to commence a series
of analyses, employing a method against which there was no
such objection, and, as will be seen, the quantities really pre
sent in various plants are much greater than has been hitherto
anticipated. Having obtained a proper specimen, one por
tion of known weight was dried at 212°F. and weighed, and
another in precisely the same condition was employed for the
analysis, the amount which I generally used varying with the
dryness of the substance from 200 grs. to 500 grs., which
was cut into pieces if necessary, and introduced into a flask,
and carefully heated with pure nitric acid, a little water being
added if the substance was a dry one. No large quantity of
the acid is required, and a gentle heat is kept up until the
whole is digested down into a yellowish pulpy mass; water
is then added, the whole boiled, and when cold filtered and
washed, there being invariably a quantity of white fibrous
substance left undissolved.    To the yellowish solution thus
obtained nitrate of baryta was next added, and though at first
perhaps no precipitate was formed, sulphate of baryta was
gradually deposited, and after standing for a day or so, the
precipitate was collected on a filter, washed, dried, ignited and
weighed, from which the amount of sulphur was calculated.
It is well to ascertain whether it is pure sulphate of baryta,
by adding to it after weighing a little hydrochloric acid, since
sometimes there was present a little carbonate, which of course
produces effervescence, and when that is the case, which sel
dom occurred to any but the most trifling extent, the amount
is easily ascertained and a proper deduction made, to obtain
the true weight of the sulphate alone.
   To the solution filtered as above, I next added acetate of
lead in moderate quantity, and then caustic ammonia in slight
excess, filtered and washed the precipitate. When dry this
precipitate was carefully calcined in a porcelain crucible over
a lamp, at as low a temperature as convenient, stirring with
a glass rod until the whole was converted into a mixture of
metallic lead, oxide and phosphate of lead. These were then
dissolved in nitric acid, and ammonia added until a consider
lºcommunicated by the Chemical Society; having been read Dec. 7,

able precipitate of submitrate was formed, when on addin
acetic acid the whole of the phosphate alone was left insoluble,
which, after standing awhile, was collected on a filter, washed,
dried, ignited and weighed, and the amount of phosphorus
obtained by calculation. That this method is correct, and that
the phosphate which is thus obtained is Pbs POs, I have
proved by experiment.                                                                                             -
   It must be borne in mind that the amounts given below
are those of sulphur and phosphorus, I having thought it right
to give them as such, and not as sulphuric and phosphoric
acids, since most certainly they do not exist invariably as
such or as their salts in plants, and I therefore see no reason
why they should not be given as elements, like the amounts
of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen as usually given
in such analyses.
   The plants analysed, with only three exceptions, viz. the
rye, mangel-wurzel, and hops, were obtained from the fields
in which they were growing by myself, and hence I can vouch
for their freedom from impurities, and have no doubt the
others were as much so as possible.

    From the above analyses it will be seen how very much
the amounts vary in some cases, whereas in others they are
pretty constant. This variation may probably be occasioned
by that of the amount of phosphates and sulphates in the
soils. I have observed as a general rule, that the finer the
quality of the specimen the larger the proportions of sulphur
and phosphorus present; though in the case of lucern, in
which the phosphorus varies as much as in any crop of which
I have analysed a sufficient number of specimens to be able
to give an opinion, all the samples were growing luxuriantly.
It may be presumed that when the amounts vary so much,

           Phosphorus in various Agricultural Crops.        333
without apparently affecting the growth of the plant, the
particular constituent so varying is not of such importance for
the plant as when more constant.                      -
   It will be observed that in many plants different parts re
quire different constituents, which indeed is well known; as
for instance in the case of wheat it is probable that an abun
dance of sulphates in the soil would produce fine straw, and
of phosphates, fine grain, and the converse, other necessary
constituents being present.
   It may also, perhaps, be inferred from these analyses that
when grain is growing and ripening the amount of phosphorus
increases in greater proportion than the total weight, and di
minishes in the straw, the grain abstracting that constituent
from it. Similar inferences may perhaps be derived from the
above, many of which are given for such purposes.
   The table given below is a practical application of these
analyses, being intended to show the quantities of gypsum
and bone-phosphate of lime represented by the sulphur and
phosphorus which are removed annually from an acre of land
by the respective crops; being also that which should be
added to already fertile land to maintain it in that condition.
No allowance for what would be removed by drainage is made,
as that is too uncertain in its quantity, and cannot in many
cases be at all material, or else uncultivated natural lands
would long ago have become sterile. The quantities so re
moved are no doubt compensated for by the disintegration
of the substrata, and the superficial removal of exhausted soil
by washing.
   In such a calculation as this, however, it is affectation to
pretend to great exactness, the elements which unavoidably
enter into it being so variable. The quantities on which I
have calculated are the greatest which are shown in the
analyses, unless where the variations are given, when I have
taken the extremes, and the weight of crop per acre is what
I learn to be a medium between the very best and average
crops; but I am most willing to confess that I am not myself
practically acquainted with this part of my subject, and hence
cannot answer for their absolute correctness, but have ob
tained them from the best authorities accessible to me.    The
necessary alterations, however, are easily made by any one for
himself, from the data I have given, but I think they cannot
be far wrong. The quantities are pounds of gypsum and bone
phosphate of lime removed from one acre.

LII. Observations on the ovidizing power of Orygen when
    disengaged by means of Voltaic Electricity. By H. Kolbe,
    Esq., Ph.D.4                             -
TN describing in a former papert the properties of sesqui
      chloro-carbohyposulphuric acid, I stated that this body
resists the action of the most powerful oxidizing agents, such
as chromic acid, nitric acid, and even nitro-hydrochloric acid.
I likewise stated the change it undergoes by the action of
a voltaic current, when an easily oxidizable metal is used
for the positive pole. By this means another copulated acid
is produced, in which one or more equivalents of chlorine are
replaced by corresponding proportions of hydrogen.
    I have since observed that this acid is completely decom
posed on employing two platina plates as electrodes; by
which arrangement oxygen is disengaged at the positive pole.
The following details, which contain a more perfect account
of this observation, I hope will be acceptable to the Society.

   On decomposing a concentrated solution of sesquichloro
carbohyposulphate of potash by a strong voltaic current (ob
tained by four elements of Bunsen’s battery), at the com
mencement no hydrogen can be observed at the negative
pole in consequence of the formation of the above-mentioned
copulated acids, whilst chlorine, carbonic acid, and afterwards
oxygen, are evolved at the positive pole. At the moment de
composition commences a distinct acid reaction of the solu
tion is perceptible, owing to the formation of free hydrochlo
ric and sulphuric acids; in a later stage of the process, these
acids increasing in quantity, hydrogen appears at the negative
pole, until finally, after all the hydrochloric acid has been de
composed, and the disengagement of chlorine has ceased,
small octahedral crystals of perchlorate of potash are deposited
from the solution, which now contains a large amount of free
sulphuric acid and bisulphate of potash. The formation how
ever of perchloric acid in this process is always preceded by that
of chloric acid; for on evaporating the solution in an earlier
stage of the decomposition, beside the before-mentioned oc
tahedral crystals, the well-known rhombic plates of chlorate of
potash are obtained.
   The following formula represents the most probable de
composition sesquichloro-carbohyposulphuric acid undergoes
by the action of a voltaic current:—
                                  <U+017F> KO-HClO,

                                    2Cl.
    The production of perchloric acid in an acid solution is
 certainly a fact worthy of attention, for according to all the
 observations hitherto made, combination between chlorine
 and oxygen could only be effected in presence of a free alka
 line basis ready to unite with the newly-formed acid; but
 ascertained as it is by a great number of careful experiments,
 it is another proof of the unparalleled negative power of
 oxygen when evolved by means of voltaic action.
    These observations induced me to make the following ex
 periments.
    A neutral solution of chloride of potassium was decomposed
 in the same manner by a strong voltaic current; it imme
 diately became alkaline, whilst hydrogen and chlorine were
 disengaged. The formation of chlorate of potash, which took
 place under these circumstances, can evidently be considered
 only as the result of the ordinary chemical action of chlorine
 upon caustic potash. On mixing however a solution of chloride
 of potassium with sufficient sulphuric acid to set free all the

muriatic acid, and passing the voltaic current through it as
before, chlorate of potash was nevertheless formed, which was
subsequently converted into perchlorate of potash, ºn . ."
   The transformation of oxy-acids of chlorine, such as liquid
hypochloric acid (CIO), or of a solution of chlorate of potash,
into perchloric acid by means of voltaic action, has been men
tioned by Berzelius. I have ascertained, moreover, that when
a voltaic current is passed through hypochloric acid, espe
cially when previously mixed with some sulphuric acid, free
chloric and perchloric acids are formed, after the disengage
ment of a considerable quantity of chlorine, tº gº tºº gº”
   A concentrated solution of chloride of ammonium evolves
hydrogen at the negative pole but neither oxygen nor chlo
rine at the positive pole. But the surface of the platina.
plate representing the latter pole is covered with small yel
lowish oily drops of chloride of nitrogen, which as soon as the
two poles are brought into contact decomposes with a more
or less violent explosion, chlorine and nitrogen being evolved."
This experiment illustrates at once the formation of this coin
pound and its highly explosive character.          … tº “...º
   Cyanide of potassium if dissolved in water is easily oxidized
by a voltaic current, and converted into cyanate of potash,
but I did not succeed in obtaining a percyanate of potash.' I
was not more successful in endeavouring to form a fluorate of
potash from the fluoride of potassium by the same means.
  I have not prosecuted my experiments further upon inor
ganic substances, having from some observations on the be
haviour of organic compounds under the action of the voltaic
current obtained results of so much greater interest, as to in
duce me to give them my exclusive attention; and at a future"
time, when I have completed the investigation, I shall beg
leave to communicate it to the Chemical Society.

      MY DEAR SIR CHARLEs,
IN compliance with the promise I     made when attending your
    last anniversary meeting at Penzance, I now give you a more
decided opinion than I was then enabled to do, respecting the

     Sir R. I. Murchison on the Silurian Rocks of Cornwall. 337
 age of the lowest and oldest of the sedimentary rocks of Corn
 wall.
    Not having seen the fossils collected by Mr. Peach on the south
 coast of Cornwall, I then found it difficult to come to any other
 conclusion than that at which Professor Sedgwick and myself
 had long ago arrived; viz. that with the exception of the pre
 sence, in the north-eastern extremity of the county, of a portion
 of the culmiferous (carboniferous) trough of central Devon, the
 remaining and underlying strata of Cornwall were of the age of
 the Devonian or Old Red system. The few Cornish fossils which
 were then shown to me in your museum, were unquestionably
 similar to those with which I was formerly familiar in Devon
 shire and North Cornwall, as well as with those of the Rhenish
 provinces and the Eifel, which Professor Sedgwick and myself
 had shown to occupy a like geological position. They were, in
 fact, forms of the same type as those which, at the suggestion of
 Mr. Lonsdale and with the assistance of Mr. James Sowerby on
 one occasion*, and with the help of MM. de Werneuil and
 d’Archiac on anothert, we had published as characteristic of a
 group of intermediate characters, pertaining to strata lying beneath
 the carboniferous rocks and above the Silurian system. In a
 word, they were identical with some of the numerous fossils of
Devon and North Cornwall, published in the work of Professor
 Phillipsi; who, in pointing out in certain tracts the connexion
of this group with the carboniferous fossils, which he had so well
described, and in others with the Silurian forms I had published,
had also concluded that the great mass of fossiliferous strata
which rise up from beneath the culm measures of central Devon
were of the same intermediate characters. In his valuable Maps
of Cornwall and Devon, Sir H. De la Beche gave essentially the
same views of geological succession; and lastly, in his Report
upon the geological structure of that region, he described certain
detailed sections in the southern districts of Cornwall, to which
I will presently advert.
    In proposing the word “Devonian,” as applied to the inter
mediate strata in question, Professor Sedgwick and myself for
tunately thus qualified our meaning in regard to the extension
of such rocks into Cornwall:—“In asserting that the stratified
rocks of Devonshire and Cornwall are, upon a broad scale, the
equivalents of the Carboniferous and Old Red systems, we do not
however deny, that in certain tracts the lowest members of some
of these rocks may represent the upper division of the Silurian
system; for although we have as yet found few if any of the
fossils most typical of that system, we admit that when the sedi

338    Sir R. I. Murchison on the Silurian Rocks of Cornwall.
ments of a given epoch have been accumulated under peculiar
conditions, we must expect to find considerable variations in the
forms of animal life.      Again, we know that the rocks of this
region have undergone great changes in assuming their hard
and slaty character; and under such circumstances, the difficulty
of precisely limiting the boundary line of any portion of them is
prodigiously increased.*.”
   The truth is, that neither Sir H. De la Beche and Professor
Phillips, nor Professor Sedgwick and myself, had, at the time
when our works were published, seen any fossils from South
Cornwall sufficiently distinct to warrant the conclusion, that it
contained forms of an older type than those which had been
detected in North and South Devon and in the west of Cornwall.
It was therefore believed (and all geological maps were coloured
accordingly) that the zone of rocks occupying the southern
headlands of Cornwall, between the Bay of Plymouth on the east
and the Lizard Head on the west, were simply downward expan
sions of the fossiliferous “Devonian * strata.         In this state of
the question, your associate Mr. Peach began his labours in col
lecting fossils along the southern headlands of Cornwall. He
first ascertained that certain forms first discovered by Messrs.
Couch in the environs of Polperro were fishes, which he exhibited
at the Cork Meeting of the British Association, and concerning
which Professor Phillips and myself could only venture (so
obscure did they appear to us) to give the guarded, though sug
gestive opinion, which Mr. Peach has recorded in your thirtieth
Report. I then ventured to surmise, that these ichthyolites
might belong to the Upper Silurian rocks, the oldest in which
the remains of any vertebrated animals had yet been discovered,
because “they occurred in rocks forming the axis of South Devon
and Cornwall, which I had always considered to be the oldest in
that country.”                                                        -
    In pursuing his researches, Mr. Peach published in 1844 a
synopsis of the Cornish fossils from various localities, in which,
besides the ichthyolites of Polperro, he identified several mollusca
from Gorran Haven, Caerhayes, and Carm Gorran Bay, with
typical Silurian species. These were the fossils I was so anxious
to see at Penzance; and Mr. Peach having obligingly forwarded
them to me in London, I no sooner unpacked the box, than I
found that true Silurian and even Lower Silurian rocks existed in
Cornwall,—the proofs being the presence of certain simple-plaited
 Orthidae, which are invariably typical of that age. But although
Mr. Peach had come to a correct general conclusion, the specific
names he attached to the South Cornish fossils in your thirtieth
Reportare not correct. In respect to the ichthyolites from the slates

     Sir R. I. Murchison on the Silurian Rocks of Cornwall. 339
 of Polperro, Pentuan, &c., they have been referred to our mutual
friend Sir Philip Egerton, who is better versed in the classifica
tion of Agassiz than any of our countrymen, and he thus writes
to me concerning them:—“These remains are very enigmatical,
and I cannot identify a single specimen with any form I know.
 I do not think any one of the fragments belongs either to Ce
phalaspis or Holoptychius. The nearest approach is to Bothrio
 lepis. The dorsal fin named by Mr. Peach Onchus Murchisoni
 (Agass.) is not that species, as far as I can determine from the
description of Agassiz, unless it be a more perfect specimen than
he has seen. The longitudinal ribs, instead of being uniform
 (as figured by Agassiz), are notched, more after the manner of
 Ctenacanthus. The other Onchus may be O. tenuiserratus, but
I have not here the means of comparison. From the general
appearance of the collection, I should say they differ from any
 Old Red or Devonian fishes I have ever seen.”
    If these ichthyolites do not decisively help us to settle the age
of the Polperro zone of rocks, they are still of great interest, as
being the only group of fishes worth noticing which has been
found in the older rocks of Devonshire and Cornwall*, and also
as being associated with shells, which Mr. J. Sowerby identifies
with the Bellerophon trilobatus (Sil. Syst.) and the Lowomena
 lincta (Phillips). The first-mentioned of these shells is charac
teristic of the tile-stones in Herefordshire and Shropshire, and
is also found in strata of the same age in Cumberland (between
Kirby Lonsdale and Kendal), which form the uppermost band
of the Silurian rocks, or a transition from the Silurian into the
Devonian system. Now as Professor Sedgwick and myself had
inferred that the limestones of Looe and Fowey belonged to the
lower calcareous zone of Devonshire, and as the sections of Sir
 H. De la Beche show that the Polperro beds dip beneath the
Looe and Fowey rocks, the zoological evidences seem to harmo
nize with recorded physical facts, and we thus obtain reasonable
grounds for believing, that the lowest Devonian and the upper
most Silurian strata are exposed in the district which ranges
along the shores of that part of Cornwall, by Polperro, Pentuan,
&c.                                                                       -
    But if doubts should exist as to whether the Polperro slates
ought to be referred to the bottom of the Devonian or top of the
Silurian system, the discoveries of Mr. Peach in the headland of
the Dodman, and in the prolongation of its strata to Veryan Bay,
completely demonstrate, that still older and unquestionable Silu
rian rocks are there present. This is the district in which both

Professor Sedgwick and Sir H. De la Beche had noted the exist

    The fossils found by Mr. Peach at Gerrans Bay, as determined
by Mr. J. Sowerby, are Orthis lata, O. orbicularis, another spe
cies resembling O. plicata, and a fºurth which does not appear
to have been published. At Caerhayes, Mr. Peach has collected
other forms of Orthidae, one of which approaches nearest to the O.
alternata of the Silurian system. The remainder are not, however,
referrible, as he had supposed, to Leptana lata, Terebratula nucula,
Atrypa striatula, &c. The fossils from the Great Peraver quarries
in Gorran Haven, on the eastern face of the Dodman, are still
more decisive; for the species which Mr. Peach has named
 Orthis flabellulum and O. testudinaria both belong, unquestion
ably, to the Orthis (callactis B)+ calligramma (Sil. Syst.), and
with it is a form undistinguishable from the Orthis (canalis)
elegantula (Sil. Syst.). The only well-preserved trilobite in this
rock appears to me to be the Calymene pulchella? (Dalman); a
second species resembles C. Blumenbachii.                       .   .. .  .   .
    No one accustomed to the Palaeozoic rocks can throw his eye
over the fossils from these three localities, without at once recog
mising them as true Silurian types. They have an entirely di
 stinct facies from the fossils of the overlying Devonian system,
and none of the species so abundant in North-western Cornwall
 are here present. With my imperfect knowledge of the country,
it would be premature to say that subdivisions can be established
in this highly dislocated region, so as to define Upper and Lower
 Silurian bands. But it may safely be asserted, that the fossils
 of Gorran Haven are Lower Silurian types; there being no one
 species more eminently characteristic of the inferior portion of
that system than the Orthis calligramma, which in Shropshire and
the   jº.       Welsh counties is found to range downwards, from
the very uppermost beds of the Caradoc sandstone into the heart
 of the Snowdon slates, and is equally typical of the Lower Silurian
 rocks of Russia and Scandinavia.             At the same time, I do not
think that the Gorran Haven beds lie deep in the Lower Silurian

 but subsequent comparisons have shown that it is identical with the O. cal

    In like manner, the Orthis canalis of the Silurian system has proved to
 be the O. elegantula of Dalman; and the names of that author being the
 oldest, are now necessarily adopted.

sils only, I should say that, the º at Gerrans Bay with the
 Orthis orbicularis are younger than those of Peraver and Gorran
Haven. Time and careful researches will, however, determine
this question of detail, and     †. now express is my opinion,
that the quartzose rocks and killas which extend from the tracts
above alluded to, to the mouth      º     centre of the bay and harbour
of Falmouth (probably      <U+017F>º      further to the south-west), are of
Silurian age also.                           º
   The energy of Mr. Peach having thus afforded us the key b
which new lights are thrown upon the succession of d.º.
strata, I cannot but hope that, when the government geological
surveyors revisit Cornwall, they will define the exact demarca
tions between these Silurian masses and their overlying Devonian
neighbours. In fact, I have within these few days been talking
over this subject with my friend the Director-General of the Sur
vey, and he has pointed out to me on his detailed map, how,
from the enormous flexures which the strata have undergone in
their range from Devon into Cornwall, it is highly probable that
Silurian rocks (the equivalents of those alluded to) may be re
cognised in other parts of Cornwall. Thus, the quartzose rocks
of Pydar Down or Moor, to the north of St. Columb, which form
an east and west axis, dipping to the north and south under fossili
ferous Devonian strata, may (he thinks) prove to be also of Si
lurian age. But, forbearing to speculate on the probable results
of future researches, it is my decided belief, that the slaty rocks
constituting the great southern headland of Devonshire, at least
all the schists, &c. to the north of the Start Point, will eventually
be classed with the Silurian group of South Cornwall; for if the
Plymouth group of limestones, so prolific in animal remains,
afforded us the means of deciphering the age of less clearly de
veloped zones on the same horizon in Cornwall, the Silurian
types collected by Mr. Peach may enable us to carry out a more
correct classification in still older strata, from Cornwall into the
obscure southernmost promontory of Devonshire. In the mean
time, confining ourselves to what we now know, it is manifest
that Cornwall exhibits in ascending order from north to south,
1st, a band of true Silurian rocks; 2nd, a zone of intermediate
character, forming a transition between the Silurian and Devo
nian systems; 3rd, a copious Devonian system, characterized by
   * The Calymene pulchella (Dalm.) occurs both in the inferior part of the
Upper Silurian, and the higher part of the Lower Silurian, in Sweden, Silu
ria and Wales.

lower and upper limestones; and 4th, a limb of the culmiferous
or carboniferous basin of Devonshire.
   This view will, I trust, be perfectly intelligible to the members
of your Society who have occupied themselves with the considera
tion of this branch of geology, and on which Mr. R. Q. Couch
has recently written with perspicuity and talent. I doubt, how
ever, if anything I have stated will make a due impression upon
one of that number, my good-humoured antagonist the Rev. D.
Williams, whose views of the Cornish succession of strata seem
to be opposed to those of all his contemporaries. Geologists,
however, who have long lived in Cornwall, and have so well
illustrated its mineral structure, will, I am persuaded, be the
first to admit the value of the Palaeozoic classification, which
having been worked out and established in tracts exempt from
much dislocation and alteration, has been so applied, as to enable
us to interpret the true history of the highly convulsed and me
tamorphosed rocks of their county. It is, in fact, the greatest
triumph which could have been anticipated on the part of those
who have steadily proceeded from the known to the unknown.
    Looking from your own country to the opposite side of the
channel, you are doubtless well-aware that there is the strongest
analogy between the slates and granites of Cornwall and those
of Brittany and Normandy. Many persons have remarked upon
the strong resemblance between the Mounts St. Michael in the
two countries; and no one can have traversed these two regions,
without perceiving that, just as they evidently belong to the
 same mineral type, so are their respective inhabitants descended
from a common stock, whose names of places have passed down
to their French and English descendants. The existence of
 Caradoc sandstones and other Silurian rocks in that part of
 France having been already indicated (Devonian and carboni
 ferous strata being also abundantly developed), their discovery
 in Cornwall is a happy addition to that union of geological and
 historical records, by which these widely-separated residences of
 the Celtic race are illustrated.
    With regard to the highly mineralized or metamorphosed
 conditions of great portions of the killas and sandstone of Corn
 wall, I can do little more than refer you to the few observations
 I made at your anniversary meeting, and of which a brief abstract
 has appeared in your newspapers. There are, as you well said
 in your anniversary discourse, many analogies between the me
 tamorphic rocks of Cornwall on the one hand and those of Scan
 dinavia and the Ural mountains on the other; whilst the paral
 lel is now drawn closer by the recent discovery of the Cornish
 Silurian rocks. , Your last erupted granites, elvans, and porphy
 ries, have played exactly the same part in traversing your Palaeo

   Sir R. I. Murchison on the Silurian Rocks of Cornwall.         343
zoic sediments, as like rocks have done in Norway. Cornwall
may also be compared to large portions of Siberia, and notably
to the Ural mountains, whose chief eruptions have taken place
through deposits of Silurian, Devonian, and carboniferous age.
In both countries the eruptive rocks are granites, porphyries,
greenstones and serpentines: even in their superficial accumula
tions there is this striking resemblance, that the Cornish detritus
and gravel (as clearly pointed out by Mr. Carne) is purely local,—
the county being quite as exempt from all far-transported mate
rials as the Ural mountains and Siberia.     With this absence of
all foreign transport or drift, Cornwall is as instructive as the
Ural in never exhibiting those “roches moutonnées’’ and those
polished and striated surfaces which have (in my opinion) been
so erroneously referred to the action of land glaciers, in all those
low regions of the earth, where they have clearly been caused by
the action of powerful aqueous drift, in the manner I have else
where attempted to explain%.
   Your stanniferous gravel bears, indeed, precisely the same re
lations to your granite and killas, as the auriferous deposits of
the Ural to the eruptive and schistose rocks of that chain. Both
are mere local, shingle accumulations, derived from veinstones
which have been denuded from the surface of adjacent crystalline
rocks. With these analogies there is however a marked distinc
tion between Siberia and Cornwall. All richly auriferous chains
(Humboldt first remarked the fact) have a meridian direction, as
in the Ural, and various north and south parallel ridges in Si
beria and other parts of the globe. The axis of Cornwall, on the
contrary, is transverse to that direction, viz. from E.N.E. to
W.S.W.; and though containing copper ore in common with
the Russian mountains, it differs from them in not producing
gold or platinum ; whilst it is peculiarly distinguished by con
taining tin, which is unknown in the Ural. Let us hope that
the day is fast approaching, when the cause of the production of
such striking phaenomena as these will receive some explanation
at the hands of those physical philosophers, who are advancing
a line of research in which your own countryman Mr. R. W. Fox
has already so distinguished himself. But if gold does not exist
(in any appreciable quantity at least) in your otherwise richly
endowed mineral county, there are, I am happy to say, good
grounds for hope, that in their most distant great colony English
men may find it abundantly. In an address to the Royal Geo
graphical Society, delivered in May 1845, when commenting

LIV. On the Production of Light by Heat. By John
   WILLIAM DRAPER, M.D., Professor ºf Chemistry in the
   University of New York *, nº 2 j . . . . . . : . . . . .
Ahº the phaenomenon of the production of light
      by all solid bodies, when their temperature is raised to a
certain degree, is one of the most familiar in chemistry, no
person so far as I know has hitherto attempted a critical in
vestigation of it. The difficulties environing the inquiry are
so great, that even among the most eminent philosophers a
diversity of opinion has prevailed respecting some of the lead
ing facts. Thus Sir Isaac Newton fixed the temperature at
which bodies become self-luminous at 635°, Sir Humphry
Davy at 812°, Mr. Wedgwood at 947°, and Mr. Daniell at
980°." As respects the nature of the light einitted there are
similar contradictions. In some philosophical works of con
siderable repute, it is stated that when a solid begins to shine
it first emits red and then white rays; in others it is asserted
that a mixture of blue and red light is the first that appears.
   I have succeeded in escaping or overcoming many of the
difficulties of this problem, and have arrived at satisfactory
 solutions of the main points; and as the experiments now to
 be described lead to some striking and perhaps unexpected
analogies between light and heat, they commend themselves
 to our attention as having a bearing on the question of the
 identity of those imponderable principles. It is known that
 heretofore I have been led to believe in the existence of car
dinal distinctions, not only between these but also other im
 ponderable agents; and I may therefore state, that when this
 investigation was first undertaken, it was in the expectation
 that it would lead to results very different from those which
 have actually arisen.
    The following are the points on which I propose to treat: —
    1. To determine the point of incandescence of platinum,
 and to prove that different bodies become red-hot at the same
 temperature.
    2. To determine the colour of the rays emitted by self
 luminous bodies at different temperatures. This is done by
 the only reliable method—analysis by the prism.
    From these experiments it will appear, that as the tempe
 rature rises the light increases in refrangibility; and making
 a due allowance for the physiological imperfection of the eye,
 the true order of the colours is red, orange, yellow, green,
 blue, indigo, violet.

   3. To determine the relation between the brilliancy of the
light emitted by a shining body and its temperature.
   Here we shall find that the intensity of the light increases
far more rapidly than the temperature. For example, plati
num at 2600° emits almost forty times as much light as it
does at 1900°.
   As I prefer to give a complete description of the apparatus
employed in these investigations after the general results are
stated, it is sufficient here to understand that the source of
light is in all instances a very thin strip of platinum 1:35 inch
long and ºth of an inch wide, brought to the temperature
under investigation by a voltaic current. Platinum was se
lected from its indisposition to oxidize, and its power of resist
ing a high temperature without fusion.
   The slip of platinum, thus to be brought to different tem
peratures by an electric current of the proper force, was
fastened at one end to an inflexible support, and at the other
was connected with a delicate lever-index, which enabled me
to determine its expansion, and thereby its temperature. For
this purpose I have used the coefficient of dilatation of Dulong
and Petit. The temperatures here given are upon the hypo
thesis of the invariability of that coefficient at all thermometric
degrees; they are therefore to some extent in error.
   By the aid of resisting wires of different lengths and a
rheostat, I was able to vary the force of the electric current in
the platinum, and thereby vary its temperature. My first
attempts were to discover the point at which the metal begins
to emit light.
   The platinum and the voltaic battery were placed in a dark
room, the temperature of which was 60°; and after I had re
mained there a sufficient length of time to enable my eyes to
become sensible to feeble impressions of light, I caused the
current to pass, gradually increasing its force, until the pla
tinum was visible. In several repetitions of this experiment
it was uniformly found that the index to which the platinum
was attached stood at the eighth division when this took place.
The metal had therefore dilated gº of its length; the eleva
tion of its temperature was about 917°, which added to the
existing height of the thermometer, 60°, gives for the tempe
rature of incandescence 977° F.
   To the correctness of the number it may be objected, that
owing to the narrowness of the metallic strip it is not well
calculated to make an impression on the eye when the light it
emits is so feeble; nor can we take the dilatations given by
the index, as representing the uniform temperature of the
whole platinum, which must necessarily be colder near its

       Prof. Braper on the production of Light by Heat. 347
points of support, by reason of the conducting power of the
metals to which it is attached.                        -
    Physiological considerations would also lead us to suspect
that the self-luminous temperature must vary with different
eyes. The experiments of Bouguer, hereafter to be referred
to, indisputably show that some persons are much more sen
sitive to the impressions of light than others. So far as my
limited investigation of this matter has gone, I have not how
ever found appreciable differences in the estimate of the tem
perature of incandescence. Different individuals, observing
the platinum, have uniformly perceived it at the same time.
    Against the number 977° it may also be objected, that an
timony melts at a much lower temperature, and yet emits
light before it fuses. If this statement were true, it would
lead us to believe that all bodies have not the same point of
incandescence. But I think the experiments of Mr. Wedg
wood on gold and earthenware are decisive of that question;
 and, moreover, I have reason to believe that the melting
point of antimony is much higher than commonly supposed.
    With a view of determining directly whether different bodies
 vary in their point of incandescence, I took a clean gun-barrel,
 and having closed the touch-hole, exposed the following sub
stances in it to the action of the fire:–platinum, chalk, marble,
fluor spar, brass, antimony, gas-carbon, lead; each specimen
 was small; the platinum was in the form of a coil of stout
 Wire.                                              -
    When one of these bodies was placed in the gun-barrel
and the temperature raised, it is clear that any difference in
their point of incandescence would be detected by the eye.
 Thus, if the ignition of platinum required a higher degree
than iron, on looking down the barrel the coil of wire should
 be dark, when the barrel itself begins to shine; or, if the pla
 tinum was incandescent first, the wire should be seen before
 the barrel is visibly hot; and these results might be corro
 borated by observing the inverse phaenomena, when the barrel
 is taken from the fire and suffered to cool.               -
     With respect to platinum, brass, antimony, gas-carbon and
 lead, they all became incandescent at the same time as the
 iron barrel itself. I could not discover the slightest difference
 between them, either in heating or cooling; and it is worthy
 of remark, that the lead was of course in the liquid condition.
 But the chalk and marble were visible before the barrel was
 red-hot, emitting a faint white light; and the fluor spar still
 more strikingly so, its light being of a beautiful blue; and
 even when the barrel had become bright red I could still see
 the spar, which had decrepitated to a coarse powder, by its

 848 Prof. Draper on the production of Light by Heat.
 <U+017F>aint blue rays, ... In these cases, it was not, however, incan
 descence but phosphorescence that was taking place. I infer
 then that all solids, and probably melted metals, shine at the
 same thermometric point. -------
    The temperature of incandescence seems to be a natural
 fixed point for the thermometer; and it is very interesting to
 remark how nearly this point coincides with 1000° of the
 Fahrenheit thermometer, when Laplace's coefficient for the
 dilatation of platinum is used. Upon that coefficient the
 point of incandescence is 1006°F.
    In view of these considerations, and recollecting that the
 number given by Daniell is 980°, and that of Wedgwood 947°,
 I believe that 977° is not very far from the true temperature
 at which solids begin to shine. It is to be understood, of
 course, that this is in a very dark room.
    I pass now to the second proposition. The rays emitted by
 the incandescent platinum were next received on a flint glass
 prism, placed so as to give the minimum deviation, and after
 dispersion viewed in a small telescope. A movement could be
 given to the telescope, which was read off on an annexed scale.
 However, instead of bringing the parts of the spectrum under
 measurement to coincide with the wires stretched across, the
 field of the instrument, I found it more satisfactory to deter
 mine them by bringing them to one or other of the edges of
 the field; a process well adapted to ascertain the position of
 the extreme rays, the faint light of which contrasted well with
 the darkness by which it was surrounded. They could not
 have been so accurately seen while the rest of the spectrum
 was in view; and as it was absolutely necessary to have fixed
 points of reference, that all the observations might be brought
 to a common standard of comparison, and as there are no
 fixed lines in the light of incandescence, such as are in the
 sunshine and daylight, I therefore previously determined the
 position of the fixed lines in a spectrum formed by a ray of
 reflected daylight which passed through a fissure gºth of an
 inch wide and one inch long, occupying exactly the position
 subsequently to be occupied by the incandescent platinum.
..Fig. 1 represents the results of this observation.
    The strip of platinum was now placed in the position of the
 fissure which had given the spectrum fig. 1, and its tempera
 ture was raised by the passage of a voltaic current. Although
 I could distinctly see the metal when the heat had reached
about 1000° by the naked eye, yet the loss of light in passing
 the prism and telescope was so great that I found it necessary
 to carry the temperature to 1210° before a satisfactory obser
 vation could be made. At this point the spectrum extended

orange, and a tint which may be designated as gray. There
was nothing answering to a yellow. The first rays visible
through this apparatus may therefore be designated as red and
greenish gray; the former commencing at the line B, and the
latter continuing to F. The magnitude and other relations
of this spectrum are given in fig. 3.
    The voltaic current was now increased, and the tempera
ture rose to 1325°. The red end of the spectrum remained
nearly as before, but the more refrangible extremity reached
to the position of the little fixed line d. Traces of the yellow
were now visible; and, with a certain degree of distinctness,
I could see red, orange, yellow, green, and a fringe of blue.
 Fig. 4 shows the result.
    The temperature was now carried to 1440°. I thought the
red extremity was advancing more to the line A: the blue
had undergone a well-marked increase. It reached consider
 ably beyond the line G, as shown in fig. 5.                                                                                -        -
    On bringing the platinum to 2130° all the colours were
 present, and exhibited considerable brilliancy. Their extent
 was somewhat shorter than that of the daylight spectrum, as
 is seen in fig. 6.                                                                     . . . . . . . .
    Having thus by repeated experiments ascertained the con
 tinued extension of the more refrangible end as the tempera
 ture rose, it became necessary to obtain observations for points
 below 1210°, the limit of visibility through the telescope. I
 therefore carried the prism nearer to the platinum, and look
 ing with the unassisted eye directly through it at the refracted
 image, I found it could be distinctly seen at a temperature as

350 Prof. Draper on the production of Light by Heat.
low as 1095°. Under these circumstances the total length
could not be compared by direct measurement with the other
observations, and the result given in fig. 2 is from the best
judgement I was able to form : the colours were red and
greenish-gray.
   The gray rays emitted by platinum just beginning to shine
appear to be more intense than the red; at all events the
wires in the field of the telescope are more distinctly seen
upon them than upon the other colour. I give them the de
signation of gray, for they appear to approach that tint more
closely than any other; and yet it is to be remarked that they
are occupying the position of the yellow and green regions.
   Already we have encountered a fact of considerable import
ance. The idea, that as the temperature of a body rises it
begins to emit rays of increasing refrangibility, has obviously
to be taken with a certain restriction.      Instead of first the
red, then the orange, then the yellow, &c. rays, in succession
making their appearance, in which case the spectrum should
regularly increase in length as the temperature rises, we here
find, at the very first moment it is visible to the eye, it yields
a spectrum reaching from the fixed line B to nearly F; that
is to say, equal to about two-thirds the whole length of the
interference spectrum, and almost one-half of the prismatic.
   It is to be remarked, that while the more refrangible end
undergoes a great expansion, the other extremity exhibits a
corresponding though a less change. As very important
theoretical conclusions depend on the proper interpretation of
this fact, we must not forget that, to a certain extent, it may
be an optical deception, arising from the increased brilliancy
of the light, While the rays are yet feeble, the extreme ter
minations may be so faint that the eye cannot detect them;
but as the intensity rises, they become better marked, and an
apparent elongation of the spectrum is the consequence.
   It is agreed by optical writers, that to the human eye the
yellow is the brightest of the rays. In the prismatic spectrum
the true relationship of the colours is not perceived, because
the less refrangible are crowded together, and the more re
frangible unduly spread out. But in the interference spectrum,
where the colours are arranged side by side in the order of
their wave-lengths, the centre is occupied by the most lumi
nous portion of the yellow; and from this point the light de
clines away on one side in the reds, and on the other in the
blues, the terminations being equidistant from the centre of
the yellow space.
   Now if the rays coming from shining platinum were passed
through a piece of glass, on which parallel lines had been

       Prof. Draper on the production of Light by Heat. 351
drawn with a diamond point, so as to give an interference
spectrum, even admitting the general results of the foregoing
experiments to be true, viz. that as the temperature rises
rays of a higher refrangibility are emitted, it is obvious that
it by no means follows that the first ray visible should be the
extreme red. Our power of seeing that depends on its having
a certain intensity. Even when it has assumed that extreme
brilliancy which it has in a solar beam it is barely visible.
 We ought therefore to expect that rays of a higher refran
gibility should first be seen, because they act more energeti
cally on our organ of vision; and as the temperature rises,
the spectrum should undergo a partial elongation in the direc
tion of its red extremity.
    I may here remark, that the general result of these experi
ments coincides exactly with that of M. Melloni respecting
heat at lower thermometric points. In his second memoir”,
he shows that when the rays from copper at 390° and from
incandescent platinum are compared by transmission through
a rock-salt prism, as the temperature rises the refrangibility
of the calorific emanations correspondingly increases. Those
philosophers who regard light and heat as the same agent,
will therefore see in this coincidence another argument in
favour of their opinion.                                   -
    In view of the foregoing facts I conclude, that, as the tem
perature of an incandescent body rises, it emits rays of light of
an increasing refrangibility; and that the apparent departure
from this law, discovered by an accurate prismatic analysis,
is due to the special action of the eye in performing the func
tion of vision.
    As the luminous effects are undoubtedly owing to a vibra
tory movement executed by the molecules of the platinum, it
seems from the foregoing considerations to follow, that the
frequency of those vibrations increases with the temperature.
    In this observation I am led by the principle, that “to a
particular colour there ever belongs a particular wave-length,
and to a particular wave-length there ever belongs a particular
colour;” but in the analysis of the spectrum made by Sir D.
Brewster by the aid of absorptive media, this principle is indi
rectly controverted; that eminent philosopher showing that
red, yellow, blue, and consequently white light, exist in every
part of the spectrum. This must necessarily take place when
a prism which has a refracting face of considerable magnitude
is used; for it is obvious that a ray falling near the edge, and
one falling near the back, after dispersion, will paint their
several spectra on the screen; the colours of the one not co

inciding with, but overlapping the colours of the other. In
such a spectrum there must undoubtedly be a general com
mixture of the rays; but may we not fairly inquire whether,
if an elementary prism were used, the same facts would hold
good; or, if the anterior face of the prism were covered by a
screen, so as to expose a narrow fissure parallel to the axis of
the instrument, would there be <U+017F>ound in the spectrum it gave
every colour in every part, as in Sir David Brewster's original
experiment? M. Melloni has shown how this very consi
deration complicates the phaenomena of radiant heat; and it
would seem a very plausible suggestion that the effect here
pointed out must occur in an analogous manner for the phae
nomena of light.
   I proceed now to the third branch of the inquiry, to ex
amine the relation between the temperatures of self-luminous
bodies and the intensity of the light they emit, premising it
with the following considerations.
   The close analogy which is traced between the phaenomena
of light and radiant heat lends countenance to the supposition,
that the law which regulates the escape of caloric from a body
will also determine its rate of emission of light. Sir Isaac
Newton supposed that whilst the temperature of a body rose
in arithmetical progression, the amount of heat escaping from it
increased in a geometrical progression. The fallacy of this was
subsequently shown by Martin, Erxleben, and Delaroche; and
finally Dulong and Petit gave the true law, “when a body cools
in vacuo, surrounded by a medium whose temperature is con
stant, the velocity of cooling for excess of temperature in arith
metical progression increases as the terms of a geometrical
progression, diminished by a constant quantity.” The intro
duction of this constant depends on the operation of the theory
of exchanges of heat; for a body, when cooling under the
circumstances here given, is simultaneously receiving back a
constant amount of heat from the medium of constant tempe
rature.
   Whilst Newton's law represents the rate of cooling of bodies,
and therefore the quantities of heat they emit, when the range
of temperature is limited, and the law of Dulong and Petit
holds to a wider extent, there are in our inquiry certain cir
cumstances to be taken into account not contemplated by
those philosophers. Dulong and Petit throughout their me
moir regard radiant heat as a homogeneous agent, and look
upon the theory of exchanges, which is indeed their starting
point and guide, as a very simple affair. But the progress of
this department of knowledge since their times has shown,
that precisely the same modifications as are found in the co

         Prof. Draper on the production of Light by Heat. 358
  lours of light, occur also for heat; a factºconveniently desig
 nated by the phrase <U+017F>º ideal coloration of heat;” and further,
  that the colour of the heat emitted depends upon the tem
  perature of the tradiating source.” It is one thing to inves
 tigate the phaenomena of the exchanges of heat-rays of the
  same colour, and another-where the colours are different.” A.
 perfect theory of the exchanges of heat must include the prin
 ciple of ideal coloration, and, of course, so too must a law of
 cooling applicable to any temperature, i<U+017F> -i                          º
      There is another fact to some extent considered by Dulong
 and Petit, but not of such weight in their investigations, where
 the range of temperature was small, as in ours, where it rises
 as high as nearly 3000° F.; I mean the difference of specific
 heat of the same body at different temperatures.” At the high
 temperatures considered in this memoir, there cannot be a
 doubt that the capacity of platinum for heat is far greater than
 that at a low point. This therefore must control its rate of
 calorific emission, and probably that for light also.                       ---
  , a From these and similar considerations, we should be pre
 pared to discover that as the temperature of an incandescent
 solid rises, the intensity of the light emitted increases very
 rapidly.”                                             --------                  **
     I pass now to the experimental proofs which substantiate
 the foregoing reasoning.                             -i-º-3-                      - -- "

   Let there be placed at a certain distance from a screen of
white paper, a candle so arranged as to throw the shadow of
a ruler, or other opake body, on the screen.                        If a second can
dle be placed also in front of the paper and nearer than the
former, there is a certain distance at which its light completely
obliterates all traces of the shadow. This distance is readily
found; for the disappearance of the shadow can be determined
with considerable exactness. When the lights are equal,
Bouguer found that the relative distances were as 1:8; he
inferred therefore, correctly, that in the case of his eye, the
effect of a given light was imperceptible when it was in pre
sence of another sixty-four times as intense. The precise
number differs according to the sensibility of different eyes,
but for the same organ it is constant.                       -          * *  * *                   :*
   Upon a paper screen I threw the shadow of a piece of cop
per, which intercepted the rays of the incandescent platinum :
then taking an Argand lamp, surrounded by a cylindrical
metal shade through an aperture in which the light passed,
 and the flame of which I had found by previous trial would
continue for an hour almost of the same intensity, I approached
it to the paper until the shadow cast by the copper disappeared.
The distance at which this took place was then measured, and
the temperature of the platinum determined.                                                 -
    The temperature of the platinum was now raised; the s
dow became more intense, and it was necessary to bring the
 Argand lamp nearer before it was effaced. When this took
 place the distance of the lamp was again measured, and the
 temperature of the platinum again determined. A
    In this manner I obtained several series of results, one of
 which is given in the following table. They exhibited a more
 perfect accordance among each other than I had anticipated.

    In this table the first column gives the temperatures under
examination in Fahrenheit degrees; the second and third the
 distances of the Argand lamp from the screen, in English in
 ches, in two different sets of experiments; the fourth the mean
 of the two; and the fifth, the corresponding intensity of the
light.                         * *
    From this it is at once perceived, that the increases in the
intensity of the light, though slow at first, become very rapid
as the temperature rises. At 2590° the brilliancy is more than
thirty-six times as great as it is at 1900°.
    Thus, therefore, the theoretical anticipation which we
founded on the analogy of light and heat is completely veri
fied; and we discover that as the temperature of a self-lumi
nous solid rises, it emits light in a greater proportion than
would correspond to the mere difference of temperature. To
place that analogy in a still more striking point of view, I will
here introduce some experiments I have made in relation to
radiant heat. No chemist, so far as I am aware, has hitherto
published results for high temperatures, or endeavoured to
establish, through an extensive scale, the principle of Dela
roche, that “the quantity of heat which a hot body gives off
in a given time by way of radiation to a cold body, situated
at a distance, increases, other things being equal, in a progres
sion more rapid than the excess of the temperature of the first
above that of the second.”
   As my object on the present occasion is chiefly to illustrate
the remarkable analogy between light and heat, the experi
ments now to be related were arranged so as to resemble the
foregoing; that is to say, as in determining the intensities of
light emitted by a shining body at different temperatures, I
had received the rays upon a screen placed at an invariable
distance, and then determined their value by photometric
methods; so, in this case, I received the rays of heat upon a
screen placed at an invariable distance, and determined their
intensity by thermometric methods. In this instance the screen
employed was in fact the blackened surface of the thermo
electric pile. It was placed at a distance of about one inch
from the slip of incandescent platinum, a distance sufficient to
keep it from any disturbance from the stream of hot air arising
from the metal; care also was taken that the multiplier itself
was placed so far from the rest of the apparatus, that its
astatic needles could not be affected by the voltaic current

igniting the platinum, or the electro-magnetic action of the
wires used to modify the degrees of heat.                      -
   The experiments were conducted as follows:—The needles
of the thermo-multiplier standing at the zero of their scale,
the voltaic current was passed through the platinum, which
immediately rose to the corresponding temperature, and ra
diated its heat to the face of the pile. The instant the current
passed, the needles of the multiplier moved, and kept steadily
advancing upon the scale. At the close of one minute, the
deviation of the needle and the temperature of the platinum
were simultaneously noted, and then the voltaic current was
stopped.
   Sufficient time was now given for the needle of the multi
plier to come back to zero. This time varied in the different
cases, according to the intensity of the heat to which the pile
had been exposed: in no instance, however, did it exceed
six minutes, and in most cases was much less. A little con
sideration will show that the usual artifice employed to drive
the needles back to zero, by warming the opposite face of the
pile, was not admissible in these experiments.
   The needles having regained their zero, the platinum was
brought again to a given temperature, and the experiment
conducted as before. The following table exhibits a series of
these results.

number being the mean of several successive trials; and the
fourth the mean of the two. It therefore gives the radiant
effect of the incandescent platinum upon the therino-multiplier
for the different temperatures.                                -
   Of course it is understood that I here take the angular de
viations of the needle as expressing the force of the thermo
electric current, or in other words, as being proportional to
the temperatures. This hypothesis, it is known, is admissible.
   It therefore appears that the quantity of heat radiated by
incandescent platinum at 980° being taken as unity, it will
have increased at 1440° to 2-5; at 1900° to 7-8; and at 2360°
to 17-8, nearly: the rate of increase is therefore very rapid.
Further, it may be remarked, as illustrative of the same fact,
that the increased quantity of heat radiated by a mass of pla
tinum in passing from 1000° to 1300°, is nearly equal to the
amount it gives out in passing from common temperatures up
to 1000°.
   I cannot here express myself with too much emphasis on
the remarkable analogy between light and heat which these
experiments reveal. The march of the phaenomena in all
their leading points is the same in both cases. The rapid
increase of effect as the temperature rises is common to both.
   It is not to be forgotten, however, that in the case of light
we necessarily measure its effects by an apparatus which pos
sesses special peculiarities. The eye is insensible to rays
which are not comprehended within certain limits of refrangi
bility. In these experiments, it is requisite to raise the tem
perature of the platinum almost to 1000° before we can dis
cover the first traces of light. Measures obtained under such
circumstances are dependent on the physiological action of
the visual organ itself, and hence their analogy with those ob
tained by the thermometer becomes more striking, because
we should scarcely have anticipated that it could be so com
plete.

     The other extremity of the platinum b is fastened to a de
 licate lever b.f, which plays on an axis at g, the axis working
 in brass holes supported on a block h. Immediately beneath
 the platinum strip, and in metallic communication with it, a
  straight copper wire dips down into the mercury cup m; on
  this wire there is a metal ball n, weighing about 100 grains.
  The further end of the index plays over a graduated ivory
  scale p p, which is supported on a block q, and can be moved
  a little up and down, so as to bring its zero to coincide with
  the index at common temperatures.
     The action of the instrument is readily understood. In the
  mercury cup e dip one of the wires N of a Grove's battery of
  three or four pairs, the other wire P being dipped into the
  cup m. The current passes through the platinum, which im
  mediately expands, the weight n lightly stretching it. The
  index f moves promptly over the scale, indicating the amount
  of expansion, and therefore the degree of heat. Remove the
  wire N out of its mercury cup e, the platinum instantly be
   comes cold, and pulls the lever to the zero point.

 be reached.          I found it convenient to intervene in the course

 be able to bring the index with precision to any degree, not
 withstanding slight changes in the force of the voltaic bat

      #he following        are the dimensions and measures of the in
 strument I have used:—Length of the platinum strip, 1:35
 inch; length of the part actually ignited, 1:14 inch; width of
 ditto, ºth of an inch; length of the index from its centre of
 motion to the scale, 7:19 inches; distance of the centre of
 motion of index from the insertion of the platinum at the point
 b, 22 inch; multiplying effect of the index, 32.68 times;
 length of each division on the ivory scale, '021 inch. From
 this it would appear, by a simple calculation, using the coeffi
 cient of dilatation of platinum given by Dulong and Petit,
 that each of the divisions here used is equal to 114.5 Fahren
 heit degrees. For the sake of perspicuity I have generally
 taken them at 115°.
      The Grove’s battery I have employed has platinum plates
 three inches long and three quarters wide; the zinc cylinders
 are two inches and a half in diameter, three high, and one
 third thick. As used in these experiments, it could maintain
 a current nearly uniform for an hour. I commonly employed
 four pairs.
      Among writers on optics, it has been a desideratum to ob
tain an artificial light of standard brilliancy. The preceding
experiments furnish an easy means of supplying that want,
and give us what might be termed a “unit-lamp.” A sur
face of platinum of standard dimensions, raised to a standard
temperature by a voltaic current, will always emit a constant
light. A strip of that metal, one inch long and gºth of an
inch wide, connected with a lever by which its expansion

might be measured, would yield at 2000° a light suitable for
most purposes. Moreover, it would be very easy to form
from it an available photometer, by screening portions of the
shining surface. An ingenious artist would have very little
difficulty, by taking advantage of the movements of the lever,
in making a self-acting apparatus, in which the platinum
should be maintained at a uniform temperature, notwith
standing any change taking place in the voltaic current.

LV. On the Acid contained in the North American Columbite.
                         By HENRY Rose”.                    - - -
THE columbite of North America has the same crystalline
       form as that from Bodenmais in Bavaria, but is distin
guished from it in general by a far lower specific gravity;
however, we find the same difference in the specific gravity of
the American mineral as occurs in the different crystals of the
Bodenmais columbite. The lightest crystals from the last
locality have the same specific gravity (5-704) as the heaviest
crystals from North America (5.708).
   I have already communicated two analyses of North Ameri
can columbites, of one of which however it was doubtful
whether it came from America. The following analysis of
American columbite was made by M. Grewink in my labora
tory; it yielded,—

Thespecific gravity in fragments was 5-323; in powder, 5.3202.
   This columbite comes nearest in composition and also in
specific gravity to that examined by M. Schlieper.
   I have on a former occasion shown that the different specific
gravity of the crystals of the Bavarian columbite was owing
to the different proportions of niobic and pelopic acids which
are found in the different crystals. The specific gravity of
these two acids is widely different, but unequally so, according
to the temperatures to which they have been exposed previous
to weighing.
   Owing to want of material, I found it impossible to make a

thorough examination of the two acids which are contained
in the North American columbite: I very soon ascertained,
after the discovery of niobic acid, that this was the principal
acid constituent in the American columbite, but I could not
determine whether it was mixed with pelopic or with tantalic
acid; I therefore addressed myself to Mr. B. Silliman of New
haven, who with the greatest readiness procured me a very
considerable quantity (half a pound) of this now very rare
mineral.
   A large quantity of this columbite was used for the prepara
tion of the acid.     When treated in the same manner as that
from the Bavarian columbite, it proved to consist principally
of niobic acid combined with pelopic acid; but the amount of
the latter was far smaller than in the Bodenmais mineral, so
that I do not think it would have been possible for me to have
examined the properties of pelopic acid so completely as was
necessary in order to recognise it as an essentially distinct acid
from tantalic acid, if I had had only the American mineral atmy
disposal. But both the acids were so perfectly identical in all
their properties with the two acids prepared from the Boden
mais mineral, that I did not find the least difference, even as
regards the specific gravity.                                 -
   As the specific gravity of pelopic acid is considerably higher
than that of niobic acid, when the two are heated in the same
manner, the higher specific gravity of the Bavarian columbite
is thus satisfactorily explained.                         -
   I have moreover found small quantities of tungstic acid in
the acids from the American columbite, as well as in those
from the Bodenmais mineral.

climate; but the want of instruments, as well as other more
pressing occupations, will, I hope, be a sufficient excuse for
the deficiency.                                       W. J. HENwooD.

May 11,         THEORY of Luminous Rays on the Hypothesis of
   1846.        Undulations. By the Rev. J. Challis, M.A., Plumian
Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in the Univer
sity of Cambridge.
   In this communication, the aether, which is supposed to be the
medium of the transmission of light, is regarded as a continuous fluid
substance, such that small increments of its pressure are proportional
to small increments of density, and is treated mathematically accord
ing to hydrodynamical principles. The author shows, by means of
the usual hydrodynamical equations, and by an additional equation
of continuity, the existence and necessity of which he has considered
in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions (vol. vii. part iii. pp.
385 and 386), that a given slender cylindrical portion of the fluid
may continue in motion without tendency to lateral spreading, while
all other parts remain at rest. It is shown, l, that the motion in
this filament of fluid may be propagated with a uniform velocity;
2, that in one straight line, which may be called its axis, the motion
is entirely longitudinal; 3, that at all other points the motion is
partly longitudinal and partly transversal; 4, that the motion is
vibratory, the vibrations both longitudinal and transversal following
the law of sines; 5, that the condensation (s) in any transverse plane,
at a point whose co-ordinates in that plane reckoned from the axis
are a and y, is given by the equation
                          d2s   d2s
                          dist ast gs=0,
g being a certain constant. It follows that the condensation in any
transverse plane, being determined by a partial differential equation,
is arbitrary, and by consequence that the transverse velocity varies
at a given time from point to point of any transverse plane in an
arbitrary manner. To obtain the foregoing equation, it is assumed
 that the condensation at any point of a transverse plane, has to the
condensation at the intersection of the plane with the axis, a ratio
not variable with the time.
    Each fluid filament in vibration is supposed in this theory to cor
 respond to a ray of light. The vibrations in different fluid filaments
 may co-exist, and consequently rays be propagated in the same direc
 tion independently of each other. A ray of common light has the
 condensation symmetrically arranged about the axis.
    May 25, 1846.-A Theory of the Polarization of Light on the
 Hypothesis of Undulations. By the same Author.
    This paper is a continuation of the foregoing. A ray in which
 the condensation is not arranged symmetrically about the axis is
 considered to be polarized. Polarization in this theory corresponds
 to difference of condensation in different directions transverse to the

 366               Cambridge Philosophical Society.
 axis of the ray. The sensation of light is due to the transverse vi
 brations. By assuming that the bifurcation of a ray takes place so
 that the transverse velocity at each point is resolved into two velocities
 at right angles to each other, and that these are respectively the
 velocities at the corresponding points of the two parts into which the
 ray is divided, Professor Challis finds,-1, that if the original ray be
 one of common light, the two parts are symmetrical about planes at
 right angles to each other passing through the axis, and are each of
 half the intensity of the original ray; 2, that if the original ray has
 been once polarized, the ratio of the two parts is equal to the square
 of the tangent of the angle which the plane of the second polariza
 tion makes with that of the first; 3, that whether the original ray
 be one of common light or a polarized ray, the two parts, on pursuing
 the same path, form a compound ray the intensity of which is in
 dependent of the difference of phase. According to this theory,
elliptically or circularly polarized light is produced whenever a ray
 of first polarization is divided into two parts which subsequently
pursue the same path in different phases. If the parts be made to
meet in the same phase, they constitute the original polarized ray.
Hence is explained the necessity of the analysing plate for the pro
duction of colours by polarized rays transmitted through thin pieces
of uniaxal or biaxal crystals. The compound rays, if received directly
by the eye on leaving the crystal, would be of the same intensity
whatever be the difference of phase.        But when they fall on the
plate, those incident in the same phase, being equivalent to rays of
first polarization, are incapable of reflexion, while the remainder,
which are incident in the form of elliptically or circularly polarized
light, are reflected in different degrees of intensity according to the
difference of phase.    The author states that he has extended this
theory to the phaenomena of double refraction.
   On a Change in the State of Vision of an Eye affected with a
mal-formation.
   Twenty years ago, the author communicated to the Society a state
ment of the effects of a mal-formation in his left eye. The rays of
light coming from a luminous point, and falling on the whole surface
of the pupil, do not converge to a point at any position within the
eye, but converge so as to pass-through two lines at right angles to
each other, and, in the ordinary position of the head, inclined to the
vertical, as formerly described (Transactions of the Society, vol. ii.).
As the luminous point is moved further from or nearer to the eye,
the image of the point becomes a straight line in one or other of the
positions above-mentioned. Since 1825 the inclinations of the two
focal lines to the vertical, their length, and their sharpness do not
appear to have undergone any sensible change, but the distances at
which the luminous point must be placed to bring the focal lines re
spectively exactly upon the retina are increased, having been formerly
3-5 and 6 inches, and being now 4.7 and 8.9 inches. Thus while
the shortsightedness of the eye is diminished the astigmatism remains
the same,

     The changes of value of any function of a, f(a), may be very
clearly, and for some purposes very usefully represented, by tracing
the curve defined by the equation z=f'(a); and the positive and
negative roots of the equation f (a)=0 will be the distances from
the origin at which the curve cuts the axis of a.              -
     In this memoir a similar method is applied to the representation
of the changes of value of a function of (a), corresponding not only
to real values of a, but also to values of the form a +y V -1. If we
make z=f (a + y V—1), and restrict ourselves to real values of 2,
the equation separates itself into two, which, it is shown, may be
represented symbolically by
*, * * ,                   =co (, )f()

and these will correspond to a curve of double curvature, the inter
sections of which with the plane of any will determine by the distance
of     º    points from the origin the imaginary roots of the equation
f(a)=0.

     2. The curve goes off into infinite branches, which lie in asymp

     3. Any plane parallel to the plane of ay cuts the curve in n points
and no more.             -
     From this last result the existence of n roots and no more for an
equation of n dimensions is the immediate result.
     Several well-known theorems are deduced from this view of the
subject, and are given as illustrations.
     The actual curves are traced, corresponding to the various cases
of the quadratic, the cubic, and the biquadratic equations, and to
the equation a "–1=0.
     In the conclusion of the memoir it is remarked that the results
obtained are not exclusively applicable to the case of algebraic
equations, and the methods are applied to the case of f(r)=sin r.
     The author trusts that the contents of this memoir, though not
adding to the number of known theorems, may yet be useful as
putting the subject in a new light, and as furnishing a method of
demonstrating the existence of the roots of algebraic equations more
simple and direct than any other which he has seen.

Pº.         HENRY, of Princeton, communicated to the American
     Philosophical Society, the result of a series of experiments on
electricity made last winter. They had reference, first, to the dis
charge of electricity through a long wire, connected with the earth
at the farther end; secondly, to the discharge of a jar through a
wire; and thirdly, to an attempt to account for the phaenomena of
dynamic induction.                 * **   *  *: *~ **       ---    -                      3
   Prof. Henry first showed, that when a charge of electricity is
given to one end of a wire, the different parts of the wire become
charged successively, as though a wave of electricity passed along it.
He then showed that the charge passed along the surface of the
wire, and not through its whole mass, as was supposed from the
analogy of galvanic conduction. Hence he inferred that dynamical
electricity obeys the same laws as the statical. He then detailed
some experiments upon the passage of electricity through plates, and
showed that when a charge was transmitted across a plate, the ten
sion was greatest at the edges, the electricity apparently exercising a
self-repelling action, while, if the charge were passed, through two
pieces of tinfoil, these slips attract each other.                     -            * , -at
   Prof. Henry believes that it may be justly inferred, from these ex
periments, that the attraction is due to ponderable matter, while the
repulsion is due to electricity; thus showing that electricity is a sepa
rate principle, and not a mere property of matter.                                       º
   Prof. Henry next passed to the subject of the discharge of a jar.
It was necessary, in his experiments, to get rid of the free electricity
arising from the thickness of the glass, and it occurred to him that
this might be done by removing the knob, and making the coating
upon the inside of less area than that upon the outside.                  With this
arrangement, when the discharge was made through a long wire, and
a test jar brought near it during discharge, a bright spark passed; but
upon approaching the jar to a delicate electrometer, it gave no indica
tions of free electricity. Reflecting upon this, and upon an experi
ment of Prof. Wheatstone, he was led to believe that the jar is dis
charged by two waves, a negative and a positive one, starting simul
taneously from the two ends of the wire. To prove this, he broke
the wire, and interposed a pane of glass dusted with red lead and
sulphur; two figures of positive and negative electricity were pro
duced. He made several other experiments tending to prove this
same fact. He showed how these experiments serve to explain that
of Dr. Priestley, where a spark was found to pass between the ends
of a long bent wire, the ends being brought within a few inches of
each other.                                                                          º
   He next passed to the connexion between statical and dynamical
induction. Statical induction has heretofore only been observed at
short distances. Prof. Henry's first experiment proved that it could be
observed at the distance of nineteen feet, the floor of a chamber inter
vening, showing that statical induction takes place at great distances,

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                     369
   though not at so great distances as the dynamical. He then ex
   plained his views of the nature of dynamical induction. When a
  spark is thrown upon a wire, it passes in a wave, whose length might
   be determined if we knew the velocity of electricity; now, if we have
   another parallel wire, a negative wave will be formed in this, and the
  two waves will travel simultaneously in the same direction.             But this
  is equivalent to a positive induced wave in the opposite direction. In
  this way the phaenomena accompanying the discharge of a jar are
  easily explained. Again, if we conceive that in a galvanic battery
  the discharge consists of a series of such waves, we may very simply
  explain the phaenomena of galvanic induction.
    ON THE EXAMINATION OF THE ASHES OF ORGANIC BODIES.
                                    BY, H. ROSE,
     Considerable attention has recently been paid to the analysis of
  the ashes of plants and animal substances. We now possess a very
  large number of quantitative analyses of different ashes, which may
  considerably enlarge our knowledge of the chemical composition
  of the inorganic constituents of organic substances. Frequently,
  however, very incorrect conclusions are liable to be drawn from the
  results of these analyses, as they have hitherto been made, with
  respect to the constituents in the organic body. This observation
  struck me on perusing M. Enderlin's paper*, who found in the ashes
  of the blood only phosphate of soda (3NaO + Pº O3), phosphate of
  lime and magnesia, peroxide of iron and perphosphate of iron, sul
  phate of soda, sulphate of lime, chloride of sodium and potassium,
  but no alkaline carbonates.         From the results found he asserted the
  total absence of carbonated alkalies and of alkaline salts with organic
  acids in the blood. It is evident, however, that these conclusions
  may be erroneous, in so far as at a high temperature the ordinary
  phosphate of soda (2NaO + HO + Pº O”) is capable of expelling
  the carbonic acid from the carbonate of soda and forming basic
| phosphate of soda.
     This observation, respecting the conclusions which M. Enderlin
  has drawn from his investigations, has already been made by several
  persons. Marchandt has attempted to refute Enderlin; Berzelius, in
  his most recent report, likewise draws attention to the subject; and
  Golding Birdt has prepared the basic phosphate of soda (3NaO
  + Pº O”) by heating the ordinary phosphate of soda (2NaO + HO
  + Pº O”) to redness with acetate of soda.
     I have also examined the ashes of the blood (ox-blood), but have
  obtained very different results from those of M. Enderlin. The
  process I adopted was the following:—I exposed the blood in a
  covered platinum crucible to a very faint red heat, extracted the
  cold mass with water, and evaporated the colourless liquid to dry
  ness; it consisted of alkaline chlorides and carbonates, with very
  minute quantities of alkaline sulphates and phosphates. The charred

mass, extracted with water, was now treated with hydrochloric acid;
the filtered solution did not yield with ammonia a very considerable
precipitate, which, although it looked almost like pure hydrated
oxide of iron, contained some phosphoric acid as well as lime and
magnesia. In the filtered solution, I obtained with oxalate of am
monia a pretty considerable precipitate of oxalate of lime, proving
the presence of carbonate of lime in the charred blood; and in the
liquid separated there was also a small quantity of magnesia. The
cinder, after treatment with water and hydrochloric acid, yielded a
very considerable quantity of a red-coloured ash on being burnt in
an atmosphere of oxygen. It was in a semifused state, and contained
peroxide of iron (which formed the chief part), earthy and alkaline
phosphates *.
    If the fixed constituents in plants are examined according to the
 above process, totally different results are frequently obtained to those
 yielded by the ash analyses which have been published up to this time.
 The ashes of peas have been examined by Fresenius and Will, Bichon,
 Thon and Boussingault; none of them enumerate carbonic acid
 among the constituents. From the investigations which have been
 made by Drs. Gibbs and Bromeis in my laboratory, the amount of
 carbonic acid in the salts which are extracted from the charred peas
 by water amounts to somewhat more than 27 per cent. Evidently,
 in the former method of reducing to ash, the carbonic acid has been
 entirely expelled. Phosphoric acid is only present in small quantity
 in the aqueous extract of charred peas. When the charred peas are
 subsequently treated with hydrochloric acid, a solution is obtained
 which contains a moderate quantity of earthy phosphates.                If the
 charred peas are now perfectly reduced to ash in an atmosphere of
 oxygen, a very considerable quantity of ash is obtained, which con
 sists principally of earthy and alkaline phosphates.
    That the method of preparing the ash of organic substances has con
 siderable influence upon the composition of the ash has already been
 noticed by several chemists, especially by Erdmann+, who showed
 that acid phosphates, which yielded white precipitates with nitrate
 of silver by ignition with carbon, lost a considerable portion of the
 phosphoric acid, and then produced a yellow precipitate in the solu
 tion of silver; he observed further, that chlorine and sulphuric acid
 might be contained in very different quantities in the ashes, according
 to the mode of preparing them; and that in the ashes of many seeds
 not a trace of chlorine had been found, while the aqueous extract of
 the seed contains very perceptible quantities of chloride of sodium.
 Mitscherlichi has likewise drawn attention to several circumstances,
 by which, in incinerating organic substances, the ashes are frequently
 decomposed and rendered impure.
     The mode of determining the fixed constituents of an organic
 substance, as above described, appears to me more advantageous
   * After these observations had been penned, I observed that Lehmann had
proved the presence of alkaline carbonate in the blood by a different method.—

  and far more rational than the methods usually employed. It may
  be objected to it, that it takes more time; but not only are far more
  correct results obtained by it, but it is also capable of answering
  several questions as to how or in what combinations the constituents
   found in the ash were contained in the organic substance. According
  to the method which I propose, the organic substance is charred at
  a very faint red heat, so that the water with which it is extracted is
  not coloured yellowish or brownish. At this temperature, which,
  owing to the volatilization of so many substances, is much lower than
  would appear, no alkaline chlorides are volatilized, nor can chlorine
  be expelled from them in the form of hydrochloric acid by acid
  phosphates. The alkaline and earthy phosphates are not able to
  expel the carbonic acid from the alkaline carbonates, either contained
  in the organic substance or formed by the charring; nor can phos
  phoric acid be eliminated from its combinations by silica, reduced
  by carbon, and volatilized in the form of phosphorus. The charring
  is effected either in a spacious covered platinum crucible over a
  spirit-lamp, or, with larger quantities of the organic substances, in a
  spacious covered Hessian crucible, especially if they do not fuse.
  When there is no longer much empyreumatic odour perceptible, the
  heating is discontinued, the cold mass left for some time in contact
  with water, and the solution of the soluble salts furthered by heating;
  the edulcoration requires considerable time and much hot water; but
<U+017F> if the highest degree of accuracy is not desired, the edulcoration
  may be discontinued when several drops of the wash-water leave a
  scarcely perceptible residue on evaporation upon a slip of platinum;
  this point is very soon attained.
     The aqueous extract contains the alkaline salts. The alkaline
  chlorides were contained as such in the organic substance previous
  to the charring, as well as at least a part of the alkaline sulphates and
  phosphates. If, as in most cases, carbonated alkali is found in the
  aqueous extract of the charred mass, it either pre-existed in the
  organic substance, or the alkali in it was combined with an organic
  acid or some other organic body, which acted the part of an acid
  towards the alkali. If the organic substance contain sulphate of
  lime, this, when carbonated alkalies are present in sufficient quantity
  in the charred mass, is converted, on treating the latter with water,
  into carbonate of lime and alkaline sulphate.          In the same way,
  when phosphate of lime is present, a certain quantity of alkaline
  phosphates is formed from it in the aqueous extract by the alka
  line carbonates. Carbonated alkali and phosphate of lime are not
  perfectly decomposed even by fusion at very high temperatures.
  The decomposition in presence of much water is likewise imperfect,
  and the more alkaline phosphate is obtained in the aqueous extract,
  the more concentrated the solution, the more carbonated alkali
  it contains, and the longer the charred mass has been digested at
  an elevated temperature. Alkaline sulphates and phosphates will
  however be found in far smaller quantities in the aqueous extract of
  the charred mass than was to be expected from the ash analyses that
  have been hitherto published.      *

the latter, are present only when too high a temperature has been
employed in the charring. From this however it is evident that the
nature of the salts in the aqueous extract may vary somewhat, ac
cording to the temperature employed and the longer or shorter
digestion of the mass with water. When the charring is effected at
too high a temperature, the greater portion of the carbonated alka
lies are decomposed by the earthy phosphates.
   The accurate examination of the salts in the aqueous extract is
not accompanied with any great difficulties. One circumstance
however renders it somewhat less easy ; carbonate and phosphate of
lime and magnesia frequently dissolve to a considerable extent in
neutral solutions of alkaline salts, particularly of alkaline carbonates
and phosphates; in the course of time they are deposited from the
solutions, especially after the application of heat. When therefore
the aqueous extract is evaporated, it frequently becomes somewhat
turbid, and deposits small quantities of earthy salts. It should con
 sequently be evaporated nearly to dryness, diluted with water, and
 the solution set aside for some time; when the earthy salts have
subsided, it is filtered, the filtered solution evaporated to dryness,
and its weight determined. When there is no alkaline phosphate or
sulphate present, the examination is very easy. The quantity of
carbonic acid is determined in a suitable apparatus by decomposition
with nitric acid; and upon this that of the chlorine by a solution of
silver; upon which, after removing the oxide of silver by hydro
chloric acid and concentrating the liquid, the potash may be sepa
rated from the soda by chloride of platinum. With the presence of
alkaline sulphate or phosphate, it is advisable to divide the quantity
of the alkaline salts, and in the one half to determine the quantity
of the chlorine and the alkalies, and in the other that of the carbonic
acid by decomposition with hydrochloric acid; that of the sulphuric
acid by a salt of barytes; and after removing the baryta by means
of sulphuric acid, and supersaturating with ammonia, to ascertain the
quantity of phosphoric acid by means of a solution of a salt of mag
nesia to which chloride of ammonium has been added.
   The charred mass, exhausted with water, is now digested with hot
hydrochloric acid for some length of time, and then washed with
water. This operation requires considerably more time and water
than in the treatment of the charred mass with water; and if the
washing were to be continued until some drops of the filtered liquid
no longer produced any opalescence in a solution of silver, an enor
mous length of time, several months, would be required, especially
in operating upon large quantities. The edulcoration therefore is
only continued until a considerable quantity of the wash-water does
not exhibit a trace of precipitate when treated with ammonia; it
will then also be seen that a large quantity of the wash water, when
evaporated upon platinum, no longer leaves any perceptible residue:
this does not require much time, especially when hot water is used.
   The acid solution contains the earthy phosphates which existed
as such in the organic substance and the peroxide of iron. It is
precipitated by ammonia, and after having determined the weight

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 373
of the precipitate, the bases are separated from the phosphoric acid.
I shall subsequently describe in these pages a method by which this
may be accomplished without any difficulty. On separating the
earthy phosphates by means of ammonia, a small quantity remains
dissolved in the filtered liquid, owing to the presence of chloride of
ammonium; consequently upon º oxalate of ammonia, a pre
cipitate of oxalate of lime is obtained, but its quantity is usually
larger than corresponds to the phosphate of lime dissolved by the
chloride of ammonium; consequently a portion of the lime existed
as carbonate of lime in the charred mass, or was formed by the de
composition of the sulphate and phosphate of lime by the alkaline
carbonates. The liquid filtered from the oxalate of lime indicates,
on the addition of a solution of phosphate of soda, the presence of
some magnesia. The insoluble earthy salts which separated from the
aqueous extract may be examined conjointly with those in the acid
extract. "
   With respect to the charred mass, which has been exhausted with
water and hydrochloric acid, it would be imagined that it could con
tain only silica or silicates undecomposable by dilute hydrochloric
acid; but it yields a very large amount of ash on complete com
bustion, even when the organic substances contain no silica or mere
traces.
   I formerly effected the perfect combustion of the cinder in hard
 lass tubes, in which the mass was heated to redness while a current
#.           was passed over it; this plan however has its inconve
niences. If the quantity of organic substance employed is mode
rately large, so much cinder is obtained, that a glass tube, even of
large diameter, would require to be filled with it several times to
burn it entirely; moreover, the tube is very much acted upon, and
rarely stands a second heating. The combustion is in most cases
very imperfect, and requires much time if but a slow current of
oxygen be passed; a rapid current is requisite for the combustion
to succeed well; but then a considerable quantity of ash may readily
be carried away, especially if it is of a very light nature; this, it is
true, may be partially prevented by passing the gas on its exit
through a stratum of water, by varying the height of which a dif
ferent pressure may be obtained; but this does not entirely prevent
the removal of the ash, and if the pressure is too great, the glass
tube is liable to bulge when strongly heated”. But the greatest
disadvantage attending the use of glass tubes is, that it is impossible
to collect the ashes so as to determine their weight accurately. Fre.
quently the ash has undergone slight fusion; it can then only be
imperfectly separated from the glass by mechanical means or the
use of solvents. The use of thin platinum or silver foil, which is
introduced into the glass tube previous to the coal being placed in
it, does not entirely remove these serious disadvantages, and gives
rise to others. I therefore employ for the combustion of the charred
mass a different method, with the results of which I am perfectly

satisfied. For some time past I have no longer employed bulb
tubes in reductions by means of hydrogen gas, but place the sub
stance to be reduced in a platinum or porcelain crucible, provided
with a platinum lid, which is perforated in the centre, into which
passes a curved silver tube about 8 inches long, through which the
dried hydrogen is conveyed into the crucible. During ignition the
gas escapes between the lid and crucible. Ebelmen” has recently
employed a similar apparatus for the reduction of the sesquioxide of
manganese to the state of protoxide. This apparatus can be used
with considerable advantage for burning the charred mass. The
crucible is half-filled with the substance, and heated over a spirit
lamp, while a current of oxygen is passed into it; with proper care
not a particle of ash is carried away, and the combustion proceeds
very rapidly; a further quantity of the substance is conveyed from
time to time into the crucible. By this means the ash obtained may
 be weighed with such accuracy as would not be easily accomplished
in any other way.                     -
    When the combustion is effected in a platinum crucible, this is
sometimes acted upon; a silver crucible is liable to partial fusion
from the heat during the combustion; it is therefore advisable to
 employ a porcelain crucible, which is acted upon far less than glass;
 and if very thin and somewhat transparent, the progress of the com
 bustion may be distinctly observed by the incandescence.
    The weight of the ash obtained, added to that of the evaporated
 aqueous extract of the charred mass and to that of the insoluble
 earthy salts dissolved by the hydrochloric acid, gives the correct
 quantity of fixed constituents in the organic substance employed.
    The ash obtained, especially when derived from vegetable sub
 stances, consists of the same constituents as were found in the aqueous
 and acid extracts; if alkalies were present in them, we likewise find
 them in the ash of the exhausted charred substance; otherwise it
 consists principally of earthy phosphates. I have already mentioned
 that nearly the whole of the iron of the blood is met with in this
 ash. Only about the tenth part of it is found in the acid extract of
 the charred mass, and indeed the less the more carefully the charring
 was effected with exclusion of the air. When the organic substance
 contains no silica, various views may be entertained respecting the
 origin of the ash from the charred mass which has been exhausted
 with water and acid. The most probable is perhaps to derive it
 from an imperfect exhaustion with the two solvents.                When an
 organic substance is destroyed by heat, the charcoal formed may
 contain such cavities that the inorganic salts surrounded by them
 are protected from the action of the solvents. The globules of the
  blood, those of yeast, the cells of plants, form perhaps after charring
 extremely minute vesicles, with such small apertures that no liquid
 can penetrate into them. That the vessels of wood are capable of
 forming extremely thin filaments with minute apertures by charring
 is known from the investigations of Degent. The charred mass of
 an organic substance (yeast), after it had been most carefully ex

hausted by water and hydrochloric acid, was ground to the very
finest powder upon a plate of agate; the two solvents now extracted
only imperceptible traces of fixed constituents, and after burning the
exhausted charred mass I obtained the same large amount of ash as
from the non-pulverized charcoal. It may nevertheless be supposed
that the extremely minute vesicles were not destroyed and torn by
the friction upon the agate plate. The microscope threw no light
upon the subject.                                                        -
    It is known that charcoal is capable, by a weak kind of affinity,
of removing certain salts from their solutions; I have also mentioned
above, that when the charred substance has been treated with hy
drochloric acid, it is almost impossible to remove the acid by washing
with water; but the quantity of ash is too considerable for us to
ascribe this origin to it, since it is known that the salts which the
charcoal has combined with may be entirely separated by long treat
ment with water at different temperatures. I mixed sulphate of
potash and phosphate of lime with sugar, and charred the mixture.
Water, and after this hydrochloric acid, extracted the two salts so
completely from the charred mass, that the latter, after combustion
in an atmosphere of oxygen, left not a trace of ash.
    Several acid phosphates (metaphosphates) are insoluble in hydro
chloric acid after ignition; to this cause might be owing the resi
duary ash of the charred mass; but although phosphoric acid is
almost constantly met with in this ash, it is not always combined
with the bases in the form of acid salts; moreover, the ash itself,
when it does not contain silica, is soluble in hydrochloric acid after the
salts have been exposed, in the combustion of the carbon in oxygen,
to a far higher temperature than that employed in charring the
organic substance.
    Ignited peroxide of iron is, it is true, not insoluble in hydrochloric
acid, although very sparingly soluble; its non-extraction by acid
from the charred blood might be attributed to this cause ; but sup
posing it to be contained in the state of peroxide of iron, not only
must it be more readily soluble in hydrochloric acid, owing to its
finely divided state, but the oxide of iron which is found in the ash
after the combustion of the coal, and which has been exposed to a
very high temperature, is soluble in hydrochloric acid.
    The alkaline and earthy phosphates which are found in the ash of
the exhausted charred mass cannot have been contained in the
form of metallic phosphurets of a peculiar kind mixed with coal,
like the phosphuret of iron, which is perfectly insoluble in hydro
chloric acid. It might be assumed that they were formed by the
reduction of the alkaline and earthy phosphates by the carbon. It
 is scarcely necessary to notice this assumption, for it is well known
that the meutral and basic alkaline and earthy phosphates are not
reduced by carbon even at a high temperature, at least not in the
 presence of silica or any similar fixed acid. But even the excess of
 phosphoric acid cannot be reduced by carbon from the acid phos
phates at the temperature which I employ in charring organic sub
stances.    In the case of the blood, however, phosphuret of iron

376           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
might be formed by the reduction of the phosphate of iron by the
carbon. Although I was convinced that this could not happen at
the temperature which I employed, I'mixed phosphate of iron inti
mately with sugar, and charred the mixture at a higher temperature;
hydrochloric acid, however, extracted the salt, so completely from
the charred mass, that this burnt without any residue in an atmo
sphere of oxygen.                       - *** * * * *...* *- : *, * :
 . It might be supposed that the salts found in the ash of the ex
hausted charred substances are so intimately combined with organic
substances that they can only be detected by reagents after the com
plete destruction of the latter. But the organic substances are so
destroyed by the charring, that if the inorganic salts found in the ash
pre-existed as such in them, they should have been extracted by
those agents in which they are soluble.
   There still remains one view respecting the origin of these ashes.
The salts found in them may perhaps not have pre-existed as such
in the organic substances, but were first formed by oxidation after
the burning of the coal. It has long been known that the proteine
compounds, of both animal and vegetable origin, contain sulphur
and phosphorus in an unoxidized state; but, as far as I am aware,
the supposition has never been advanced, that the radicals of the
earths and alkalies may likewise be contained in organic substances
in an unoxidized state, perhaps combined with those elements.
These would certainly constitute a very peculiar class of combina
tions, such as we are at present not acquainted with. If they are
really combined with organic substances in the living body, they
cannot have been essentially altered on destroying the organic body
by charring, or they have entered into combinations with carbon
and nitrogen, which are insoluble in water and in hydrochloric
acid.                                                                 -
   I have already observed that the salts found in the ash of the
charred mass exhausted with water and acid, especially when derived
from vegetable substances, are similar to those which occur in the
aqueous and acid extract. This view can only be confirmed by a
long series of investigations; but if it should be confirmed, then those
salts which we find in the ash after the destruction of the living
plants were probably contained in them only in part as such, and in
part in an unoxidized state. The inorganic salts, therefore, which
are taken up from the soil by the living plant, are partially deoxi
dized by it, and in this state form combinations with organic sub
stances contained in the plant.                                          -
   This view is far more probable with respect to several animal
substances, especially the blood, than in reference to plants. It has
long been suspected that the iron in the blood was contained in it
in an unoxidized state; and, according to the recent investigations
of Mulder, the iron is actually extracted by acids from hamatine
with evolution of hydrogen gas. This view acquires still greater
probability from the experiments which I have related. On the
other hand, it is very remarkable that the iron cannot be extracted
from the charred blood by hydrochloric acid. I think it would be

        extremely interesting to pursue this subject further. From what
        has been stated, it results that the view which I have advanced can
        neither be confirmed or refuted by any number whatever of analyses
        of the ashes of plants, which have been prepared according to the
      * methods hitherto in use, but only by a process similar to that I have
        described, and which I have ºtherefore pronounced a far more
        rational method of investigation.
(tº        I have already shown that frequently very considerable quantities
jºr     of alkaline carbonates are extracted by water from several organic
*       substances after charring, in the ashes of which no carbonic acid
is tº   was found by former investigators. But all organic substances do
 º:     not yield alkaline carbonates when treated in this manner, even
º,”     though considerable quantities of alkali are contained in their ash.
        Highly remarkable in this respect is yeast, the ash of which, accor
        ding to Mitscherlich *, contains no carbonic acid and no metallic chlo
        rides; and my experiments show that they are likewise not to be
        found in the aqueous extract of the charred yeast. Yeast diffuses,
        on being charred, an odour similar to that of the proteine compounds;
        the aqueous extract did not turn litmus-paper blue, became turbid
        on evaporation, and deposited a large quantity of earthy phosphates.
        The mass, evaporated to dryness, yielded on filtration a clear solu
        tion, which faintly reddened litmus-paper, and contained therefore
        not a trace of alkaline carbonates; I could only find in it alkaline
        phosphates, with very minute traces of alkaline sulphates and chlo
        rides. The charred mass gave, on treatment with hydrochloric acid,
        a solution, from which ammonia threw down a considerable precipi
        tate of earthy phosphates. The cinder, exhausted with water and
        acid, furnished on combustion a very large quantity of ash, which
        contained the same constituents which had been extracted from the
        charred mass. These experiments, the results of which entirely
        agree with those obtained by Mitscherlich, were made with top-yeast,
        which had been perfectly purified by washing. Other results may
        perhaps be obtained by using unwashed yeast for the experiments;
        for the beery liquid, separated from the yeast by filtration and eva
        porated, did not diffuse on charring the same disagreeable odour as
        the yeast itself, or as nitrogenous substances generally at a high
        temperature. The evaporated solution, extracted with water from
        the charred mass, contained a large amount of carbonated alkali, and
        effervesced therefore strongly with acids, with much chloride of potas.

   In the Phil. Mag. for May 1845, p. 422, are detailed some ex
periments by Dr. R. D. Thomson, which show that when starch
has been digested in considerable quantities by animals, it passes
into the condition of soluble starch, or dextrine and sugar, and being
absorbed in the latter form into the blood, can be detected in that

fluid during the period of digestion. The experiments detailed in
the paper referred to were made in 1844. Magendie has lately, in
a paper communicated to the French Academy (Comptes Rendus,

was fed on cooked potatoes, the blood contained dextrine and grape
sugar. He observed also, that if starch be mixed with fresh serum,
it is so transformed in a few seconds that it cannot be detected by
reagents, and in a quarter of an hour sugar makes its appearance.
This exactly corresponds with the previous results obtained by Dr.
Thomson in 1844, who “was unable to detect any traces of starch
in the serum of the blood” (Phil. Mag., May 1845, p. 420), but
easily obtained evidence of the presence of sugar in the same blood.

   ON THE COMPOUNDS OF CYANO GEN.              B.Y. M. AD. WURTZ.
   Formation of Cyanuric Acid.—When a current of dry chlorine gas
is passed over fused urea, very energetic reaction occurs; the urea
is decomposed, swelling up and emitting abundant white vapours.
The products of this action are cyanuric acid, hydrochlorate of am

highly remarkable.—ED,

monia, hydrochloric acid and azote. To separate the cyanuric acid,
it is sufficient to treat the cooled mass, which remains in the vessel
in which the decomposition was performed, with a little cold water.
The hydrochlorate of ammonia dissolves in the water, and the cyan
uric acid remains in the form of a white powder, which, if requisite,
may be purified by solution in boiling water. The following equa
tion explains the reaction of the chlorine upon the urea:
   3 (C2H4 Az2 O2) + 3CI = Az + HCl·H2H4 Az Cl-HCG Az3 H3 O6.
The author considers this as the most convenient process for pre
paring cyanuric acid.
    Chlorohydruret [hydrochlorate PJ of Cyanogen.—When a current of
 chlorine gas is passed into a solution of hydrocyanic acid, prepared
 by Trautwein's process, a slight increase of temperature occurs after
 the operation has been some time continued. The liquid emits a
 very perceptible odour of chloride of cyanogen, and a vapour is formed
which condenses in small drops in the cold parts of the apparatus,
 and these constitute the principal product of the reaction: to collect
 it, a tube with chloride of calcium is to be adapted to the retort
 which contains the hydrocyanic acid, bent at a right angle, and
 passed into a long-necked receiver cooled by ice.              -
     When the operation is finished, the receiver contains a liquid which
 is limpid, very volatile, fumes on exposure to the air, and emits
 a very irritating odour of chloride of cyanogen : this is impure chlo
 rohydruret of cyanogen. It contains hydrochloric and hydrocyanic
 acids, from which it is freed by agitating it with two or three times
 its volume of cold water. The stratum of liquid which separates
 from the water is to be poured off, and submitted to a fresh distil
 lation, its vapour being passed through a tube containing chloride
 of calcium.
     The chlorohydruret of cyanogen thus prepared is a colourless, very
 fluid and corrosive liquid. It emits an odour which strongly irritates
 the bronchiae, and especially the eyes. It boils at 68°F. Its va
 pour burns with a violet flame. It dissolves sensibly in water, and
 the solution precipitates nitrate of silver white.
     When brought into contact with dry chlorine, it is entirely con
 verted into solid chloride of cyanogen and hydrochloric acid, Cº Azº
  Cl2 H+Cl= H Cl-HC9A3 Cl3.
     If this reaction takes place with some grammes of the substance,
  the sides of the vessel will be covered the next day with fine radia
  ting needles, and there remains at the bottom a viscid liquid, which
  eventually becomes a mass of large crystals of chloride of cyanogen.
     M. Wurtz states that he had some difficulty in analysing the
  chlorohydruret of cyanogen. This will readily be conceived, when
  the extreme volatility of this liquid is considered. The experiments
  performed by the author led to the formula C* Az' Cl*H, and this
  appears to be confirmed by the reactions which the substance un
  dergoes.
     This substance may therefore be considered as a compound of
  hydrocyanic acid with chloride of cyanogen, C*Az* Cl*, the descrip
  tion of which will presently be given; or it may be regarded as solid

 means of a water-bath, and in the receiver, properly cooled, a colour

the bottom of a vessel of water, but is sensibly soluble in it. The
 solution does not precipitate nitrate of silver. The reactions de
scribed seem to indicate that the alkalies decompose the chloride of
 cyanogen into alkaline chloride, ammonia and carbonic acid. It is
well-known that the two latter bodies are products of the decompo
sition of cyanic acid. Analyses performed by the author led him to
 conclude that the composition of liquid chloride of cyanogen is ex
pressed by the formula C* Azº Clº.      It appears therefore to be a new
isomeric of chloride of cyanogen.—Comptes Rendus, Mars 11, 1847.
    RESEARCHES ON HYDRATES, STANNIC AND METASTANNIC
             -         ACIDS.    BY M. E. FREMY.
   The author inquires whether it is to be generally admitted, that
all acids which, by becoming anhydrous, have lost their property of
combining with bases, are no longer to be considered as acids. In
order to determine the acidity of anhydrous acids, almost all such as
are known were made to act upon anhydrous bases, or on salts con
taining acids less fixed than those employed; the acids used were
the carbonic, sulphurous, sulphuric, phosphoric, silicic, boracic, stan
nic, &c. These were found to possess all the characters of acids,
without the intervention of water : thus, to cite one example, it was
found that perfectly dried sulphurous acid completely decomposed
carbonate of soda, when gently heated, forming sulphite of soda,
which was decomposable by an anhydrous and more fixed acid.
   It being established that a certain number of acids preserve their
acid reaction when rendered anhydrous, the author examined whether
certain salts did not exist in which water was indispensable ; and
he is of opinion that several classes of salts exist, the molecules of
which are unquestionably ternary, and always formed by the com
bination of an acid, a base and water.
   Supposing that if energetic acids, such as the sulphuric and nitric,
form with equally energetic bases, salts which are almost always an
hydrous, it appeared questionable whether the same would occur with
acids whose affinity for basic water is but slight. The author's atten
tion was directed to those hydrated metallic oxides which are soluble

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,             381
in the alkalies, and which may be considered as weak acids. It was
found that these bodies possess the property of combining with bases
in the state of hydrates only.....Thus, hydrated binoxide of copper
dried in the air, the formula of which is Cu O*HO, is perfectly
soluble in excess of potash and soda; the solution is of a fine blue
colour, and when evaporated, even in, vacuo, it is decomposed, and
deposits oxide of copper, which is insoluble in the alkalies. The
hydrates of oxides of tin, antimony and chromium, SnO, HO ;
SbO3, HO ; Crº O3 10HO, dissolve in the alkalies, and all become
insoluble by losing water. The author satisfied himself that the in
solubility was owing to the separation of the water, and not to the
isomeric modifications which certain oxides undergo by calcination.
    It was found impossible to obtain crystalline compounds of the
above-mentioned hydrates with the alkalies; for by evaporation,
even in vacuo, the alkali which it is requisite to employ in excess
 combines with the water of the hydrates, or in acting perhaps only
by its presence occasions the precipitation of the anhydrous oxide.
    The preceding compounds yield, however, incontestable proof of
 the existence of saline groups, which are not possible without the
 presence of water: they demonstrate that certain hydrates owe their
 solubility in the alkalies entirely to water of hydration.
    The new facts stated establish marked differences between stannic
 acid and the acid which M. Fremy calls metastannic acid; and this
 he has found forms three different hydrates with water: the first is
 insoluble in nitric acid and soluble in ammonia; it is obtained by
 precipitating a metastannate by an acid; the second is produced by
 the reaction of nitric acid upon tin; its formula is Snº O19, 10HO ;
 it is insoluble in ammonia and nitric acid; the third is prepared by
 drying the preceding hydrate at 266°F. ; its formula is Snº O'o,
 4HO.
    Neutral metastannates, formed in the presence of great excess of
 alkali, have for their formula Snº O'9, MO, 4HO, whereas stannates
 are represented by Sn O2 MO. The equivalent of metastannic acid
 is then five times greater than that of stannic acid. The metastan
 nates are always hydrated, are necessarily ternary, and decompose
 when dehydrated: in this case the metastannic acid loses its acidity,
 whereas stannates, like most other salts, may be rendered anhydrous
 without decomposing.
    The essential action of water on the constitution of the metastan
 nates, may be readily shown by the following experiments. If me
 tastannate of potash be gently heated, so as to take away its water
 of combination, the separation of the acid and base is immediately
 effected : on treating the dehydrated salt with water, potash only is
 dissolved, which does not contain a trace of metastannic acid, and
 this acid remains in an insoluble state. In this case, therefore, a
  decomposition is effected upon a definite salt, similar to that which
  the binoxide of copper undergoes in potash when heated: these two
 phaenomena are precisely of the same description.
     The dehydration of metastannate of soda is perhaps still more
 remarkable, for it takes place below 212°F. This salt is soluble in

382           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
cold water; but if it be added to boiling water, it decomposes in
stantaneously, and the water contains pure soda only.
   The author is of opinion that he has stated an important fact,
which is, that the same oxide, by combining with different propor
tions of water, can form two acids which are distinguished by their
properties, their equivalent, and their mode of combining with bases.

       ON SULPHOXIPHOSWINIC ACID AND ITS COMPOUNDS.

   The author remarks that he and M. Bouyet had described a new
kind of salts, the acid of which they designated sulphoxiarsenic acid,
consisting of arsenic, oxygen and sulphur, water being deducted.
The sulphoxiarseniate of potash, which was obtained by passing sul
phuretted hydrogen into a solution of arseniate of potash, has for its
formula. As O3 S2, KO-H-2HO.
   The great analogy existing between the corresponding compounds
of arsenic and phosphorus, rendered it probable that sulphoxiphos
phates might also be formed. After many trials, M. Cloez succeeded
in producing these salts by decomposing the chlorosulphuret of phos
 phorus of Serullas by an alkaline solution.
   The chlorosulphuret of phosphorus, treated with common alcohol,
yields an acid analogous to the phosphovinic acid of M. Pelouze.
 According to M. Cloez the formula of this acid is PhO? Sº, C*H*O,
 2(HO); it is the sulphoxiphosphovinic acid. With pyroxylic spirit
 sulphoxiphosphomethylic acid is formed. Amylic alcohol should
 produce the corresponding compound, sulphoxiphosphamylic acid.
    By saturating the sulphoxiphosphovinic acid with the carbonate
 of barytes, lime, strontia, &c., well-defined crystalline salts are pro
 duced: the formula of the barytic saltis PhO3S2, C4H8O, 2.BaO +Aq.
    The potash and soda salts are readily obtained by decomposing
 the chlorosulphuret of phosphorus with an alcoholic solution of pot
 ash or soda. These salts are soluble in alcohol. The following
 equation explains the reaction which occurs with potash : Ph Cl*S*
 +C+ H6O2+5 (KO)=Ph Os Sº, C4 Hº O 2 (KO)4-3(KCl)4-HO.—

               ON ANHYDRO US HYDROFLUORIC ACID.
    M. Louyet states that in 1846 he mentioned to the Academy that,
 in his opinion, anhydrous hydrofluoric acid was as yet unknown; in
 proof of its correctness, he showed that the acid supposed to be so,
 saturated a smaller quantity of a base than it ought to do, if it had
 been anhydrous.
    This proof not having satisfied M. Dumas, the author was advised
 by him to pass hydrofluoric acid, hitherto regarded as anhydrous,
 over anhydrous phosphoric acid, and to collect the product in a
 platina vessel immersed in a freezing mixture. According to M.
 Dumas, if by this process a liquid hydrofluoric acid was always ob

                       Meteorological Observations.                                           383
tained, it would be necessary to admit that the hydrofluoric acid,
supposed by MM. Gay-Lussac and Thenard to be anhydrous, was
really so.
   M. Louyet performed this experiment by the aid of an apparatus
which he describes, and the result of it is, that anhydrous hydro
fluoric acid is gaseous at 10°F. at a medium pressure. In this
respect it does not differ from other anhydrous hydracids, nor from
the fluosilicic nor fluoboric acids. Hydrofluoric acid gas is extremely
fuming, on account of its great affinity for water. It acts feebly on
glass, and might probably be received in glass vessels over mercury.—

                            [With a Plate.]
    CCORDING to the theory of Ohm, the electric force
      circulating through each part of a galvanic circuit is
equal to the quotient of the sum of the affinities in action
divided by the sum of the resistances to be overcome. Thus
                           F= R+r*-,
where F represents the force, A the sum of the affinities
generating the current, R the resistance of the electromotor
and the wires attached, and r the resistance of the wire of a
galvanometer included in the circuit.
   If a secondary wire, whose resistance is represented by w,
have its ends attached to the two points of connexion between
the wires of the electromotor and those of the galvanometer,
so as to form with the galvanometer-helix a divided course for
the circulation of the current, the equation for the force be

                                 r-Hw'
   Let one of the wires of the electromotor be detached from
its connexion with the other wires, and drawn along in con
tact with the secondary wire, thus modifying the relative
length, and of course, in the same proportion, the relative
resistances of the two courses open to the current, but leaving
the sum of the resistances constant. The above equation will
become
                                     º!
                          G'= F.

   If the electromotor be not very weak, and the galvanometer
be sensitive, in order to reduce the current passing through
the galvanometer to a magnitude within the compass of its
indications, the secondary wire will require to be short and
stout, making the resistance w very small, and consequently L
very small in comparison with R; F will then vary very slightly
by the relative changes thus caused in r and w, and for prac
tical purposes F, as well as r +w, may be considered constant;
so that we may take with little error

or the quantity of electricity passing through the galvanometer
wire will vary sensibly as the length of that part of the se
condary wire included between the wires of the electromotor.
   We have thus, differing slightly from methods previously
proposed, a means of graduating the galvanometer. By the
use of two cells of Daniell’s constant battery in series, this
may be accomplished with sufficient accuracy by the above
method. One battery wire, being in fixed connexion with
one point of the double circuit, the other wire must be ap
proximated to, or elongated from, that point, in contact with
the secondary wire, until the needle of the galvanometer points
to 1%. If the distance of the battery wires be doubled, so as
to include a double resistance, the needle ought to point to
2°, if trebled to 3°, and so on, the variations in F, whatever
be those in G and w, being wholly inappreciable.
    F=G.’ tº. If the section and length of the secondary
             70                            -
wire be properly proportioned to those of the galvanometer
wire, it will always be possible, by moving one battery wire
backwards and forwards in contact with the secondary wire,
while the other battery wire is in fixed connexion, as before

             the measurement of Electrical Forces.           387
described, to make the value of G uniformly constant, the
needle for example always pointing to 45°, whatever power
of electromotor be applied; and as the sum r +w continues
constant, F in the above equation will then vary inversely
as w.    The relative force of different electromotors, however
powerful or however weak, may thus be accurately measured
by the same delicate galvanometer; being inversely propor
tional to the length of that part of the secondary wire con
tained between the wires of the electromotor; or

*                         F T w!'
   Moreover, if a compound constant battery of three or four
pairs be used, and a voltameter be introduced between the bat
tery and the double circuit, it will be easy to find the value of
w answering to a certain F, which is also known in terms of
the chemical equivalents decomposed in the voltameter in a
unit of time. Thus, the wires being adjusted so as to cause the
galvanometer needle to point to 45°, note the value of w, viz.
the length of the secondary wire contained between the wires
of the battery; note also the length of time required, other
things being kept constant, to effect a certain amount of de
composition in the voltameter. The quantity decomposed in
one minute, deduced from the above observation by simple
proportion, is the F. The product of the F and w thus ob
tained may then be used in the formula
                              F'—  F.
to ascertain the value, also in terms of chemical equivalents,
—of any other force F, without the further use of the volta
meter, and whether the force have energy sufficient for che
mical decomposition or not; for the quantity necessary to
deflect the galvanometer to a certain fixed point is always the
same, whatever be the intensity of the current.
   Thus the same rigorous measurement, in terms of the
weight of matter naturally associated with fixed quantities of
electricity, may be applied to all electrical forces, whatever
their intensity, which the voltameter has applied to those ca
pable of producing chemical decomposition, and this by an
immediate observation, without the loss of time requisite for
a chemical quantitative experiment.
   Since the needle of the galvanometer is liable to slight
changes in the intensity of its magnetism, the above-determined
values of F and w will from time to time require verification.

   With the help of an additional galvanometer, the resistance
of the helix of the one in ordinary use may be measured by
the above process; and also the resistance of the secondary
wire of the double circuit may be estimated, by introducing
as the la piece of wire having the same section and conducti
bility as the secondary wire, cut off for instance from the
same piece. Thus r +w becomes known, and may then be
used for the determination of the resistances opposed to weaker
forces. ... If the helix of the galvanometer be skilfully formed
and well-insulated, the resistance r-Ew once determined will
not be liable to change.
   The sum of all the tensions of the circuit, positive and ne
gative, i.e. of the affinities producing the current, is known
from the equation
                           A = F(R+L).
In the majority of cases A= FR will be a sufficient approxi
mation; or at least A = F(R+w), as except in very weak
forces, w will be so small that it will not materially differ from
L or – X (0.
   * F.I.,
   The practical form which I have given to an instrument for
the above purposes, and which I call the “Detached Galva
nometer Scale,” is represented in Plate VII., and may be thus
described.
   It consists essentially of four wires, a, b, c, d; the first three,
formed of copper, are one-fourth, one-eighth, and one-six
teenth of an inch in diameter respectively; the last, d, is also
one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter, but is formed of plati
num. Each of them is exactly eight inches long, and they
are all partially sunk in grooves, parallel to, and about one
inch distance from, each other, in a board eight inches long of
hard well-dried wood, varnished and graduated into tenths of
an inch, the lines being drawn through from side to side.
   The four wires are joined into one continuous wire, com
mencing at A and terminating at E, by being soldered to the
connecting pieces A, B, C, D, E, which are bored, and fur
nished with screws to clasp a wire from any electromotor whose
force is to be measured.
   The connecting pieces are of solid brass, and at least half
an inch thick, in order to offer no appreciable resistance to a
current passing through them from the wire of the electro
motor to the wire of the scale.
   When in operation, the wires from the galvanometer are
always to be attached to the terminating connecting pieces A
and E.

 390         On the measurement of Electrical Forces.
    One wire from the electromotor must be attached to A, B, C
 or D, according to the magnitude of the force to be measured,
 and the other wire from the electromotor must be moved along
 in contact with the wire a, b, c or d, according as the first
 wire is connected with A, B, C or D, until the galvanometer
 needle points to 45°.
    F is a vernier which is applicable for this purpose: the
 moveable wire of the electromotor, being passed through the
 small hole e and brought up again by the notch f, will lie in
 the groove ef, and the vernier sliding on the wire of the scale
 by the groove which is at right angles to ef, will enable the
 operator to read off the position of the moveable wire to
 Tºdth of an inch. It is requisite to keep the wires of the
 scale and vernier bright, and to rub them well with wash
 leather before each time of using, and the vernier will require
 little pressure to obtain a correct indication.
    The diameter of wire c being half that of b and one-fourth
 that of a, its section is one-fourth and one-sixteenth of these
 respectively. Consequently, it will offer to an electric current
 four times the resistance which is offered by an equal length
 of b and sixteen times that offered by an equal length of a.
 The wire d is of the same diameter as c, but being platinum
 has a less conducting power, say one-fifth, and will therefore
 offer five times the resistance of an equal length of c. The
 ratio of the resistances of the wires a, b, c, d, however, since
 different pieces of the same material are apt to differ in their
 conducting power, and very slight differences of diameter
 become multiplied into importance in the section, must be
 determined by actual experiment, which is easily done with
 the help of a constant battery; and the product of F and w
being also ascertained by experiment for one of the wires,
may then be known by computation for the others. As the
length of d is graduated on the board into eighty divisions,
and indeed with the assistance of the vernier into 800, this
instrument is calculated to measure a scale of electric forces,
extending from its lowest or unity to 80 × 5 x 4 x 4 =6400, or
with the vernier through 64,000°.
    With a galvanometer of moderate sensitiveness, having a
helix of about 1000 inches of copper wire rºndth of an inch
in diameter, a force capable of decomposing water sufficient
to furnish (F)+indths of a cubic inch of hydrogen gas in one
minute, required (w) six inches of wire d to be interposed
between its conducting wires to raise the index of the galvano
meter to 45°, making the product of F and w for this wire ="36.
   For smaller or larger electric forces, additional instruments
with finer or coarser wires will be requisite.

   The resistances of wires are to each other directly as their
lengths, and inversely as the products of their sections and
conductibilities. If the wire of the galvanometer helix be as
above, 1000 inches in length and Tºndth of an inch in dia
meter, then eight inches of wire d, being of platinum, one
sixteenth of an inch in diameter, and having, suppose, one-fifth
of the conducting power of copper, will equal in resistance
about an inch and a quarter of the helix wire; therefore sincef
r= 1000 and the greatest value of w=1}, the quantity #.
cannot in this instrument be of any importance in the deter
mination of resistances, and may always be safely neglected.
For the accurate measurement, with an instrument having
finer wires, of resistances offered to weaker forces, the fraction
may be useful.
LX. Physical and Geological Observations on the principal .
          Geysirs of Iceland. By A. DEscLoIzEAUx*.
   N Iceland the name of Geysir is generally given to a jet
     ting thermal spring, and the names of hwer (cauldron) and
laug (baths) are applied to springs simply bubbling up, or
wholly tranquil, contained in basins almost always regular,
circular or elliptic.
   The jetting springs most celebrated on account of their
volume, the beauty of their eruptions, and the importance of
the deposits which they have formed and which they still form
at the present day, are those known by the names of the Great
Geysir and Strokkur. Although most of the travellers who
have visited Iceland have described the eruptions of these
two springs which they witnessed, and of which some have
published pretty accurate representations, I will here relate
the manner in which this phaenomenon takes place.
   In the Great Geysir, whose waters, as I shall observe here
after, have formed for themselves a very regular basin in the
form of a truncated cone hollowed at the summit, the erup
tions are preceded by subterraneous detonations, which have
always been justly compared to a distant sound of artillery,
and which powerfully shake the base and lateral parts of the
cone.    After each detonation, the column of water which
occupies the central channel is upraised, in the form of a
hemisphere, some metrest above the surface of the basin;
then all becomes calm again,
   These detonations and these upliftings of the liquid mass
are produced pretty regularly every two hours, as we have

Icelandic orthography has been preserved in this memoir.

392 M. Descloizeaux's Physical and Geological Observations
ascertained by a series of observations carried on for several
days, and consequently they are far from announcing a great
eruption; but when this is approaching, detonations stronger
and more frequent than the first are heard, the uprisings of
the central column become more and more considerable, and
all at once an immense column of water, three metres in dia
meter at its base, is projected into the air to a height varying
from thirty to fifty metres, spreads like a fountain at its summit,
and falls again in part into the large reservoir, eighteen metres
in diameter, which forms the basin of the spring; the rest of
the mass of water flows over the external sides of the cone,
and spreads out into the little rills which furrow the plateau
on which this cone rests.       The column of water does not
generally attain its greatest height until several consecutive
jets at very short intervals have prepared the observer for the
magnificent spectacle which the Geysir reserves for the close
of the eruption, like a skilful firework-maker who terminates
his exhibition by a splendid bouquet. These eruptions last
from five to seven minutes.
   In the Strokkur, the circumstances attending the eruption
are a little different, and the form of the channel which dis
charges the emitted waters is doubtless the principal cause
which gives the phaenomenon a peculiar character. In this
channel, which represents a well even with the ground, the
water is at about three metres below the surface, and it boils
up with incessant oscillation. When it is attempted to produce
an artificial eruption by covering the surface of the water
with clods of earth or turf, or when a natural eruption is
about to take place, this boiling ceases for some instants,
and a pointed, lanceolate jet issues suddenly to a certain
height; it is soon followed by another, which is in its turn
succeeded by a series of slender columns, very pointed at the
summit, with serrated outlines, which cannot be better com
pared than to immense yew-trees. These columns, which
succeed one another sometimes for twelve to fifteen minutes,
attain various heights, which reach, as in the Geysir, to fifty
metres. When the eruptions of the Strokkur take place
naturally, the jetting water is quite as limpid as that of the
Geysir; and, if the weather is calm and the sun bright, no
thing can exceed the magnificence of these immense columns
of clear water, perfectly vertical, and reflecting the brilliant
colours of the rainbow.      If however the Strokkur is excited
by clods of earth or turf, the water is coloured black, often
of a very deep tinge, and the phaenomenon loses much of its
splendour.
   Before passing to the results of the thermometric experi
ments and the various observations made at the Geysir and

              on the principal Geysirs of Iceland.           393
the Strokkur, I shall describe in a summary manner the topo
graphical and geological position of these two springs, for the
geological portion of the Voyage en Islande of the Scientific
Commission of the North contains extensive details upon
this subject.
   The two principal geysirs of Iceland are situated in the
south-east part of the island, at eighty-seven kilometres, in a
straight line, to the east-north-east of Reykjavík, and at forty
six kilometres to the north-west of Hecla.      These fountains,
accompanied by a great number of hwers and laugs, occupy a
space of 500 metres from north to south, by 100 metres from
east to west, towards the northern part of a large plateau of
volcanic tufa, bordered on three sides by large glaciers or
Jökulls, the principal of which are, on the north, the Láng
Jökull; on the north-east, the Hofs-Jökull and the Arnarfells
Jökull; on the east, the Skaptár-Jökull; on the south, Hecla
and the Torfa-Jökull.
    This vast plateau is traversed, from north-east to south
west, by two of the largest rivers in Iceland, the Hvítá and
the Thjórsá, and by their numerous tributaries: these two
principal rivers, which take their sources, the first in the
snows of the Láng-Jökull, and the second at the foot of the
Arnarfells-Jökull, flow into the sea at the south-west part of
the plateau, which is terminated on this side by low sandy
shores. At numerous points of the plateau containing the gey
sirs, rise mountains which have in many instances the form of
isolated cones, composed of a conglomerate, the chief con
stituent of which is basalt and a brown tufa, the principal
element of which appears to be the mineral which Sartorius
von Waltershausen found in the ancient tufas of Etna, and
which he has named palagonite. The height of these moun
 tains, several of which have preserved the appearance of
 craters of eruption, and still present, on their slopes or at
their base, debris of streams of lava, does not exceed 500 to
600 metres.
    Beside these cones, we meet with some hillocks of a gray
phonolite, inclosing numerous crystals of felspar, and very
small crystals of pyroxene: some strips of ancient trap or
compact basalt, often divided into columns, appear also at the
 surface of the plateau; and a sort of vitreous pitchstone, both
 green and reddish, which appears to have resulted from the
 fusion of the phonolite by the basalt, is ordinarily seen in
contact with these two rocks.
    The hill nearest to the geysirs, from which it is distant
 only about 360 metres, to the west, consists of upheaved
and almost vertical strata of a bluish gray phonolite, much

394 M. Descloizeaux’s Physical and Geological Observations
disintegrated on the lower part, where it presents numerous
traces of having been acted upon and undergone a slight altera
tion by the thermal waters, but it is tenacious and tolerably
homogeneous towards the summit. The height above the
plain of this hill, which has the name of Laugafjall, may be
estimated at seventy-five metres. From the foot of its eastern
escarpment, an undulating district extends for a length of
about 350 metres, entirely consposed of ancient siliceous con
cretions, slightly altered and friable. This district, the highest
hills of which rise to nearly twenty-five to thirty metres’
elevation above the plain, is pierced with a multitude of holes,
from which steam and the vapour of sulphuretted hydrogen
still escape; small quantities of alum and sulphur are deposited
on the edges of some of these holes, one of which is situated
at the very foot of the trachytic hill.
    The existence of an ancient siliceous district, so extensive
as that which I have just mentioned, certainly appears attri
butable to numerous extinct geysirs, the abundant deposits
of which have at length completely stopped the orifices from
which their eruptions took place. The lower part of this
ancient district is separated from the deposits of the present
Great Geysir by a small ravine of two metres in depth, situ
ated at ten metres from the basin of the geysir, and directed
nearly from south to north. The sides of this ravine, from
whence acid vapours are also disengaged at several points,
discloses both in the ancient and modern formation, numerous
layers of siliceous concretions of a very varied aspect, distri
buted in the midst of a bolary clay in which the red colour
predominates.
    On the right side which bounds the deposits of the present
geysir, and in a very plastic clay, we meet with small stems of
birch-trees, of the size of those which still grow in the country,
entirely silicified and converted into chalcedony; the clay itself
is full of small crystals of white pyrites, formed from the iron
which it contains and of the sulphur of the vapour springs.
Above the chalcedonous stems, and approaching the most
recent strata of concretions, we now only find birch-leaves
and a network of herbaceous plants, forming a sort of siliceous
travertine. In this same part, and always in the middle of a
reddish clay, I have observed a thin, very regular, and exten
sive layer of zoned chalcedony; this substance, which is trans
lucid as long as it remains immersed in the moist clay, becomes
opake and of an enamel white by a simple desiccation in the
open air, without being able to re-acquire its transparency,
even on a prolonged immersion.
   The banks of the little river the Beiná, which flows at 300

                on the principal Geysirs of Iceland.        -         395
metres to the east of the Geysir, and into which a part of the
water that overflows after each eruption run, present a fact of
the same kind: in the midst of a network of silicified plants
forming several layers, the total thickness of which exceeds
three metres, we found small portions of silex, which pos
sessed all the properties of precious opal, as long as they are
strongly hydrated, but which only preserve their vivid colours
while they remain immersed in water, or are kept from drying.
May we not hence conclude that the opals and chalcedonies
of some ancient volcanic districts owe their origin to phaeno
mena similar to those of the present geysirs of Iceland P
   The left side of the small ravine spoken of above, which
bounds the deposits of the ancient extinct geysirs, did not
present chalcedonous wood, but we extracted from it birch
stems transformed into very friable white silica, which ap
peared to have been derived from individuals larger than
those we meet with at the present day in Iceland. Some spe
cimens of these woods, in which the cells and vessels may still
be observed under the microscope, are penetrated in various
directions with small roots which appear to belong to the
same species; we might without doubt thence conclude that the
large stems were already in a state of advanced decomposition
when the silica came and penetrated into their tissue, a cir
cumstance which would perhaps explain the reason why these
woods have not been converted into chalcedony, but into pul
verulent silica.
   It is at all events certain that a birch-wood once existed
between the ancient and recent geysirs; and, as these trees.
cannot live where the soil is covered with siliceous concre
tions, it must be admitted that these two classes of fountains
did not exist simultaneously, and that the recent geysirs suc
ceeded the primitive geysirs, when the orifices of these last
became insufficient to give a passage to the masses of water
which had to be cast forth *.
   With respect to the duration of the ancient phaenomena,
the depth of twenty-five metres at least of the soil which they
have formed, shows that it must have been very considerable.
In fact, the concretions deposited by the present geysirs have
not yet exceeded a thickness of four to five metres; and all
seems to prove that, within the historical period of Iceland,
the increase of this thickness, which is distributed over an ex
tended surface, has been very small, so that we must attribute
a very high antiquity to the recent geysirs themselvest.
  * A very detailed description of the districts formed by the ancient and
recent geysirs has been given by M. Robert in the geological part of the
Voyage of the Northern Scientific Commission to Iceland.

396 M. Descloizeaux’s Physical and Geological Observations
    The two jetting springs, the temperatures of which I have
principally sought to determine during my stay in that locality
with M. Bunsen of Marburg, are the Great Geysir and the
 Strokkur. I shall first direct my remarks to the & Geysir.
    The only observations of any accuracy which we hitherto
possessed on the temperature of this spring are those of
 M. Lottin, a member of the Northern Scientific Commis
sion, who visited Iceland in 1836; but these observations left
much still to be desired, both from the method itself which
 M. Lottin followed, and from the experiments not having
been sufficiently repeated to embrace the various phases of
the moments of calm and of eruptions of the geysir. The
determinations which M. Bunsen and I have made were taken
immediately before a great eruption, immediately after that
eruption, and in the interval of two great consecutive erup
tions. The thermometers which I employed were double
bulbed, and constructed by Bunten after the directions of M.
 Regnault+: they were composed of a small cylindrical reser
voir, surmounted by a stem of accurate calibre, and divided
into parts of equal capacity; this stem ended in a finely drawn
out point terminating almost at the summit of a small cap of
thin glass, soldered to the top of the stem, at the part where
its diameter began to diminish, and containing a small excess
of mercury.
     In taking observations with these thermometers, the stem
 was entirely filled with mercury, at the ambient temperature;
 it was then immersed, by the side of a good standard, in a
 bath, the temperature of which was nearly constant, and lower
 than that which was to be observed: a portion of the mercury
 of the stem was raised into the small upper bulb. When the
 mercury was stationary and occupied exactly the extremity of
the small drawn-out point, the temperature of the standard
formed in a given time, to establish at the Geysir itself a fixed mark capable
of resisting the ignorant curiosity of certain visitors, I endeavoured to con
struct one easy to be recognised only by the forewarned and attentive eye.
For this purpose, I chose two contiguous laugs, situated at nearly an equal
distance from the Strokkur and the Geysir, proceeding towards the Laugaf
jall: the most northern laug, without apparent overflow, is contained in a
nearly elliptical basin, the major axis of which is seven metres, the minor
one 3m'40, and the depth 2"55; the temperature at the surface was
found to be 98°5. The second laug, separated only from the first by a
small natural wall, has a more irregular basin, of a depth of 9m:30, and the
water of which, indicating a temperature of 96°-5, flows off incessantly by
a small rivulet which passes near the Strokkur, depositing on its way abun
dant incrustations. In the narrowest part of the wall which separates these
two laugs I made an aperture, the successive obliteration of which it will
always be easy to ascertain. The following were the dimensions of this
 aperture on July 12th, 1846:—Depth 0-065; length, from east to west,
 0*260; breadth, from north to south, Om-110.
    * See Scientific Memoirs, Part XVI. p. 588.

                on the principal Geysirs of Icelaud.                     397
was noted; the thermometer, inclosed in a copper or iron case,
the lid of which was hermetically closed by means of a screw
and red-lead cement, was let down into the spring; after
remaining there thirty minutes, it was raised and compared
again with the standard; the mercury stopped at a certain
division of the stem, and the quantity of mercury which had
escaped from the stem during the observation, converted into
centigrade degrees and added to the first temperature indi
cated by the standard, gave the temperature of the spring.
The thermometers employed by M. Bunsen were constructed
upon the same principle; only that, instead of a capsule sol
dered to the upper part of the stem, the capillary opening of
the latter was closed by a small point of iron, kept vertical by
means of a spring, which the mercury could raise, so as to fall
over into the case.
    In each of the five experiments which we made at the
Great Geysir, we employed five thermometers arranged on a
single line, and separated by nearly equal intervals.
    It is known that the Great Geysir has formed by successive
incrustations a very regular basin, having the shape of a trun
cated cone, the exterior slopes of which have a mean inclina
tion of 8°, whose summit is occupied by a cup or vase”, pre
senting only on the edges some small clefts through which is
carried the overflow of the water, when its level rises.                The
mean inclination of the sides of this cup is 13°.
    In the centre of the basin is a circular well, which appears
perfectly regular as far as the eye can discern. Between two
consecutive eruptions, this well and the cup which surrounds it
are completely filled with water, a very small portion only of
which overflows after the upheavings, which take place about
every hour and half: but immediately after the great erup
tions, the cup is completely empty, and in the well the water
descends below the bottom of the cup from one metre to
2”50, according as the projected column had attained a
greater or less height; the former level is not restored until
after six or seven hours.                                     t
    The following are the principal dimensions which we have
found for the different parts of the Geysir:—

   As we took care, in each experiment, to alter the order of
our thermometers, that their indications might be checked, I
shall indicate by numbers and by the letter B those of M.
Bunsen, and by the letter D those which belonged to me.
   It will be conceived that the temperature at the surface of
the water which fills the basin must be excessively variable;
for that temperature depends at the same time on the tempe
rature of the sides of the basin, on that of the air, on the force
and direction of the wind, and on the hygrometric state of
the atmosphere, which allows of a more or less speedy evapo
ration. This is the reason why the numbers given by differ
ent travellers, for the temperature of the water on the edge of
the basin, agree so little; we ourselves made a series of ob
servations, the terms of which differ considerably among them
selves. They are as follow:—

       Mean temperature of the column of water 108°83.
   The three preceding tables show, in an evident manner,
that the mean temperature of the column of water which fills
the central well of the Great Geysir, remaining in other re
spects constant, the distribution of the temperature, in dif
ferent points of that column, varies with the moment when
the observation was made. We see, on examining these
tables, that there is at the bottom of the well a maximum, im
mediately before the eruptions, which may be estimated at
127°; and a minimum, immediately after, which may be esti
mated at 123°.
   The results given in the two following tables, obtained at
different periods between two consecutive eruptions, show
that the phaenomenon always passes in the same manner, and
with tolerable regularity:—

    Thus, notwithstanding the relative lightness of the most
 heated water, which tends to rise to the surface, we see that,
even after the eruptions, the temperature of the different strata
does not become equalized ; still further, in proportion as the
inferior strata become heated, to reach their maximum, the
 upper strata become cool, undoubtedly in consequence of
evaporation, and of the heat communicated to the sides of the
well and the basin; so that the greatest difference of tempera
ture at the two extreme levels corresponds precisely to the
moment of the eruptions.                     -
    We can now ascertain what would be the boiling-point of
water submitted to a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere,
augmented by the liquid column the height and mean tem
perature of which we have determined in our five experiments.
For this purpose, we must first express the pressure of this
liquid column in millimetres of mercury at 0°. The density
of the water of the Geysir, found at from 1-0010 to 10° cen
tigrade; the curve which represents the results obtained by
M. Isidore Pierre for the dilatation of distilled water, and
which I admit as being applicable to the water of the Geysir,
extending it up to 113°; lastly, the density of the mercury
at 0°, compared to that of distilled water at 4°, and found at
13:596 by M. Regnault, enables us to make this reduction.
We thus find that the heights of the columns of water in our
different experiments correspond, in millimetres of mercury at
  °, to the following numbers:—                  m

   Thus, at the point to which the lower thermometer can
penetrate, the water does not attain the temperature of ebulli
tion which it should have under the pressure to which it is
subjected; but it approaches that temperature in proportion
as a great eruption is near. We may thence conclude that
the centre of heat which raises the temperature of the water
of the Geysir is situated at a certain distance below the pre
sumed bottom of the central well, and we may deduce from
this a plausible explanation of the manner in which the erup
tions are determined.
   Let us in fact suppose that the column of water in the cen
tral basin communicates, by a long and sinuous channel, with
the space, be it what it may, which receives the direct action
of the subterranean heat: after an eruption during which a
projection of a great quantity of water and vapour has taken
place, the lower parts of the liquid mass are cooled, and the
steam which is formed in the reservoir submitted to the action
of the heat has a less tension than that at which the weight of
the central column and that of the atmosphere are in equili
brium; this vapour, as it forms, becomes condensed in con
tact with the water which fills the sinuous channel, and it im
parts to that water its latent heat. The increase of tempera
ture of the water of the channel is transmitted by degrees to the
lower part of the central column where the thermometer
can reach; but this increase is retarded by the atmospheric
air and the other gases which accompany the vapour; how
ever, at the lapse of a shorter or longer time, the water of the
channel must boil, and the steam which continues to form can
not longer condense there; this vapour must therefore accu
mulate, and acquire a gradually increasing tension, until this

402 M. Descloiseaux's Physical and Geological Observations
tension is able to overcome the resistance of the column of
water which fills the basin, and to project it into the air.
     A thermometer placed at four metres above the bottom of
the central well during an eruption which took place July 14,
1846, at 3' 15" in the morning, and which raised the column
of water to 49*37, according to a measurement taken by M.
Waltershausen, indicated a temperature of 124°24, which
corresponds perfectly to what would have been found at the
same point in the third and fourth experiments.
     In the intervals of the great eruptions it often happens that
the column of water is raised to one metre, or 1"50 above the
usual level, and it is easy to conceive that it must be thus; for,
if the vapour formed in the subterranean reservoir is not con
densed entirely at its contact with the water of the sinuous
channel of which I have spoken, and if it is accompanied with a
sufficient quantity of atmospheric air, or of other gases, it must
in the end divide the liquid column, and escape at the sur
face, producing those subterranean detonations and those jets
which all travellers have remarked. A fact worthy of atten
tion is, that these detonations appear to be produced periodi
cally with sufficient regularity; whereas the great eruptions
only take place at quite unequal intervals, as is shown by
the following table of a series of observations which we con
tinued for several days. This difference might be explained
by admitting that the production of vapour is not perfectly
regular. In the following table, the three columns indicate
the date of the observations, the hours when the detonations
or jets took place, and those when great eruptions were pro
duced:—

    The heights of the two most remarkable eruptions during
our visit to the Geysir, measured by M. Sartorius von Wal
tershausen with a theodolite, gave—
   The 6th of July, at 11h 00m A.M., 145 French <U+017F>t.=47"101.
   The 14th of July, at 3h 15m A.M., 152 French <U+017F>t.=49*375.
    I have said, at the commencement of this memoir, that the
water, when it had completely left the basin, after the great
eruptions, descended into the central well, at about 2"50 be
low its orifice. The following are two numbers I observed:–
    The 11th of July, at 6 o'clock in the evening, a depth
        of water below the orifice of the well .                    .  .    .    . 2”00

   * The great eruptions are denoted by an *.
   # If we calculate the quantity of water which, to produce this lowering,
escaped from the basin, during and after the eruption, to flow almost
wholly into the Beiná, we find that this quantity was, in the first case,
157*585, and, in the second case, 161”825: now, admitting that at

404 M. Descloiseaux's Physical and Geological Observations
    I also availed myself of my visit to the Geysir to make
some chemical experiments upon the water of this remarkable
spring, which it would have been difficult to render so con
clusive with water carried to Paris. I paid particular atten
tion to the estimation of the sulphuretted hydrogen, the odour
of which is very perceptible in the vapour which incessantly
escapes from the basin, and to ascertain whether the soda
contained in that water is in the caustic or carbonated state.
    The sulphydrometer of M. Dupasquier served me for the
first determination. On operating with necessary caution, I
found that one litre of water of the Geysir, perfectly limpid
 and cooled, protected from contact with the air, to about 40°,
 contained 2°448 of sulphuretted hydrogen.
    To ascertain the state of the soda, we collected some water
 in a well-stoppered bottle, acidulated it with some drops of
 hydrochloric acid, and boiled it; the vapour, collected in some
 lime-water, yielded a very perceptible precipitate. Mixed
 with some ammoniacal chloride of calcium, the water was not
 rendered perceptibly turbid; it therefore does not contain
 free carbonic acid.
    The presence of chlorine or of alkaline chlorides was like
 wise ascertained by means of nitrate of silver.
     To obtain a complete analysis of this water, I collected a
 quantity in a flask with a drawn-out neck and closed it over
 the lamp, and in glass bottles closed with a good cork stopper
 covered with caoutchouc.
     The water of the first flask was employed to estimate the
 carbonic acid combined with the soda; this determination
 was made in the laboratory of the Val-de-Grâce, where M.
 Millon was kind enough to place at our disposal one of the
 apparatus which he employs to estimate the carbonic acid in
 organic analysis. A second operation, made comparatively
 on water of the bottles closed with a caoutchouc stopper, gave
 a result nearly identical with that of the first experiment.
 metres = 156,760 kilogrammes in the second case, on condensing upon
 the lower part of the Geysir, might re-establish its primitive level.
     I have stated above that this level was re-established in about seven
  hours, and that from that moment only a small quantity of water flowed
  over after each of the detonations which took place every two hours.
    The deficit in the Geysir, after a great eruption, might therefore be
  made good by a subterraneous disengagement of vapour, varying from
  1807 kilogrammes to 2394 kilogrammes an hour. Now an ordinary steam
  engine, without coating or covering and working without pressure (sans en
  veloppe et sans détente, consuming five kilogrammes of pit-coal an hour,
  expends about thirty kilogrammes of vapour by horse-power. We see
  therefore that the present phaenomenon of the Geysir requires for its
  production, only a development of vapour corresponding to nearly that of
 an engine of 700 horse-power, which gives an approximate idea of the
  order of this phaenomenon.

    M. Damour kindly undertook the analysis of the residue
which this water leaves on evaporation, and I here transcribe
only the results which he has given in a separate notice. A
litre of this water, evaporated at 65° centigrade, gives a resi
due weighing 1.3900 gr., and effervescing with acids. Heated
to 300°, the weight of this residue was reduced to 1-1830;
and at a cherry-red heat the residue agglutinates, and now
amounts to only 1:0540.
   The same quantity of water contains,—

   In several analyses, M. Damour found that the relation
3 : 1 between the oxygen of the silica and that of the bases
was constant, and he concluded therefrom that the silica is
probably dissolved first in the water of the Geysir, in the
state of alkaline silicates, NaO, SiO4, 3NaO, 2SiO2, which
can be produced artificially, and which are very soluble in
water; then, by the action of the sulphurous and hydro
chloric vapours, sulphates and chlorides are formed : the
quantity of alkali combined with the silica undergoes a suc
cessive reduction, and the primitive relation of 3:1 becomes
9 : 1. In this state of saturation, a portion of the silica ceases
to be soluble, and is deposited, without doubt, in a quantity
corresponding to the amount of alkali saturated every day by
the action of the vapour springs, and consequently of the

406 M. Descloiseaux's Physical and Geological Observations
oxidation of the alkaline sulphurets in contact with the
atmosphere.
   We can conceive that the water of the Geysir, passing into
the state of vapour at a very high temperature in subterranean
conduits formed by felspathic rocks, attacks their sides, and
is thus charged with the salts which the analysis discovers
In 15.
   Beside the analysis of the water of the Geysir, the memoir
of M. Damour contains those of several of the springs of
Reykir, on the south coast of the island, and that of the water
of Laugarnes, situated at a short distance from Reykjavík.
All these waters are alkaline and siliciferous; and, although
the proportions of the substances which they contain are
different in each, they offer, like that of the Geysir, a constant
relation between the oxygen of the silica and that of the bases:
only, the thermal springs of Reykir deposit, like the Geysir,
numerous siliceous concretions, whilst that of Laugarnes forms
none at all. The experiments of M. Damour explain this
difference very well; for in the waters of Reykir, the con
stant relation between the oxygen of the silica and that of the
bases is as 2: 1; and after subtracting the quantity of alkalies
necessary to saturate the chlorine and sulphuric acid, this re
lation becomes as 8: 1. In this state of saturation, a part of
the silica ceases to be soluble and is deposited.
   In the water of Laugarnes, on the contrary, the primitive
relation of the quantities of oxygen is as 3:1, as for the
Geysir, and this relation, after the saturation of the chlorine
and the sulphuric acid, becomes as 6:1, numbers which re
present an alkaline silicate entirely soluble in water.
                             Strokkur.
   The Strokkur, the Icelandic name of which, signifying
churn, well indicates the continual movement of the water in
the channel which contains it, is situated at about sixty metres
to the south of the Great Geysir. It has not, like the latter,
formed itself a regular and conical basin; the waters occupy
a sort of level well, the edges of which are only encircled
by a rounded mound, and worn by the frequent passage of
the waters.
   The dimensions of this channel are as follows:—
       Total depth below the surface .       . . .    13”55
       Diameter of the opening . . .         . . .     2"40

   The channel of this second jetting spring is therefore irre
gular, and its diameter diminishes rapidly from the surface to

    at rather above three metres below the ground, falls prin
    cipally after great eruptions, but it sometimes rises suddenly;
    and the surface of the water is incessantly boiling.

    oscillations:—

       To determine the temperature of this column of water, we

 always supposed that its temperature there was that of boiling
 water; the second and third experiments show, in fact, that
 at one metre below the surface it is so. Lastly, a thermo
 meter placed at the bottom of the channel during an erup
 tion, indicated a temperature of 115° C.
    We see that the column of the water of the Strokkur pos
 sesses, at different heights, much more constant temperatures
 than those of the Geysir, and that the influence of the erup
 tions is very. little felt; this depends evidently on the con
 tinual boiling of the water, which determines incessantly
 ascending currents in the column and a sort of intermixture.
 The mean height of the column of water of the Strokkur is
 equal to a column of mercury at 0°, of 0"7179.
    The temperature at which the water, submitted to this pres
 sure and to that of the atmosphere, would begin to boil, is
 120°.043.
    We have seen that the maximum temperature at the
 bottom of the Strokkur was 115°; the difference between this
 maximum and the point of ebullition of the water is therefore
 5°.043. This number is sensibly smaller than the corre
 sponding number found at the Great Geysir, which may be
 owing to the point attained by the thermometer in the Strok
 kur being nearer to the subterranean source of heat, or to the
 channels which form the communication between the liquid
 column and that central point being narrower; the heat parted
 with by the vapour condensed to the water of this channel is
 transmitted more rapidly to the base of the column.
    The eruptions of the Strokkur, which are quite as high as
 those of the Great Geysir, instead of presenting, like the
 latter, the appearance of a beautiful fountain with a base three
 metres in diameter, and a crown of about eighteen metres,
present, only an ensemble of sharp, jagged points, resembling
very tall and slender yew-trees. In the Geysir, the eruptions
always take place naturally; at the Strokkur, on the contrary,
they are either natural or artificial. All travellers in fact
have remarked that, if the orifice of the Strokkur is filled
with light stones or pieces of earth and grass, the oscillations
of the water cease for some instants; then, at the end of five
or ten minutes, a jet of a blackish water charged with earth
is shot out to a great height, and is followed by other inter
mitting jets during eight to ten minutes. This experiment,
which can be repeated several times a day with success, seems
to prove that the small excess of pressure resulting from the
accumulation of clods of earth upon the water suffices to
hinder the normal disengagement of the vapour through
the column of water, and to augment the tension of that which

        Mr. Porrett on a New Vegeto-Alkali in Gun-Cotton. 409
  is formed in the subterranean reservoir, to the extent of pro
  ducing a sudden detonation.
      Be this as it may, as we desired to know whether the
  natural eruptions of the Strokkur were produced more regu
  larly than those of the Geysir, and had any connexion with
  them, we only forced the eruptions twice at our arrival, and
  we noted, in the following table, all the great natural erup
  tionS:—

     It will be seen from this table that the natural eruptions of
 the Strokkur do not present more regularity than those of the
 Geysir, and that their coincidence with the latter, if it some
 times happens, is not general.
     Some observers have admitted that there was a direct com
 munication between the Strokkur and the Geysir; unfortu
 nately I was not able, during my visit, to collect water from
 the Strokkur sufficiently freed from the earthy matters coming
 from the clods of earth which we threw upon it during the
 first days of our arrival, to bring it back and submit it to an
 accurate analysis; but the quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen,
 which I found to be 108-748 per litre, differs sufficiently from
 that which the water of the Geysir contains, to allow us
 to conceive that these two springs, subjected perhaps to the
 same cause of subterranean heat, are not, as has been thought,
 in immediate connexion.
LXI. On the evistence of a New Vegeto-Alkali in Gun
                Cotton.      By Rob ERT Por RETT, Esq.*
AT the last meeting of this Society on the 7th instant, a joint
       communication from Mr. Teschemacher and myself “On
the Chemical Composition of Gun-Cotton” was readt, and
in the last paragraph but one thereof I suggested that a view
    * Communicated by the Chemical Society; having been read Dec. 21,
1846.
   + This communication will be found at p. 273 of the present volume of
this Journal.

410 Mr. Porrett on a New Vegeto-Alkali in Gun-Cotton.
might be taken of the arrangement of its elementary particles
which would account for the singular fact of its non-acidity,
by supposing it a compound of nitrous acid and oxide of
lignin, the said new oxide being also supposed to possess al
kaline properties.
   It was before mentioned that the action of a small voltaic
battery on gun-cotton gave but very slight indications of its
decomposition, but that slight as they were they were rather
favourable to the suggestion; the indifference of this compound
to the electrical action of the battery I found was owing to
its highly non-conducting nature, but I succeeded rather
better by moistening the gun-cotton with acetic acid, and
placing it in a thin layer between a plate of silver and one of
zinc, completing the circuit with a copper wire and leaving
them for forty-eight hours so arranged; at the end of that
time, on dismounting this little voltaic arrangement, the
inner surface of the silver plate was found to be encrusted with
a small quantity of matter, which when dry looked white like
starch, which powerfully restored the blue colour of reddened
litmus paper, and which when heated to redness left a black
carbonaceous residue ; the minute quantity obtained made
further experiments with it impossible, but it increased my
desire to be able to procure the same substance by chemical
means in any quantity that might be wanted.
   After several trials I succeeded by the following process.
   I took 2 ounces by measure of nitric acid of the specific
gravity 1.45, to which I added 50 grains of gun-cotton; the
mixture being gradually heated to 100° of Fahrenheit's scale
and kept below 180°, became quite transparent and fluid, and
all the cotton disappeared, being quietly dissolved without
any evolution of gas; when a portion of the solution in this
state was dropped into water a white precipitate was formed,
having all the properties, structure excepted, of the original
gun-cotton, the liquid was therefore a simple solution in acid,
without decomposition; but on heating the liquid further up
to 240°, deep red acid vapours were given off abundantly for
a long time, and these collected in a receiver surrounded with
ice proved to be hyponitrous acid. The same effect exactly
took place when sulphuric acid was used instead of nitric at
the same temperature, so that the hyponitrous acid was merely
eliminated in both cases, and not formed from the excess of
nitric acid used in the former instance; the cold and very
concentrated nitric solution containing a great excess of acid
was now brought nearly, but not quite, towards a neutral state
by pouring into it a strong solution of subcarbonate of potash,
after which a solution of bicarbonate of potash was used

      Mr. Porrett on a New     Vegeto-Alkali in Gun-Cotton. 411
until perfect neutrality was obtained: the liquid in this state
became thickened, not only by the quantity of minute crystals
of nitrate of potash formed in it beyond what it could hold in
 solution, but also by an abundant precipitate of a whitish-gray
 colour, consisting of the new alkali probably in a state of car
bonate. The liquid was heated nearly to ebullition, during
 which its colour became darker, and it was set aside in order
 that the crystals of nitrate of potash formed on cooling might
 be separated and the liquid disembarrassed of them as much
 as possible; after this it was evaporated to dryness by the heat
 of a water-bath, and the brownish residue was acted upon
 first by sulphuric aether, which however would not dissolve
any portion of it; next by alcohol, specific gravity 0.813,
which took up a very small quantity of the new alkali; then
spirit of wine was tried; the solvent power was greater than
that of the alcohol, but it had the disadvantage of taking up
with the alkaline matter a very minute quantity of the nitrate
of potash which accompanied it, so that I could not get an
exclusive solvent for the former; the principal quantity by
far of the carbonated alkaline oxide of lignin still remained,
and I was obliged to use a small quantity of cold, distilled
water for its solution, notwithstanding that the water took up
at the same time some of the nitrate of potash and bicar
bonate of potash remaining in the mass. This aqueous solu
tion contains the new alkali in abundance, but mixed as stated
with the other two salts, it acts very powerfully upon red
dened litmus paper.
    When a portion of the hyponitrous acid is neutralized by
an aqueous solution of the new alkali, hyponitrite of oxide
of lignin, probably identical with gun-cotton or with xyloidine,
is reproduced and precipitated as an insoluble compound.
    Thus I have verified the accuracy of my suggestion, ex
cepting that instead of nitrous acid neutralized by a new
alkali existing in gun-cotton, it is the hyponitrous acid so
neutralized that constitutes that substance.       For this new
alkali I have proposed the name Lignia, and believe that it
opens a wide field for scientific research.
    I suspect that in the natural decay of woody fibre from
leaves and rotting plants this alkali is produced in combina
tion with acetic acid, and that the acetate of lignia so formed
exists in the sap of all vegetables; further, that it is decom
posed and deoxidated by light acting on the leaves and bark
of trees, reproducing lignin for the assimilation and growth
of the plant: its action also on the animal system deserves
inquiry. I lay no stress however on these speculations, ex
cepting so far as they may stimulate others to enter into in

 412       On some new Researches in Animal Chemistry.
 vestigations which it is impossible for me, consistently with
 my other duties, to find time for carrying on, and I leave the
 subject without reserve to those who have more leisure.
     I would remark, that the composition of lignia must be
 that of lignin plus 2 atoms of oxygen given up by the nitric
 acid in becoming hyponitrous acid; and I would further
 observe, that the latter acid and lignia forming an insoluble
 compound, may probably be employed as mutual tests of each
 other’s presence in combinations.
 LXII. On some new Researches in Animal Chemistry.                Ea:-
    tracted from a Letter from Professor LIEBIG to Dr. A.
    W. HoFMANN +.
 I AM      at present occupied with the investigation of the con
      stituents of the animal fluids which are found without the
 blood and lymphatic vessels. The fluid from flesh, for ex
ample, reacts strongly acid, and the question was, whence
 arose this acidity? After overcoming more difficulties than I
have ever experienced in any investigation, I have for the
 first time indisputably proved that free lactic and phosphoric
acid exist in the whole organism wherever muscle is found.
 How curious, that in the absence of all proofs on the part
of the opponents of lactic acid, I should now demonstrate
to them its existence in the flesh of oxen, fowls, calves, and
sheep, by preparing and analysing the most beautifully cry
stallized zinc and lime salts!        How wonderful, that in the
animal organism acids and alkalies are found separated by a
membrane, constituting myriads of little galvanic circles,
which, as such, must produce chemical and electrical effects
To the latter class I refer all the observations of Matteucci,
which can now be easily explained.
    I have further found that the flesh of the muscles of oxen,
fowls, sheep, calves, and the carnivorous pike contain crea
tin, prepared by Chevreul eleven years ago, and which, from
Berzelius’s not being able to reproduce it, has since then, in
a measure, disappeared from the field of science. Creatin
is a beautiful substance, having the formula Cs Na Hu Og.
At the temperature of 100°C. it loses 2 equivs. of water, and
becomes Cs Na Ho O. = glycocoll + ammonia or caffein +
amidogen and water. Heated in a stream of hydrochloric
acid, creatin loses 4 equivs. of water and takes up 1 of hy
drochloric acid. By this treatment, however, its nature is
entirely altered, being now converted into a beautiful organic
base, the properties of which are totally different from those
lºommunicated by       the Chemical Society; having been read Dec. 21,

         On some new Researches in Animal Chemistry.        413
of creatin.   It becomes now soluble in water, and forms with
bichloride of platinum a fine crystallized double salt.
   I have, finally, discovered two other new bodies in the
same fluids, of which the one crystallizes in needles, the other
in plates of the lustre of mother-of-pearl. Unfortunately I
have obtained scarcely sufficient for two analyses from 40 lbs.
of the flesh of oxen and 20 of that of fowls.                -
   I see a boundless field before me, and doubt not that for
every quality of the animal body, something which can be
estimated quantitatively, will also be discovered to which it is
indebted for its properties.
   I have also satisfied myself as to the part which common
salt plays in the bodies of animals. I have found that the
fluids without the blood and lymphatic vessels contain only
potash-salts, viz. chloride of potassium and phosphate of
potash, with phosphate of magnesia, whilst the blood and
lymph contain merely those of soda (phosphate of soda). If,
therefore, the latter are indispensable to the formation of
blood and the processes of life, it is evident that an animal
 on the continent, which finds in plants only potash-salts,
 should have chloride of sodium given to it, by means of which
the phosphate of potash of the seeds and of the rest of the
plant is transformed into chloride of potassium and phosphate
of soda.   I found further that the salt brine which flows from
salted meat contained certainly alkaline phosphates, and that
 scurvy is hence easily explained by the deficiency in the
 salted meat of the alkaline phosphates necessary to the for
mation of blood. The soup from boiled meat contains the
 soluble phosphates of the flesh, and the meat itself the in
 soluble. Neither the soup nor the flesh alone can maintain
 the processes of life, but both must be taken together. The
 English have in this respect hit upon the proper practice.
 In a theoretical point of view their food is more correctly
 combined than that of the Germans.                  -
    Still more wonderful results have been obtained by the oxi
 dation of casein by means of peroxide of manganese and sul
 phuric acid, by M. Gugelberger. Three products are ob
 tained: the first of which is aldehyde, the second oil of bitter
 almonds, and the third a fluid aethereal body with a compo
 sition similar to metacetone. The aldehyde was analysed as
 aldehydite of ammonia, of which a considerable quantity was
 obtained.   From oil of bitter almonds the most beautiful ben
 zoic acid was produced by the action of chlorine.
    From these results a sort of conception may be obtained
 how and wherefore many medicines have a certain deleterious
 or useful action.

414        Dr. Muspratt on the Salts of Sulphurous Acid.
    Urea, creatin, glycocoll, leucin, cystin, &c. are organic
bases, and only products of the animal body or its elements,
and organic bases are partly poisonous, partly beneficial in
their action. I have caused the new experiments of Mulder
on his protein to be repeated. The substance prepared by
Fleitmann in this laboratory, according to his new method,
and supposed to be free from sulphur, still contains 1.5 per
cent., as does likewise a similar preparation by Laskowski.
    I beg of you to communicate this short notice to the Che
mical Society, of which I have the honour to be a member.
             LXIII. On the Salts of Sulphurous Acid.
            By J. SHERIDAN MUSPRATT, Esq., Ph.D.*
I HAVE been induced to return to this subject by a paper
     lately published by Dr. Rammelsberg in Poggendorff’s
Annalent. In his treatise he differs slightly from me in the
quantities of water contained in some of the sulphites, but as
he invariably took his water as loss and as mine was generally
determined by combustion with chromate of lead, I did not
think it worth while going over all the analyses that I had
performed in Giessen, being so thoroughly convinced of the
accuracy of those results. The only point where we materially
disagree is regarding the constitution of the red sulphite of
copper, and which will be subsequently discussed under that
head. When I first undertook, in Baron Liebig’s laboratory,
the investigation of the salts of sulphurous acid, very little
was known of their constitution; but since that time they
have occupied the attention of numerous chemists, and are
now invested with as much interest as the compounds of any
other acid. They are very readily decomposed either by
moisture or heat, and on this account may have led different
chemists to the assumption of various formulae for the same
salt. For example, there is scarcely any salt of this acid
which does not contain traces of sulphate, which are always
overlooked in the analysis; and moreover, unless great care
is exercised in oxidizing the sulphurous acid when its quantity
is to be determined, serious errors may arise.             I shall now
proceed to the description of the sulphites under their re
spective heads.
    Sulphite of Soda.-This salt is obtained by transmitting
sulphurous acid through a solution of carbonate of soda until
the liquid becomes acid, and then allowing the solution to

         Dr. Muspratt on the Salts of Sulphurous Acid.        415
repose for some days under a bell-jar over sulphuric acid.
The crystals possess a cooling and sulphurous taste, and are
slightly alkaline to test-paper.
   Analysis:–7:10 grs. burned with chromate of lead gave
4.19 grs. of water = 59:01 per cent.
         -          Formula, NaO, SO2 + 10 aq.
   Vauquelin has described a sulphite of soda of the following
constitution :-NaO, SO2+ 8aq; and Rammelsberg analysed
one which agreed with the annexed formula: NaO, SO3 + 7aq.
The varying proportions of water can only be accounted for
by the different temperatures at which the salts have been
formed.
   Bisulphite of Soda.--Dr. Rammelsberg obtained an acid
salt agreeing with the formula 2(NaO, 2SO2) + aq. I find
however on referring to his results that the formula Na SO,
 + HO SO2, which I gave in my former paper, corresponds
quite as well with his numbers as the one given by him.
    Sulphite of Ammonia.-I have not yet succeeded in pro
curing from an aqueous solution an ammoniacal sulphite of
sufficient stability for analysis. The salts formed in alcohol
and aether, and heretofore described *, possessed the sub
joined formulae:–
                         NH4O, SO2 + aq.
                         NH4O, SO2 + SO2.
    I have produced another ammonia sulphite by passing sul
 phurous acid into a very strong solution of caustic ammonia
 until there was no smell either of the acid or alkali, and then
 adding cautiously absolute alcohol. After a short time a
 brilliant white saline mass of crystals subsided, which were
 allowed to remain undisturbed for twenty-four hours. I threw
 the whole on to a filter and dried the crystals over sulphuric
 acid.     This salt is alkaline, and evolves traces of ammonia.
    Analysis:—23:09 grs. of the salt gave 33-88 grs. sulphite
 of barytes = 9:32 sulphurous acid or 40°36 per cent.
    The formula 2(NH4O, SO2) + NH3+3aq. requires 40-09
 per cent. sulphurous acid.                                     -
    Sulphites of the Protovide of Iron.—Finely divided metallic
 iron dissolves pretty readily in sulphurous acid, imparting to
 the liquid a slight green tinge. When this liquid is evapo
 rated in vacuo, very small and almost colourless crystals are
 obtained, which are but slightly soluble in water. Exposed
 to the air in a dry state they are not readily altered, but if
 moist are rapidly converted into sulphate. I found my sul
 phurous acid, on analysing this compound, to agree so closely

   Sulphites of the Perovide of Iron.—When sulphurous acid
is passed through water holding in suspension freshly-preci
pitated peroxide of iron, the whole readily dissolves, and the
liquid acquires a blood-red colour, which disappears on ex
posure to the air. If this solution be boiled so as to expel
the uncombined acid, and then left to the atmospheric action
for some days, it acquires a light brownish colour, and de
posits a reddish brown compound containing sulphurous acid
and peroxide of iron. Dr. Koene of Brussels expresses the
constitution of this salt by the formula
                         Fe2O3, SO2 + 7aq.
   I found that when caustic potash was added very gradu
ally to the blood-red solution above-mentioned, a yellowish
crystalline precipitate formed, the liquid remaining still acid.
This compound, after filtration, edulcoration and desiccation,
gave the following results:—
   9:01 grs. gave 2:18 grs. peroxide of iron.
   6-21 grs, gave 6'80 grs. Sulphate of barytes= 1.87 grs, sul
phuric acid.

   These numbers agree with the formula
               Fe2O, SO2 + 2(KO, SO2) + 5aq.
   This double sulphite of iron and potash appears to be
 Koene's salt, in which 2 equivalents of water are replaced by
 2 equivalents of sulphite of potash.
   The sulphite of the peroxide of iron forms a salt with sul
 phite of ammonia, but it is very difficult to get a sufficient

quantity of it for analyses. It contains 33.68 per cent. of
peroxide of iron.
   Sulphites of Nickel.—The two salts which I described in
my first paper on the sulphites possessed the subjoined for
mulae :—
                       NiO, SO3 + 4aq.
                       NiO, SO2 + 6aq.
   The latter agrees with the results of Fordos, Gélis and
Rammelsberg. I have again prepared the former by transmit
ting a stream of sulphurous acid gas into water holding in sus
pension carbonate of nickel. When the whole had dissolved,
the solution was filtered and boiled, which liberated a mass
of small greenish crystals, almost insoluble in water.
   6.02 grs. salt burned with chromate of lead gave 2.08 grs.
water = 34°55 per cent.
   The formula NiO, SO2 + 4 aq. affords 34.06 per cent. of
Water.
   Dr. Böttinger has described a double sulphite of nickel of
the following constitution :-
               NiO, SO2 + NH*O, SO2 + 4 aq.
   Sulphites of Cadmium.—Carbonate of cadmium in water is
readily dissolved by sulphurous acid, and when the resulting
solution is treated with absolute alcohol an aluminous-looking
precipitate appears, which when dried and heated in a test
tube affords no water—it must be the anhydrous sulphite of
cadmium. If however the gelatinous precipitate is allowed to
remain in the alcoholic menstruum for some days it disap
pears, and there deposit in its stead beautiful silvery-looking
crystals, which turn out to be the same salt as that ob
tained by Fordos and Gélis when dissolving the metal in the
acid.
   Analysis:—6-79 grs. of salt gave 6'94 grs. sulphate of ba
rytes= 1.90 sulphurous acid.
   8'll grs. salt gave 1.29 grs. water.

gave him the annexed formula,
                             2(CdC, SO.)+NH3.
   Sulphites of Copper.—The brilliant red salt which is formed
either by boiling together solutions of sulphate of copper and
sulphite of ammonia, or passing sulphurous acid into water,
holding in suspension oxide of copper, was first analysed by
Chevreul, whose numbers agree with the formula—
                             3Cu2O, 4SO2+5aq.
I gave the annexed formula for this salt,”—
                                 Cu2O, SO2+aq.
Böttingert analysed the compound after me, and his results
favour the formula—
                             3Cu2O, 4SO2+4aq.
Rammelsberg however has stated that the salt is a double
one, and constituted as follows:—
                    CuO, SO2+ Cu2O, SO2+2aq.
   I have reprepared the red salt by passing a stream of sul
phurous acid into water containing pure oxide of copper.
When the whole had dissolved, the liquid was boiled. The
red compound deposited in pretty large crystals, which were
thrown upon a filter and effused with cold water until the fil
trate did not afford the slightest milkiness with a solution of
chloride of barium. They were then dried in vacuo. I tested
the salt for sulphuric acid before submitting it to analysis,
and found traces present, even after taking every precaution.

   It is evident from the preceding results, that if the base of
this salt be only subowide of copper, its constitution may be
assumed as the following,
                           Cu,O, SO,--aq.

acid,

which I can only account for by his salt not being so well
washed as mine. My salt dissolves in hydrochloric acid, af
fording a colourless liquid, and when a weak solution of pot
ash is added to this, a white precipitate subsides. Yellow
prussiate of potash gives a whitish precipitate in the acid so
lution, soluble in an excess of muriatic acid.    When the red
salt is placed on a filter and affused with boiling water until
the filtrate affords no milkiness with barytes, half of its sul
phurous acid is removed.
7:37 grs. gave 4.41 grs. Ba0, SO3=1.21 SO3=16:41 per cent.
   This quantity favours the formula—
                          2(Cu,0, HO) SO2.
   Böttinger states in his paper, “That by long boiling with
the liquid this salt loses sulphurous acid and becomes lighter
in colour, which confirms my own observation. The analy
sis of such a precipitate gave me 66-60 per cent. of Cu2O,
which will account for the varying results obtained by dif
ferent chemists when analysing this red salt.”
    Sulphite of Copper and Soda.--When rather strong solu
tions of sulphate of copper and sulphite of soda are mixed
together and treated with absolute alcohol, a dark reddish
looking liquid, which greatly resembles nitrobenzide, sub
sides, and if this be collected and left in vacuo for some time,
fine yellow crystals appear, which after washing and desicca

sulphate of copper with a large excess of sulphite of am

from the sand-bath at 136°F., because at this temperature
 silvery-looking flakes began to deposit, which powerfully re
fracted the light. In a short time a large quantity of a
 shining compound had separated, which when dried over
 sulphuric acid and submitted to analysis gave the annexed
results:—

 I thought further determinations unnecessary. When this
 compound is heated with water, it is decomposed and the red
 gritty salt separates. Great care is required in the prepara
 tion of this sulphite, for it is difficult to prevent some of the
 red salt depositing with it. The best way to obtain it in large
 quantities, is to heat slightly a strong solution of sulphate of
 copper with an excess of bisulphite of ammonia, then cork
 the vessel and allow the mixture to remain undisturbed for
 some days.                                                       -

LXIV. Analysis of the Bohemian Glass as found in the
   Combustion Tubes employed in Organic Analysis. By Mr.
   THOMAS Row NEY”.                        … tº    :* * *   -
THE difficultly fusible variety of Bohemian glass has been
      repeatedly the subject of chemical investigation. We are
indebted to Berthiert, Dumasi, Gras Š, and lately Peligotº
for an analysis of this substance. The glass analysed by these
chemists was of the kind usually employed in the manufac
ture of Bohemian goblets, an art in which Bohemia has ex
celled for centuries.           * *  * * *   , , ,
   It appeared desirable to compare with the results of these
analyses the composition of the glass which is used for the
combustion of organic substances, and which likewise is
chiefly manufactured in Bohemia. The properties most valued
in this variety of glass are essentially different from those
sought for in other kinds, and it was to be expected that this
material, which has so greatly contributed to the progress of
organic chemistry, and upon which the German manufac
turers have of late bestowed so much attention, would also
show some marked peculiarity of composition.
   The following analysis was made in the laboratory of the
Royal College of Chemistry. The glass was selected from the
stock of the laboratory, recently imported from Germany, and
which numerous trials had proved to be of first-rate quality.
The tubes, though perfectly tractable in an energetic blow
pipe flame, scarcely altered their form during the longest
combustion in a strong charcoal fire; they never cracked
during the process, even on suddenly increasing the tempe
rature, and not uncommonly the same tube could be em
ployed repeatedly in analysis.
   A careful qualitative examination of the specimen having
proved the presence of silicic acid, lime, sesquioxide of iron,
alumina, oxide of manganese, magnesia, soda and potassa, the
quantitative determination was proceeded with.
               a. Determination of Silicic Acid.
   The finely-powdered glass was ignited with carbonate of
soda, treated with hydrochloric acid in excess, evaporated to
dryness, once more ignited and digested with hydrochloric
acid, after which all the silicic acid remained insoluble ; it
was collected on a filter, washed, ignited and weighed.
    I. 2:1890 grims. of glass gave l'5946 grim. silicic acid.
   II. 2' 1284 grims. of glass gave 1.5628 grm. silicic acid.

422                   Mr. Rowney's Analysis
                    b. Determination of Lime.
   The acid filtrate from the silicic acid was neutralized by
ammonia, then slightly acidulated with acetic acid and pre
cipitated by oxalate of ammonia, and the oxalate of lime con
verted into carbonate in the usual manner.
li I. 2:1890 grims, of glass gave 0-4203 grim. of carbonate of
 Inne.
   II. 2' 1284 grms. of glass gave 0.3843 grm. of carbonate of
lime.
     c. Determination of Alumina and Sesquioaide of Iron.
   To the liquid filtered from the precipitate of oxalate of lime
(b.), containing a large quantity of chloride of ammonium, am
monia was added in excess, by which alumina and sesqui
oxide of iron were precipitated and the oxide of manganese
and magnesia were retained in solution. The joint precipi
tate of alumina and sesquioxide of iron was collected, washed,
ignited and weighed; then dissolved in hydrochloric acid and
thrown down with potassa, which kept the alumina in solu
tion. The precipitate of sesquioxide of iron (thus obtained),
once more dissolved in hydrochloric acid and reprecipitated by
ammonia, was now collected, ignited and weighed; the differ
ence in the amount of the two weighings gave the amount
of the alumina thus:–
   2-1890 grms. of glass gave 0:0096 grm. of mixed oxides
and 0.0029 grm. of sesquioxide of iron; the difference, 0.0067
grm., is the amount of alumina.
           d. Determination of Owide of Manganese.
   This oxide was thrown down by carbonate of soda as car
bonate of manganese, from the filtrate, separated from the
oxide of iron and alumina (c.); the precipitate was washed,
dried, ignited, and calculated as the compound oxide and ses
quioxide of manganese (Mna O.).
   I. 2' 1890 grims. of glass gave 0.0114 grm. of the above
named double oxide.
   II. 2' 1284 grms. of glass gave 0.0160 grm. of the double
oxide.
               e. Determination of the Magnesia.
   The filtrate from the carbonate of manganese (d.) was pre
cipitated by phosphate of soda; the phosphate of magnesia
and ammonia was washed, dried, ignited and weighed as pyro
phosphate of magnesia.
   I. 2' 1890 grims. of glass gave 0:0127 grim. of pyrophosphate
of magnesia.

   II. 2' 1284 grms of glass gave 0-0177 grim. of pyrophos
phate of magnesia.
                f. Determination of the Alkalies.
   To determine the amount of the alkalies, a portion of the
glass was fused with hydrate of baryta; the fused mass was
digested in hydrochloric acid, evaporated to dryness and
ignited, the residue again digested in hydrochloric acid, and
then filtered from the insoluble silicic acid.      Carbonate of
ammonia was then added to the filtrate, to separate the alumina,
sesquioxide of iron, baryta and lime; the solution filtered
from the precipitate was evaporated to dryness and ignited,
to drive off the ammoniacal salts, and the magnesia separated
by means of baryta; the excess of baryta was separated by
means of carbonate of ammonia, and filtered.         The filtrate,
evaporated to dryness and ignited, yielded the mixed chlo
rides of the alkaline metals; they were dissolved in water,
bichloride of platinum added, and the solution evaporated to
dryness on a water-bath; the residue was digested in strong
alcohol, when the potassio-chloride of platinum remained un
dissolved; it was collected on a weighed filter, washed with
alcohol, and dried in a water-bath until it ceased to lose
weight. The filtrate from the potassio-chloride of platinum
was evaporated to dryness, and, after the addition of some
oxalic acid to the residue, ignited till it was completely de
composed; the residue was digested in water, filtered, and the
filtrate evaporated to dryness in a weighed capsule; its in
crease in weight gave the quantity of chloride of sodium.
   1.5645 grm. of glass gave 0.9330 grm. of potassio-chloride
of platinum, and 0.0905 grm. of chloride of sodium.
   From the results enumerated, the calculated per-centage is
as follows:–

   The amount of oxygen in the bases stands to the amount
of oxygen in the silicic acid nearly as 1:6.

of the glass for combustion-tubes does not differ very much

                                                         100'0
   The oxygen in the bases of this glass stands to the oxygen
in the silicic acid likewise as 1:6. Soda is entirely absent,
and completely replaced by potassa. The presence however
of a small amount of soda does not seem to be injurious to
the glass.
LXV. On a Generalization of a Theorem of Euler in re<U+017F>er
   ence to the Products of the Sums of Squares. By J. R.You Ng,
   Professor of Mathematics in Belfast College”.
TH: recent researches of Sir W. R. Hamilton, of Profes
      sors Graves and De Morgan, and of Messrs. J. T. Graves
and Cayley, in reference to the new analytical theory of ima
ginary quantities, have revived attention to Euler's theorem,
that the sum of four squares multiplied by the sum of four
squares produces the sum of four squares; to which theorem
an extension was given by Lagrange, by the introduction of
coefficients into the component squares.
   These recent researches have suggested the inquiry as to
                     * Communicated by the Author.

            to the Products of the Sums of Squares.         425
whether or not the theorem admits of generalization; and in
the Philosophical Magazinefor April 1845, Mr. J. T. Graves
announced that he had arrived at the truth that “the product
of two sums of eight squares is a sum of eight squares;” but
adds, that “the full statement and proof of the theorem must
be reserved for another time.” I have anxiously inquired at
every likely source of information to which I have access, for
the publication of this proof; and am disposed to conclude,
from the result, that such publication has not yet been fur
nished.
   I have been thus led to enter into an independent investi
gation of the subject; and find that the theorem holds not
only for four and eight, but also for sixteen, and indeed for
any number of squares expressed by an integral power of 2.
This investigation I propose to forward to the British Asso
ciation, at its meeting in June, provided I be assured that I
have not been anticipated in the generalization here announced.
By thus alluding to the results at which I have arrived, in
the pages of this Journal, I shall afford timely opportunity
for the information being communicated to me, if the above
mentioned extension of Euler's theorem has ever as yet been
published.
   The notation in which the subordinate theorems and the
general theorem is announced is this, viz.
    22(D) x 22(D')=22(D"), 2.4(D) x 2.4(D')=X4(D"),
and generally
                    2,0 D) X X,( D')=2,( [] "),
where n is any integral positive power of 2.
   The theorem holds too when certain coefficients are intro
duced: thus, taking eight squares, it is true that
            (sº +bt”--cu” +bcv84 bcwº-H ca”--by”--2°)
         x (s”--bt?--cu!?--bcwº-H bow”--ca/2+by"+2")
         =s*4-bi"24-cu”--bct<U+017F>”.4-bcwº-cyl-4-by-4-2”.
And also that

And the same has place for any number ofsquares expressed

LXVI. On a Method for the Analysis of Bodies containing
   Nitric Acid, and its application to Erplosive Cotton. By
   WALTER CRUM, F.R.S.*
AT the first meeting        of the present Session of the Philoso
      phical Society, I gave an account of some experimental in
quiries into the nature of gun-cotton, a body whose composition
was then little known. I had at that time chiefly occupied my
self with its nitrous contents, and described a method by which
some approximation could be made to a quantitative result for
nitric acid. On resuming the subject, I found that much was
wanting to render the method a rigorously accurate one; and
I shall now relate what I have since done to simplify and
complete it. I shall first, however, give an account of its
application to nitrate of potash,_ a body of known composi
tion, and easily obtained in a state of purity,+to which I had
recourse as a means of proving the accuracy of the method,
and detecting any fallacy to which it might be liable.
   Nitric Acid in Nitrate of Potash.-The salt I employed
was purified by repeated crystallization, and fused at little more
than its melting heat. A glass jar, eight inches long and an
inch and a quarter in diameter, is filled with, and inverted
over mercury. A single lump of the fused nitrate, weighing
about six grains, is let up into it, and afterwards fifty grains
of water. As soon as the nitrate is dissolved, 125 grains of
sulphuric acid, ascertained to be free from nitric acid, are
added. By the action of the mercury upon the liberated nitric
acid, deutoxide of nitrogen soon begins to be evolved, and
usually in about two hours, without the application of heat,
the whole of the nitric acid is converted into that gas. Occa
sional agitation is necessary, and it is easily performed by
giving a jerking horizontal motion to the upper part of the jar.
The surface of the sulphuric acid is then marked, and three
fourths of a cubic inch of solution of sulphate of iron, recently
boiled, let up into the jar. The gas is rapidly absorbed, ex
cept a small portion at last, which must be left several hours
to the action of the solution, or be well agitated in a smaller
tube with a fresh portion of it. No correction of the nitric
oxide has to be made for moisture; for the mixture of acid and
water which I employed, as I ascertained by direct experiment,
has no perceptible force of vapour. In one experiment,
   5:40 grains nitrate of potash yielded
   4.975 cubic inches of gas, at 60°Fahr., and bar. 30 inches.
   The residue not absorbable by sulphate of iron, was
  * Read before the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, April 14, 1847, and
communicated by the Author.

      On the Analysis   of Bodies containing Nitric Acid.             427
   0.015 cubic inch; leaving
   4.96 cubic inches of nitric oxide = 1°594 grains NO2, and
which correspond to
   2.869 grs. nitric acid, or 53' 13 percent. of the nitrate of potash.
    Four consecutive experiments made in this manneryielded—
                                 53' 13
                                 53° 14
                                 53-73
                                 53-29
                   Mean . . . . 53-32
or leaving out the third experiment, 53.19.
    The calculated per-centage of nitric acid in nitrate of potash,
the acid being represented by 6-75, and the potash by 5.8992,
is 53°36%.
    In order further to determine whether the presence of organic
matter would interfere with the liberation of the nitric oxide,
the experiment was repeated with the addition of three grains
of cotton wool, which was first dissolved in the sulphuric acid;
the result was 53.24.
    Other nitrates are analysed in the same manner. For salts
in powder, which it is difficult to pass through mercury with
out loss, I cut a quarter-inch glass tube into little cylinders
for them, of half an inch long, and close up the ends with
thin paper fastened with gum. In the analysis of numerous
samples of crude nitrates, the residue, which is azote, may be
taken as a constant quantity, and the jar graduated in such a
manner that the volume of gas may be read off at once as the
per-centage of nitric acid.
    Preparation of Gun-Cotton.--The cotton I employed was
fine Sea Island. It was first thoroughly carded, and then
bleached, by boiling in caustic soda, and steeping in solution
of bleaching powder; then caustic soda again, and afterwards
weak nitric acid. It was well washed and beaten in a bag
with water after each operation. When burnt, 10,000 parts
left 9 of ashes. It was considered to be lignine, nearly pure,
    The cotton, dried and carded after bleaching, was exposed
in parcels of 10 grains each, for several hours, to the heat of
a steam-bath, and each parcel was immersed, while hot, in an
ounce measure of the following mixture:—
    One measure sulphuric acid, spec. grav., 1840.
    Three measures of pale lemon-coloured nitric acid, of 1:517.
After one hour it was washed in successive portions of water,
till no trace of acid remained, and dried in the open air.
   * By Thomson's numbers the per-centage of nitric acid in nitre is 5294;
by Berzelius, 53.44.

   428    Mr. W. Crum on the Composition of Gun-Cotton.
      30 grs. of bleached cotton wool, dried at 65° F., became,
   after being some hours in a steam bath,
      28'32 grs., and lost, therefore, 5.6 per cent. of water. It
  increased to
      51.08 grs, when made into gun-cotton, and dried in the open
  all".
      Dried further in vacuo, over sulphuric acid, it was reduced to
      50-40 grs., and lost therefore 1.33 per cent. of water.
      100 of dry cotton produced 1779 of dry gun-cotton.
      The gun-cotton thus prepared is whiter, but less transparent,
  than the original bleached wool. It appears to be little liable
  to change, but a slight elevation of temperature causes a com
  mencement of decomposition, and the colour becomes more
  or less brown.     It is much less tenacious than cotton wool.
  Dissolved in nitric acid, and tested with chloride of barium,
  it gives no indication of sulphuric acid.
      The increase of weight above stated is the greatest I have
 been able to obtain; and I had completed its analysis in the
 manner I shall describe, when I found reason to believe that
 it still contained a portion of unaltered cotton. With a view
 to saturate that portion, it was immersed a second time, and
 for twenty-four hours, in the same mixture of acids, but with
 out yielding any greater quantity of nitric acid.
     An immersion of one hour in nitric acid alone gave a better
 result. It lost in weight by this second process 0-47 per cent.
 It was little altered in appearance, but after being dried in the
 open air, it lost in the air-pump only 0.69 per cent, instead
 of 1:33, as in the former case.     It is this substance of which I
 shall now relate the analysis.
     Ashes in Gun-Cotton.—Sixteen grains of gun-cotton were
 dissolved in nitric acid. The solution being evaporated by
 degrees, and burnt to ashes, left 0.035 gr. of a reddish ash,
 or 0.22 per cent.
     Nitric Acid in Gun-Cotton.—In this process the same ap
 paratus is employed as for nitrate of potash. About 6 grains
of the gun-cotton, containing a known quantity of water, is
collected into a ball—squeezed between the finger and thumb
to free it as much as possible from air—and let up into the
jar, over the mercurial trough. 125 grains of sulphuric acid
are added to it. Nitric acid is liberated, and, being acted
upon by the mercury, produces nitric oxide. After one hour,
when about three-fourths of the whole gas has been evolved,
and the gun-cotton is entirely dissolved, 50 grains of water
are added. In another hour the increase of gas ceases; in a
few hours more its boundary is noted, then treated with sul
phate of iron, and the residue measured.          It consists of azote

       Mr. W. Crum on the Composition of Gun-Cotton. 429
from the common air introduced with the gun-cotton, and a
minute portion also, which is always accidentally entangled
between the mercury and the glass. Its oxygen is absorbed
by the mercury, when in the state of nitrous acid.
  In one experiment—
  6.02 grs. of gun-cotton=5'978, after being dried over
sulphuric acid in vacuo, and =
  5-964 grs., after deducting ashes, produced
  5'513 cubic inches of gas, bar. 30 in., therm. 60°, of which
  0.08 was left by sulphate of iron.
  5.433 cubic inches, therefore, were deutoxide of nitrogen, =
  1746 grs. NO2, which represent
  3.143 grs. of nitric acid, or 52.70 per cent.
Another experiment gave 52.68 per cent.
  The gun-cotton prepared by a single immersion gave only
51'42 per cent. of nitric acid.
   Carbon in Gun-Cotton.—Having failed to obtain good results
by burning this substance with oxide of copper, I used chromate
of lead, precipitated from the nitrate, and heated to redness.
I employed for the combustion an apparatus which I used
many years ago for the analysis of indigo, and I still find it
very convenient for substances which do not require a strong
red heat. It consists of a tube of hard glass, eight inches long
and three-eighths of an inch in diameter; the gases from which
are led by a small bent tube under the receiver in a mercurial
trough.
   1 inch at the closed end of the tube is filled with 8 grains
chlorate of potash, ground with chromate of lead.
  4% inches are filled with chromate of lead, among which is
ground to powder 3 grains of the gun-cotton.
   1} inch contains chromate of lead that has been used to wash
out the mortar.
   A glass plug separates these materials from the perforated
cork which joins the two tubes. The materials are gradually
heated with broad-wicked spirit-lamps. Carbonic acid comes
over, mixed, when in the receiver, with nitric oxide and the
azote of the apparatus; and when all the gun-cotton is con
sumed, the lamps are extended to the chlorate of potash. The
oxygen gas thus liberated, which in other cases is useful to
consume carbonaceous inatter that may have escaped the
chromate, expels in this case all remains of carbonic acid, and
passing itself into the receiver, mixes there with the nitric oxide,
and causes its entire absorption by the mercury. Oxygen and
azote are then the only gases left along with the carbonic acid,
and as those are not absorbable, an addition of half a cubic
inch of solution of caustic soda indicates exactly the quantity
of carbonic acid present.

430 Mr. W. Crum on the Composition of Gun-Cotton.
   In one experiment, 2.993 grs. of gun-cotton (after deduct
ing water and ashes) yielded 7'952 cubic inches of gas, of
which 5’733 was carbonic acid, = 0.739 grs. carbon, or
                              24.69 per cent.
A second experiment gave 25-16
                   Mean . . . 24.92
   Elements of Water in Gun-Cotton.—To burn gun-cotton for
the purpose of collecting its oxygen and hydrogen in the state
of water, I ground up 10 grains of it with pounded flint, and
used the combustion tube already described, having attached
to it a chloride of calcium tube, and afterwards a tube with
asbestos moistened with sulphuric acid. But along with water,
ammonia and other matters were obtained, which destroyed
the result. I next used a thin glass tube of a foot and a half
long, bent so that a foot in the middle of it could dip into
cold water.     Such water as would condense at 65°Fahr. was
collected. The gas was led through it into a mercurial trough,
and measured. A trace of cyanogen appeared in the last por
tions of gas, while the oxygen from the chlorate of potash was
burning a quantity of charcoal that had escaped the nitric
acid.
   After the experiment, the refrigerating tube was found
studded with large crystals of bicarbonate of ammonia. It con
tained very little water in the liquid state. The crystals and
the liquid were washed out with more water, converted into
muriate of ammonia, and found to contain 0-675 gr. NHs
2CO2, the hydrogen of which represents
0.299 gr. of water.    There were besides
2025 grs. water in the tube. In the 22 inches of gas which
        were obtained, assuming it to be saturated with moisture,
        which is doubtful, there was
0.088 gr. of water—making in all
2:412, from which must be deducted
0.160 gr. hygrometric water in the gun-cotton and in the
      flint, leaving
2.252 for the water in 992 grs, of dry gun-cotton or 22:70
      per cent.
   In a second experiment, where the only difference was in
having moistened cotton for the gas to pass through before
entering the mercurial trough, the water obtained only amount
ed to 20-61 per cent. I did not proceed further. These were
the two last of a number of experiments, and the determina
tions of nitric acid and carbon are so much more satisfac
tory, that I prefer resting the water contents upon their results.

        Mr. W. Crum on the Composition of Gun-Cotton. 431
During its transformation into gun-cotton, there is no indica
tion of change in the proportions of its oxygen and hydrogen.
The difference, therefore, between the weight of the substance
employed and that of the nitric acid and carbon found b
experiment, is oxygen and hydrogen in the proportions i.

   Gun-cotton, from the form in which it is produced, is not
one of those substances we can expect to obtain in absolute
purity. Every previous improvement in its preparation had
diminished this excess of unaltered cotton, and I had no reason
to suppose the last portion perfect, considering the difficulty
with which some of the previous stages of improvement had
been attained.
   The specimen I have thus examined consists, therefore, of
           96-59 gun-cotton (12C, 7H, 70, 3NO3).

 LXVII. On the Conversion of Relief by Inverted Vision.                 By
    Sir DAVID BREwsTER, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., and V.P.R.S.
    Edin.*
 UNDER the name Conversion of Relief, an expression first
         used by Mr. Wheatstone, I include all those optical
 illusions which take place in the vision of cameos and inta
 glios, of elevations and depressions, whether they are produced
 with opake or transparent bodies,—no surfaces with or without
 shadows, in reflected or transmitted light, while using one
 or both eyes, – or by erect or inverted vision. In these various
forms of the phaenomenon, the illusion is modified by certain
 secondary causes, which were regarded both by Mr. Wheat
 stonet and myselff as primary causes; so that we were led
 away, each in a different direction, from the right path of
 inquiry.
    The phaenomenon occurs in its most general and simple
 form, when it is produced by viewing a shadowless depression,
 or elevation, made in an extended surface, through an invert
 ing microscope, or the inverting eye-piece of a telescope, and
 at an angle intermediate between 0° and 90°. In so far as I
know, the phaenomenon has never been thus limited, and,
consequently, no explanation of it has ever been given. That
which I shall now submit to the Society is capable of the most
rigorous demonstration; and when it is once in our possession,
we can have no difficulty in recognising the secondary causes
which increase or diminish the influence of the primary one,
and which, in its absence, are sometimes the immediate cause
 of the illusion.

 quaquaversus light, like that of the sky. If the observer,
 placed at a moderate distance, view these objects in the di
 rections EA, E'A', either with one or with both eyes, his
 accurate appreciation of the distances E A, E'A', will prove
 to him that A is a concavity, and A<U+017F> a convexity; but if E A,
 E'A' approach to equality, either from the distance of the
 observer, or from the shallowness of A, or the slight elevation
 of A', he will cease to recognise any difference in the distances
 EA, EA', and will be unable to tell which is the convexity,
 and which the concavity. So great, indeed, is this uncer
 tainty, that from causes which he cannot discover, they will
 sometimes appear convex and sometimes concave. In this in
 determination of the judgement, a touch of A, A' by the finger,
 or the introduction of a shadow, will remove or confirm the
 illusion, whatever it may be. The same result will be obtained
 if we view A and A' vertically, with an erect or inverting eye
 piece. In all these cases, we suppose that the circular, or
 rather the elliptical, base of the convexity or concavity is di
stinctly seen.
    Let us now look at A, A', at obliquities varying from 0° to
 90°. In fig. 1 the concavity A will have an elliptical section
 at all obliquities, till, at 90°, it appears a straight line; but in
 the converity the effect is very different. In passing from 0°
 to the position E!, fig. 2, the circular section of Al will ap
 pear an ellipse; but in passing from E to 90°, the appear
ance of A' will lose all resemblance to A. When the eye is
at e, for example, the summit A' of the convexity will cover
the point a of the table, and a m will be invisible; and near
 90°, the convexity A will eclipse the whole surface of the table
m M, however extended it may be, and will rise above it.
    Let us now suppose that the eye at E, fig. 3, views the con
cavity A through the in-                     Fig. 3.

3, furthest from the eye in fig,4, m An must appear a concavity
infig. 4, solely because it seems to rise out of the surface MN,
which looks upward, asif it had not been inverted by the eye-piece.
    Now, in this experiment, the conversion of the concavity
into a convexity depends on two separate illusions, one of
which springs from the other.                        Fig. 5.
The    first illusion is the
that the surface M N is look- belief                  O
ing upwards, whereas it is
really inverted, as shown in                   A_
fig. 5; and the second illusion,                      In’
 which arises from the first, is,
 that the pointnappears furthest             m
 from the eye, whereas it is "                               -
 nearest to it, as shown in fig. 5. All these observations are
 equally applicable mutatis mutandis to the vision of convexities;
 and hence it follows, that the conversion of relief, occasioned
 by the use of an inverting eye-piece, is not produced directly
 by the inversion, but by an illusion, in virtue of which we
 conceive the remotest side of the convexity or concavity to be
 nearest our eye when it is not.
    In order to demonstrate the correctness of this explanation,
 let the concavity m A n be made in a narrow stripe of wood,
 as in fig. 5, and let it be viewed, as formerly, through the
 inverting eye-piece. It will now appear, as in fig. 5, really
 inverted, and free from both the illusions which formerly took
 place. The narrow surface M N being now wholly included
 in the field of view, and the thickness NO of the stripe of
 wood distinctly seen, the inversion of the surface M N, which
 now looks downward, will be at once recognised. The edge
 n of the concavity will appear nearest the eye”, as it really is,
 and the concavity, though inverted, will still appear a concavity.
 The very same reasoning is applicable to a convexity on a
 narrow stripe of wood.                     --
    * The inversion of an object never makes the nearer part of an object
 more remote, nor the remote part nearer.

             Conversion of Reliefly Inverted-Vision.            435
   When, as in fig. 4, the concavity is seen as<U+017F>aiconvexity, let
it be viewed more and more-obliquely,” The elliptical margin
of the converity will always be visible, which is impossible in a
real convexity; and the elevated apex will gradually sink till
the elliptical margin becomes a straight line, and the imaginary
convexity completely leveled. The struggle between truth and
error is here so singular, that while one part of the figure
m An has become, concave, the other part retains its con
vexity lº                                <U+017F>º   -in 911 bººs. . . . . . . .
   In like manner, when a convexity is seen as a concavity,
the concavity loses its true shape, as it is viewed more and
more obliquely, till its remote elliptical margin is encroached
upon by the apex of the convexity; and, towards an inclina
tion of 90°, the concavity disappears altogether, under cir
cumstances analogous to those already described, wº,
   If, in place of using an inverting eye-piece, we invert the
concavity m A n, by looking at its image in the focus of a con
vex lens, it will sometimes appear a convexity, and sometimes
not. In this form of the experiment the image of the con
cavity, and consequently its apparent depth, is greatly dimi
nished. Hence any trivial cause, such as a preconception of
the mind, or an approximation to a shadow, or a touch of the
hollow by the point of the finger, will either produce a con
version, or prevent it.
   In the preceding experiments we have supposed the con
vexity to be high and the concavity deep and circular, and
we have supposed them also to be shadowless, or illuminated
by a quaquaversus light, such as that of the sky in the open
fields. This was done to get rid of all secondary causes, which
interfere with and modify the normal cause when the concavi
ties and convexities are shallow, and have distinct shadows,
or when the concavity has the shape of an animal, or any
body which we are accustomed to see convex.
   Let us now suppose that a strong shadow is thrown upon
the concavity. In this case the normal experiment, already
explained and shown in fig. 5, is much more perfect and satis
factory. The illusion is complete, and invariable when the
concavity is in an extended surface; and it as invariably dis
appears when it is in a narrow stripe.               --
   In the secondary forms of the experiment, the inversion of
the shadow becomes the principal cause of the illusion; but,
in order that the result may be invariable, or nearly so, the
concavities must be shallow, and the convexities a little raised.
At great obliquities, however, this cause of the conversion of
form ceases to produce the illusion, and in varying the incli
nation from 0° to 90°, the cessation takes place sooner with
                             2 G 2

436       On the Conversion of Relief by Inverted Vision.
deep than with shallow cavities. The reason of this is, that
the shadow of a concavity is very different at great obliquities
from the shadow of a similar convexity, The shadow never
can emerge out of a cavity so as to darken the surface in which
the cavity is made; whereas the shadow of a convexity soon
extends beyond the outline of its base, and finally throws a
long stripe of darkness over the surface on which it rests.
Hence it is impossible to mistake a convexity for a concavity,
whenever its shadow extends beyond its base.
    When the concavity is a horse or a dog upon a seal, it
will often rise into a convexity when seen through a single
lens which does not invert it; but the illusion disappears at
great obliquities. In this case the illusion is favoured, or
produced, by two causes: the first is, that the convex form of
the horse or dog is the one which the mind is most disposed
to seize; and the second is, that we use only one eye, with
which we cannot measure depths as well as with two. The
illusion, however, still takes place when we employ a lens
three or more inches wide, so as to admit the use of both eyes,
but it is less certain, as the binocular vision enables us to keep
in check, to a certain degree, the other causes of illusion.
   The influence of these secondary causes is strikingly dis
played in the following experiment. In the armorial bearings
upon a seal, the shield is often more deeply cut than the sur
rounding parts. With binocular vision the shallow parts rise
into a convexity sooner than the shield, or continue so while
the shield remains concave; but if we shut one eye, the shield
then becomes convex like the rest. In these experiments
with a single lens, a slight variation in the position of the seal,
or a slight change in the direction or intensity of the illumi
nation, or particular reflexions from the interior of the stone,
will favour or oppose the illusion. In viewing the shield, or
the deepest portion, with a single lens, a slight rotation of the
seal round the wrist, backwards and forwards, will remove
the illusion, in consequence of the eye perceiving that the
change in the perspective is different from what it should be.
   In a paper in the Edinburgh Journal of Science, already
referred to, I have described several other examples of the
conversion of form, in which inverted vision is not employed.
As seen by the naked eye, hollows in mother-of-pearl, and
other semi-transparent bodies, rise into relief; and the same
thing happens on surfaces of agate and woods of various kinds
when transparent circular portions are illuminated by refrac
tion, at those parts of their circumference where they would
have been illuminated had they been convexities*. But the

 most interesting cases of conversion of form are those in which
 the mind alone operates, and receives no aid either from in
 version, shadow, or monocular vision.           “If we take, as I have
 elsewhere remarked, one of the Intaglio moulds, used in
 making the bas-reliefs of that able artist Mr. Henning, and
 direct the eyes to it steadily, without hoticing surrounding
 objects, we may coax ourselves into the belief that the Intaglio
 is actually a bas-relief. It is difficult at first to produce the
 deception, but a little practice never fails to accomplish it.
 We have succeeded in carrying this deception so far as to be
able, by the eye alone, to raise a complete hollow mask of the
human face into a projecting head. In order to do this we must
exclude the vision of other objects; and also the margin or
 thickness of the cast. This experiment cannot fail to produce
a very great degree of surprise in those who succeed in it;
and it will, no doubt, be regarded by the sculptor (who can
use it) as a great auxiliary in his artº.”
    From these observations it will be seen that the conversion
of form, excepting in the normal case, depends upon various
causes which are effective only under particular conditions;
such as the depth of the hollow or the elevation of the relief,
the distance of the object, the sharpness of vision, the use of
one or both eyes, the inversion of the shadow, the nature of
the object, and the means used by the mind itself to produce
the illusion. In the normal case, however, where the cavity
or convexity is shadowless, and upon an extended surface,
and where inverted vision is used, the conversion of form
depends solely on the illusion, which it is impossible to resist,
that the side of the cavity or elevation next the eye is actually
furthest from it—an illusion not produced by inversion, but
by a false judgement respecting the position of the surface on
which the form is placed.

438 : Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
momena, and to which we are indebted for many very valuable
discoveries. That which I am now about to explain differs
from all that have preceded it, and possesses at least the ad
vantage of simplicity united to singular delicacy”.
    It must have been clear to every one, that the phaenomena
observed by M.'Arago in his well-known experiments made
in the year 1824, when he caused a needle-to oscillate over
the surfaces of various substances, were due to the proximity
of the heedle to the body observed, as much as to the nature
of the body itself; and the discovery of this distinguished
natural philosopher was confirmed by Dr. Seebeck of Berlin,
on making similar observations. Those I have now to detail
are entirely due to the same cause, carried to the extent of
actual and forced contact. ºn tº ". . . . . . . . . . . . .
    I now proceed to explain the mode in which the experi
ments have been performed.” ºr ºil ºr " ,                                                 *   ** ** * *

tion will be presently given, is to be placed on the point of a
fine sewing-needle, about half an inch in height, which may
be run through a slice of cork to answer as a support; but
that which I myself employ has a flat brass foot about the size
of a shilling, with the fine end of a sewing-needle fixed in the
centre, and the brass foot is truncated close to the supporting
needle, to enable it and the object to be brought close together
for the purpose of observation. If a cork support is used, the
sewing-needle should for the same reason be run through it
near the edge.                                                      *  ,    ,           -

   * The general principle upon which these observations have been made
was discovered so far back as the month of March 1841; it was not how
ever applied to ascertaining whether the various classes of substances were
magnetic or not till the spring of 1845, when nearly 140 substances were
found to be magnetic, and a few measurements of the intensities were ob
 tained, but it was at the commencement of 1846 that the greatest part of
them were made. The remainder have been only recently completed ;
 though these remarks were in such a state of forwardness as to lead to a
hope of their being published in the summer of 1845. Want of health has
been the cause of these various delays.

          Magnetism, Cohesion, Adhesion and Wiscosity.        489
being urged to it by a bar-magnet, its point will exactly touch
some portion that is smooth, and vertical, … These conditions
being strictly attended to, and the object, under examination
being placed about a quarter of an inch or so from the point
of the magnetic needle, the pole of the bar-magnet that is of
a contrary character to the point of the needle/intended to
touch the object, is to be approached with extreme gentleness
and very slowly, so as to cause the least, tremulous motion
possible in the needle. When the bar-magnet is brought so.
as to cause the needle to press with a slight force against the
substance examined, the former is, to be kept in the same
steady horizontal position, for at least ten or fifteen, seconds
after it has been observed that all tremor, has ceased in the
needle ; upon which the bar-magnet may be withdrawn as
slowly and as carefully as it was brought near. And this is
the place to observe, that one great advantage of having the
supporting pivot so short, and consequently the magnetic needle
so low down, is that it enables the observer to allow the mag
net to lie upon the table, and to advance and draw it back at
pleasure, as well as to have its axis in the same horizontal
plane as that in which the needle revolves; for should it be
higher or lower than the latter, it would cause an inclination,
and a consequent displacement of the needle, from gravitation
the moment the bar was withdrawn, that might interfere with
the success of the experiment. If all the conditions just de
scribed have been attended to, the needle will be found to
have attached itself firmly to the glass, copper, or other body
operated upon, and will in many cases so remain any indefi
nite time, if not disturbed.    But it should be well-remarked
that time must generally be given to the magnetic needle to
settle, and thereby coerce the substance to which it is to attach
itself.  This is an essential condition in most cases.       The
slightest movement in the room, even the motion of the air
from the impulsion given by the breath of the observer, are
to be carefully .#. in the nicer experiments. Any vibra
tion in the house also will, in most cases, from the extreme
delicacy of the operation, cause a failure. Some time, too,
will in all probability elapse before the experimenter will have
acquired the dexterity necessary to the success of the difficult
cases, and he must be careful that the point of the magnetic
needle does not catch itself against the object under examina
tion when it is rough; and there is also great danger of its
becoming jammed when it approaches an angle of 90° with
the magnetic meridian. To prevent such a consequence,
the object should be so placed, when the amplitude is large,
that only the side of the point of the magnetic needle may rest

440     Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
against it. Either pole of the needle may be used, and the
bar-magnet may be made to influence it. either by attraction
or repulsion, as is most convenient for the observation. The
operator will likewise find it an advantage to use a low seat,
as he will by that means be able to have his eye in the same
level as the object examined as often as it may be neces
sary, particularly when minute objects are observed.
   All that has just been said merely regards the mode of
avoiding a failure; but if it is desired to measure the relative
magnetic intensities of the substances under examination, then
a graduated disc is to be employed, which may be placed
under the supporting needle, its N. and S. being in the line
of the magnetic meridian; but a very convenient substitute
for these two will be found in detaching the bottom of one of
the compass-boxes, of which I shall immediately speak, covered
with its engraving of the rhombs and degrees, and cutting
away so much of it as might interfere with the approximation
of the different bodies. The nearer the needle can be brought
to 90° by the attraction or repulsion of the bar-magnet, the
greater is to be considered the magnetic intensity of the object,
which is to be shifted after each measurement so as to increase
the angle of amplitude till it is found that the needle will no
longer attach itself, which consequently gives the limit of its
magnetic intensity. This being an exhausting and tentative
process, renders such measurements extremely tedious in many
cases, and yet it cannot be remedied; for, owing to the time
lost in waiting for the oscillations of the needle to cease, as
well as for it to connect itself with the substance, and in the
various adjustments of the latter, much time is expended;
added to which, the experiment must be often repeated in
difficult cases, to be quite sure that a failure has really arisen,
from a want of attractive affinity between the needle and sub
stance. Nearly an hour has been consumed in an experiment
.       much attention and delicacy of manipulation were re
quired.
   Great care of course must be taken not to confound effects
purely electric with those that are magnetic. To prevent
such a possibility of error, it is only necessary to breathe upon
a suspected substance, which will effectually remove all free
electricity. Thus Iceland spar, which cannot be touched with
the fingers without becoming electric and remaining so for
days, may in the space of a few seconds be rendered fit for
examination, as the humidity of the breath quickly evaporates
and carries off the superabundant electricity.
   It is well-worthy of remark, as showing how much time is
necessary, not merely for the exhibition of magnetic attraction

          Magnetism, Cohesion, Adhesion and Viscosity.        441
by some substances, but also for the loss of this quality, that
in many cases where the needle was with difficulty made to .
attach itself, on contact being broken a fresh connexion was
produced with the greatest ease, if only a short delay had
taken place, and no change whatever had been made in the
position of the object. Time, too, was still more necessary to
the success of the experiments when the angles were to be
measured; for it not unfrequently happened that, when I had
supposed the greatest amplitude had been attained, on main
taining the forced connexion for a few minutes with an enlarged
angle, a firm connexion took place; thus throwing a doubt
upon the measures I had previously noted as the highest at
tainable in other substances.    Such measures, therefore, even
in any case, can only be considered as approximative, as
greater deviations may possibly be yet obtained by myself or
other observers. Thus in the case of a spark of diamond, I
was able to increase the angular distance from 42° to 65°. So
likewise in the case of quartz, it rose gradually from 45° to
90°.    Now when it is considered that the attachment of the
needle takes place generally with the greatest readiness when
the angle of deviation is small, say 10° or 15°, owing to its
limited deviation from the meridian in such cases, it can leave
but little doubt that this peculiarity arises from the slow effect
of magnetic propagation in the substance examined, in which,
 to use language that has become familiar in describing mag
netic phaenomena, saturation takes place but slowly.
    The foregoing facts entirely accord with the remark made
 by Sir John Herschel and Mr. Babbage, when in 1825 they
 varied the experiments of M. Arago. A remarkable confir
 mation of this peculiarity was exhibited by chromium, which
 was entered, after many trials with a magnetic needle, as a
 failure, yet on repeating the experiment, and allowing a long
 time for the needle to operate, the measurements rose succes
 sively, according to the notes taken on the occasion, as follows:
 20°, 25°, 30°, 40°, 45°, 49°, 55°, 70°, 90°.   The notes on the
 subject having been overlooked, a fresh attempt at measure
 ment, after the lapse of more than a year, was recently made,
 when it was again entered as a failure, as there was not the
 least tendency to a connexion between the needle and the
 chromium after the ordinary time given to other difficult sub
 Stances.
    On reflecting on the necessity of time being given to deve
 lope the magnetism of some substances, and remembering that
 the needle, which was the active agent in its production, did
 not weigh four grains, and that the parts of the needle and the
 substance in contact were merely two minute points, it'struck

442      Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
me that the magnetism mightbelmuch-increased by keeping
it in close contact for a short time with a more powerful mag
net. The result fully justified this, anticipation, and the at
tractive affinity between the needle and the substance was
immediately augmented; but generally in those cases where
no attraction had been already discovered, none made its ap
pearance by the additional magnetic influence to which it
was subjected. Want of health and time prevented me from
establishing more than the general character of these last facts,
but I shall have to speak more fully of the particular cases
tried as I proceed. A vºw º ºx                              a    º
    Among the few substances placed in contact with the bar
magnet for the purpose of increasing their magnetic energy,
the following seem to be totally uninfluenced by its presence,"
viz. copper, lead, marble, selenite, alum and pure lac. * * * *
   The following experiment will 'show how strong the con
nexion often is that takes place between the needlä and non
ferruginous substances. A magnet having been brought ver
tically over the needle contained in a small box-compass, which
was screened by a piece of crown-glass, the needle attached
itself instantly, or, to speak more exactly, per salium, so firmly.
to the glass, that the box might be pushed backwards and
forwards from one end of the chimney-piece on which it lay”
to the other, without contact being broken; and in this state
it continued for six days, though the door of the room was
often shut with considerable force; and the connexion was at
last only broken by the box having inadvertently received a
shock from the hand. The contact was occasionally renewed:
by the same means, sometimes for two or three days, and
always continued till broken at pleasure. This experiment
will not succeed if the pivot of suspension is either too high
or too low; and the needle must be of the pointed kind.

   It is, proper to describe here a very useful electrometer
which I employed to ascertain whether substances exhibit any
electrical effects. It is of extreme simplicity, and is not merely
much more sensitive than that employed by Haüy, but even
more so than the most delicate gold-leaf electrometer. It
consists of a magnetic needle five-eighths of an inch in length,
with an agate cap. Upon each end of the needle a piece of
oaten straw, one inch in length and about one-thirtieth of an
inch in diameter, is fixed. When this part of the system
is placed, as in the former case, on the point of a sewing
needle with a brass stand, the instrument is complete.             It has
an additional advantage over that of Haüy, that, owing to the

slight magnetism of the needle, the points of which are in
serted in the straws, it preserves a definitelposition, without .
the slight magnetism of the needle apparently interfering with
its sensibility. It has likewise the advantage of being easily
set up or dismounted to protect it from injury, and is capable
of being contained in a very small box. It I ought to remark
likewise that it is so susceptible, that if unprotected by a screen
it is kept in a sort of perpetual movement, by the otherwise
inappreciable currents of air in the room. I tº                   *    .

    After the trial of needles of various forms, and lengths, I
have found none that answer so well as those which are em
ployed in the compasses of commerce, set in mahogany boxes
two inches square, and to which I have already alluded. The
needles in these boxes are an inch and a half long, very slen
der and pointed, weighing about three grains and a half.
Their caps are of brass, which in this case is an advantage; for
needles with those of agate are much too tremulous from their
great sensibility, and the experiment will be almost sure to
fail if the point of the needle slips in the least from the spot
where it first settles, the circumference of its action being as
limited as the part of the point of the needle actually in con
 tact. Long needles, therefore, owing to their great oscilla
tions, are particularly unfit for these experiments; while, on
 the contrary, I have succeeded extremely well with a needle
 not more than five-eighths of an inch long.
    The preceding directions siniply concern the kind of mag
 netic needle that is to be employed; but it is, as I have said,
 by the aid of a bar-magnet that the needle is made to attach
 itself to non-ferruginous bodies; for by no other means could
 it be caused to approximate itself by a slow, steady, and gentle
 movement, and be left without disturbance when the motive
 agent is withdrawn, a condition upon which the success of the
 experiment entirely depends in the cases of low intensity; but
 for those of higher attraction, I shall presently show a sim
 pler mode of attaining the same end without a magnet. The
 bar-magnet which I use is very convenient; it is six inches
 and a half long, three-quarters of an inch wide, and rather
 better than a quarter of an inch thick. If the magnet is long,
 it is managed with difficulty; and if small, it requires to be
 brought very near the object, and there is consequently danger
 of disturbing the position of the needle when the magnet is
 withdrawn, which had better likewise be wrapt in soft paper,
 to enable it to be laid down on the table without causing a jar

444      Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
or shock, I now proceed to an important step in these dis
coveries.
On the relative dynamic values of the degrees of the compass,
   and on the cause of the needle resting in the magnetic meri
   dian.
   Shortly after I had begun to measure the angles of devia
tion, I saw that it was a matter of the first necessity to ascer
tain whether the degrees of the compass after 90° increased in
strength, or went on diminishing in some given ratio, as it
appeared to me that the connexions were made with increased
facility in proportion as the N. pole of the needle approached
nearer to 180°. For the purpose of settling this question, I
made a number of most careful measurements, after drawing
proper lines upon a sheet of paper, which all crossed one
another in a common centre, by ascertaining the distances at dif
ferent azimuths at which a bar-magnet, placed with its axis di
rected to the centre of a magnetic compass-needle (the pivot
of suspension of which was exactly over the common centre
of the lines of which I have spoken), caused the needle to as
sume a position in which its axis was in the same line with
that of the magnet, I found that these points of distance form
a peculiar curve, which was nearest to the axis of the magnet
at the east and west azimuths, and receded from it as it ad
vanced to the north and south; and was twice the distance
from it at the north that it was at the south azimuth.      Such
is the sum total of the results which I communicated to the
Royal Society in June 1846, and of which a short account has
been given in the Abstracts of the Papers read before the So
ciety, and republished in this Journal for last November*. It
since however occurred to me, that the longest distance from the
east and west azimuths would be better ascertained by operating
by the means of repulsion than by attraction, as I had done; for
it is evident that repulsion will sooner discover a minute devia
tion of the needle when in its natural position at N. than can
be effected by attraction, because if the axis of the bar-magnet
deviates in the slightest degree from the line, a false value will
be obtained; and there always therefore remains a doubt in
proceeding by attraction, respecting the point where the reci
procal action of the needle and the magnet ceases, in conse
quence of the identity of their axis. Now in proceeding by
repulsion, the reverse takes place; and the minutest difference,
except so far as the friction of the needle on its pivot is con
cerned, is immediately detected. I was surprised therefore
to find that where I had only been able to discover a devia
                         * Vol. xxix. p. 405.

        Magnetism, Cohesion, Adhesion and Viscosity.        , 445
tion at eight inches distance, owing to the minute quantities
concerned, I could obtain a deviation at sixty inches; after
which all effect ceased. As the distance was exactly four
inches from the centre when the north end of the needle was
drawn to 180° by the bar-magnet, and as there must be some
definite ratio between the two distances thus obtained, I as
sume that the true length of the greater azimuth is sixty-four
inches, and that the four inches not discovered in the measure
ment resulted from the friction of the needle on its pivot,
though it was an extremely delicate instrument that had been
made by M. Pixii. Instead therefore of the greater distance
being merely the duplicate length of the shorter one, it is re
lated to it as its cube.
   The reason of this disproportion of the needle when in its
natural position, from that which is discovered when it is
forced round to the opposite pole, may, I think, be found,
when it is remembered that, as the earth is either per se or by
induction a magnet, the latitude in which the experiment has
been made being at such a distance from the magnetic equa
tor, there can be no longer an equality in the effects. It would
be therefore a question, I think, not devoid of interest, to as
certain whether such a disproportion exists at the magnetic
equator.                           -
   I will now describe the means by which a long line was
obtained, upon the exactness of which the accuracy of the
observation necessarily depended. A white thread of fine
cotton, weighted at each end with lead, was laid over a long
and steady table, and the weights being allowed to hang down,
a perfectly right line was instantly obtained, which had only
to be adjusted so as to agree with the magnetic meridian.
   The length of the azimuths obtained in the lines N., E. and
 S. being respectively 64, 2, 4, it follows that by the law of the
inverse square of the distance they are related to one another
in the proportion of 1-1024 and 256, and that consequently
every degree rises gradually from N. or 0°, till at E. or 90° its
strength is 1024, after which there is a rapid decrease up to
 180°; and it may therefore be practically assumed, to save
circumlocution, that at 175° its proportional strength is 256°,
or only one-fourth the strength it has at 90°, that being the
true proportion as it reaches S. or 180°, where the needle is
necessarily in a state of equilibrium by its balanced attraction
to the west; but all this will be much more evident by a re
ference to the curve itself, which is preserved in the form that
was laid before the Royal Society, as it would be inconvenient
to represent on paper the due proportion from the centre to
N. In fact, for all practical purposes, the new correction is

   The true proportions of the curve, from the centre to E. or W., is 1, to S. 2, and
to N. 16; but as the distance from the centre to N. could not be represented con
veniently on paper, the dotted lines on each side of the line N. must be supposed
to be elongated to that extent.

of no consequence, as anything lower than the azimuth line
that passes through 5°, I have found to be as low as can be
ever required for any useful measurement; and it will be seen
that by the dotted line I have drawn passing through it, and
the dotted lines that are intended to represent the correction
of the curve, that azimuth remains unaffected. Measured by
a rule, the proportion of the azimuth line passing through 90°
is as 1 to 2 with that passing through 5°. Now by the inverse
ratio of the distance, it has only one-fourth of the strength at
5° that it has at 90°; and practically, therefore, is the same in
strength at 5° as it is at 175°. Hence 90° may be considered
as a middle point, from which the degrees diminish by equal
decrements to 5° and 175°; and it will be seen by a reference
to the curve, that the azimuth lines cutting 45° and 135° are
essentially the same in length. The ascertainment of the true
strength of the degrees from 90° to 180° was a necessary de
sideratum, which has led to the unexpected discovery that the
position of the magnetic needle north and south is the effect
of equilibrium arising from equal repulsions from east and
west; and that so far from there being any attraction at
 N. and S., they are just the two points where the needle is
in the greatest state of freedom; and that in the case of a nee
dle of low magnetic power, the mere resistance caused by
friction on its pivot, will be sufficient to prevent its taking up
its true position in the line of the magnetic meridian. These
facts prove that the movement of the needle from 90° to zero
depends upon repulsion, commencing at 90°, and diminishing
gradually till it stands in equilibrium at zero; and that the
return of the needle to 90°, when the north end is brought to
 180°, is the result of an attraction that increases up to 90°,
when the repulsion commences.                        -
   The mathematical expression of these results is that—
    The value of every degree of the compass is inversely as the
square of the length of the ordinate or co-ordinate passing
through it, the abscissa being considered as zero.
   The general principle of the values of the various degrees
of the compass obtained by the preceding system of azimuths,
was further verified by the following method:—
   A bar-magnet 12% inches long, was properly suspended by
silk, free from torsion, and the N. pole being brought round
to the south, was allowed to return back by the east. The
following is the mean of eight observations, made with great
care, and which only slightly differed from one another. The
bar required 11; . to complete its return from 180° to
 135°. When made to start again from 135° to 90° it occu
pied six seconds; and when allowed to depart again from 90°

448 Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
to 45°, the time occupied was 54 seconds; while its return
from 45° to 0°, after being again left to itself, took 64 seconds.
   It might be supposed, d priori, that the north end of the
bar-magnet when brought to the south and left to itself would
be repelled with violence; but so far from this, as seems to be
the case when small needles are observed, its movement is
extremely slow, and there is a loss of a second or two before
it acquires the gradually augmenting momentum that is to
carry it back: a momentum indeed which increases so rapidly,
that though the bar consumed 11; seconds to carry it back
from 180° to 135°, it only required 15% seconds to carry it
from 165° to 0°, and of this time 13; seconds were occupied
in reaching 45°, after which the remaining 45° were completed
in 2 seconds; yet the bar required 6% seconds to return from
45° to 0°, when it had not the benefit acquired by the pre
ceding momentum. As a further proof how much the slow
ness of the movement of the bar increases near 0°, when not
assisted by previous momentum, 63 seconds was the space of
time requisite to carry the bar from 5° to 0°, yet when it had
the advantage of the momentum acquired between 10° and 5°,
it completed the whole in 4 second less time, that is the space
from 10° to 0° in 64 seconds, while it has just been seen that
it required only 2 seconds to carry it from 45° to 0°, when it
had the advantage of the previous momentum acquired by
setting off from 165°.
   There was a peculiarity in the return movement of the
magnetic bar which is worthy of attention. When the north
end moved from 180° to 135°, it required, as has just been
seen, 11% seconds to complete the amplitude, while it only
took 64 seconds to traverse over the parallel amplitude from
45° to 0°.   The reason of this difference is, that in the first
case its momentum is in an increasing ratio, and the force that
is to move it has gradually to augment, while from 45° it sets
off with a strong momentum which it retains till it reaches 0°.
What the nature is of this force which goes on increasing on
the return of the bar up to 90°, and from that point continues
decreasing down to 0°, is a question of much importance in
the theory of terrestrial magnetism. It is evidently one at
right angles to the natural position of the needle, and seems
to be caused by a principle identical with that of the con
junctive wire of the pile, and would strongly tend to confirm
Ampère's theory of electric currents from east to west, if the
supposition of the efficiency of these were not opposed by
considerations to which I may return on a future occasion.
   While upon this point it will be interesting to see the rela

   The mode I have described of measuring the insensible
magnetic attractions of non-ferruginous bodies, has the rare
advantage of the most perfect delicacy and precision in all
angles up to 90°, but from thence to the moment when sensible
attraction commences, there is considerable vagueness, as far
as relative intensities are concerned. Where perfect repulsion
occurs it is distinctly indicated by the impossibility of forming
a connexion; but it is likewise evident that in many cases a
low degree of repulsion to the magnetic needle is overcome by
giving time for magnetic propagation, or by keeping the sub
stance operated upon in contact with a powerful magnet.
Where a body is very light, as cork or charcoal, the failure
must be attributed to their want of density, for the part of the
needle which comes in contact with the bodies is but a minute
point, yet the molecules which compose the cork or charcoal
in that spot, must stand at such a distance from one another
as to render their magnetism ineffective, and therefore inap
preciable.
   The delicacy of this mode of measurement is sufficiently
attested by its having been applied with equal success to a

450        Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
hair of the human head, and to a spark of diamond; and the
accuracy attained may be judged of by the fact, that the same
hair having been measured a year afterwards, was found,
without any remembrance of the previous measurement, to be
what it was before, namely 80°. A specimen from another
head which only gave 76° was lost, and the measurement
could not be verified, but another hair from the same head
being tried it was found to be 82°, a difference which may be
accounted for by supposing that all the hairs on the same
head are not possessed of equal magnetic intensity at the same
moment of time, or by a change in the state of the health of
the individual. The measurements may be relied upon as
never in excess, though from causes of disturbance, such as
the vibration of the house, &c., they must occasionally be
capable of being pushed further. No pains however have been
spared to obtain the utmost degree of accuracy. Those who
shall undertake to repeat these experiments will be best aware
of the extreme difficulty of the subject.

ment of the finger instead of the magnet; but that the mag

the needle, whether ferruginous or non-ferruginous of itself.
This is the “simpler mode” already alluded to.

  I have already spoken of the manner of raising the mag
netic intensity of various substances, by keeping them in close
contact with a bar-magnet for a short time. The following
metals had their magnetic intensities slightly raised by this
means:—
                   Platinum, from 65° to 90°;
                   Antimony, from 66° to 90°;
                   Bismuth, from 45° to 80°.
   It is very remarkable that it is not of the least consequence.
whether the substance is kept in juxtaposition with the N. or
S. end of the magnet, for the result will be just the same in
either case, and the N. or S. end of the needle may be made
to attach itself with equal indifference to the part of the sub
stance that has been so excited. Whether this proceeds from
a want of polarity in ferruginous magnetism, or from the
molecules of the substances having been rendered more
obedient to the coercive energy of the needle, it is difficult to
say. As the magnetism still remains, after such influence, of
the insensible kind, it is clear that they cannot penetrate to
any depth, and this may be the reason why no polarity can
be formally proved. The possible existence of polarity is.
jº by the fact that the magnetism is capable of
being heightened, and by the analogy of the connexion that
takes place between two similar poles of magnets when
brought forcibly into contact, as well as by what takes place
with arsenic. The magnetism which is found to exist in all
matter, and that to a degree which has never been anticipated, .
would be of tremendous operation in nature if it were not like
or identical with cohesive affinity, and consequently acting
only at distances that may be considered as insensible. . In
this respect it contrasts strongly with the power of gravitation,
and with that even of the magnetism of steel.                  -
   The effects that take place by keeping substances in con
tact with a magnet cannot be attributed to induction, as they
continue for a  :      or shorter space of time after separation.
   The measurements of the first class of substances speak so
clearly for themselves, that there would be but little occasion
for any remarks upon the greatest portion of them, if it were
not for the contrast in which some of them stand to the im
portant results obtained by Dr. Faraday, when he operated
with a very powerful electro-magnet. From the effects he .
observed he divides all metals into two classes, namely, mag
netic and diamagnetic, according as they showed attraction or
repulsion; the first of these states being indieated by the
cylinder placing itself in the line of the axis of the magnet, and

452 Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
the other, on its taking up a position at right angles to the
same axis.    Now it is not a little remarkable that platinum
and palladium, which he selects as magnetic, exhibit, it will
be seen, a lower state of attraction than cadmium, copper,
gold, mercury, and silver, and that these, in common with
 antimony, bismuth, lead, tin, and zinc, in which he found re
pulsion, all exhibit attraction, according to the present form
 of experiment, and some in a very strong degree.
    The case of antimony and bismuth is deserving of atten
 tion, for by a method somewhat analogous to the present one,
the late M. Lebaillif found that they exhibited repulsion;
 though in his experiments the bodies were not forced into
 contact, and therefore their occult properties were not elicited.
 In these two instances, as is the case with all bodies of low
 attractive power, the connexion was formed with some dif
 ficulty; but as it was repeated on many occasions at different
intervals of time, and even within a day of these remarks, not
the slightest doubt can exist on the point. But I shall have
to return to this subject again.
    Another fact resulting from the two modes of experimenting
employed by Dr. Faraday and myself, is that the connexion
 could be formed on any side or end of the substance, and that
form had no influence upon the result. Indeed this was to be
expected, as the transverse position which the substances
assumed in his hands resulted from their shape, as every ob
long body under repulsion must necessarily place itself at
right angles to the resultant of forces, with a facility propor
tioned to its length and slenderness. Where the shape of
the substance examined would permit of it, the end has of
late always been selected in preference to the side, with a view
to ascertaining this point; and this was particularly the case
with the antimony and bismuth, which were in bar, and had
been cut across.                       -
    I have introduced iodine into the class of metals and
metalloids, as its semi-metallic lustre seemed to justify it, and
because I found that it attracts the magnet of itself; but it
shows no polarity. All that is necessary is to hold a scale of
this body against the point of the magnetic needle, when, on
drawing it back, the needle will remain connected with it for
40° or 50° of the compass. A piece of arsenic too, which
showed very low magnetic intensity (15°), acquired a similar
power, but in a higher degree, after it had been for a short
time in close juxtaposition with the end of a bar-magnet; but
it was remarkable that this power only appeared on the flat
side of the arsenic where it had pressed against the crucible
in which it was melted, the other broken parts of the sides

         Magnetism, Cohesion, Adhesion and Viscosity.       453
being only raised by the same process to 85°. I attribute this
peculiarity to the greater number of points that are brought
in contact with the magnet where the surface is flat. The
character of the magnetism thus acquired is entirely the same
as that of steel, attracting and repelling in the same manner,
but comparatively in a very low degree, and consequently
quite superficial. If brought quite close to that end of the
needle for which it exhibits repulsion, it will, like a magnet,
in consequence of the proximity, attract it. It lost its mag
netic power in the course of a few weeks, but it has since
been renewed with the same facility as before.                -
   It appeared to me that the needles got out of order, for a .
short space of time, by their contact with the iodine and
arsenic; but upon this point I cannot at the present moment
speak positively. Certain it is that they became quite para
lysed on two or three occasions, but were restored by having
recourse to the touch, and subsequently by only letting them
lie quiet an hour or two. I suspected the same effect to have
taken place once or twice, after keeping them in contact with
antimony, but at other times I could assign no cause for the
change.                       -                                 -
   All the specimens of brass I have examined are very mag
netic, and may have that property considerably increased by
putting them in contact with a magnet. One specimen,
which is a bar, causes attraction at one end, but the repulsion
which existed at the other has disappeared. The former
state appears to continue unchanged, at least I have seen no
difference in the course of a year. Bell-metal has very low
 magnetic powers; so much so indeed that I despaired of
making the needle connect itself with it; nor was this object
effected till they had both been kept in connexion for some
time, and even then there was every symptom that this was
 attained only by overcoming a natural repulsion, as in the
 case of chromium, of which I have already spoken. No
 change seemed to be effected by keeping it in contact with a
 magnet. German silver is magnetic, and if brought within
about the eighth of an inch of the needle will attract it. But
 the specimen I had, seemed by its colour to contain an unusual
 proportion of copper, or otherwise it might have proved more
 magnetic.    No increase of magnetism resulted from connec
 tion with a larger magnet. Cobalt and manganese, as is
 known, attract. The needle clung at once to a globule of
 mercury, against which it had been urged by the magnet.
    All the rarer substances, including pure gold, in the pre
 ceding class, I believe to be chemically pure, as they were
 obtained from Messrs. Boyveau and Pelletier, and M. Ber

  454        Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
   hemot of this city (Paris), who considered them as such;
  but the tin and lead were taken from the ordinary specimens
  of commerce, and if the supposition which accounted for the
  magnetism of non-ferruginous bodies by their containing minute
  portions of iron, had any foundation, it would have been
  apparent in these two substances; yet it will be seen that the
  magnetism of both shows nothing very remarkable, and that
  the tin exhibits the same degree of attraction as the specimen
  of cadmium which I believe to be chemically pure, and these
  two will be found, nearly in all circumstances, to exhibit as
  remarkable a conformity magnetically as they are known to
 do chemically. When I show, however, the mutual attrac
  tions of non-ferruginous bodies, it will be seen that the notion
  of Coulomb, and other experimenters posterior to him, cannot
  be accepted as accounting for the results they observed.
                                       2nd Class.
                           Selenium ...... 10° | Sulphur 28°
     Selenium and sulphur both exhibit very low intensities with
 the magnetic needle, and even these are obtained with so
 much difficulty as to demonstrate that they are forced states.
 I have paid particular attention to these two singular sub
 stances, and have found that they resemble one another as
 much by their magnetic properties as by those that are che
 mical. I will here anticipate the branch of this inquiry which
 is to follow, by stating that they are remarkable in nearly
 agreeing in their affinities for the metals, but particularly for
gold. They, however, show not the slightest attraction for
one another, and therefore must be considered as mutually
repulsive. I have invariably found that where there is a che
mical resemblance there is likewise similarity in magnetic
properties, and these two substances maintain their resem
blance in the same way as tin and cadmium, which only
exhibit a difference of nature with respect to arsenic; but
everything regarding this last body seems anomalous, which,
like sulphur, has no affinity for selenium. Contact with the
magnet appears to elevate their power of attraction, at least
this was the case, as will be seen hereafter, when they were
tested with brass.

ºr gº     The present class exhibits many various degrees of attraction
      for the magnetic needle, but the ruby, the emerald, the sapphire
…”    and the jargoon, it will be seen, stand high in rank for this
 ---
----  property, while tourmaline and oural emerald are but low.
      The diamond was the only one of these precious stones that
      was placed in contact with the magnet, and it was found to
      have its energy raised by the connexion. Though the dia
      mond does not exhibit much attraction for the magnetic
      needle, it will be seen hereafter that this is compensated for
      by its affinity for copper, platinum and glass of every kind;
      and it will be generally found that what is of difficult connec
      tion with the magnetic needle is remarkably the reverse with
      glass, and they may respectively be placed at the head of a
      binary division of all substances; and what makes the fact the
      more remarkable, is that the attractive properties of glass are
      heightened in a very sensible degree by its remaining in con
      tact with the magnet. Glass has a striking affinity for cor
      nelian, red and white, and for blood-stone, while a connexion
      between the magnetic needle and these stones is formed with
      extreme difficulty.
          It might have been expected that flint would have shown
      much resemblance to quartz in its attraction for the magnetic
º     needle, but the connexion was always formed with great dif
º: :  ficulty, and on inany occasions, though it appears as high as
*:::  90°, it could not be raised above 20° in some particular spe
º     cimens, and many were tried. Yet the needle attached itself
      with great facility at 40° and 50° to quartz, and finally reached
      90°, but not by any forcing process: that measure however
      is still its ultimate limit. Flint has a decided repugnance for
      the magnetic needle, but still the magnet can overcome it, and
       a refractory specimen was raised by this means from 20° up
       to 40°.

456        Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
    The prism was raised by the magnet from 30° to 60°, but
the green glass, to which the magnetic needle attached itself
with great difficulty, seemed to acquire repulsive rather than
attractive powers by the same means. This was a specimen
of fancy glass, of an apple-green colour, and cut to represent
the calyx of a flower. I am ignorant as to what metal it owed
its colour. It will be seen hereafter that the prism, which
was of English fabric, exhibited an extraordinary affinity for
all the metals, as well as for flint glass. The common green
glass employed for wine bottles, and crown glass, notwith
standing the iron they contain, exhibited no striking attraction
for the magnetic needle, which can be easily accounted for by
remembering that the iron is in intimate combination with
other bodies, and having its affinity employed, simulates
neutrality.
    The particular kind of porcelain used by dentists has very
little attraction for the magnetic needle, and in other respects
exceeds even the glasses in its affinity for non-ferruginous
metals and gelatinous bodies. It and stone-ware are much
alike.
    The crystals of various kinds in this class, with the excep
tion of protosulphate of iron, exhibit very low magnetic in
tensities for the needle, and confirm what I have said about
the common glasses. Carbonate of iron, it will be seen, has
but little affinity for the magnet. Iceland spar is as difficult
and capricious as flint in its attraction for the needle, but is
remarkable in its affinity for non-ferruginous bodies. Talc
has but little attraction for the magnet and zinc, but it is
otherwise with iron and gold. It was not tried with other
bodies. The specimen, which was remarkably thin, came
from Delhi.           The other substances were not measured, but
the needle connected itself with them. Crystallized tin failed
with the magnetic needle, but rose to 90° after contact with
the bar-magnet.                               -

    Amongst the animal products, pearl and mother-of-pearl
are conspicuous in this class for their attraction for the mag
netic needle, and for gold, copper, brass, lead, platinum, zinc,
tin, and in all probability for the other metals, though they
were not tried. Glass attracts it with equal facility. Horn
of all kinds is extremely magnetic. The hair of the head has
been already alluded to, and it must excite surprise that a
body so fine could contain such high magnetic properties;
and the fact is of extreme use as proving the very circum
scribed extent of the spot, or rather of the point, which is
connected with the needle in these experiments, for the very
finest hair of the head that can be found exhibits as strong an
affinity as the thickest of the same kind. Amongst hair the
white whisker of a cat, of the mixed Angora breed, must not
be omitted, as it was distinguished above all for its attractive
properties which it maintained for all the substances with
which it was tested.

                   (~p <U+2192>-po.”)–(3p–p;3)*= 1;    . . . . (1.)
and which decomposes itself into two factors, as follows:
             (ap+pa + 32-p3)(ap+pa-3p-Hp 3) = 1. . . (2.)
These two factors are not only separately linear with respect
to the variable vector p, but are also (by art. 20, Phil. Mag.
for July 1846) conjugate quaternions; they have therefore a
common tensor, which must be equal to unity, so that we may
write the equation of the ellipsoid under this other form,
                   T(ap+pa +3p-p3) = 1; . . . . . (3.)
 if we use, as in the 19th article, Phil. Mag., July 1846, the
 characteristic T to denote the operation of taking the tensor
 of a quaternion. Let ~ be an auxiliary vector, connected
 with the vector p of the ellipsoid by the equation
                         a = p(x-3)2T'; . . . . . . (4.)
 we shall then have, by (3.), and by the general law for the
 tensor of a product,
                      T(z+3+2). To = 1;       . .   . . . (5.)

 where the second member is scalar; therefore, using the cha
 racteristic U to denote the operation of taking the versor of a
 quaternion, as in the same art. 19, we have the equation
                   U(2–3+a). Up = +1; . . . . . (7.)
 and the dependence of the variable vector p of the ellipsoid on
 the auxiliary vector a is expressed by the formula
                              U(2—3-1-0)
                      p= +    £1.3 .         . . .     . .    (8.)
 Besides, the length of this auxiliary vector a is constant, and
 equal to that of a-3, because the equation (4.) gives

we may therefore regard 2–3 as the vector of the centre C
of a certain auxiliary sphere, of which the surface passes
through the centre A of the ellipsoid; and may regard the vec
tor a –3+a as a variable and auxiliary guide-chord AD of the
same guide-sphere, which chord determines the (exactly similar
or exactly opposite) direction of the variable radius vector
AE (or p) of the ellipsoid. At the same time, the constant
vector —23, drawn from the same constant origin as before,
namely the centre A of the ellipsoid, will determine the posi
tion of a certain fixed point B, having this remarkable pro
perty, that its distance from the extremity D of the variable
guide-chord drawn from A, will represent the reciprocal of
the length of the radius vector p, or the proximity (AE)-' of
the point E on the surface of the ellipsoid to the centre (the
use of this word “proximity” being borrowed from Sir John
Herschel). Supposing then, for simplicity, that the fixed
point B is external to the fixed sphere, which does not essen
tially diminish the generality of the question; and taking, for
the unit of length, the length of a tangent to that sphere from
that point; we may regard AE and BD' as two equally long
lines, or may write the equation
                               AE= BD,        . . . . . . (10.)
if D' be the other point of intersection of the straight line BD
with the sphere.
   31. Hence follows this very simple construction* for an
ellipsoid (with three unequal axes), by means of a sphere and
an external point, to which the author was led by the fore
going process, but which may also be deduced from principles
more generally known. From a fixed point A on the surface
of a sphere, draw a variable chord AD; let D'be the second
point of intersection of the spheric surface with the secant BD,
drawn to the variable extremity D of this chord AD from a
 fixed external point B; take the radius vector AE equal in
length to BD', and in direction either coincident with, or op
 posite to, the chord AD; the locus of the point E, thus con
structed, will be an ellipsoid, which will pass through the point B.
   * This construction has already been printed in the Proceedings of the
Royal Irish Academy for 1846; but it is conceived that its being reprinted
here may be acceptable to some of the readers of the London, Edinburgh,
and Dublin Philosophical Magazine; in which periodical (namely in the
Number for July 1844) the first printed publication of the fundamental
equations of the theory of quaternions (is-jº-k2=–1, if=k, jk=i, ki–j,
ji=—k, kj=—i, ik=—j) took place, although those equations had been
communicated to the Royal Irish Academy in November 1843, and had
been exhibited at a meeting of the Council during the preceding month.

   32. We may also say that if of a quadrilateral (ABED'),
of which one side (AB) is given in length and in position, the
two diagonals (AE, BD') be equal to each other in length, and
intersect (in D) on the surface of a given sphere (with centre C),
of which a chord (AD') is a side of the quadrilateral adjacent
to the given side (AB), then the other side (BE), adjacent to the
same given side, is a chord of a given ellipsoid. The form,
position, and magnitude of an ellipsoid (with three unequal
axes), may thus be made to depend on the form, position, and
magnitude of a generating triangle ABC. Two sides of this
triangle, namely BC and CA, are perpendicular to the two
planes of circular section; and the third side AB is perpendi
cular to one of the two planes of circular projection of the ellip
soid, because it is the axis of revolution of one of the two cir
cumscribed circular cylinders. This triple reference to circles
is perhaps the cause of the extreme facility with which it will
be found that many fundamental properties of the ellipsoid
may be deduced from this mode of generation. As an ex
ample of such deduction, it may be mentioned that the known
proportionality of the difference of the squares of the recipro
cals of the semiaxes of a diametral section to the product of
the sines of the inclinations of its plane to the two planes of
circular section, presents itself under the form of a propor
tionality of the same difference of squares to the rectangle
under the projections of the two sides BC and CA of the ge
nerating triangle on the plane of the elliptic section.

LXX. Observations on the Analysis of the Spectrum by
   Absorption. By Sir DAVID BREWSTER, K.H., D.C.L.,
   F.R.S., and V.P.1°.S. Ed.*
IN a paper On       the Production of Light and Heat by Dr.
    Draper, published in the last Number of this Journal, the
ingenious author has made some observations on my Analysis
of the Solar Spectrum, which it is necessary that I should
notice. While he admits that I have “shown that red, yellow,
blue, and consequently white light exist in every part of the
spectrum,” he ascribes this result to the non-coincidence, or
the overlapping of the colours of the several spectra formed
on a screen by the rays falling near the edge, and those falling
near the back of a prism with a refracting face of considerable
magnitude. “In such a spectrum,” he says, “there must
undoubtedly be a general commixture of the rays; but may
we not fairly inquire whether, if an elementary prism were
                   * Communicated by the Author.

used, the same facts would hold good; or, if the anterior face
of the prism were covered by a screen, so as to expose a nar
row fissure parallel to the axis of the instrument, would there
be found in the spectrum it gave every colour in every part,
as in Sir David Brewster’s original experiment?”
    As my experiments were not made upon spectra formed
upon screens by prisms with large refracting surfaces, they
are not liable to this criticism, even if it were otherwise well
founded. The spectra which I use are so pure, and free from
all commixture, that Fraunhofer's black lines are distinctly
visible; and the results are precisely the same when the re
fracting face of the prism is reduced to the smallest possible
dimensions.
    My analysis of the spectrum by absorption, therefore, does
not indirectly controvert the principle, that “to a particular
colour there ever belongs a particular wave-length, and to a
particular wave-length there ever belongs a particular colour,”
 as Dr. Draper states, in theoretical language, the well-known
proposition of Sir Isaac Newton, but it directly controverts it,
and absolutely overturns it.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THE AMMONIACO-MAGNESIAN PHOS
           PHATE FROM URINE,          BY M. BOUSSINGAULT.
rTHE      author remarks that some time since Mr. Stenhouse proposed
       a process for rendering the phosphoric acid and alkaline phos
phates contained in urine useful in agriculture.      It is indeed suffi
cient to add milk of lime to it, to occasion a precipitate of phosphate
of lime.
   It occurred to M. Boussingault that it was possible, by means of
 a magnesian salt, to collect both the phosphoric acid and a part of
the ammonia developed during the putrefaction of the urine; and
the result was that of obtaining a manure which contains two sub
stances useful to vegetation—phosphoric acid and ammonia.
   In the month of June M. Boussingault mixed a solution of hydro
chlorate of magnesia with about 123 pounds of urine, fresh collected
in the morning. At the end of five days the urine assumed a milky
appearance, and from this time the deposit of ammoniaco-magnesian
phosphate increased rapidly. A month afterwards the solution was
poured off, and the phosphate was collected on a cloth to wash it.
The salt was very white, and in small well-terminated crystals; when
dried in the air, it weighed about one pound and nearly 100 grains
avoirdupois. The presence of the magnesian salt greatly diminished
the infectious odour emitted by the putrefying urine. It will be ob

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             463
served besides, that no disengagment of carbonate of ammonia would
occur, for the alkali developed was immediately converted into a
fixed salt.          -
   M. Boussingault observes that the above-described process appears
to be susceptible of being advantageously employed in situations in
which a large quantity of urine may be collected, as in the work
shops, hospitals, prisons, &c. of towns, because an efficacious manure
would be obtained which is particularly easy of transport. The
diminution of the bad smell ought also to be considered; for it is
evident that a magnesian salt acts under these circumstances as a
disinfectant. In establishments situate in agricultural districts, the
process would possess but little utility, because the urine could be
there employed immediately and without any preparation; and the
only advantage which could result from the use of a magnesian salt
under these circumstances, would be the prevention of the loss of
ammonia, a loss which the author thinks has been much exaggerated,

         CHEMICAL RESEARCHES ON THE YOLK OF EGGS.
   M. Gobley states that the fresh researches which he has made on
this subject were undertaken with a two-fold object, one of which
was to consider certain points which he had scarcely touched upon
in his first communication, another object was to determine how far
the objections of M. Sacc against his conclusions were well-founded;
with these views the author modified several of his analytical pro
cesses, so as to be quite certain that he would avoid the causes of the
errors which had been supposed to be discovered.
   M. Gobley concludes from his recent experiments,              -
   1st. That the fatty matter of the yolk of egg is formed, as had
previously been stated, of two distinct parts; one a fixed oil, the oil
of egg, and of a soft, not fusible substance, viscous matter.
   2nd. That the phosphorus does not occur in the oil, but in the vis
Cous matter.
   3rd. That oleic, margaric, phosphoglyceric, lactic acids, and the
extract of meat are not products of oxidizement.
   4th. That the viscous matter is not, as the author imagined, a
combination of oleic, margaric and phosphoglyceric acids with am
monia, but constitutes a body of a complex nature from which two
different substances have been separated, to which the author has
provisionally given the names of phosphorized matter and cerebric
*matter.
   5th. That the phosphorized matter which forms in the future animal
the substance described by M. Fremy as oleophosphoric acid, yields
oleic, margaric and phosphoglyceric acids with the greatest facility,
as products of decomposition in the presence of acids and mineral al
kalies under the influence of water or alcohol, and without the inter
vention of the oxygen of the air,

substance which Vauquelin, MM. Couerbe and Fremy have succes

 and cerebric acid.—Comptes Rendus, Avril 12, 1847.
               ON PLASTER OF PARIS.          BY M. PLESSY.
    All chemists have agreed with M. Gay-Lussac, that sulphate of lime
 which had lost the whole of its water of crystallization by the action
 of heat, amounting to 21 per cent, or two equivalents, might be re
 hydrated, and the setting of plaster was explained by it. M. Millon
 has, however, communicated to the Academy the following remarks:
 “Sulphate of lime heated to 230°F. loses 1% equivalent of water; at
 284° to 293° F., mere traces of water are separated; lastly, when
heated to 572°, the plaster is rendered anhydrous and does not then
 set.”
    These results, opposed to those obtained by M. Gay-Lussac, induced
 M. Plessy to occupy himself with a question which chemists had
 supposed to have been long settled, the consideration of which M.
 Millon has resumed.
    The facts stated by M. Plessy are, 1st, that gypsum and crystal
lized sulphate of lime, artificially prepared, lose 21 per cent. of water
 at 230° to 239°F. in a current of dry hydrogen, a gas which is well
known to exert no action on the salt under the circumstances in
 which M. Plessy operated; 2nd, plaster heated in the open air from
 230° to 239°F. readily lost 15 per cent. of water, and there then
 appeared a stop to occur; but at 266° to 284°F., the limit at which
plaster is dehydrated, according to Mr. Graham, M. Plessy separated,
 not traces of water, but 2 per cent., and this was effected in a very
short space of time; lastly, at 392° to 482°F., the plaster operated
on suffered a total loss of 21 per cent.     The author satisfied himself
that it was anhydrous, by heating it strongly with a spirit-lamp, and
yet it recombined with the whole of its water of crystallization so
perfectly, that after having set, it lost 21 per cent., or two equivalents
of water.
    It appears from the above statement that plaster does not retain
very precisely half an equivalent of water; for at 270° to 284°F.,
the loss is 17 per cent., and the half equivalent of water is greatly
endangered; the compound Sº O%2CaC), HO of M. Millon is de
stroyed, and yet it is formed at 230° to 239°F.; at this temperature,
moreover, it does not exist in a current of dry gas; this combination
has, notwithstanding, been obtained. M. Johnston found in the
boiler of a steam-engine, prismatic crystals of sulphate of lime which
contained half an equivalent of water.
   It results from the experiments now detailed, that sulphate of lime
which has lost the whole of its water of crystallization, may regain
it when they are brought into contact.
   In concluding, M. Plessy remarks that his results are opposed to
those of M. Millon, but that they have been previously announced
by M. Gay-Lussac and several other chemists.-Comptes Rendus,

        SUPPLEMENT TO VOL. XXX. THIRD SERIES,
LXXII. On the Phaenomena exhibited by Polarized Light when
   its plane of polarization is rapidly rotated. By Professor
   DovE *.
As unpolarized light exhibits the          same physical properties
      in all planes throughout the ray, whilst in rectilinearly
polarized light these are different in the different planes, and
attain their maxima and minima in two planes situated at right
angles to each other, and gradually pass into one another by
intermediate stages in those which lie between them, the
question arises, what will be the properties of polarized light
the plane of polarization of which is put into rapid rotation.
The experimental answer to this question gives rise to very
numerous phaenomena, which illustrate in a remarkable man
ner several positions in the theory of light, which have as yet
been only theoretically investigated.
   Two supports of the same height as the other supports were
placed to the triangular prism of the polarizing apparatus,
described by the author in the Scientific Memoirs, vol. i. p.86,
in the fixed rings of which, hollow rollers could be set in rapid
rotation by a band passing round a wheel with two grooves.
Both the rollers can rotate in the same direction, and, by
crossing one of the bands, in the opposite direction. Within
and on both sides of the hollow rollers, Nichol's prisms, cir
cularly polarizing plates of mica or ground crystalline plates
can be screwed. The condensing lens of the apparatus is so
placed as to concentrate the light of an Argand or monochro
matic lamp in the polarizing apparatus, whether at rest or in
rotation. The results of the experiments were as follows:—
   1. Light which is completely polarized rectilinearly when the
Nichol’s prism is at rest, possesses exactly its ordinary pro
perties when it is set in uniform rapid rotation, if the analy
sing apparatus is not rotated. On examination by a doubly

466                 Prof. Dove on some Phaenomena
refracting prism, when the rotation is slow, it constantly ex
hibits figures of the same brightness. The intense comple
mentary colours of their overlapping margins, on introducing
a lamina of selenite, mica, or a thin layer of calcareous spar,
completely disappear. The complementary system of rings
of calcareous spar and apophyllite, ground at right angles to
the axis, the splendid isochromatic curves of nitre, ground at
right angles to the line bisecting the angle formed by the two
axes, completely neutralize each other, becoming white. The
same applies to the colours of unannealed and compressed
glass. The centre of the system of rings which in rock
crystal (on slowly rotating the polarizing apparatus) passes
through the colours of the spectrum, appears perfectly colour
less on rapid rotation.
    We thus have in the rotating polarizing apparatus, a circle
of colours for the complementary colours; and not only for
those which occur in Newton's rings, but also for the compli
cated system of rings of those crystals the binary axes of
which are either situated in one plane with several lines of
bisection, or in different planes with the same line of bisection
(selenite, borax).
    We may easily convince ourselves of the true existence of
the polarization on the one hand, and the coloured curves on
the other, however rapid the rotation may be. We need only
place a Leyden jar, which spontaneously discharges itself, in
the situation of the lamp, to illuminate for an instant the Ni
chol’s prism rotating in the dark, and to convert the rotation
into apparent repose+. With monochromatic light, the dark
lines of interference vanish in a uniform illumination.               If the
red system of rings be separated from the violet in a binaxial
crystal by a glass coloured by cobalt, both disappear during
the illumination in an indefinite coloured mixture, in which
it is indifferent whether, as in nitre, the red axes form the
lesser angle, or, as in carbonate of lead, the violet.
   * If light which has been perfectly polarized by reflexion from a mirror
be transmitted first through an unannealed glass and then through two glass
appendages, of which the refracting plane of one is situated in the reflecting
plane of the polarizing mirror, the refracting plane of the other being at
right angles to it, the colours of the cooled glass entirely vanish and it ap
pears white, provided each of the two analysing apparatus is so inclined to
the incident ray as to polarize an unpolarized incident ray to the same
extent. With the slightest alteration of either apparatus the complement
ary images immediately appear, when the figure previously appeared co
lourless. This at once affords a very simple means of comparing the power
of two polarizing apparatus, based upon simple refraction, and of illustrating
the views of Sir David Brewster on the dependence of the polarization
#. a number of plates, their refractive power, and the incidence of the
 ight,

                   exhibited by Polarized Light.               467
    2. If the polarizer and analyser be rotated with equal velo
city in opposite directions, that system of rings is seen which
is obtained when both are in repose, and inclined to each
other at an azimuth of 45°. This is particularly distinct when
the light is rendered monochromatic by using a flame of spirit,
coloured yellow by common salt. The cause of this phaeno
menon, which appears so remarkable at first, is at once seen
when we recollect that, when one apparatus only rotates, the
analysing or the polarizing, during an entire revolution, the
arms of the white cross fall twice as often on the same spot as
those of the black, and the dark lines of interference alternate
with the bright lines of coincidence exactly in the same spots.
 When however both apparatus rotate in opposite directions,
the system of rings with the white cross appears at the points
0°, 90°, 180°, 270°, whilst the system of rings with the black
cross corresponds to the points 45°, 135°, 225° and 315°. As
the bright arms of the white coincide with the coloured spaces
of the dark cross, the impressions of the two are added, and
we obtain the appearance above stated. If the rapidity of
rotation of both rollers is exactly the same, the figure appears
motionless; but if the rapidity of rotation of the two is slightly
different, it slowly revolves, because the points of coincidence
gradually alter.
   3. If the polarizing and analysing apparatus revolve rapidly
with the same velocity in the same directions, the linear system
of rings becomes converted into that which is obtained when
circularly polarized light is circularly analysed. If, before
rotation, the Nichol's prisms are so placed that in calcareous
spar the black cross is visible, on rotation we obtain the New
tonian reflected rings with a black centre, but without the cross;
but if, when at rest, the white cross is visible, we then see, on
rotation, the Newtonian transmitted rings with a white centre.
If the polarizing and analysing apparatus do not rotate with the
same rapidity, we see the remarkable phaenomenon, that the re
flected Newtonian rings with the black centre, and the trans
mitted ones with the white centre, constantly alternate in
definite periods in the same spot of the field.
   4. If a circularly polarizing apparatus be rotated in an op
posite direction to the linear analyser, the same phaenomenon
is seen as when a linear polarizer and a linear analyser re
volve in opposite directions, but it is less distinct (2).
   5. If the circularly polarizing apparatus be rotated, and
the linear analyser be kept at rest, we obtain the system of
rings appearing at the quadrants exactly on rotation as on
repose.
   6. If the circularly polarizing apparatus be kept at rest,
                              2 I 2

468              Prof. Dove on some Phaenomena
and the linear analyser be rotated, we obtain a faint system of
rings without a cross, with a gray centre surrounded by a
black circle.     The direction of the rotation is here indifferent.
    7. If the circularly polarizing apparatus be rotated in the
same direction as the linear analyser, we obtain the appear
ance, but fainter, which is seen when a linear polarizer and a
linear analyser are rotated in the same direction, the rotating
velocity not being the same; hence the alternating system of
rings (3).
    8. But if a circularly polarizing and a circularly analysing
apparatus be rotated, either in the same or in opposite direc
tions, this has no influence on the appearance, which is per
 fectly identical with that which is seen when both apparatus
 are at rest.
    9. If a lamina of mica, circularly polarizing at an azimuth
 of 45°, be introduced between the Nichol's prisms, and be kept
 at rest whilst the polarizing Nichol’s prism rotates, the systems
 of rings neutralize each other on linear and circular analysis,
forming white light, in uni- and binaxial crystals and in rock
crystal.
    10. If the lamina of the polarizing apparatus, which pro
 duces circular polarization at an azimuth of 45°, be rotated
 between the Nichol’s prisms which are at rest, we obtain as
 the resultant of all the phaenomena of light polarized ellipti
 cally, circularly and rectilinearly in a single plane, on linear
 analysis, the phaenomena of partly rectilinearly polarized light,
 on circular analysis, those of a mixture of ordinary and cir
 cular light, i. e. in the first case the system of rings with a
 dark cross, in the latter the system of rings which vanishes
 at the quadrants; they are however faint.
    In all the foregoing experiments the Nichol’s prisms were
 crossed before the rotation was commenced.
     11. It is so difficult to set two laminae of mica or two Ni
 chol’s prisms either at an exactly equal or exactly opposite
 rotating velocity by means of a band passing round a wheel,
 that in those experiments in which the laminae of mica being
 kept at rest, the Nichol’s prisms rotate in the same or in op
 posite directions, or in which the Nichol’s prisms being at rest,
 the laminae of mica rotate, the relative position of the laminae
 or of the Nichol's prisms is constantly becoming somewhat
 changed, and hence the phaenomena of elliptical become mixed
 with those of the circular light. Hence, for the production of
 these phaenomena, the motion must be effected by wheel-work.
     12. Light, originally polarized rectilinearly, when trans
 mitted through a rotating Nichol’s prism and then analysed,
 yields light partially polarized in the original plane.

     13. A rotating velocity, which continues to decrease and
  increase through an entire revolution, in (1) and (9) produces
 partially polarized instead of ordinary light.
     14. Unannealed glasses rotating between Nichol’s prisms at
  rest, do not neutralize each other and form white light.
     15. Light from a rotating Nichol’s prism falling upon a
  metallic mirror, possesses the ordinary characters.
     16. The twin-growth of crystals gives rise to very compli
 cated phaenomena of colour. This is very beautifully seen in
 plates of calcareous spar, ground at right angles to the axis
 of the inclosing individual. The author has formed some of
 them artificially, by introducing a lamina of selenite of a de
 finite thickness between two accurately centred plates”. If a
 plate of a natural twin-crystal be rotated, after having been
 accurately centred as regards the axis of rotation, the colours
 become neutralized, forming white light; whilst a simple plate,
 rotated on its axis, preserves its system of rings unchanged.
    N.B. [The phaenomena of interrupted crystals, described in paragraph 16
 of this paper, were observed by Sir David Brewster previous to 1819; and
 the method of forming them artificially by enclosing laminae of selenite and
 mica between accurately centred plates of calcareous spar, and between
 equal plates of the spath calcaire basée, was practised by him previously to
 W.; 1827, the date of which is signed, in his Journal of Experiments, by
 the Vice-President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The experiments,
 too, are briefly described in his Treatise on Optics, Part II. chap. xxii. § 115,

 LXXIII. On the Depolarization of Light.                    By Prof. Dove.
 IF     rectilinearly polarized light be allowed to fall upon a
      rough surface, as a white wall, it is perfectly depolarized.
This phaenomenon is most distinctly seen, by allowing the
spectra of a prism of rock-crystal, polarized at right angles to
each other, to fall upon such a surface, and analysing the
purple-red resulting from the violet end overlapping the red
extremity, with a Nichol’s prism. On rotating the latter, there
is not the slightest alteration in colour. This depolarization,
which eight years ago the author, in a paper communicated to
the Berlin Society of Friends of Natural History, showed also
to occur on the rough internal surface of bodies covered with
a reflecting layer, progressively diminishes with the obliquity
of the incidence, so that even the dullest surface ceases to de
polarize at very acute incidences. With perpendicular inci
dence, it also extends to circular and elliptical light, which,
when reflected by a rough surface, is depolarized, i.e. possesses
the properties of common light. If the explanation of the
depolarizing property of rough surfaces is found in the sup
position that such a surface reflects in all directions, by the
converse, the combination of light polarized in all possible
                * Poggendorff's Annalen, vol. xxxv. p. 594.

470              Messrs. Wöhler and Liebig on
planes yields common light by reflexion. . A truncated hollow
cone, the smaller circular section of which was about fourteen
lines in diameter, and the larger seventeen lines, was ground
into a glass plate, four lines in thickness and three inches in
diameter. The lowermost surfaces of the glass were rough
ened at the margin of the circular section and blackened, and
the larger circular section was covered with a glass plate, upon
which a circular piece of tin-foil was pasted, so that its centre
coincided with the axis of the truncated cone. The angle of
the cone at the apex amounted to 70° 50'. When this appa
ratus is turned towards the sun, so that the rays fall at right
angles to the base of the cone, they enter the annular space
between the tin-foil and the dark coating of the sheath, and
arrive at the reflecting surface of the hollow cone at an angle
of 35° 25', thus becoming polarized in all the planes of re
flexion, and after reflexion, crossing at one point of the axis.
In the apparatus made by CErtling, this point was exactly in
 the plane of the smaller aperture of the cone, and was visible
when received upon the surface of a piece of white paper
placed there. As the polarized light would be depolarized
on account of the depolarizing action of this rough surface, it
 could only be determined that it was unpolarized. This was
 effected by polarizing the light incident upon the cone by
 means of an inserted glass plate, and introducing a plate of
 mica between the inserted glass plate and the cone. The
point remained colourless.
 LXXIV. On Thialdine and Selenaldine, two new artificial
    organic bases. By WöHLER and LIEBIG.              Communicated
    by Dr. A. W. HoFMANNº.
                            1. Thialdine.
 THE peculiar deportment of hydrated cyanic acid with al
        dehyde, which gives rise to a new acid containing the
 elements of aldehydite of ammonia and hydrated cyanic acid,
 induced us to study the action of some other substances on
 aldehyde and aldehydite of ammonia.
    The most interesting product which we obtained along
 with others, is a new organic alkali free from oxygen, and
 containing carbon and hydrogen in the same proportions as
 acetic acid, combined with sulphur and the elements of sul
 phide of ammonium. This substance, which we call thial
 dinet, is highly remarkable from its composition, and we have
 no doubt that the method which led to its discovery, when
  applied to other compounds analogous to aldehyde and alde
 hydite of ammonia, will yield a long series of new and inter
    * Communicated by the Chemical Society; having been read January 4,
  1847.                 t Contracted from 6elow and aldehyde.

                       Thialdine and Selenaldine.                   471
 esting products. The study of these substances promises to
 become highly important for the theory of the formation of
 organic bases, in which the action of ammonia is frequently
very prominent, and it may be expected that a close investi
 gation of the production of organic substances containing
sulphur will throw some light upon their generation in the
organism of the plant.
    The preparation of thialdine is very simple. One part of
 aldehydite of ammonia free from aether and alcohol is dis
 solved in from twelve to sixteen parts of water; one ounce of
this liquid is mixed with from ten to fifteen drops of solution
of ammonia, and treated with a slow stream of hydrosulphuric
 acid; after half an hour the solution begins to become turbid,
 and crystals are deposited of the appearance of camphor and
 of considerable size; after four or five hours the liquid again
becomes clear and the operation is terminated. The crystals
are collected on a funnel and washed with water until all the
 sulphide of ammonium is separated. Pressure between bibu
lous paper removes the adhering water. The dry crystals are
 dissolved in aether, the solution mixed with a third of its vo
lume of alcohol and left to spontaneous evaporation. The
liquid soon deposits very regular rhombic tables, which can
be obtained of half an inch in dimensions if too rapid an eva
poration of the solution has been avoided.
   If no more of the solution is left than is required to cover
the crystals formed, the mother-liquid is decanted off; the
crystals are then dried by leaving them for some time between
folds of bibulous paper. The mother-liquor yields some more
thialdine on evaporation. The crystals thus obtained are
however not quite colourless. The remaining liquid contains
much sulphide of ammonium, part of which arises from the
ammonia added.
    It happens sometimes that on passing hydrosulphuric acid
gas through the solution of aldehydite of ammonia, no cry
stalline body, but a heavy colourless oil of offensive odour is
deposited. This oil is a mixture of two bodies, the greater
part being thialdine, the fusing-point of which is depressed
to the temperature of the atmosphere by the presence of a
liquid substance”. In order to obtain pure thialdine from
this mixture, the supernatant aqueous layer is separated, and
the remaining liquid (consisting principally of the oil and but
a small amount of the aqueous solution) is agitated with half
its bulk of aether, which instantaneously dissolves the oil.
The aethereal solution, which may be easily separated from
   * Crystals of thialdine when placed in contact with sulphide of ammo
nium for some time are entirely converted into a heavy oil, insoluble in
water, which has not been further examined.

472               Messrs. Wöhler and Liebig on
the water, is agitated in a stoppered bottle with a little con
centrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture generally solidifies
as a mass of fine needles, which may be separated from the
oil by washing with aether. In this manner hydrochlorate of
thialdine is obtained, from which pure thialdine may easily
be prepared by moistening the dry crystals with a concen
trated solution of ammonia, and extracting the separated base
by means of aether. The aethereal solution yields by sponta
neous evaporation crystals of pure thialdine. Addition of al
cohol to the aethereal solution facilitates the crystallization
exceedingly; the crystals become larger, more regular, and
perfectly transparent.
   Pure thialdine is heavier than water; its specific gravity is
1.191 at 18°C.; it forms large, transparent, colourless, shining
crystals of the form of common gypsum, possessing a highly
refracting power and a peculiar aromatic, but after some time
very disagreeable odour. The crystals fuse at 43° C.; the
fused crystals solidify at 42°; they are volatile at the tempe
rature of the atmosphere without residue. Thialdine distils
with the vapour of water, but is decomposed when distilled
alone, a heavy oil of offensive odour passes over, solidifying
only partly and after some time, whilst a brown, syrupy re
sidue containing sulphur is left in the retort. Thialdine in
this respect resembles aldehydite of ammonia, which, though
volatile itself, cannot be exposed to a higher temperature with
out decomposition. If a crystal of thialdine remains for several
hours in an atmosphere containing acid vapours, such as is the
case in the laboratory, a white envelope of fine silky needles
is found at a certain distance from the planes of the crystals.
   Thialdine is but little soluble in water; it is soluble in al
cohol, and much more so in aether; when powdered it deli
quesces at the common temperature in vapour of aether, or in
an atmosphere containing vapour of aether.
   An alcoholic solution of thialdine exhibits the following re
actions:—
   With acetate of lead, at first no precipitate, but after some
time a yellow deposit appears, which soon becomes red and
finally black.
   Nitrate of silver causes a precipitate, which at first is white,
then yellow, afterwards black.
   With chloride of mercury a white precipitate is produced,
turning rapidly yellow.
   With bichloride of platinum a dingy, yellow precipitate is
thrown down after some time.
   Thialdine has no reaction on vegetable colours; it is solu
ble in all acids with which it combines, forming crystallizable
salts; the hydrochlorate and the nitrate are remarkable for

                    Thialdine and Selenaldine.                   473
the facility with which they crystallize and for the beauty of
the crystals.
   Thialdine and its salts are decomposed when gently heated
with a solution of nitrate of silver; sulphide of silver is pro
duced with disengagement of a combustible gas, easily in
flammable and possessing the odour and all the properties of
aldehyde; namely, it is entirely absorbed by concentrated
sulphuric acid and solution of potassa, the former becoming
brown immediately, the latter remaining clear but depositing
when gently heated a yellowish-brown precipitate of resin of
aldehyde, and assuming the peculiar and offensive odour
which accompanies the decomposition of aldehyde under these
circumstances.
   When thialdine is ignited with lime, chinoline appears
among the products of decomposition, which may be easily
recognised by its characteristic odour and by its beautiful
platinum salt.
   With cyanide of mercury thialdine exhibits a peculiar com
portment. On mixing the two solutions a white precipitate
is produced, which on boiling is converted into amorphous,
black sulphide of mercury. If this decomposition takes place
in a retort its neck becomes coated with fine crystalline nee
dles, extremely volatile, insoluble in water but easily soluble
in alcohol and aether. This new body, in which part or all the
sulphur appears to be replaced by cyanogen, is formed in but
small quantities, which up to this moment has prevented us
from studying it any further.
   The analysis of thialdine was performed in the usual way;
the combustion with oxide of copper is attended with diffi
culties, as the conversion of carbon into carbonic acid is ob
structed by the large quantity of sulphur contained in the
body forming a corresponding amount of sulphide of copper
at the point of contact between the substance and oxide of
copper.
   On burning thialdine with oxide of copper and separating
the sulphurous acid formed by means of peroxide of lead, a
gas is obtained containing volumes of nitrogen and carbonic
acid in the proportion of 1 : 12. Aldehydite of ammonia,
from which thialdine is produced, contains 4 equivs. of car
bon to 1 equiv. of nitrogen, from which it is evident that al
 dehydite of ammonia on being converted into thialdine by
 means of hydrosulphuricacid has lost two-thirds of its nitrogen.
    We have mentioned that thialdine, on being gently heated
 with a solution of nitrate of silver, has its sulphur converted into
 sulphide of silver. This mode of decomposition was employed
 to determine the sulphur. The nitrogen of the thialdine re
 mains in the residuary liquid in the form of ammonia, from

which it was precipitated by bichloride of platinum, and de

   Hydrochlorate of Thialdine.—Thialdine is dissolved in large
quantity by hydrochloric acid: the saturated solution has an
acid reaction. On spontaneous evaporation, or concentration
on the water-bath, it deposits large, regular, transparent prisms
of great lustre, and frequently an inch in length. The hydro
chloric solution of crude thialdine contains in admixture a
foreign body of most offensive odour; on agitating with aether
this odour disappears immediately, and the liquid which for
merly was turbid becomes perfectly transparent. Hydrochlo
rate of thialdine is rather soluble in water, less so in alcohol;
both liquids dissolve a large quantity when hot, and deposit
beautiful and perfectly regular crystals on cooling. Hydro
chlorate of thialdine is insoluble in aether.         When heated in
the dry state this salt is decomposed without fusion; it be
comes brown, and chloride of ammonium sublimes with evo
lution of a gas possessing a most offensive odour and burning
with a dull flame.        From the solution of this salt nitrate of
silver throws down a yellow precipitate, which, on being
gently heated, turns black with evolution of aldehyde. This
black precipitate is a mixture of chloride and sulphide of
silver; all the nitrogen of the base remains in the liquid in
the form of ammonia.

    Nitrate of Thialdine,—This salt may be obtained by mixing
 this base directly with dilute nitric acid; it is, however, pre
 ferable to dissolve crude thialdine in aether, and agitate the
 liquid with moderately concentrated nitric acid; the solution
 solidifies into a crystalline mass, which is washed with aether,
 dissolved in water, and crystallized by evaporation and cooling.

   On burning this salt with chromate of lead, more accurate
numbers for the carbon and hydrogen were obtained than in
the analysis of thialdine itself or the hydrochlorate, a result
which can easily be explained by the co-operation of the oxy

   But the question respecting the real constitution of this
body is too closely connected with that of the true constitu
tion of organic bases in general to admit of any definite
opinion being promulgated at this moment, when so few ex
periments on the subject are as yet before us. Still we can
imagine how important for the general question facts like the
formation of thialdine may hereafter become, and that just
from this quarter perhaps a way for its solution may be ob

                     Thialdine and Selenaldine.             477
tained. We will here merely allude to an explanation of the
constitution and basic character of thialdine, at once obvious,
namely, that it may be regarded as a copulated compound of
sulphide of ammonium with 3 eqs, of a body
                             C, Ha S,
which is the sulphide corresponding to the oxide in aldehyde,
namely, sulphide of acetyl.
                          2. Selenaldine.
    The existence of thialdine and the mode in which this base
is formed, induced us to try the preparation of a correspond
ing selenium compound. We perfectly succeeded in obtain
ing that body : selenaldine, however, is so soon and easily
altered, that we have not as yet been able to subject it to a
more profound investigation.
    Selenaldine was produced by passing into a concentrated
 solution of aldehydite of ammonia hydroselenic acid gas, dis
 engaged from selenide of iron by means of sulphuric acid.
 In order to prevent the decomposition of hydroselenic acid
 by the oxygen of the atmosphere, the whole apparatus had
 been filled previously with hydrogen. The excess of the poi
 sonous hydroselenic acid was condensed in a potassa appa
 ratus. After some time the solution of aldehydite of ammonia
 begins to become turbid, and crystals of selenaldine are de
 posited. When the mass of crystals is no longer augmented,
 the excess of hydroselenic acid is expelled by a stream of hy
 drogen gas; the solution of selenide of ammonium, covering
 the crystals, which soon turns red and deposits selenium, is
 now displaced by introducing a stream of cold water, free from
 atmospheric air, through one of the glass tubes connected
 with the bottle. The crystals are then collected upon a
 filter, pressed between folds of bibulous paper and dried over
 sulphuric acid.
    Selenaldine, as it is deposited from the liquid in which it
 forms, presents itself in small colourless crystals, doubtless
 isomorphous with thialdine. In contact with the atmosphere
 it turns immediately yellow. This substance has a feeble but
 disagreeable odour; it is slightly soluble in water, on which
 account it should not be washed too long. The aqueous so
 lution and the last washings become soon turbid in contact
 with the atmosphere, and deposit an orange-yellow body.
 The same deportment is exhibited by the solution of sele
 maldine in alcohol and aether, in both of which it is easily
 soluble. In consequence of its being so easily altered, we
 did not succeed in obtaining this base in crystals from any of
 the solutions mentioned. On evaporating them in vacuo over

 478             Dr. R. A. Smith’s Remarks on
 sulphuric acid, the greater portion of the substance is vola
tilized with decomposition, the yellow body being likewise
produced, while sulphate of ammonia is formed in the sul
phuric acid. Also, when heated alone, selenaldine is decom
posed, with disengagement of a gas of most offensive odour.
Selenaldine is a base like thialdine; it is soluble in dilute
hydrochloric acid, and reprecipitated by ammonia as a cry
stalline mass. The hydrochloric solution also immediately
decomposes with evolution of a most offensive odour. Sele
maldine is altered in a similar manner by boiling with water.
The yellow body, the formation of which seems to be always
attended with a liberation of aldehydite of ammonia, when
collected is orange-yellow, amorphous, soluble in alcohol and
aether, and fuses, when heated with water, to a reddish yellow
mass, which remains soft for a long time. When heated alone,
this body is charred with evolution of an oil containing sele
nium and possessing a most offensive odour.
   We did not obtain a decisive result when trying to produce
a telluraldine, the tellurium which we employed in the pre
paration of the hydrotelluric acid accidentally containing so
large an amount of selenium, that merely selenaldine was de
posited from the purple solution, containing, as it appeared,
only telluride of ammonium. We intend to repeat this ex
periment with tellurium free from selenium.
LXXV. Some Remarks on the Air and Water of Towns.
              By Rob ERT ANG Us SMITH, Ph.D.”
HAVING given considerable attention          to the inquiry into
      the causes affecting the health of towns, I was anxious
to find what the real evil in their polluted atmosphere con
sisted of; the air has been frequently examined, but the dif
ferences found do not sufficiently account for the differences
perceptible in breathing for the first time in entering a large
town from the country, or for the very great difference in
the colour and appearance of both when contrasted side by
side, by an individual outside a town, having both before his
eyes. The accumulation is great in this case, it is true, but
therefore so much the more fitted for showing us its true
character.
   I first examined the rain-water taken from a cistern; a little
was boiled down and the solid residue was like fatty matter,
which burnt and gave the smell of a fat, leaving afterwards
a strong odour of nitrogenized organic matter. As this
amounted to nearly one per cent, I was disposed to con
rºommunicated by the Chemical Society; having been read January 4,

                  the Air and Water of Towns.                479
sider it an accidental impurity, and collected some rain in
a porcelain vessel previously carefully cleaned. A smaller
amount was obtained, but still from 500 grains of the water a
sufficient quantity to make the smell distinct. I know that
organic matter has been found in rain-water, but I am not
aware that the smell of nitrogenized matter has been distinctly
observed. It has been obtained also by boiling down large
quantities: I have never found it to fail in evaporating as
little as 1000 grs. The amount was generally about 0.1 of a
grain in 1000 grs., but the average cannot be got without
trying many seasons and many places.
   1000 grs. collected on the 23rd of November, 1846, in a
platinum vessel, after raining thirty hours with little inter
mission, gave with nitrate of silver a precipitate weighing
0'll grs. = 0.027 of chlorine, and with a salt of barytes 0-1,
equal to 0-0343 grs. of sulphuric acid, besides a perceptible
smell of organic matter as before.
    I do not adduce this analysis as of any great importance
in showing the amount; the quantity operated upon is small,
and I was desirous, for the sake of the salts, not to expose it
to the contact of any vessel which could be acted on ; but I
mention it to show, that the quantity is not such as can be
only procured by the questionable process of boiling down
large quantities in vessels too large to admit of being perfectly
cleaned.
   The water is often alkaline—I say often, but I have always
found it so; by boiling this is lost, proving, as I think, that
there is more carbonate of ammonia set free from the burning
of coals than is necessary to saturate the sulphuric acid in
the atmosphere.                                    -
   The air is often acid, as evidenced by test-papers exposed
to it; and it certainly proves very acid when certain quantities
of coal are burnt.
   It would have been well to have examined water from the
country falling at the same time, but being persuaded that
water so impure would long ago have been examined if it
even fell over large districts in such a state, I preferred look
ing to its origin.
   As far as I am aware no examination of unventilated places
has given us a good proof that carbonic acid is the greatest
agent in making them so actively injurious. I breathed, and
had others to breathe, through a bent tube into a large jar,
and examined the moisture in the jar. As it always con
tained organic matter in large quantities, I inferred that the
same must occur when the perspiration and breath con
dense upon the windows of crowded rooms.

 480              Dr. R. A. Smith’s Remarks on
    This condensed moisture is not easily obtained in sufficient
 quantities; but on the occasion of a concert at the Mechanics’
 Institution here, I collected 200 grs. from one window, letting
 it drop into a small platinum basin. By burning 5 grs. of this
 the smell was made apparent; by burning 150 grs. a strong
 smell of human sweat came off, continuing until the sub
 stance was dry. It will therefore be difficult to tell how
 much organic matter was contained in the whole, as a great
 deal evaporated, but above 2 grs. were left. When heated,
 this smelt like burning flesh, and was very disagreeable.
    We know that volatile products escape from the bodies of
 animals, and are mixed with the air so as to undergo com—
 plete oxidation; but this cannot be any important part which
 the air has to perform, as the following facts show that the
 oxidation is best effected in the earth. It may however be
 important that bodies should decompose in this manner, be
 cause they are also more readily conveyed by the atmosphere
 to plants.
    When we see the volatile and decomposing matter from
 the body so distinctly as in the last case mentioned, it is
 possible for us to conceive that infectious matter is not a sub
 stance so very subtle as has been supposed; we have only to
 allow it to be in a peculiar state of decomposition.
    Burning in a platinum crucible and the odour discover a
very small quantity of organic matter, such as it is scarcely
 safe to trust to the results of the balance. I hope in a future
paper to show the qualities of several water districts in this
respect, but at present give an abstract only of the results of
 such observations as I have made, hoping that the constant
 and almost monthly variation of the water of whole districts
will be a sufficient excuse for the absence of an arranged set
of results.
    When water from a peaty district is boiled down and the
ashes burnt, the smell of peat is distinctly observed. The
river Dee at Chester contains 25 grs. of organic matter to the
gallon, and the smell is as perceptible as at Llangollen, close
to a peaty district. 500 grs. of the water are sufficient to
indicate this very strongly. Water from the Lancashire and
Yorkshire hills may be known to contain peat also by testing
the same quantity, although many of the streams do not con
tain 15 grs. per gallon. Some of the canals near Manchester
may be known to be supplied from peaty districts by the
same tests.     But whenever we approach a town the smell
from the burnt ash changes, and organic matter from the de
composition of protein compounds is distinctly traced. So
easily is this known, that when water was brought to me

                 the Air and Water of Towns.                481
from the Dee, above Llangollen and below, it appeared evi
dent that even this small town had affected the river. Before
the water arrives at Chester the peat predominates too much
to make it perceptible that matter from towns has been
thrown into it; below it is distinct.     Water from surface
drainage indicates by the same mode of treatment nitrogenous
matter undecomposed.
   Observing this increase of organic matter on approaching
towns, I naturally expected to find a large quantity in the
wells, of which there are many in Manchester, placed as they
often are in the neighbourhood of cesspools, besides being
exposed to the infiltration of the water of drains.
   A well was first examined in a garden near the town, the
proprietor having complained of it as being unwholesome.
It contained 40 grs. of common salt per gallon, 14 grs. of
organic matter and salts of ammonia, besides other ingredients
to be expected in connection with organic matter. I next
examined a well near a burying-ground; it was loaded with
inorganic salts. Its taste was very bitter; when evaporated
and burnt, the remaining inorganic matter gave out a pun
gent acid vapour. Four wells in the same neighbourhood
were examined, all with the same results. I then went to nearly
all the churchyards in Manchester, of which there is a consi
derable number, but finding that the neighbourhood of the
collegiate church gave the same indications as all the rest,
although there have been no burials there for many years, I
was induced to ascribe it to the presence of large dung-heaps
close to the well. Other wells distant from churchyards, but
near cesspools, gave the same result. In the suburbs they
were not so much tainted, but in some newly-built streets
close to the town, in gravelly soil, were very bad.
   I have no doubt that the churchyards and the cesspools act
in a similar manner, as we might naturally expect. The chief
impurity is a collection of inorganic salts. It is remarkable
how rapidly the organic matter becomes oxidized and con
verted into nitric acid in the soil.   In one case I found as
much as 70 grs. of nitrates in a gallon of water, besides mag
nesia, lime and alkalies.   This water seems to be a favourite
with some persons; when not quite so heavily charged it has a
fine sparkling appearance. The wells in the centre of the town
have nearly disappeared, otherwise it is probable that organic
matter would have been found there in a less oxidized state.
   As these wells have undergone several changes during the
autumn and early part of the winter, I shall not give the re
sults of the analyses which I have made, until a few seasons
shall enable me to make a more complete examination of the

subject. At present, when the ground is so wet, it is difficult
to obtain a sufficient quantity of the salts, which are peculiar.
At present I may say that sulphuric acid added to the water
gives off chlorine; that heat evolves chlorine and peroxide of
nitrogen from it; and that the remaining salt is a mixture
of a chloride and a nitrate chiefly. This will be sufficient to
show that neither the water nor the air of Manchester has so
very minute an amount of impurity as to put it without the
power of detection.
LXXVI. On certain Atmospheric or Barometric Waves which
   traversed Europe during November 1842. By WILLIAM
    RADCLIFF BIRT*.
A".     the sittings of the Geological Society on the 3rd and
      17th of May in the year 1816, a paper was read by Dr.
Macculloch On the Employment of the Barometer in mea
suring heights. In this paper the author endeavoured to show
that the differences indicated by different instruments, placed
at various stations on the earth's surface, are real differences
of atmospheric pressure, and that the changes which take
place at several stations are far from being simultaneous: he
also expressed an opinion, that the differences of pressure,
combined with their progressive character, are in some way
or another connected with the direction of the wind, especially
the two cardinal currents N.E. and S.W. of our island; but
the imperfect state of the barometer at that time was such as
to prevent an efficient investigation of the subject.
    In the year 1832, Professor Forbes, in his Report on the
 Recent Progress and Present State of Meteorology, presented
 to the British Association for the Advancement of Science
 during its sitting at Oxford, alluded to the accidental variations
 of barometrie pressure as greatly influenced by latitude, the
 amount of variability increasing towards the poles. He ap
 peared to regard these variations as resulting from great
atmospheric tidal waves, which perpetually traverse our oceans
 and continents, and he viewed a future and more advanced
 state of meteorological science, as furnishing data from which
 the most interesting and important conclusions might be drawn
 in immediate connexion with such atmospheric waves+.
    On the 21st of March in the year 1835, Sir John Herschel
 made a series of hourly meteorological observations at Feld

 Science for 1846.

hausen Wynberg, near the Cape of Good Hope. These were
accompanied by a simultaneous set at the Royal Observatory
near Cape Town. The observations thus set on foot were
continued at numerous stations during the following three
years; and the discussion of the whole, collected by Sir John,
forms the subject of a report presented by that gentleman to
the British Association during its sitting at Cork in the year
1843. One of the objects to which Sir John directed his
attention in this discussion, was the barometric fluctuations
considered with a view to the propagation of atmospheric
waves. For this purpose the stations were distributed in
groups, in one of which (the European) Sir John succeeded
in detecting and tracing two well-defined waves; one on the
21st of September 1836, the other on the 21st of December
1837.    These waves were so vast in their dimensions, that to
take in (says Sir John) an effect of this nature, we must enlarge
our conception of an atmospheric wave till it approaches in
some degree, in the extent of its sweep and the majestic regu
larity of its progress, to those of the tide-waves of the ocean+.
   The principle on which the discussion of these hourly ob
servations was conducted, was that of projecting the baro
metric curves for all the stations of one group on a single sheet
for each separate term, the scale being one inch to an hour in
time, and one inch to Oin-O66 of barometric altitude. From
the nature, however, of the observations, no one curve was
continued longer than twenty-four hours, except on the occa
sion of a remarkable storm. During the progress of this
work, it was deemed desirable to obtain the complete rise and
fall of the barometer; so that a complete wave might be ob
served at least at one station.     Observations undertaken with
this view, and projected in curves, illustrate Sir John Her
schel's report. As a test of any conclusions that may be drawn
from a discussion of observations on this principle, the obser
vations may be so combined as to exhibit, not only the baro
metric relations with regard to time, but also with regard to
space: in other words, the distribution of pressure over a
tract of country, at any given epoch, will indicate the real
character of the waves then transiting.
    The last report which I had the honour to present to the
British Association during its sitting at Southampton, contains
an examination of certain barometric observations exclusively
on the last-named principle. These observations were made
during November 1842, the same month in which the obser
vations were made from which some of the curves illustrating

 Sir John Herschel's report were projected. The result of the
 examination has been the apprehension of several large atmo
 spheric waves of so distinct a character, that the barometric
 movements over an area included by the angular points, the
 Orkneys, St. Petersburgh, Geneva and Cork, have been fully
 explained, especially during the earlier portion of the month.
 In order clearly to place these barometric waves before the
 readers of the Philosophical Magazine, I shall at once proceed
 to make various extracts from the report bearing immediately
 upon the subject, commencing with the
        Definition and Phaenomena of an Atmospheric Wave.
    When a number of barometric observations are projected on paper
 according to a suitable scale, and continued for months and years,
 the eye on contemplating them will recognise a variety of curved
forms, some of large and some of small amplitude; some rising to a
 considerable altitude, others sinking far below the level, representing
 the mean barometric pressure at the station of observation. At first
 there appears but little regularity in these curvilinear records of the
 ever-shifting state of our atmosphere, but here and there the atten
 tive observer will notice some similarity existing between two or
 more individual curves, and he may notice some which possess a
 certain symmetrical arrangement of the ascents and descents. In
 consequence of this similarity and symmetrical arrangement, he
 examines more carefully the records of barometric pressure, and not
 only discusses the observations at one station, but compares those
 observations with others made at various stations; and here again
 he finds apparent irregularity and confusion. The curves to a cer
tain extent agree, but in many minor points they differ often very
 considerably, in some cases rising at one station while falling at an
 other; this induces a still more minute and careful investigation:
the distribution of pressure over the largest area he can command is
carefully examined; and whether his stations are few or many at
any given time, he finds on this area a point of maximum pressure
and a point of minimum pressure; between these points he finds
various pressures, generally increasing from the point of least pres
sure to the point of greatest pressure. On some occasions he finds
a line of high pressure, stretching quite across the area, and on others
a line of low pressure. By continuing his inquiries for successive
epochs, he finds these lines of high and low pressure move across
the area, or in other words, the high pressure or low pressure is
gradually transferred from one point to another.       He also finds at
still more remote epochs other lines of high and low pressure, some
having the same direction with the lines originally noticed, and others
crossing the direction of the original lines at various angles.
    The questions which now suggest themselves are the following:—
What are these movements? How can they be represented 2 In
what manner can they be explained P A simple consideration of
the curves suggests the idea of waves as explanatory of the phaeno

 that ideal individuality which the mind attributes to the process
 which it observes of the successive change of place which the baro
 metric maxima and minima undergo, and by which they regularly

 dividuality has been employed as a mean of examining the move.
 ments just alluded to.
    Mr. Scott Russell, in his admirable report on waves, presented to
 the British Association during its sitting at York in 1844, has given
 the elements of an aqueous wave. These elements appear so clearly
 to express the relations of the barometric phaenomena (simply con
 sidered as such), that I shall avail myself of Mr. Russell's terms to
 indicate the distribution of pressure over the surface of the earth, as
 in figure 1.

the slope W a, the anterior slope or front of the wave; the slope

   The observations to which allusion has been made, were published
by Mr. William Brown in a paper that appeared in the Philosophical
Magazine for April 1846. This paper is entitled “On the Oscillations
of the Barometer, with particular reference to the Meteorological
Phaenomena of November 1842.” The object of the author is to show
that the barometric oscillations are produced by the meeting of oppo
site or nearly opposite aérial currents; that one current thus meeting
or impinging on another, deflects it, and under some circumstances
produces a rise of the mercurial column, but under others occasions a
fall in many cases of considerable magnitude. In order to elucidate his
views, Mr. Brown has collected barometric observations from eleven
stations, which are scattered over an area included by the following
angular points:—The Orkneys, Christiania in Norway, Paris, Ply
mouth and Cork. These observations are in most cases given as read

would be commencement.

 off from the scale. In addition to these the paper is accompanied by
 six plates, in which the direction of the wind at numerous stations is
 indicated for every day during twenty-six days in the month by
 arrows. The anemonal observations published in the body of the
 paper not being in all cases for consecutive days, a comparison of
 them with the plates is rendered difficult; nevertheless the plates
 form a very valuable portion of the communication, and if they have
  been laid down from accurate observations, they furnish us with an
 important addition to our knowledge of the arrangement of the aërial
  currents, especially with respect to the distribution of pressure. It
  is a matter of regret that Mr. Brown did not so arrange his obser
  vations and plates, that the accuracy of the latter could have been
 seen by inspection.
     This paper is peculiarly interesting at the present time, when the
 attention of meteorologists is directed to the important and interesting
 problem of the barometric oscillations. I have already noticed the
 views which have been taken of these oscillations as the results of
 waves. In this paper they are regarded as the effects of currents;
 and it appears that meteorologists are now divided as to which of
 these hypotheses they shall be referred. Professor Dove remarks,
 in his letter to Colonel Sabine on the Magnetical and Meteorological
 observations*, “the so-called irregular variations of the barometer
 are regarded by some persons as only the effects of currents of air of
 unequal temperature and moisture; other persons distinguish the
 effects of currents from the effect of undulations progressing in the
 manner of waves of sound, and propagating themselves with great
 velocity over large portions of the earth's surface.”
     It is worthy of notice, that these movements have been referred
 to two very distinct kinds of waves.       Prof. Forbes speaks of them
 as great atmospheric tidal waves, and Prof. Dove speaks of a class
of individuals who regard them as progressing in the manner of
waves of sound.
     It is not my intention to enter into an examination of the conclu
sions and results which Mr. Brown has arrived at; as the question is
open, I apprehend I have not committed an injustice towards that
gentleman by having employed a rather different process to that
which he has used, and further discussed the observations he has
given.      I beg to acknowledge the obligations I am under to him
for these observations, and especially for the plates, of which I have
before spoken: they are extremely interesting in the present inquiry.
    In accordance with these remarks, I have selected the following
stations from Mr. Brown's list:—the Orkneys, Belfast, Shields, Cork,
Bristol, Plymouth, London, Paris, and Christiania. The reason I
have omitted Glasgow and Armagh will be apparent from Mr.
Brown's notes. As I have discussed these observations with espe
cial reference to the wave hypothesis, I have most cautiously avoided
in my remarks any thing that may at all bear on Mr. Brown's views.
The plan I have proceeded on is as follows. I have selected the

 middle observation of each day; at those stations where only two
 are given morning and evening; I have taken a mean of them.
 These observations I have so arranged as to exhibit the distribu
 tion of pressure over the area for each day—the line or lines of
 the greatest diminution of pressure—and the relation of such dis
 tribution and of such lines to the aërial currents or winds.              As a
 convenient method of readily expressing these various relations
 and giving to the discussion that completeness which otherwise it
 would want, I have adopted the wave hypothesis, and to every line of
 barometric maxima applied the term crest and to every line of minima
 the term trough. In a word, I have regarded the progress of the ba
 rometric and anemonal phaenomena as the progress of waves. The
 observations remain the same both in Mr. Brown's and my own dis
 cussions, the results only are different; and it remains for other
 philosophers, by more closely investigating the subject, and submit
 ting the observations to a more rigorous and searching discussion,
 to advance this interesting inquiry and to become more intimately
 acquainted with the causes of these interesting phaenomena.
    In addition to the discussion of these observations making us
 acquainted with several large waves similar in character to the defi
 nition before given, it also reveals to us the arrangement of the aërial
 currents with respect to such waves, or rather by means of these
 observations and the plates accompanying them, we are able to
 ascertain, not only the general direction of the aërial currents, but
 also the barometric phaenomena resulting from their transit.
    Prof. Dove, in his second letter to Col. Sabine relative to the
 magnetical and meteorological observations, has announced his
 opinion that the equipoise of the atmosphere is maintained in the
 temperate zone by currents on the same level flowing in opposite
 directions*; thus we have a bed or stratum of air moving from
 the S.W., and on each side of this are strata of N.E. winds. We

 488           Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.
 may here inquire, how are these alternate aérial currents related
 to the waves before alluded to ? It is one of the objects of the
 discussion to exhibit this relation, which may be thus briefly ex
 pressed, at least in so far as the examination of the observations has
 yet extended”. Let the strata a a a'a', b'b' bb, fig. 2, represent two
 parallel aerial currents, a a a' a' being from S.W. and b' b' b b from
 N.E., and conceive them both to advance from the N.W. in the
 direction of the large arrow, that is the strata themselves will advance
 with a lateral motion.       Now conceive the barometer to commence
 rising just as the edge b b passes any line of country, and to continue
 rising until the edge b' b' arrives at that line, when the maximum is
 attained. The wind now changes and the barometer immediately
 begins to fall, and continues to fall until the edge a a coincides
 with the line of country on which b b first impinged. During this
 process we have all the phaenomena exhibited by an atmospheric
 wave; when the edge b b, fig. 2, passes the line of country, the point
 a, fig. 1, of the wave (the anterior trough) transits that line of coun
 try and the barometer begins to rise with a N.E. wind. During the
 period the stratum b' b' b b, fig. 2, transits the line the anterior slope
 W a, fig. 1, passes; when the conterminous edges of the strata a'a'
 b' b', fig. 2, pass, the crest W, fig. 1, extends in the direction of the
 preceding trough : the barometer now begins to fall, and when the
 edge a a, fig. 2, occupies the place of b b, also fig. 2, the descent of
 the mercurial column is completed; the posterior slope W w, fig. 1,
 has passed, and the posterior trough w, fig. 1, now occupies the line
 in which the anterior trough extended.
    This arrangement of the aërial currents in connexion with a baro
 metric wave may be termed the air-motion of the wave. In contem
plating the transference of the barometric maxima and minima, we
 regard only the wave-motion. In contemplating the direction and
 force of the wind, we regard also the air-motion. The wave-motion
 consists in the lateral transference of the parallel beds of aerial cur
 rents; the air-motion being these oppositely directed parallel currents
 themselves.
    From these considerations, we readily see that the wave is a con
 venient method of representing the barometric fluctuations. We have
seen that the rise is due to the anterior slope and the fall to the
posterior; and we now further learn that the direction of the aërial
current on the anterior slope is at right angles to the axis of transla
tion directed towards the left-hand, while on the posterior slope it is
the reverse; still at right angles to the axis of translation, but directed
towards the right-hand.
   Having thus noticed the wave-motion with its accompanying air
motion, these interesting questions suggest themselves:—How are
the forces of this air-motion arranged? Do all the particles move
with the same velocity? Are there different velocities in different
parts of the wave? Our anemometers will answer these questions.
In the troughs, the edges b b a a, the forces are strongest; as the
barometer rises, the force gradually subsides; when the crest passes,
           * For this knowledge I am indebted to Mr. Brown's plates.

                Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.                              489
it is zero; and as the barometer falls, it increases until the trough
passes, when it is again strongest.
   M. Dove has suggested that the parallel currents, by which the
equipoise is maintained in the temperate zones, may be shifting ones,
and we have supposed that the parallel currents of N.E. and S.W.
winds may advance from the N.W. with a lateral motion. The same
cause that produces the well-known opposite and superposed equato
rial and polar currents, will also give rise to the same opposite but
parallel currents in the temperate zones, namely, the ascending column
of heated and consequently rarefied air. Now it is well known that
in stormy weather, when the wind is blowing with great force, the
barometer being nearly at its minimum, upon the wind changing
the barometer commences rising; the wind however continues to blow
with about the same force as it did with the previous falling baro
meter. Upon M. Dove's view of parallel and opposite currents,
somewhere in or near the line forming the boundary between the
currents, towards or in the torrid zone, we ought to find the point

   * In attributing the greatest force to the N.E. current, I do not by any means
wish to put forward or support any hypothesis that would at all interfere with the
well-known fact, that the greatest force is usually manifested by S.W. winds. The
point to which I wish more particularly to solicit the attention of the Association is
this, the cause which induces the south-westerly current itself. This must reside in
or near the torrid zone. Here we have a sufficient cause; we are presented with
phaenomena fully adequate to explain an influx of cool air from the N.E. This is
the current that must first be established, and in the first instance its force will be
greatest. We have however only to turn to Prof. Dove's letter to Col. Sabine
 (Report of the British Association, 1845, p. 61), and we shall at once find the reason
 why S.W. winds manifest by means of our instruments the greatest force. The N.E.
currents are narrower, and the force soon abates as they pass over towards the
S.E.; while on the other hand the same station is not only oftener, but longer in
the S.W. currents, and as the line of greatest force approaches, the force increases,
on some occasions very rapidly, until the wind changes. The line of greatest force
soon passes the station, so that upon a mean of numerous observations the south
westerly wind exhibits the greatest force.

4.90          Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.
constantly drawn off to feed the ascending column. When however
it is once established, the velocity of the line of S.W. current near
est to the N.E. would probably be equal, or nearly so, to that of the
N.E. current itself.
   In this way it is easy to conceive that a complete barometric wave
may be produced; the lines of greatest velocity of the parallel cur
rents will indicate the trough; the rapidity with which the currents
pass in opposite directions greatly diminishes the pressure, and ac
cording to this view somewhere near the direction of the trough and
to the S.W. of it, we ought to find the point of greatest rarefaction :
the velocity decreases on each side this trough, and with this de
crease of velocity the pressure increases, so that we have a distri
bution of pressure of a wave form gradually rising on each side
the trough, the pressure being dependent on the velocity of the pa
rallel currents.
   The constant ascent of air at the point of rarefaction would con
tinually draw off a quantity of air from the S.E. side of the line of
greatest velocity b–b, fig. 3, and this would be attended with two
results; first, there would be a real hollow or trough formed in the
line of junction of the parallel currents; and secondly, this line
would gradually advance towards the S.E.; for as more air would be
drawn off from that side, the whole body of air would advance in
that direction to supply the deficiency; and should the rarefying
process cease, we can readily conceive that not only will the wave
form be continued, but also wave-motion. The establishment of the
parallel currents will give the air-motion ; the diminution of pres
sure towards the lines of greatest velocity will give the wave-form ;
and the drawing-off of air from the S.E. will induce the wave-motion.
The wave thus generated is negative; it consists of a hollow pro
duced by the ascending current of heated air carrying off a con
siderable portion of air set in motion by this ascending column,
and its direction of motion is determined by more air being drawn
off from the S.E. slope than the N.W.
                               Cross Waves.
    The examination of the transit of a single wave by means of
 barometric and anemonal observations, would be comparatively
 easy, but it seldom happens, from the operation of natural causes,
 that an isolated or solitary wave is produced. In almost every
 instance (except in those in which the generating power is very
 much greater than any which occasions the production of smaller
 waves) the wave is contemporaneous with others of equal, if not of
 greater magnitude, so that different systems are in motion at the
same time, each individual pursuing its own course, and although
perfectly independent of every other, yet greatly modifying the re
sulting phaenomena as exhibited by the barometer and anemometer.
 When therefore we proceed with the examination of certain baro
 metric and anemonal phaenomena in the manner above alluded to,
 We are speedily perplexed with the barometric and anemonal effects

              Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.                           491
of cross waves; the flowing of one set of waves in a certain direc
tion is apparently interrupted and interfered with by another in a
different direction, and before the first set can be exhibited with its
proper proportions, and the true altitudes, amplitudes, velocities, and
directions of its individual waves assigned, all the phaenomena of
the other set must be carefully disentangled and separated from the
aggregate phaenomena presented by the contemporaneous systems.
The barometric curve, including a complete rise and fall at any one
station, is not the curve resulting from the transit of any one wave;
it does not represent the form of any reality in nature; but it does
represent, and is an exponent of the effects resulting from the con
temporaneous transits of waves, or systems of waves, such as have
been described.
   The discussion of Mr. Brown's observations has clearly brought to
light a set of parallel and opposite currents at right angles to those we
have been contemplating, namely, from N.W. and S.E. with a wave
motion towards the N.E., producing the cross waves which occasion
the complexity before alluded to. The late Professor Daniell has re
marked that the curves increase in range towards the N.W., and in
general the neighbourhood of water presents curves remarkable for the
boldness of their contour and the large extent of their range. In ven
turing a speculation on these cross waves from the S.W. with parallel
and opposite currents from N.W. and S.E., I should be inclined to
attribute them to the effect of the solar influence on the terrestrial
surface, extending from Cape Verd in Africa to the extreme north of
Lapland in Europe. This surface extends from S.W. to N.E., or
somewhat in that direction. It may be remarked, that to the north
east of Cape Verd is situated the Sahara or Great Desert of Africa,
and here we have a great rarefying surface. To the north-west or
west-north-west of this extensive rarefying surface, the broadest part
of the Atlantic ocean is situated. The relative positions of the Great
Desert and the broadest extent of the Atlantic will produce a great
 indraught of cool air from the ocean; the direction of this wind will
 be W.N.W. or N.W. To the north-east of this current, probably
 in the neighbourhood of Morocco, Fez, Algiers, Spain and Portugal,
 and the north-west portions of the Mediterranean sea, we ought
 to find the counter current from the S.E. or L.S.E., the two por
 tions in juxtaposition moving with the greatest velocity. Some
 where in the Atlantic the turning-point of these oppositely directed
 currents should exist. The line of junction of these parallel cur
 rents will determine the trough of the wave, and as before shown, in
 consequence of the air being drawn off from the north-east to supply
 the ascending current, the wave will progress towards that quarter;
 the barometer first descending with the S.E. wind as the trough
approaches stations to the N.E., and rising with the N.W. as the
 current produced by the rarefaction approaches, until the crest
 passes, when the new counter current or slope of the next wave
would set in *.
   * In the above suggestion I have considered the northern portion of the African

  492            Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.
     Pursuing this idea further, there can be no question that Ireland
  and Scotland become points, or unitedly constitute a great point of
  rarefaction, forming as they do the nearest land to the northern part
  of the Atlantic, the land becoming hotter than the neighbouring
  water, and in consequence a N.W. current with its compensating
  current from the S.E. is induced. Not only will the rapidity of the
  currents reduce the pressure, but the ascending column from the
  land will transfer some of the air into the general current of the
  atmosphere, and there will be a real difference in the distribution of
  air as well as pressure; a section transverse to the line of greatest
  velocity will exhibit a hollow or trough, and the same phaenomena
  will result from this arrangement of the aërial currents as we no
 ticed arising from the N.E. and S.W. currents, the only difference
  being in direction.
     In thus considering these rectangularly posited systems of parallel
  and opposite currents, many complex anemonal and barometric
 phaenomena receive an easy explanation, particularly the revolution
  of the vane in one uniform direction, and the barometric wind
 rose. When the conterminous edges of any two currents pass a
 station, the barometer is either at a maximum or minimum with
 respect to that particular system of currents; the wind also changes
 at this time. If the barometer has previously been rising with a
 north-easterly wind, it now begins to fall with a south-westerly : the
 cross currents are however passing at this time with a lateral motion
 towards the N.E.; in this set of cross currents the barometer will
 rise with a north-westerly wind and fall with a south-easterly. Sup
 pose while the posterior slope of a N.W. wave transits, wind S.W.,
 and before its trough passes, the trough of the cross wave from the
 S.W. also transits, and is immediately succeeded by the following
 anterior slope with its N.W. current, the wind will pass from S.W.
 to W. Now while this slope continues, upon the trough of the N.W.
 system passing, the wind changes to N.E., and the resultant of the
 two currents is N. . It is easy to pursue this reasoning, and thus
 trace the changes of the wind arising from these two cross systems
 completely round the compass.
    The two systems of cross currents naturally divide themselves
 into four beds of opposite currents, namely, N.E. S.W., N.W. S.E.;
 with the first of each system, N.E. N.W., the barometer rises, and
 with the last of each, S.W. S.E., it falls, so that in the barometric
 wind-rose the maximum is found about the N.E., the prevailing
 system, and the minimum near the S.W., the opposite current of
this system.
    The extent of arc which the wind-vane frequently describes, espe
cially in stormy weather, also receives an explanation from these
systems of cross currents. A contemporaneous S.W. with a N.W.
wind will occasion large arcs to be described between these points;
continent as inducing the N.W. current, but of course, the entire surface, as far as
the extreme north of Europe, including Great Britain and Ireland, will act as a
rarefying surface.

the south-westerly gusts prevailing, directing the vane to that quar
ter; and the north-westerly immediately following, instantly occa
sions a change carrying the vane towards the N.W. These sudden
and extensive changes are rendered more distinctly perceptible by
means of a small kite flown with about 250 or 300 feet of string, or
even more; the distinctness and independence of the direction of
the two currents are readily seen, as well as the difference in their
strength.                                                                -
                 Discussion of Mr. Brown's Observations.
   In the discussion to which I have alluded, I have first arranged
such of the observations collected by Mr. Brown, or deductions from
them, as indicate the barometric pressure about the middle of each
day at the stations before-named, as near as the data furnished by
that gentleman will allow. These observations or deductions will be
found in Table I. The arrangement is such that the eye may readily
ascertain the barometric state of the atmosphere at any station on
any day embraced by the area and period included in the table.
The changes at any one station are also readily seen, the altitudes
above 30 inches being distinguished from those between 29 and 30,
and those below 29 also being distinguished from the rest. This
table forms the basis of the conclusions which have been thus arrived
at. The values corresponding to each day have been arranged with
especial reference to the maximum and minimum of that day in
space, that is, the station exhibiting the greatest pressure on any
particular day has generally been placed first on the list for that
day; and that exhibiting the least, last. At the head of each list
are placed the directions of the crests as indicated by the observa
tions. Crests passing from N.W. to S.E. are distinguished by the
odd numbers, and those passing from S.W. to N.E. by the even.
 When the observations give two slopes from a crest or trough pass
 ing between such slopes, the observations have been arranged to
exhibit this. After the arrangement of the observations, the lines
of the greatest diminution of pressure corresponding in a majority
 of cases to tranverse sections of the waves, and exhibiting either
their anterior or posterior slopes, are inserted. These are succeeded
 by the direction of the wind on each side of the crests as given in
 Mr. Brown's plates, and the discussion of each day's observation is
 concluded by a few explanatory notes”.

               Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.                      495
       Results of the Discussion of Mr. Brown's Observations.
   In collecting the results of this discussion, I have arranged in Tables
II. and III. the principal lines of diminution of pressure; the suc
cession of waves as well as the distinct systems become very apparent
from these tables. The succeedingTables IV. and W.exhibit the prin
cipal features of the respective waves of each system. The most pro
minent result appears to be the confirmation of Prof. Dove's sug
gestion of parallel and oppositely directed currents. The diagrams
of the wind in connection with the barometric observations clearl
exhibit such currents, and we see by a glance at Tables IV. and
V. that the beds of these currents varied considerably in breadth. At
the opening of the observations they were very much broader than
at the close, and the N.W. system (waves No. 2, 4, 6) were alto
gether larger than the S.W. We have in fact two systems of waves
or currents crossing each other at right angles, the individuals in
both gradually decreasing in size. In the speculation which has been
ventured relative to the S.W. system, the mass of terrestrial surface
forming the N.W. boundary of the great eastern continent has been
assumed as the rarefying surface, producing the set of parallel and
oppositely directed S.E. and N.W. winds, the currents gradually
shifting towards the N.E. The gradual contraction of the beds of
each system as the observations proceed is a highly interesting fea
ture, which requires a more extensive discussion for its elucidation.

498            Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.
                             General Conclusion.
   From the collation of Mr. Brown's with the St. Petersburgh and
Geneva observations which have been added to Table I., it is readily
apparent that the results arrived at in the discussion to which refer
ence has been made have been fully confirmed, and there appears
to be but little doubt that the waves as determined in the first in
stance by a discussion of observations from the stations announced
in my first report*, and further identified and illustrated by the ob
servations collected by Mr. Brown, as well as those which have been
brought to light by means of Mr. Brown's observations, and con
firmed and illustrated by the St. Petersburgh observations, had a
real existence; an individuality has been attributed to certain arrange
ments of acrial currents and distribution of pressure in connexion
with such currents, the aggregate phaenomena forming an atmo
spheric wave. Of the waves thus brought to light, two occupy very
prominent positions, they stand out as it were from the others; the
individuality of each is very striking, and the velocities with which
they traversed the area isolate them from their predecessors and ex
hibit them not as gregarious, but solitary waves. These waves are
B° and crest No. 4, the first occurring just previous to the setting
in of the great wave, and the last forming its crown. The wave,
 crest No. 4, appears from its elevated position on the symmetrical
 or normal wave, admirably adapted to crown our investigations with
 success, especially in so far as its amplitude, velocity and path are
 concerned, we are now, I apprehend, in possession of materials to
 determine with a considerable approximation to accuracy, these ele
ments. Its longitudinal direction appears to have been very exten
sive. This element would receive considerable elucidation by means
 of observations from the south of France, Spain, Portugal and the
 north of Africa. It is highly probable that this wave in the direction
 of its length stretched from the extreme south to the very north of
 Europe.
    The waves just alluded to will furnish material for a further paper,
 in which their essential features, elements, &c. will be fully discussed.
 In the mean time the attention of the reader is directed to several
 interesting features of waves Nos. 1 and 2.
    Wave crest No. 1.--An inspection of Table V. shows that this
 crest extended from Belfast to Paris on the 1st; on the 4th it passed
 Christiania, and on the 5th it was vertically over St. Petersburgh.
 On the same day, the 5th, Mr. Brown's observations indicate that
 the crest No. 2 extended from Cork, past Belfast, towards the Ork
 neys; so that the point of intersection of the two crests, Nos. 1 and 2,
 must have been situated toward the north-west of Norway. This
 at once explains the greater amount of pressure in the north-west of
 Europe in the early part of November.
    During the first eight days of November, the movements at St.
 Petersburgh and Geneva were strictly in accordance with the transit

  the distance between the stations: they were of a precisely opposite

    The line joining Belfast and Paris, the direction of crest, No. 1 on
 the 1st, when produced, will pass near Geneva, the anterior slope
 extending to or beyond St. Petersburgh. The numbers in the above
 table clearly show, that when the barometer was falling at Geneva
 from the posterior slope, it was rising at St. Petersburgh from the
 anterior. On the 5th the crest passed the latter station, when the
 posterior trough passed Geneva. This gives for the semi-amplitude,
 or half breadth of the wave, 1365 miles; the velocity of the crest,
 from its passing Geneva to its arrival at St. Petersburgh, being 14-22
 miles per hour. The altitude, as measured by the mercurial column,
 equal to 46 inch. The fall at St. Petersburgh, from the posterior
slope of this wave, and the rise at Geneva, from the anterior slope
of wave crest No. 3, is also clearly seen in the above table.
    Wave crest No. 2.-Table IV. shows that on the 5th this crest
extended from Cork to the Orkneys. The anterior trough of this
wave was also in the neighbourhood of Geneva on this day. This
gives for the semi-amplitude 792 miles. The altitude of the wave
appears to have been '76 inch, and the velocity of the crest about
8'25 miles per hour.
    This wave, with its front towards the south-east, was very di
stinctly developed during the early part of November. The altitude
of the crest appears to have subsided as the wave progressed; the
highest reading at Belfast was 30:55 on the 5th, at London 30-16
on the 6th, and at Paris 29-90 on the 8th.           The following tables
exhibit the features of the anterior slope. Table VII. shows the
barometric rise and fall at stations arranged more or less with re
gard to a line cutting the crest of the wave transversely. The de
pressing influence of the wave, crest No. 1, is clearly seen at London
and Paris on the 5th,     Tables VIII., IX, and X. exhibit the depres
sion of the south-easterly stations below those to the north-west of
them while the anterior slope passed.

              Mr. W. R. Birt on Atmospheric Waves.                   501
   Upon comparing the numbers at the Orkneys with those at Paris,
as given in Table I., we at once recognise a considerable difference
in the oscillation at the two stations. At the Orkneys it amounted to
1:72, at Paris to 79, range at the Orkneys in excess '93. It appears
probable that this difference of oscillation at two stations, as the Ork
neys and Paris, may be thus explained. ... The curves in the north
west of Ireland, as determined by the discussion of Sir John Her
schel's hourly-observations, are remarkable for boldness and freedom
of contour and great range of fluctuation. The late Professor Da
niell found, from an examination of the Manheim observations, that
the range increased towards the north-west, and that the greatest
oscillation occurred in the neighbourhood of water.         Now a wave
generated in any way and approaching the continent of Europe from
the north-west, would most probably impinge on it with a high and
in some cases acuminated crest     –/ \–                 but as it passed
onward the crest would gradually subside –TS                             :
so that at stations considerably to the south-east the fluctuations
would be very much less than at or near its point of genesis. Again,
a negative wave, with a deep trough also approaching from the north
West  ~~,                  would present large fluctuations as it im
pinged on the land; but after passing onwards, the opposite to sub
sidence would take place; the depth of trough would decrease,
 TS             -T, and the oscillations to the south-east would
also decrease. Such phaenomena appear to be presented by the ob
servations from the 5th to the 10th of November 1842.
    In connexion with this subsidence of crest No. 2, as it passed from
 N.W. to S.E., it may be interesting to notice the passage of crest
 No. 3, the circumstances of the transits of the two waves being dif
 ferent; wave No. 2 coming from the sea, and passing over Ireland,
 Scotland and England, and the land forming the central part of
 Europe; while wave No. 3 skirted the western and north-western
 boundaries of Europe, and more or less passed over the waters of
 the Atlantic and North Sea.      The crest No. 3 came from the S.W.,
 so that a line from Plymouth to Christiania would cut it more or less
 transversely; the ranges however are nearly the same at both stations.
  The crest which traversed England on the 1st arrived at Christiania
 on the 4th; at this time the barometer had commenced rising at
  Plymouth from the anterior slope of crest No. 2, and it continued
 rising until the 7th, when the crest passed. At Christiania the ba
 rometer had fallen from the posterior slope of crest No. 2. It ap
 pears from a careful comparison and consideration of the barometric
  movements at Plymouth and Christiania, that crest No. 2 passed
  Christiania about a day earlier than it did Plymouth, that is, the lon
  gitudinal direction of the crest was such as to cause it to pass over
  Christiania while Plymouth was still under the anterior slope of the
  wave, the sections passing over Christiania and Plymouth being
  separate and distinct. The character of the passing wave is well

502      Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
determined at both stations, the posterior slope exhibiting a rapid
and deep fall, which took place alike at Christiania and Plymouth.
   The crest No. 2 passed Cork, Belfast and the Orkneys on the
5th, Plymouth on the 7th, and Paris on the 8th, with a diminution
of oscillation.   We find however no diminution of oscillation at
Christiania as compared with Plymouth.        It is highly probable the
subsidence of the crest, as it proceeded towards Paris, resulted from
the influence of the land in England, while both at Plymouth and
Christiania the crest was but slightly interfered with by the influ
ence of land, the difference of level resulting from the anterior slope
of crest No. 3.             -                                  -
   These considerations exhibit a large wave of considerable breadth
and slow motion, extending in a longitudinal direction from the ex
treme south-west of England, past Norfolk, towards the Swedish
capital.
   !. elements of the waves, as referred to in Tables II., III., IV.
and V., have been determined by observations made daily; and a
perusal of the discussion of these observations will clearly show that,
in order to detect and examine the characters of the larger undula
tions, daily observations may suffice. For this purpose it will be
best to choose the middle of the day. The Astronomer Royal has
determined, from four years' observations at Greenwich, that at 2
hours, Göttingen mean time (20 minutes past 1 P.M. Greenwich
time), the barometer varies but 0"001 from the mean of the year,
that is, if the mean pressure is to be determined from an isolated
observation each day, this hour is the most suitable, the mean cor
rection being O"001 to be added.       This at once indicates, that for
the present purpose this hour is also the most suitable, the observa
tions being, to a great extent, free from the effects of the diurnal
oscillation. If two observations are made, the most suitable epochs
are 7:20 A.M. and 1:20 P.M.; and if three, 7:20 P.M. in addition. In
order however to detect and examine smaller undulations, observa
tions at shorter intervals equally disposed throughout the twenty
four hours are essential.

a slight modification of the needle, the mutual magnetic rela
tions of non-ferruginous bodies might possibly be ascertained.
Through the obliging readiness of M. Pixii of this city, I had

                Magnetism, Cohesion, Adhesion and Viscosity.       503
       two needles constructed, half of which were magnets and the
       other half brass; the junction of the brass and steel being
       effected exactly mid-way where the caps were attached. As
       it was anticipated that the movement of such a needle would
       be slow, as the whole directive energy could only be obtained
       from the magnetic end, their caps were of stone. I had the
       pleasure to find that though their movement was necessarily
       sluggish in comparison with that of the common needle, yet
       that it was perfectly uniform and certain; and that the brass
       end attached itself to various substances with even more
      tenacity than had been the case with the purely magnetic
   º
-- sº
       needle, or with its own magnetic portion. I next had two.
      needles inade, one with a gold and the other with a silver ter
       mination; but owing to a misapprehension of the workman
       their caps were of brass, and from this circumstance the in
       creased friction prevented their free movement, particularly in
       the case of the silver needle.    However, sufficient was dis
-      covered by their employment to see that the gold and silver
      could likewise be made to attach themselves to non-ferruginous
       bodies.                                         -
          It was only now necessary to make such a modification of
      the new principle of measurement as should enable it to be
      applied to any metal, and for this purpose I had short tubes
      soldered to the ends of half magnetic needles where they were
      joined to their agate caps. Into these small tubes, needles of
      any malleable metal could be inserted at pleasure; their weight
      and length being just sufficient to balance the steel portion of
      the needles. The steel ends were necessarily made thicker
      than the magnetic needle I have already described, to balance
      the increased weight of the tubes and metal needles; and the .
      whole weighed, when complete, in one case sixteen grains, and
      in the other, which was a little larger, nearly eighteen grains.
      The length of the steel half was twenty-three millimetres, and
      the whole needle therefore forty-six millimëtres long. . It is
      necessary to bear in mind that the metal needles should not
      exceed the magnetic ends in length, otherwise, according to
      the principle of the lever, they would be moved with greater
      facility than the steel portion, and give proportionably higher
      results.
         The form of these needles is here given with and without
      their metal ends.
         By a further modification, the arrangement was fitted to be
                                                         -

504 Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
employed with any small fragment or substance that it was
desirable to use as a needle.         This consisted simply in
making a slender needle of wood of the same form as those
of metal, by means of which any fragment, though, not ex
ceeding the size of the head of a pin, could be attached with
wax, and then employed, the same as if it were a needle of
malleable metal, after being inserted in the little tube of the
magnetic needle. The deficient weight of the wooden needle
can be made up by twining round it a fine strip of sheet
lead; and in like manner the metal needles may be made
to balance with equal nicety, when too light, by rolling round
them a small strip of tin foil; a necessity that must often
occur, owing to the different densities of the metals employed.
 All these details are requisite, as the experimenter must in so
 many cases become his own workman, to meet each particular
exigency.
    These needles were urged to the substances by a bar-mag
 net, in the same way as in the preceding experiments, and         -
 were employed either in measuring the purely magnetic in
 tensities or those of non-ferruginous bodies, by using one or
 the other end as occasion required. The unmagnetic ends
 were likewise made to connect themselves with substances,
 for which they had a strong affinity, by means of the finger
 instead of a bar-magnet as in the former cases, but to a much
 greater extent, for it was the only means I had at my com
 mand of ascertaining that the junction was made with more
 than usual readiness, and this result is here marked by the
 letter<U+017F>, instead of the signs x x as before. All the other
 signs formerly used are again employed in similar cases, and
 it will be seen, perhaps with some surprise, that the mutual
 affinities of non-ferruginous bodies greatly exceed those of
 the magnetic needle, there being few cases in which the mea
 sures did not reach 90°.                   -
    In the preceding branch of this subject, whatever has been
 said on the importance of giving time for the influence of the
 needle to take effect, is no longer necessary; and all that is
 required is to afford the time requisite for oscillation entirely
 to cease; for here the effects are purely normal, as non-fer
 ruginous bodies only are mutually concerned. This result
 might have been easily anticipated, for it is now merely
 natural and spontaneous affinities that are brought into play.
 Magnetism, in the common acceptation of the term, will be
 seen to be an abnormal and exceptional state, and all the re
 sults that proceed from it must partake of the same character.
 The more powerful therefore the magnet or the loadstone,
 the more abnormal and exceptional must be its results.

   The phaenomena brought to light by Dr. Faraday's mode
of experimenting are indeed very remarkable, and they ap
pear to me to have a surprising analogy with what he and
Thilourier effected, when operating on the gases. By the
resources of science, those bodies which in their normal state
only exhibit repulsion, were made to reveal their occult
power of attraction; and in a similar manner in these new
experiments, bodies that had been only remarked for indif.
ference to magnetism, were brought within its pale. Yet the
instances which I have already shown, and those which are to
follow, will make it more than doubtful whether the two cate
gories of attraction and repulsion under which bodies arranged
themselves in his hands, are really those that would result
from their normal conditions, if these could be known with
exactness. Thus by his experiments he considers platinum
as magnetic, and flint glass as diamagnetic, and they ought
not therefore to agree in their affinities; yet I find that they
both have a remarkable attraction for lead; crown glass too,
so far from having a feeble attraction for the magnet, as we
are led to suppose from his experiments, has really a very
considerable affinity for it, as will be evident by the instance I
gave of the needle in the compass-box, which attached itself
per saltum to its glass screen on a magnet being held over it.
Palladium and platinum also, which Dr. Faraday considers
as magnetic, agree with all his diamagnetic metals with which
I have operated in their attraction for glass of every kind, and
I find that both palladium and platinum exhibit a much
feebler degree of attraction for the magnetic needle than they
do for iron that is free from magnetism. Yet in his scale
crown glass ranges between palladium and platinum.
   The obscure nature of affinity cannot be better exemplified
than in considering these experiments, where we have a fresh
demonstration of its universality. As no instance has yet
been discovered of a body existing free from repulsion, for no
bodies have yet been found with their molecules in close con
tact, so in the present case we shall see that where attraction
could not be more than imagined, that that property exists in
considerable strength, and that it is owing to it, by the mere
affinity of points for points, that is of molecules for molecules,
that bodies hold together with such tenacity, though each
point is totally inert beyond its own sphere of action; indeed
so much so that the finest hair or a fragment of any substance
not so large as the head of a pin, has as much influence,
magnetically, on the various needles that have been tried, as
the largest mass. It is different however where the electro
magnet is concerned, for through its powerful influence the

506      Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
magnetic energies of bodies brought within its range are
heightened to a surprising degree. Magnetism proves the
co-existing and alternating nature of attraction and repulsion,
and that where we find one we may be quite certain that the
other is only in abeyance, existing potentially, and ready to
spring into action the moment the conditions of bodies are
such as to admit of this law of nature coming into activity. I
say bodies, because, as it is a law of relation, there must be
the mutual presence of two things to enable it to exist. Now
the insensible relations which the present experiments reveal,
seem identical with those which Dr. Faraday was able to
make sensible, even to an audience in a theatre, by the means
of a powerful electro-magnet, just in the same way as when a
bit of paper excited positively or negatively, and scarcely
affording the slightest indication of its excitement, will be
roused into strong repulsion by the approach of any electric
body in a similar state with itself, but more highly excited;
and indeed the degree of its repulsion will be proportioned to
the energy of the electric state of the body with which it is
in relation; it being one of the mysterious peculiarities of
affinity that the body that exhibits it in the strongest degree
raises the feebler related body up to a state of equality.
   The neutral state which Dr. Faraday supposes to exist
through the struggle of what he terms magnetic and diamag
netic forces, in various saline solutions, is according to the
preceding views due entirely to the relative strength of the
latent attraction or repulsion roused into a state of exaggera
tion, and if I may so say abnormalism, by the surpassing energy
of the electro-magnet; but were we to suppose the phaenomena
thus exhibited to be the normal state of nature, we should
interpret wrong, and mistake the exception for the rule.
   But as facts are better than all reasoning, I proceed to
exhibit the mutual attractions and presumed repulsions which
I elicited in about 600 additional experiments, together with
the measures so obtained.
   The measurements of the experiments which follow were
first thrown into a tabular form, the substances being arranged
perpendicularly on the left side of the paper, and the needles in
succession at the top, both of them being between ruled lines in
opposite directions. This arrangement had the great advan
tage of affording an easy contrast at a glance, but notwith
standing the number of experiments that have been made it
left too many lacunae, owing to the great number of needles
and substances which I had not time to try; for the sake of
saving space it was abandoned therefore for the present plan.
   The needles employed are indicated by the letters which

          Magnetism, Cohesion, Adhesion and Viscosity.       507
follow. The glass needle was of flint glass. It is possible
that one of crown glass might have given even higher results;
but if so its effects could not have been appreciable in the
cases above 90°. By a reference to the counter experiments
where crown and flint glass were the substances, and the
metals the needles, there will be seen to be a great equality in
the results.                                                 -

   In this and the following classes, the results already ob
tained with the magnetic needle are again repeated for the
sake of affording an easy means of comparison. The iron
needle was of soft iron wire, and on bringing it near a delicate
magnetic needle it caused no repulsion, but attracted the N.
and S. poles; I therefore believe that if it had any magnetism
it did not influence the results, and if so it would have had a
tendency rather to diminish than to raise the measurements,
for often, as in the case of palladium, platinum, bismuth and
arsenic, iron has an advantage over the magnetic needle,
though, as may be observed with regard to antimony and
chromium, it often falls considerably behind it. Iron in its
normal state, that is free from adventitious magnetism, dis
covers less affinity for other bodies, and even for itself, than
gold, cadmium, tin, copper, and some other metals. When
it was made to attach itself to a bit of its own wire, the con
nexion was broken with as much facility as was exhibited by
most of the metals. This result will be scarcely anticipated,
and is a further proof that it was devoid of free magnetism.
The polarity that iron exhibits is due entirely to extraneous
causes, and as my opinions have been long made up upon the
subject, I hope before long to make them     É.     and to show
that it depends upon causes of the simplest kind, if that ex
pression may be applied to phaenomena in which so mysterious
an agency as affinity is concerned. Manganese exhibited only
an attraction of 10° for tin, and none for platinum. Chromium
had likewise no attraction for tin, and indicated only 19° for
gold, while for platinum it had an attraction of 90°, yet both
chromium and platinum are magnetic metals according to
Dr. Faraday's experiments, and gold diamagnetic. But all

         Magnetism, Cohesion, Adhesion and Viscosity.          509
these unexpected results will be seen at a glance by referring
to the list.
   Antimony and bismuth stand high with such non-ferruginous
metals as have been tried; platinum, for which the attraction
of both is low, being excepted. With cadmium the attraction
for antimony was raised to 90° by keeping the latter in con
tact with a bar-magnet for a short time; yet tin, between which
and cadmium there is such a similarity, attained 90° without
being kept in contact with the bar-magnet; but I see by a
reference to the note taken at the time, that it was accom
plished with some difficulty. It is remarkable that antimony
was twice raised with the brass needle to 90° with great ease,
though before it could not be got higher than 30°. In the
same way antimony was last year made to connect itself at 90°
with the copper needle, while now the cut end could only be
got up to 40°, and the side to 55°, but this sort of capricious
 ness has occurred from time to time without any assignable
CauSe.

    What has already been said with regard to sulphur and
 selenium in the first part of this paper, leaves but little to be

 affinity for glass, but their contrast with lead is striking. The
  energy of both was heightened by being kept in contact with
 a magnet, and then tested with a brass needle. The preference
  that selenium shows for iron over the magnetic needle, is
  worthy of attention, as well as the contrast it stands in with
  sulphur, in its low attraction for lead.                -

     In this class it will be seen that iron in many cases main
 tains a great superiority over the magnet. The glasses seemed

   512 Sir G. C. Haughton on the Common Nature of
   to deserve particular attention, and have been carefully tested.
   Their strong attraction for non-ferruginous bodies must prove
   interesting, and Iceland spar vies, with them in that property,
   for the needles had only generally to be pushed against it to
   form the connexion. The porcelains exceed even the glasses
   in their affinities for non-ferruginous bodies. The attraction
  of glass for sugar candy, rock salt and alum, is worthy of at
  tention. The metals were not tried, for want of time, with
  the exception of gold and tin.
     The case of carbonate of iron is very remarkable, for it
 might d priori be supposed that from the large proportion of
 iron it contains, it would show considerable attraction for the
 magnetic needle; but this is so far from being the case, that
  it will be seen to be one of the lowest in the scale, and after
 being kept eighteen hours in contact with the N. pole of a horse
 shoe magnet capable of raising thirty pounds, its affinity for the
  magnetic needle was not increased. It might also have been
 expected, from its great density, and the analogy of similar
 cases, that in consequence of its feeble attraction for the mag
 net, it would exhibit a strong affinity for glass. It however
 is otherwise; and by a reference to all the metals with which
 it was tested, in consequence of these peculiarities, it will be
 seen to be one of the most remarkable and interesting sub
 stances that have been tried, exhibiting a very low state of
 attraction for almost all bodies, gold, silver, cadmium, tin and
 zinc being excepted, and for these metals it exhibits a re
 markable affinity. The results of many of the experiments
 on various bodies will show a kind of elective affinity, as is
observed in chemical combinations; and no substance exem
plifies this remark so completely as carbonate of iron. Thus
though it has the strongest affinity for zinc, it does not show
an attraction for brass above what it exhibits for copper,
which is as low as 149. Yet most bodies have a surprising
affinity for brass. Carbonate of iron affords a fresh instance
that the iron in a body may be quite inert, in consequence of
its combination with another substance neutralizing its affini
ties.
    The low affinity of the magnetic needle for marbles is quite
in accordance with the experiments of Dr. Seebeck, and the
numbers he obtained for bismuth, platinum and antimony,
bear a singular resemblance to those afforded by the present
experiments. There may be the same accordance between
the others, but there is no means of marking by the present
mode, the nice shades of difference after 90°.      Silver, which
he places next to iron in power, seems to take the place of
brass, which I find to be generally singularly magnetic.

 Amongst the alloys that become neutral by combination, he
 mentions copper and nickel; now this alloy, which is popu
larly called German silver, I believe, I found to be so mag
netic as to draw the needle after it; but then the proportions
of the two alloys most probably differed; his specimen con- .
tained two parts of copper and one of nickel, while mine, as
I have already remarked, seemed to have an unusual propor
 tion of copper, to judge from its colour.

   In this class of animal products the magnetism of the needle

remarkable. The specimen of ivory (a paper-cutter), which

paratively recent, as was evident from its fine eolour, gave 90°
with the magnetic needle; and the probable cause of this dif
ference will be shortly seen, when I speak of the results ob
tained with a needle made out of a part of this very piece of
ivory. Glue exhibits phaenomena of a very interesting cha
racter. Its affinity for the magnet was only 29%, after the
most painful efforts were repeatedly made to pushit further,
but on being left in contact with the bar-magnet for some
hours, it instantly attached itself at 38°.hits affinity for the
iron was 90°,+, and it exhibited the same amount of attraction
for pure gold, platinum, cadmium, tin, zinc and arsenic,
which were allothe metals it was tested with.                       But I have

is remarkable. The lignum vitae was raised from 33° to 49°
by contact for a short time with a magnet, and the same pro

   many occasions with-great care, and the results they afforded
   were always uniform; but differed from one another. The

  had previously <U+017F>ailed, after it had been kept in contact with a
  magnet; but I cannot positively say that the magnet was the
  cause, as on repeating the sameºexperiment on other occa

  nect itself till after the attempt to raise its magnetism, though
  many trials had previously been made. The attraction of
 iron for all three specimens is deserving of notice. This sin
  gular substance exhibited a strong affinity for all the needles
  with which it was tested. The affinity of lac for various metals

 from my own convictions, that glass is much stronger in its
adhesions than even pure gold, and perhaps equal to brass.
The advantage that iron has over the magnetic needle is con
spicuous, and is deserving of attention, though the ratio of
 the magnet might very fairly be raised to 2:00, for it is in part
 owing to the experiments with the larger range of substances,
 that it stands so low.                                         .   . .. ..     . . 9
   "The preceding experiments include a vast variety of sub
 stances in the     ... vegetable, and animal kingdoms, that
 exhibit such strong attractive affinities for one another, that
 however much they may differ in theirexternal appearances, and
in their very natures, they are bound together by common
 bonds that connect them all into a single family; for we find the
 metal attaching itself to crystalline, animal and vegetable sub
'stances; and again, the crystal, whether we call it by the name
 of diamond, salt, or sugar-candy, connecting itself readily to
 metallic, animal and vegetable bodies. In a similar way ani
 mal bodies attach themselves to those that are mineral and
 vegetable; and to complete the circle, the vegetable king
 dom, by its woods, its gums, its lac and its resins, is connected
 with them all.               -                 -
° Out of about 600 measurements the proportion of those
that have exhibited repulsion, or what may be presumed re
 pulsion, for there is only negative proof on the subject, is
 about 1 in 25. Could a counter system of measurements be
 established it is possible this might be reversed, and that the
 same amount of repulsions would be obtained, and this per
haps is the fact in Dr. Faraday’s remarkable experiments,
  owing to the influence of the electro-magnet. Still the facility
 with which the majority of these connexions was established,
  can hardly lead to a doubt that they are purely of a normal
  character, where the magnetic needle is not concerned, be
  cause they can only result from the spontaneous effects of

nature;     but in the case where the magnetic needle has been
the coercing agent, and the measures indicate low intensities,
and where the connexions was made with much difficulty, I
 should draw a contrary inference. This oview is strongly
supported by what took place with the cornelians.
      The two extremes of- the preceding scale give two alloyed
 metals as the    highest and the   lowest,  mº and the
 magnet.      In seeking for two unmired bodies that should pro
    erly represent the natural scale in the mineral kingdom, that
is, one in which the       jº. is not arbitrari i.
sumed as the standard of reference, but one that considers the
natural classes of substances, I woul º, taking º
and diamond, and exclude brass and t          e magne.” The firs
would take the lead of all metals, namely metalloids, while
diamend would be placed at the head of a substances of the
vitreous class, or hâloids, that is to say, all the precious stones
and all crystals; platinum as the heaviest, and diamond as
the hardest of all known bodies. The class of metalloids will
 be as naturally closed by potassium, as it will be seen the
 haloids are by gum, two of the lightest of the º
 vitreous classes of bodies. The reason for adopting this clas
sification is, that I find that iron, from which the magnet is
 formed, has no remarkable affinity for other, bodies, nor for
itself, and that the magnet, constituting an exception to the
 rule of nature, is itself dependent for its exalted effects upon
 electricity and other extraneous causes, and could only keep
 its high position while attractive affinity, by our ignorance of
 natural laws, was supposed to be exclusively its peculiar pro
 perty. Such a division is by no means meant to undervalue
 the importance of the magnet; for though it has led to t
 discovery of the affinities of all the rest, there can be no doubt
 it exists by an exceptional law; and we might as well place
 iron at the head of all metals, because we are indebted to it
 for the implements which have enabled us to penetrate to those
 very metals. The term magnetism therefore will always main
 tain its ground as the general expression of the magnetic at
 tractions which connect all bodies together, even though they
 have nothing to do with iron; in the same way that the term
  electricity has been extended to all those phaenomena in which
 attraction or repulsion result from friction, and yet having not
 the slightest resemblance to the electron or amber that led to
  their discovery. . . .    .   . . . ..                nº

º #. was a curious problem to be solved. What was the
cause of this extraordinary affinity of a substance like ivory
for so many heterogeneous bodies, of which porcelain offered
the most remarkable instance, as the specimen employed,
 . stood on a surface of glass, drew the ivory as much as
one-fourth of an inch after it on one occasion, and always
some small distance when it was merely pushed away? The
diamond exhibited the same phaenomenon, but in a minor
 degree, and careful testing proved that electricity in no way
 contributed to the results.        "…                   -        * ,
. On referring to the tabulated measurements of which H
 have spoken, and in which the measures of substances stand
 .          contrast, I observed that the needles had attached
 themselves with remarkable facility to animal bodies, such as
 ivory, pearl, mother of pearl, horn, hair, glue, &c. It was
 ..        therefore, that it was the affinity of something common
 to all these substances, that caused such easy contact between
 them and the needles. This step gained it was not difficult
 to discover that the gelatine which was common to all these
 animal products, was the substance that chiefly produced with
 equal facility a contact with gold, diamond, Iceland spar,
  º alabaster, horn, vegetable ivory, gum, and such dis
 similar substances, in the mineral, vegetable and animal king
 doms. The low attraction afforded by the piece of old ivory
 of which I have spoken, I suppose to have resulted from partial
 change in its structure through age; and the same cause may
 be assigned for the difference exhibited by the pearl and the
  mother-of-pearl in their measures, for from the colour and
 the style of setting of the pearl, less than fifty years could not
 be assigned for its workmanship. . . .
 ... I have already alluded to the facility with which all vitreous
 bodies form connexions, and to include the present class of
 substances in their proper category, we must get rid a little
 of our familiar notions, and remember that if gelatine, albumen,
 gluten, resin, lac and gums are devoted to particular uses
  that make us only think of them as means of adhesion, they
  are in fact, when considered under a more extended point of
  view, animal and vegetable glasses; and what fully establishes
  this character is the extraordinary fact which I have already
  mentioned, that glue was raised to 38° by contact with a bar
  magnet; but in truth since that portion of this communication
  was despatched for the press, the piece of glue was raised to
                                                                      -

78° by being kept in contaet for four-and-twenty hours with
the great horse-shoe magnet already spoken of, and the mag
netic needle attached itself with singular readiness, contrar
to what had been previously found to be the case. The who<U+017F>e
effect however gradually disappeared, the attractive power
declining, as was ascertained by successive measurements,
till it fell back to its º about twenty
minutes. It was by mere accident, as m y be supposed, that
it was kept so long in contact, and most likely so long a time
is not necessary to produce the effect”. This result is well
worthy of being contrasted with what has been said about
carbonate of iron, and it will be admitted, I am sure, that two
cases, less reconcilable with analogy could scarcely be pro
duced. We thus see that gelatine, and in all probability similar
substances, conform to the laws that have been seen to prevail
 in vitreous bodies, and it is only necessary to observe their
fractured edges when hard, and particularly those of glue,
dried albumen and resin, to be convinced of this fact.               Even
 India rubber when in a low temperature approaches to the
same state, and it has been already noted that several needles
attached themselves firmly to it. To be convinced that this
 view, which connects these substances with the glasses, is not
 fanciful, it is only necessary to call to mind the case of gelati
 nous hydrate of silicium, which is obtained from a mineral
 glass that dissolves in water; and it is not amongst the least
 remarkable of the analogies that exist throughout nature, to
connect the liquor of flints with broth, white of egg, gum
 water and paste, and the last of these therefore, by a series of
 links, with the mysterious powers of the magnet, that caused
 St. Augustin to faint, and made Thales to believe that it was
 animated by a soul |                                                     -
    To be quite convinced of the strong affinities that ivory,
 mother-of-pearl, horn, albumen, tortoise-shell and quill ex
 hibit in common, I formed needles of these substances, and
 tested them to an extent that left no doubt that they possess
 the same qualities as ivory; but on the whole the quill and
 mother-of-pearl approached nearest to a state of           jºl;      with
 that substance, though there was a very slight difference
 between them all. These fresh proofs leave therefore no
    * It has since however been ascertained that length of time was essen
 tially the cause of raising the magnetism of the glue, for on keeping
 subsequently in contact for thirteen hours, its magnetism could only be
 raised to 49°. Another very important point was likewise fully established,
 namely, that either pole of a magnet might be used without the glue
 showing any signs of polarity, for when 78° were obtained it had been kept
 in contact with the N. end of the magnet, and when 49° was the amount of
 measurement the S. end was employed, while in each case it was the S. end
 of the needle that formed the connexion.

doubt that it is owing mainly to the gelatine they contain, that
these needles show such a remarkable degree of attraction for
nearly all bodies.                 ..    ... . . ..
    nº." to say that all cohesion is purely magnetical
in the extended sense I have given to the term, for such an
opinion is scarcely reconcilable with what is observed in che
mical combinations, where we see, elements, changing places
according to what is called elective affinity. In the various
theories that have been put forth to account for chemical com
binations and the cohesion of bodies, the attractions and re
pulsions of different electrical states have been proposed by
the celebrated Berzelius; but though this might, as a theory,
obtain currency amongst scientific men, and enable them to
reason with facility, as long as acids and their bases are con
sidered, yet it is clearly in fault the moment it is applied to
explain the cohesion of simple bodies, such as the pure metals.
 Many instances may be observed in the preceding experi
ments, that favour the notion of the existence of electives
affinity between the various bodies that have been experi
mented upon, but to which immediate electric agency can with
difficulty be conceded; and we must therefore have recourseº
in such cases to what are called the laws of nature for their
explanation. With regard however to the combinations of
acids and alkalies, I believe the varying preferences they ex
hibit when brought near one another to result from electricity,
though magnetism is not without its share in effecting their
union; and I hope shortly to be able to present some con
siderations that will render this opinion highly probable, by
making known a discovery I have made of the antagonism of
heat and electricity, as well as the proofs of a single electric
fluid. … "
        I cannot take leave of this subject without expressing my
unfeigned admiration for the skill exhibited by Dr. Faraday,
in his experiments on the same subject, as well as on so many
other occasions; and if we differ in our views of magnetical
phaenomena, it will be easily accounted for, by the opposite
results we have obtained, owing to our methods of experi

tº M. Boudet observes that M. Depaire, pharmacien of Brussels, has
 stated that when iodide of lead is prepared by the reaction of ace
 tate of lead and iodide of potassium, the supernatant liquor contains
 a considerable quantity of iodine. He found that this liquor, in which
 acetate of lead produced no turbidness, gave a yellow precipitate of
 iodide of lead on the addition of a little nitric acid, a precipitate of
 trisiodide of lead with trisacetate, and free iodine with sulphuric and
 hydrochloric acids; and submitted to evaporation, leaves a white
 residue, which on the addition of water, regenerates iodide of lead.
    From these facts M. Depaire concluded, that in employing acetate
 of lead to extract iodine from iodine baths, loss of iodine was sus
 tained ; to avoid which, he proposes, as M. Cottereau, jun. had
 previously
 the           done, to employ the trisacetate of lead, which precipitates
     iodine perfectly.                       -                  ºn as tº                  fºr
ºM. Depaire afterwards examined in what state the iodine could be
 retained in the solution from which the iodide of lead was precipi
 tated; and after having ascertained that it was not in a state of
 simple solution, he appeared disposed to think that it exists in the
 state of potassio-iodide of lead, , , ,         *. .    .. . .
    M. Boudet states that experiments, which he performed four years
 ago, but which he º to publish, confirm the remarks of M.
 Depaire; and he is enabled to add some observations, which, he
 thinks, will not be uninteresting.” + “º "ºº" " " '
bo Having ascertained that in preparing iodide of lead with acetate
and excess of acid, ºtherweight of the product obtained was less
Ethan indicated by theory, to the amount of about 10 per cent.,
“M. Boudet added some mitric acid to the solutions which ceased to
 precipitate with acetate, and he obtained an additional yellow preci
 pitate of iodide of lead. This suggested the employment of nitrate
 instead of acetate of lead in preparing the iodide; and on trialit was
 found to yield such a product as theory would indicate, minus the

iodide dissolved. The use of nitrate of lead appears to have been
preferred by several chemists; and M. Baudrimont expressly recom
mends it, on the ground that the acetate yields some oxiodide.oºd
    This first point being established, it remained to explain the loss
of the 10 per cent. occurring, by the use of acetate, of lead; and
presuming that the acetate of potash, formed with the iodide of lead,
took some part in this phaenomenon, the action of this saltoniodide
of lead was examined, and the results were as follows:-                 r it
    When iodide of lead is triturated with acetate of potash, the mix
ture becomes rapidly moist, gradually loses its colour, and soon be
comes perfectly white. This pasty mixture does notact upon litmus
paper and pulverized acetate of lead. When exposed to the air it
partially liquefies, and partially crystallizes in silky needles of double
iodide of potassium and lead; on contact with water it becomes im
mediately yellow, reviving yellow iodide, and the liquor becomes
acid; and when filtered it yields a pale yellow precipitate with tris
 acetate of lead, and regenerates bright yellow iodide, when nitric
acid, or dilute sulphuric acid is added. By evaporation it leaves a
white deliquescent residue, which regenerates yellow iodide on con
tact with water. If, instead of water, alcohol be added to the pasty
 mixture of acetate of potash and iodide of lead, it partly dissolves;
 the residue, which is almost white, yields yellow iodide ion contact
 with a weak acid; and the supermatant liquor does the same on the
 addition of nitric acid.                                                     * , is
     When, on the other hand, iodide of lead is treated with a hot so

 ... Alkaline owalates.—When bromine is gradually dropped into a
  solution of oxalate of potash or soda, containing a slight excess of
 alkali, no action ensues if the temperature be low; but if it be raised
 to 104° or 122°F., action immediately commences, and becomes very
  vivid ; much gas is disengaged, which extinguishes, flame, yields
 a white precipitate with lime-water, and is totally absorbed by
  a solution of potash; thus possessing all the properties of pure car
 bonic acid. The liquor contains the bromide of potassium or sodium,
  which may be obtained in fine crystals, by spontaneous evaporation.
  The oxalates of barytes, lead, and silver, are similarly acted upon.

     Bromine is to be added till effervescence ceases and the lijuor
 becomes of a permanent reddish tint; if the excess of bromine be .

     This liquid is extremely complex, and contains three distinct sub
 stances: the most volatile is easily obtained in a pure state; it is
 bromoform. The least volatile product is solid and crystallizable;
 it is partly altered by heat, and is evidently a new substance. The
third compound, which arises during the reaction, is formed only in
 very small proportion, and it is impossible to deprive it entirely of
bromoform or the crystallized substance.           it                    * <U+2192>

 washed with water to deprive it entirely of bromide of potassium ;
the mixture of oil and water is then to be submitted to careful
distillation, stopping it as soon as but few small drops only of oil
pass over with the vapour of water. This first liquid is separated
from the water by decantation, dried over fused chloride of calcium,
and then distilled alone, as long as its boiling-point remains constant.

    On account of the decomposition of this substance by the alkalies
 the author proposes to call it bromotaform.   In this operation there is
 then first a case of oxidizement which resolves the molecule of citric
 acid into more simple products; then the bromine acting by itself
 on one of the products formed, gives rise to a phaenomenon of substi
 tution.
    On observing the preceding product so readily decomposed on the
 presence of bases and of water, may it not be admitted that this
compound is first formed, and that the bromoform is merely the re
sult of a secondary action ?
    The citrates of soda and barytes act in the same manner as the
 citrate of potash, bromoform and the crystalline matter being both
obtained with them.—Ann. de Ch. et de Ph., Avril 1847.
A chemil CAL INVESTIGATION OF SOME SILICATES CONTAINING
    CHLORINE, SULPHURIC AND CARBONIC ACID.                 BY M. WHIT
    NEY OF Boston, UNITED STATEs.
   Long ago Arfvedson observed, in examining sodalite, that it dis
solved entirely in nitric acid, although it formed a gelatine with
hydrochloric acid. Gustave Rose made a similar observation upon
cancrinite from the Ilmen mountains, which dissolves to a clear liquid
in concentrated hydrochloric acid, but suddenly gelatinizes on boil
ing. Mr. Whitney found that a whole series of silicates, which, as
regards composition, exhibit great similarity to the above minerals,
possess the property of dissolving to a clear liquid in all dilute acids.
All these minerals gelatinize with concentrated acids, with the ex
ception of cancrinite, which is likewise soluble in them. To this
series belongs, besides sodalite and the cancrimite from the Ilmen
mountains, elaeolite from Litchfield (Maine), noseau from the La
chersee, hauijne from the Albanese mountains and from Niederme
nig, and the cancrinite discovered by Dr. Jackson of Boston, along
with the above elaeolite at Litchfield.                  -
   The author has examined all these minerals with the greatest care,
and the following are the interesting results of his investigation :--
sodalite, noseau and hauijne, may be regarded as combinations of
a silicate of alumina and soda, of the composition NaO Si O3 +3
(Alº O'SiO3), with chloride of sodium, sulphate of soda, and sulphate
of lime.   This silicate has hitherto never been met with in the iso
lated state. It possesses the composition which was formerly
ascribed to elaeolite. The following are the formulae of the minerals
under consideration :-
